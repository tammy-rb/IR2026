    <p pid="e527.7/1">Mr Speaker, may I take this opportunity to thank all those who work in our schools and wish them a well-earned break over the summer holidays? High and rising school standards are a non-negotiable for this Labour Government as we seek to build a school system that enables every child to achieve and thrive. Our independent expert-led curriculum and assessment review has found that the current system for primary assessments is broadly working well. However, we will take on board any recommendations from the review panel when it reports in the autumn.</p>

    <p pid="e527.8/1">A recent survey by Young Minds found that over a third of year 6 pupils felt ill due to standard assessment tests, and over a quarter said they made them feel bad about themselves. Ninety-six per cent of headteachers say that SATs harm wellbeing, and 95% doubt their accuracy. Our children and teachers are telling us that SATs are broken. Will the Department consider a more holistic assessment approach that ensures the wellbeing of our children at such a young age?</p>

    <p pid="e527.9/1">It is our ambition that all children get the chance not just to achieve at school but to thrive. SATs are carefully developed to ensure that they are  accessible.

    <p pid="e528.6/1">With the summer holidays just around the corner, I want to say a huge thank you to everyone working across education for all their hard work this year. Improving the quality of teaching is the best way to drive up school standards, supporting every child to achieve and thrive. Through our plan for change, we will recruit an additional 6,500 expert teachers in our schools and colleges.

    <p pid="e528.7/1">I congratulate the Secretary of State on the Department for Education being more than a third of the way through recruiting those 6,500 teachers.

    <p pid="e528.8/1">I give my hon. Friend that assurance and thank him for all the work he does for schools right across his constituency. Recruiting and retaining more teachers—particularly in the most disadvantaged areas—is critical to our opportunity mission, but I am also delighted that initial teacher training acceptances are up 12% in secondary. That is positive progress being made, with a 16% increase in maths and a 46% increase in physics. That is the change that the Labour Government are delivering.</p>

    <p pid="e528.9/1">I thank the Secretary of State for her response and for the Government’s commitment to recruiting 6,500 new teachers. However, as we know,  dyslexic children tend to leave school or education with disproportionately lower attainment levels. They are also over-represented in the criminal justice system and often have low self-esteem, with much of that coming from their experience in educational settings. Will the Secretary of State outline how she will ensure that the recruitment of new teachers will bring in those who can meet the education needs of dyslexic and neurodiverse children?</p>

From September, thanks to this Labour Government’s reforms, all new teachers will receive three years of evidence-based training, including significantly enhanced content on supporting children with additional needs.

    <p pid="e530.2/1">I would be very happy to do so. As the right hon. Gentleman just heard, we are seeing big increases in initial teacher training acceptances in many of those key subjects such as maths and science. On the commitment we have made, we had 60,000 fewer children in primary over the course of the last year and, as a former holder of this office, he would rightly expect that we target our efforts in areas of greatest need. Sadly, we are seeing a big decline in the number of children in primary, with the numbers forecast to fall by another 165,000 over the next few years, so we are focusing our efforts where they are needed.</p>

    <p pid="e530.4/2">One thing that drives people out of teaching is poor discipline, yet the Government have abolished behaviour hubs, despite the evidence that they were working.

We are turning around the problems that the Conservatives left behind on teacher recruitment and retention.

I believe that a better system will be delivered. We can make sure that children get early, timely support that is much more effective and focused on their outcomes.

    <p pid="e539.0/1">Many of the young people I meet in schools across Epping Forest are clear that they agree with the local school policy of restricting mobile phones when they are at school. Sadly, however, the Government have repeatedly refused to heed Conservative calls to protect our children with a national ban on phones in schools—even voting against it. Bodies such as UNESCO and the OECD are crystal clear about the negative impacts of phones on young people’s education, so when will the Government listen to the evidence and to our school leaders, and support a ban on smartphones in schools for the sake of our young people’s education and mental health?</p>

    <p pid="e539.2/1">Last Thursday, I felt the fear in a hall full of parents of primary school children in Totnes as they listened to campaigners going through the evidence of the impact of smartphones on kids at secondary school. There is a clear safeguarding issue around kids seeing videos of hardcore pornography and violence.</p>
    <p pid="e539.2/2">I am therefore pleased that Tina Graham, the head of Kingsbridge community college, has just announced a smartphone-free policy from September to protect children, which will mean no phones in school at all except for reasonable adjustments. That is a much better policy than the “Not seen—put it in your bag” policy that most schools follow. In the light of such safeguarding concerns, where every child is only as safe as the least safe phone in school, why will the Minister not do the one thing that could transform our children’s mental and physical health, and school attainment and direct all schools to go smartphone free—</p>

    <p pid="e544.5/1">Given the “lose, lose, lose” system that the last Government left behind—in their own words—we are working hard to reform the system so that every child can achieve and thrive.

    <p pid="e544.6/1">Given that answer, I will quote the Secretary of State. She was saying earlier that the system is so distorted that the financial allocations do not reflect the real needs of children. That means that local authorities have huge deficits through no fault of their own; they are trying to do their job. When she comes up with her new policy in the autumn, will she commit to writing off those deficits so that those authorities can do the job in the future?</p>

    <p pid="e544.7/1">As part of our reforms, we will commence a phased transition process, which will include working with local authorities to manage their SEND systems, including their deficits, alongside an extension to the statutory override until the end of 2027-28. We will set out more details about the plan for how we will support local authorities with the historical and accruing deficits accumulated under the last Government and since, due to the appalling situation that we inherited.</p>

There was a lot of frustration and a lot of tears. They were honest and open about their upset at the current system, but there were also a lot of ideas and a determination to make change happen, so that  those who come after us do not have to go through the same stress and anxiety that we do as SEND parents.

I am sure that all Members will join me in offering support and prayers to everyone affected by the Minehead middle school bus crash last Thursday. Our deepest sympathies and condolences go to all those affected at the school and in the wider community, and particularly to the family and friends of the 10-year-old boy who tragically lost his life. Most of the injured have now been released from hospital. Support has already been put in place for those affected, and it will continue into the summer break and beyond. I extend my thanks to everyone involved in co-ordinating and delivering this vital help, and I also pay tribute to the emergency services for their incredible response in the most challenging of circumstances.</p>
    <p pid="e546.3/2">This Labour Government believe that children growing up in our country deserve the very best start in life, which is why we are investing nearly £1.5 billion over the next three years to transform early years and family services. That will include £500 million to roll out Best Start family hubs in every local authority, honouring the proud legacy of Sure Start and ensuring that every family can thrive regardless of postcode or income. Labour is building back the crucial family services that were decimated by the Tories, providing high-quality support for parents, babies and children from pregnancy onwards—and we are only just getting started.</p>

    <p pid="e550.6/1">I am not quite clear what the right hon. Gentleman is driving at with that question. What I have said in response to the very sharp decline in the birth rate is that as a Government we want to make sure that people are able to make choices that are right for them, including around family size. My concern is that too many young people, because of the inaccessibility of housing and the challenges they face in the jobs market, are making decisions they do not necessarily  want to make. That is why the expansion of childcare, for example, is a critical part of how we are supporting families.</p>

    <p pid="e555.3/1">As the House will be aware, on <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 8 July</phrase> an arrest was made by Essex police following incidents that took place in Epping earlier that day, and a man was subsequently charged. His trial is due to start on <phrase class="date" code="">26 August</phrase>, and he has been remanded in custody until that time. These are very serious allegations and it is vital that criminal justice procedures are able to run their course—Superintendent Tim Tubbs of Essex police has said that</p>
    <p pid="e555.3/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“the last thing we want is for any public discussion to hinder an ongoing prosecution.”</p>
    <p pid="e555.3/3">I thank Essex police both for its swift response on that case and for handling the protests in Essex yesterday evening and in previous days with diligence and professionalism.</p>
    <p pid="e555.3/4">Criminal activity of any kind is totally unacceptable, wherever it occurs and whoever it is perpetrated by. As outlined following the recent Casey report, we are improving joint protection arrangements between the police and immigration enforcement linked to the asylum system. We are clear that where crimes are committed, every effort must be made to catch, prosecute and punish those responsible.</p>
    <p pid="e555.3/5">Let there be absolutely no doubt: foreign nationals, including asylum seekers, who abuse our hospitality by breaking our laws should expect to be removed from this country. In the first year of this Government, 5,179 foreign national criminals were removed from the UK—a 14% increase on the previous year. That is important progress, but we want to go further. Through the Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill, we are changing the law to ensure that individuals convicted of any registered sexual offence are not granted asylum, and we are legislating to allow for the tagging of any migrant considered to pose a threat to public safety or national security, as well as strengthening our crackdown on illegal working.</p>
    <p pid="e555.3/6">But we must go further to end hotel use. This Labour Government inherited an asylum system in chaos, with 400 hotels in use at the peak in 2023 at a cost of almost £9 million a day. We are changing that, clearing the asylum backlog and increasing returns to end the use of asylum hotels all together by the end of this Parliament. Alongside those actions, we are mounting a comprehensive and wide-ranging effort to tackle small boat crossings, including the intensified co-operation and pilot returns scheme with France outlined by the Home Secretary in her statement last week.</p>
    <p pid="e555.3/7">There is no quick fix for the chronic problems this Government inherited, but, for the first time in years, there is now a serious and sensible plan to restore order and proper management to the asylum and immigration system. Let me state plainly to the House that we expect rules to be respected and enforced, and we expect the law to be followed. When it is not, we expect those involved to face the full force of the law. We are taking every possible step to deliver the strong border security that the country needs, because nothing matters more than the safety of the British people.</p>

    <p pid="e556.0/1">The Policing Minister was crowing about the Government’s action on small boats, but the truth is this: so far this year, the Government have allowed in 23,000 illegal immigrants across the channel—that is 52% up on last year; this year has been by far the worst ever; and numbers in asylum hotels are now higher than at the time of the election. This is a border security crisis, but it is also a public safety crisis, especially for women and girls. Many nationalities crossing—for example, Afghans—commit up to 20 times more sex offences than average; Louise Casey made that point in her report.</p>
    <p pid="e556.0/2">Now we have press reporting on the huge scale of the crime committed by illegal immigrants housed in the Government’s own asylum hotels. The Sun found 339 charges in the last six months based on only half the hotels currently operated. The Mail on Sunday found 708 charges based on only a third of those hotels. Those crimes included multiple cases of rape, sexual assault, violence, theft and arson, including the case that the Minister referred to in Epping, where a 38-year-old Ethiopian man has been charged with sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl. An illegal immigrant in Oxford has been convicted of raping a 20-year-old woman in a churchyard. A Sudanese man was convicted of strangling and attempting to rape a woman in a nightclub toilet in Wakefield. Violent protest in response to those appalling crimes is never justified. The public, though, are rightly sick of this illegal immigrant crime wave. It has to end.</p>
    <p pid="e556.0/3">Will the Minister commit now to doing the following things? First, will she record and publish the immigration status of all offenders? Secondly, will she close that asylum hotel in Epping? Thirdly, will she repeal the Human Rights Act for immigration matters? Finally, will she emulate Greece’s new approach, which started today, and deport all illegal immigrants on arrival from France without judicial process either back to their country of origin or to a safe third country? Will she give the House and the country those commitments?</p>

I regret the tone that the shadow Home Secretary is taking on such a serious and important matter. I also gently remind him to look at his record and that of the Conservative party on this issue. More than 400 asylum hotels were in operation at their peak, housing over 50,000 people at a cost of almost £9 million a day. Enforced returns were down 50% on 2010. Returns of foreign national offenders had fallen by a thousand. Criminal smuggler gangs were able to exploit our weak border security—</p>

That is why we need an efficient asylum system that swiftly returns those without a genuine right to stay. I would welcome details from the Minister on what steps the Government are taking to deliver that. Clear rules that are properly enforced will be key to rebuilding public trust in the system after it was broken by the Conservatives.</p>

We must arrest the people who land on our shores, detain them and send them back to where they came from. The Human Rights Act 1998 was never intended to cover illegal immigrants of this sort.

We understand that there are different opinions on immigration in this country, and people should be allowed to voice those opinions. When that turns into violent disorder, as we have seen, it is not acceptable. I know that the police behave in a very professional way. They allow protests to take place, but they clearly have to keep the King’s peace as well.

Peaceful protest plays its part, but she will be conscious that the police themselves have condemned the “mindless thuggery” that we have seen in Epping. Also, there are reports that seem quite serious about neo-Nazi groups and their leaflets being circulated.

    <p pid="e560.0/1">Two weeks ago in Epping, there were three alleged sexual assaults on school-age girls; my thoughts are with the victims, their families and their peers. These were allegedly linked to the Bell hotel, which has been stood up as an asylum hotel against all advice. Since then, we have had numerous major protests involving hundreds of people, injuries to police officers and damage to police vehicles. People quite rightly have the right to peaceful protest, but these violent scenes are not us. They are not Epping and they are not what we stand for. I want to thank Essex police for all that they are doing to keep us safe in these challenging and distressing times for our town. Following the protests, we have churches cancelling services, businesses closing early and local residents feeling like they are barricaded in their own homes. The hotel is in the wrong place: it is near a school and there is inadequate safeguarding of the hotel’s vulnerable residents. This is a crisis that is boiling over, and for the sake of community safety the Home Secretary and the Government must get a grip of the situation. They must listen and act now to close this hotel immediately. Will they now do that?</p>

We in this House have perhaps not been as quick as we should be to recognise how social media has moved things on in society in a way that we need to deal with.

    <p pid="e564.5/1">My constituency has a proud history of being a welcoming community. We have had an asylum hotel for two years with no problems; the families are well integrated in the local community with many children in the local schools. Late last week, however, we were told that people would be asked to move from that hotel with no notice from today, despite the fact that the hotel will still be used for asylum seekers. They do not know where they will need to move to. I have raised the issue with the Home Office and had no response, so can the Minister urgently look into it today? Does she agree that every MP with an asylum hotel in their constituency should have a dedicated Home Office contact so that we can work together to promote peace and harmonious community relations, and against disinformation and violence?</p>

    <p pid="e565.1/1">We have heard Conservative and Reform MPs decry legislation that they say is stopping the problem being fixed. They talk the talk, but they do not actually vote for legislation. The shadow Home Secretary, with an angry face, was going on about what is happening in hotels, but it was his Government’s policy that set up hotels as hostels for asylum seekers. This Government have said that they will end the policy. Can the Minister set out the Government’s sensible approach—not gimmicks—to end the use of hotels as hostels?</p>

    <p pid="e565.3/1">Violent disorder is always wrong, but we need to recognise that it is a symptom of people’s outrage at the current situation, and of their fear of crime—particularly sexual crime—in their community. The Minister should focus not on the tone of questions in the House and what has happened in the past, but on what she will do to solve the problem. In that respect, I agree with what the Father of the House said about requiring a credible deterrent, so does the Minister regret cancelling the Rwanda scheme?</p>

    <p pid="e566.0/1">The right hon. Lady says that there is no plan. First, we are working with source and transit companies to stop dangerous journeys before they begin. Secondly, we are stepping up law enforcement, with new powers, more National Crime Agency officers and specialist units in France to disrupt smuggling gangs. Thirdly, we are strengthening border security, with more patrols, drones and legal challenges to stop overcrowded boats. Fourthly, we have secured a new returns agreement with France—something that the shadow Home Secretary could not achieve—so that people arriving illegally by small boat can be sent back, while also accepting a matching number of eligible applicants through a safe route. Finally, we are cracking down on illegal working and reforming the asylum system to close loopholes exploited by gangs and ensure fair, controlled migration. That looks like a plan to me—that is a plan.</p>

It would be nice to think that the normal courtesies will be resumed.</p>

    <p pid="e568.2/1">Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. I have, of course, saved the bulk of my responses for you and the House this afternoon. With permission, I would like to update the House on the Government’s plans to reform the water sector.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/2">The water industry is clearly failing. Our rivers, lakes and seas are polluted with record levels of sewage, and water pipes have been left to crumble into disrepair. I share customers’ fury at rising bills. Right now, hosepipe bans are in place across the country because not a single new reservoir has been built in over 30 years, and the lack of water infrastructure is blocking economic growth. Water companies have been allowed to profit at the expense of the British people when they should have been investing to fix our broken water pipes. They got away with this because of a broken regulatory system that has failed both customers and the environment. The public expressed their fury in last year’s general election and voted for change. That change will now come.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/3">In just one year, we have put in place the building blocks for change. First, we restored accountability by giving the regulators more teeth and introducing a ban on unfair bonuses, severe and automatic penalties for breaking the law, and jail sentences for the most serious offences. Secondly, we are investing £104 billion of private sector funding to rebuild the water network, upgrading crumbling pipes, repairing leaks, building new sewage treatment works and digging out new reservoirs. It is the single biggest investment in the history of the water sector, and it allows me to make a new commitment to the country: this Government will cut water companies’ sewage pollution in half by the end of the decade. That is the most ambitious commitment ever made by any Government about water pollution, and it is just the start. Over a decade of national renewal, we will restore our rivers, lakes and seas to good health.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/4">The third building block for change is today’s final report from Sir Jon Cunliffe’s Independent Water Commission. I express my thanks to Sir Jon, his officials, and all those who have contributed to this outstanding piece of work. I agree with Sir Jon that water regulation has been too weak, too complex, and ineffective. Having four separate regulators with overlapping and conflicting remits has failed both customers and the environment. Ofwat has failed to protect customers from water companies’ mismanagement of their hard-earned money, and it has failed to protect our waterways from record levels of pollution. Today, I can announce that this Labour Government will abolish Ofwat. We will bring water functions from four different regulators into one—a single powerful super-regulator responsible for the entire water sector, with the teeth it needs to enforce the high standards that the public rightly demand.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/5">The new regulator will stand firmly on the side of customers, investors and the environment and prevent the abuses of the past. For customers, it will oversee investment and upgrade work, so that hard-working British families are never again hit by the shocking bill hikes that we saw last year as customers were left to pay the price of failure by the previous Government. For investors, it will provide the clarity and direction required for a strong partnership between Government, the sector and investors to attract billions of pounds of new funding. For the environment, it will reduce all forms of pollution to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good. We will work closely with the Welsh Government to devolve the economic regulation of water to Wales.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/6">I will publish a White Paper this autumn giving the Government’s full response to the Independent Water Commission’s final report and launching a consultation on it. Following that, I will bring forward a new water reform Bill early in the lifetime of this Parliament. Ofwat will remain in place during the transition to the new regulator, and I will ensure that it provides the right leadership to oversee the current price review and investment plan during that time. To provide clarity during this period, I will issue an interim strategic policy statement to Ofwat and give ministerial directions to the Environment Agency setting out our expectations and requirements. We will publish a transition plan as part of our full Government response in the autumn.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/7">Today, we are immediately taking forward a number of Sir Jon’s recommendations. First, we will establish a new statutory water ombudsman—a single, free service to help customers resolve complaints such as incorrect bills, leaking pipes or water supply failures. The new ombudsman will have the legal powers to protect customers and will bring the water dispute resolution process in line with other utilities, such as energy. It is part of the Government’s ambition to put customers at the heart of water regulation.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/8">Secondly, we will end the era of water companies marking their own homework. We will end operator self-monitoring and transition to open monitoring to increase transparency and help restore public trust. Water companies are already required to publish data on some sewage spills within one hour. We will roll out real-time monitoring across the wastewater system, and all this data will be made publicly available online. That will ensure that the regulator and, importantly, the public have the power to hold water companies fully accountable.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/9">Thirdly, we commit to including a regional element within the new regulator to ensure greater local involvement in water planning. By moving to a catchment-based model for water system planning, we can tackle all sources of pollution entering waterways, so that they can be cleaned up more effectively and more quickly. This will ensure—for the first time—that water infrastructure investment plans align with spatial planning to support faster regional economic growth. The lack of water infrastructure that held back development around Cambridge and Oxford for so long will not happen again.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/10">The new regulatory framework will recognise the risks investors take and, if they meet their obligations, they will see a fair, stable return on their investment. Just   last week, I signed the Government’s new water skills pledge to make sure that the sector has the skills and workforce it needs to deliver this vast investment.</p>
    <p pid="e568.2/11">This Labour Government were elected to clean up water pollution and ensure that unacceptable bill hikes can never happen again. We now have all the building blocks in place to make that happen. We are establishing a new partnership based on effective regulation, where water companies, investors, communities and the Government will work together to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas for good.</p>

    <p pid="e570.1/1">I am grateful to the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement. I shall be responding on behalf of the shadow Secretary of State while she meets farmers at the Royal Welsh Show.</p>
    <p pid="e570.1/2">Let me begin by recognising the scale and seriousness of the work undertaken by Sir Jon Cunliffe and his team. The review contains 460 pages and 88 recommendations, and represents one of the most detailed examinations of the water sector since privatisation. Indeed, there is much in it that we cautiously welcome, including the merger of the regulators. As we examine the recommendations in more detail, we stand ready to support serious reform if it is done properly. However, I am afraid that what we have seen and heard from the Secretary of State over the past year has not matched the seriousness of Sir Jon Cunliffe’s work, nor has it gone anywhere near the root-and-branch radical reform that he sold to voters before the election. I therefore seek clarity from him on the following points.</p>
    <p pid="e570.1/3">First, over the weekend the Secretary of State announced that Labour would cut sewage spills by 50% by 2030, but what he did not mention was the fact that plans submitted under the last Conservative Government were already set to cut sewage spills by even more than that amount. The Times reported yesterday that the Secretary of State’s new pledge would actually see an additional 20,000 discharges of sewage in our rivers, compared with existing plans. Can the Secretary of State explain why, after 88 recommendations and a year-long review of the sector, he has watered down sewage reduction targets rather than massively ramping them up?</p>
    <p pid="e570.1/4">Secondly, the Secretary of State took to the airwaves at the weekend telling the public that we needed to go back to the “purity” of our waters that we all remember, but the uncomfortable truth for which Labour still refuses to take responsibility is that when it left office in 2010, just 7% of storm overflows were monitored. Let me repeat that: under Blair and Brown, 93% of sewage discharges were happening with no oversight and no accountability whatsoever. The only reason we can talk tough today is the fact that the last Government pushed monitoring to 100% in 2023. May I therefore ask the Secretary of State to clarify his statement?</p>
    <p pid="e570.1/5">Thirdly, the Secretary of State told the public that he had secured £104 billion of investment from the water sector to fund these reductions, but what he did not mention was that £93 billion of that investment plan had already been submitted by water companies in  October 2023, nine months before he was even in office. I would know that because I was the Minister at the time, and I have here the letter showing that he had nothing to do with it. Will he comment on that?</p>
    <p pid="e570.1/6">Fourthly, the Secretary of State champions the 81 criminal investigations of water companies that have taken place since the election and his ban on water company bosses’ bonuses, but what he does not explain is that these criminal investigations are a direct result of the Conservatives’ policy of quadrupling the number of water company inspections, and that it was our party that launched the ban on bosses’ bonuses. This is all available for the public to see and to fact-check for themselves, as it is a matter of public record.</p>
    <p pid="e570.1/7">What all this shows is that, for all their bluster and promises of radical change, the Government have made almost no new progress on the issue over the past year. They have sat on their hands for more than a year waiting for the review. It is no wonder that the campaigners whom the Secretary of State so shamelessly used for votes in the run-up to the last general election are now, today, calling for his resignation. We on this side of the House stand ready to work with the Government on serious reform. We will support any action that genuinely holds water companies to account, delivers cleaner waters and protects the public from paying the price of corporate failure. However, we will not stand by while the Secretary of State rewrites history, waters down ambition, and backtracks on the promises that he made to the public.</p>

    <p pid="e571.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman—I think—for his comments, but it is disappointing that the shadow Secretary of State did not consider a matter of this urgency to be important enough for her to show up in the Chamber this afternoon. I am afraid that that really does reflect the importance that their party ascribed to this issue during the 14 years in which it was in power.</p>
    <p pid="e571.0/2">I enjoy listening to the hon. Gentleman, but I am afraid that he sounded a little delusional this afternoon. If he really thinks that the Conservatives did so well on sewage, I wonder why he thinks sewage pollution in our waterways increased every single year during their 14 years in charge. The fact is that the Conservatives made the situation far worse, because they instructed the regulator to apply a light touch when they should have told it to get a grip. They stripped out resources from the regulator, reducing its resources by 50% at one point, so it was less able to enforce against sewage pollution. They allowed millions of pounds, if not billions, to be diverted away from investment and to be used instead for unjustified bonuses and dividends for water companies.</p>
    <p pid="e571.0/3">It is this Government who have secured £104 billion of investment to upgrade our water system. It is this Government who have banned the unfair bonuses that water bosses were taking. It is this Government who are introducing monitoring of all sewage outlets. And it is this Government who are going to clean up our rivers, lakes and seas, where the previous Government failed abysmally.</p>

    <p pid="e572.2/1">I thank the Secretary of State for advance sight of his statement, and Sir Jon Cunliffe for his report and for his work in producing it. The Liberal Democrats have long argued for the abolition of Ofwat, and for the creation of a new, consolidated and powerful regulator. In fact, we put it to the Public Bill Committee and it was supported by neither the Labour party nor the Conservative party, but today’s proposal seems to include doing just that, so we strongly welcome the statement. It is a reminder to the wonderful volunteers and water campaigners across the country that their work is absolutely worth while and has made a huge difference. My message to them is: thank you so much and keep going, because we still do not know the details and the nature of the new regulator, and we still see no sign in the report of any plan to tackle the toxic nature of the water industry’s ownership structure.</p>
    <p pid="e572.2/2">Why is there no plan to change the structure of the industry itself? Even the best regulator in the world will fail if water companies are still owned by those who care nothing for the quality of the lakes, rivers and seas, and who care only about making as much profit as possible in return for very little investment. Is it really acceptable to ask bill payers for a 30% rise when there is no guarantee that the water company will not be siphoning off huge chunks of that money in dividends, pay rises or bonuses? Why is there nothing in the statement that will truly empower the volunteers, citizen scientists and water campaigners I just mentioned? Why are we not giving places on water company boards to the likes of the Eden Rivers Trust, the South Lakes Rivers Trust, Save Windermere, the Clean River Kent Campaign, Surfers Against Sewage and Windrush Against Sewage Pollution, known as WASP? Why is there no mention of monitoring the volume of sewage spills as well as the number of incidences, and no mention of including legally binding pollution reduction targets?</p>
    <p pid="e572.2/3">Although the statement is welcome and we rightly celebrate the Liberal Democrat campaign wins that it is full of, our job as a constructive and effective Opposition   is to scrutinise the detail and to carry on campaigning to clean up our waterways and our water industry too. That is exactly what we shall do.</p>

    <p pid="e573.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for his questions.

I hope that they will join us in welcoming Sir Jon’s report.</p>
    <p pid="e573.0/2">There will be a White Paper and a consultation alongside it. We will launch the White Paper in the autumn, giving detailed Government responses to the 450-page report. With 88 recommendations, there is a lot to go through, but the report includes proposals about ownership, which will be consulted on as well. Volunteers and citizen scientists will be able to engage for the first time through the proposed regional structures. We accept that proposal in principle, and the detail of it will be worked through during the consultation. For the first time, there will be engagement on the catchment of entire river systems, and citizens, local authorities and businesses will all have a voice in that, as will members of the farming community operating within those catchments.</p>
    <p pid="e573.0/3">I believe that by reducing the number of spills we will also reduce the volume of spills. The hon. Gentleman will be able to monitor that, and he will be able to hold me to account, as will the House and the public, as we work towards the target that I have outlined for reducing sewage spills from water companies by 50% by 2030. He of course is lucky enough to represent one of the most beautiful parts of the country, including Windermere, and we are working with United Utilities to remove all sources of pollution from that beautiful, iconic lake, so that what became a story of decline can become a visible symbol of renewal with this Government.</p>

    <p pid="e574.0/1">My hon. Friend makes a very important point. We are currently going through a dry spell and seeing hosepipe bans in many parts of the country, yet in the winter it rained very heavily. The reason we have hosepipe bans is that we do not have the reservoirs to catch the rain when it falls and then use it in drier periods, which is because we have not built a new reservoir for 30 years. That changes now: these plans include the intention to build nine new reservoirs. To speed up the planning process, I as the Secretary of State am taking control of consents for reservoirs, so that they can be approved much faster and go ahead to provide the country with the clean drinking water we need.</p>

Anglers are quite rightly furious about the level of pollution, which is destroying fish and other life in our rivers, but also about the impact of abstractions, particularly from chalk streams, so the new regulator will be engaging with them.

    <p pid="e574.3/1">I really welcome the water commission. The EFRA Committee has had each of the water bosses in, one by one, and each struggled to explain why their industry prioritises bonuses over fixing broken pipes. I therefore really welcome the action that the Government have taken to ban bonuses, starting with the bonus for the Southern Water boss, Lawrence Gosden. We were, however, disgusted to hear last week that he plans to take a doubling in his salary, an additional £690,000, after overseeing major water outages, flooding in Hastings town centre and massive sewage dumping.

To pay that money—£100 billion—we would have to take it away from public services, such as the national  health service and education, to hand it to the owners of the companies that have been polluting our waterways.

It is astonishing that the Conservatives thought it was a good idea to strip out resources and tell the regulator to go soft on the companies given the abuses that were taking place. That has ended now, and we are moving to a model of effective regulation that will protect bill payers and clean up our rivers.</p>

My constituents will be relieved as, after 14 years of Tory failure and inaction, water pollution from toxic sewage discharge is a persistent problem in Battersea, and all the while their bills are being hiked.

    <p pid="e579.1/1">This Government-commissioned review looked at how to tinker with the Conservatives’ failed privatised monopoly system, but the truth is that it is a moribund model that has resulted in billions being paid out to shareholders and billions in debt being loaded up, and in crucial infrastructure being neglected, meaning that sewage is regularly pumped into our rivers and seas. Does the Secretary of State accept that the cost of that failure must be part of the calculation of the cost of bringing water into public hands, where it belongs, and that figures like £100 billion are grossly inflated by those who do not think the water industry should pay for its greed and terrible mismanagement of our water system?</p>

We know it does not work, and we have only to look north of the border to see it; under the nationalised model in Scotland, pollution is worse, not better. The hon.

The reason we are strengthening regulation and changing the regulator is so that we can prevent such failures. The £104 billion that we secured at the end of last year will help to upgrade pipes, so that we can reduce the amount of water leaking out of the system, and pay to build and dig out the new reservoirs to catch the rain, so that there is a supply of water in the drier periods.</p>

Would it not be better to bring it into public ownership and set a share price based on the costs of pollution and on the exorbitant executive pay and bonuses, so that the public as a whole can control their water supply and no longer be left to the vagaries of the private sector, with all the devastation and damage it has caused over the past 30 years?</p>

Friend; it is a shame that no Reform Members have turned up, although perhaps it is not surprising because they did not bother mentioning this issue in their manifesto either. We did hear at the weekend that their leader, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26352" name="Nigel Farage">the hon. Member for Clacton (Nigel Farage)</phrase>, wants to hand £50 billion of taxpayers’ money to the owners of water companies. If we add that to its existing £80 billion of unfunded commitments, it comes to £130 billion. By my reckoning, that is almost double the amount that Liz Truss bet and lost on the economy when she crashed it and sent mortgages, prices and rents skyrocketing. Reform wants to double down on the bad bet.</p>

In my constituency, water heroes like Doug Kennedy, who I joined in Nether Winchendon testing the River Thame a few weeks ago, have decades of real local knowledge on our waterways, as do the volunteers of the River Thame Conservation Trust. That powerhouse of local knowledge will be replicated up and down the country.

Burst-pipe sewage-dumping following storm overflows has now become customary. Last year alone, 119 hours’ worth of sewage was discharged into rivers and waterways in my constituency. Thames Water has been allowed to get away with such negligent and environmentally hazardous practices for far too long while Ofwat has stood by and watched. Earlier this year, a freedom of information request uncovered that Ofwat had not recouped a single penny from the financial sanctions it has placed on Thames Water. Now that the Government have finally realised that Ofwat must be replaced, will the Minister set out a timeline for the implementation of the review’s recommendation of a new regulator?</p>

So my question to the Secretary of State is a simple one: will he do me a favour and speak to the relevant Minister at the Northern Ireland Assembly, Andrew Muir, to ensure that we in Northern Ireland have the same result as what is going to happen here with the required changes to infrastructure, giving more responsibility and outputting the changes that are made? With the positivity the Secretary of State has shown, that would take care of some of our difficulties in Northern Ireland.</p>

    <p pid="e590.2/1">I thank the Secretary of State for everything he is doing to transform water companies across our country. My residents in Gillingham and Rainham have suffered astronomical hikes in their bills and have been exposed to pollution and sewage dumps in our water, yet the chief executive of Southern Water thinks that he deserves a bonus of approximately £700,000 on top of his salary. Does the Secretary of State agree that that is an absolute disgrace? Will he ensure that any loophole used to bring forward those bonuses is shut down under his reforms?</p>

    <p pid="e590.3/1">I agree with my hon. Friend that that is disgraceful. I am afraid that these problems arose because the previous Government instructed the regulators to apply only a light-touch approach to regulation, when they really needed to get an absolute grip on this failing sector. The previous Government failed to do that, but this Government will ensure that that happens.</p>

    <p pid="e590.4/1">Many of my constituents share my utter disgust at the way in which water companies have been able to profit from degrading our rivers and chalk streams. It is fantastic to see bonuses already banned at polluting Anglian Water and to see that we are following up by taking action and sacking regulators that were asleep at the wheel. As we start on really ambitious reforms to halve sewage spills over the coming years, how can we ensure that we are tightening up some of those monitoring procedures so that my constituents can see clearly and transparently whether we are feeling the benefits locally?</p>

    <p pid="e590.5/1">Monitoring will now be compulsory on every single outlet, not just some of them. That data will be published in near real time so that consumers know exactly what is going into the waterways in the area where they live or where they are on holiday.</p>

Portsmouth, as an island city, is well aware of the damage done; we see it, we smell it and we feel it in our pockets every day. More than 100 of my constituents have raised their fury and disappointment at the way that the Tories allowed firms to extract billions and pump raw sewage. Abolishing Ofwat and having an independent water commissioner is another brilliant step that will have real teeth and serve customers. Will the Secretary of State confirm that this Government  will ensure action—that we do not just monitor, we take action; that there is no light touch and we take action; that our actions ensure that fair water companies serve the public interest first? Will he meet me and my resident David Taylor, a brilliant campaigner and inventor, to explore how we not only stop sewage pumping, but reduce leaks?</p>

    <p pid="e591.1/1">I very much welcome the Secretary of State’s focus on protecting water customers, because my constituents and I have seen our Thames Water bills go up dramatically. We want to know that those bill increases are going towards improving the infrastructure and customer service, as opposed to payouts to bosses that happened so much under the regulator’s watch.

    <p pid="e592.1/1">I very much welcome the Secretary of State’s announcement, which means that Thames Water will no longer be able to treat my constituents with contempt—as it did under the previous Conservative Government—by diverting many millions from the bills paid by local residents to shell out dividends to its shareholders and pay itself bonuses, all the while pumping loads of sewage into our river. The Secretary of State has talked about ringfencing; can he clarify what will happen if Thames Water does not now invest enough of its income in stopping the spills and clearing up our river? Is it fair to say that Thames Water and its directors are still drinking in the last chance saloon?</p>

    <p pid="e592.4/1">People will have the right to go to the ombudsman to take up complaints such as that one, or any other complaint. Previously, there was no statutory ombudsman that water customers could have recourse to when they faced problems. We will bring one in, and it will operate alongside the much-increased levels of compensation that we have already introduced through the Water (Special Measures) Act 2025, which my hon.

    <p pid="e592.5/1">I congratulate the Secretary of State on the scale of ambition he has shown today. Although there are many issues in the water sector in Scotland—not least the combined sewer overflow discharges into the Water of Leith at Colinton Dell—one thing we understand is that to reduce CSO spills, we have to reduce the amount of rainfall going into our combined pipes, which is done through planning in Scotland. The Cunliffe report makes clear that it is time to enact schedule 3 to the Flood and Water Management Act 2010, which would do the same in England. Will the Secretary of State take that recommendation forward?</p>

    <p pid="e593.0/1">In my view—and Sir Jon Cunliffe also makes this point—it is very important that we align water infrastructure investment with spatial planning, so that we can tackle the kinds of problems that my hon. Friend has referred to. We intend to go ahead with that in England; I have already accepted that recommendation in principle, even ahead of any consultation. Of course, the situation will be different in Scotland, because it has a SNP Government who have not really taken these issues seriously.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2025-07-21e.595.1" speakername="David Lammy" type="Start Statement" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/10678" colnum="595" time="17:58:00" url="">
    <p pid="e595.1/1">With permission, Mr Deputy Speaker, I would like to make a statement on the middle east. I will begin with Syria. We have been horrified by the recent violence in the south, including civilian deaths. Clashes between Druze and Bedouin militias have quickly escalated into intense fighting, with involvement from Government forces and further Israeli strikes on the Syrian military. As I have said directly to Foreign Minister al-Shaibani, we want to see the fighting ended, civilians protected, and the rights of all Syrians upheld. The violence in Suwayda must be investigated, and those responsible must be held accountable. We want humanitarian access to be restored and for aid to be delivered, and Syria’s sovereignty must be respected.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/2">The UK can be proud of our support to the Syrian people over many years. A stable Syria matters to the UK’s national interest, in terms of terrorism, irregular migration and regional stability. We must work to prevent extremism, sectarianism or lawlessness taking hold now that Assad is gone. That is why we are backing a sustainable ceasefire. It is why we support an inclusive transition, and it is why I visited Damascus recently to support the new Government and to press them to meet their commitments.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/3">I will now turn to the situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. It is two and a half months since Prime Minister Netanyahu restarted offensive operations. The Israel Defence Forces have driven Palestinians out of 86% of Gaza, leaving around 2 million people trapped in an area scarcely over 20 square miles. Whatever this Israeli Government might claim, repeated displacement of so many civilians is not keeping them safe. In fact, it is quite the reverse.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/4">The new Israeli aid system is inhumane and dangerous, and it deprives Gazans of human dignity. It contradicts long-established humanitarian principles. It creates disorder that Hamas are now exploiting, with distribution points reduced from 400 to just four. It forces desperate civilians, children among them, to scramble unsafely for the essentials of life. It is a grotesque spectacle, wreaking a terrible human cost.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/5">Almost 1,000 civilians have been killed since May seeking aid, including 100 this weekend alone. There are near-daily reports of Israeli troops opening fire on people trying to access food. Israeli jets have hit women and children waiting for a health clinic to open. An Israeli drone has struck down children filling water containers, which Israeli officials blamed on a technical error. Hamas are of course contributing to the chaos and taking advantage of it, but I utterly condemn the killing of civilians seeking to meet their basic needs. The Israeli Government must answer: what possible military justification can there be for strikes that have killed desperate, starving children? What immediate actions are they taking to stop this litany of horrors? What will they do to hold those responsible to account?</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/6">I am a steadfast supporter of Israel’s security and right to exist. I treasure the many connections between our peoples, and the horrors of <phrase class="date" code="">7 October</phrase> must never be forgotten, but I firmly believe that the Israeli Government’s  actions are doing untold damage to Israel’s standing in the world and undermining Israel’s long-term security. Netanyahu should listen to the Israeli people, some 82% of whom desperately want a ceasefire, and to the hostages’ families, because they know a ceasefire offers the best chance to bring their loved ones home. Those hostages may be hidden in cramped tunnels under the ruins of Gaza, but we will not forget them, or Hamas’s despicable actions, and we will continue to demand their unconditional release. This offensive puts them in grave danger, but still Netanyahu persists.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/7">Indeed, Minister Katz has gone further, proposing to drive Gaza’s entire population into Rafah, imprisoning Palestinians, unless they are persuaded to emigrate. This is a cruel vision that must never come to pass, and I condemn it unequivocally. Permanent forced displacement is a violation of international humanitarian law. Many Israelis themselves are appalled. As the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said,</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/8" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“it marches us into the abyss”.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/9">He is right.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/10">Today I join a statement with 31 Foreign Ministers as signatories. It had a simple, urgent message: the war in Gaza must end now. There is no military solution. Negotiations will secure the hostages. Further bloodshed serves no purpose. Hamas and Israel must both commit to a ceasefire now, and the next ceasefire must be the last ceasefire. I thank the United States, Qatar and Egypt for their tireless efforts. I am sure that all Members share my intense frustration that the ceasefire has not happened. Until there is a breakthrough, we must keep doing all we can to relieve the suffering.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/11">UK aid has saved lives, reaching hundreds of thousands with food, water, hygiene and sanitation, and essential healthcare. Under the most appalling circumstances, our aid is saving lives today. That includes the almost £9 million the UK has provided to UK-Med since we entered office, reaching half a million patients inside Gaza and 24,000 in the past fortnight alone, including three-year old Razan—UK-funded medics removed a bullet from her neck after nearly three hours of surgery. These doctors and nurses working in the most extreme conditions are true heroes. They deserve the thanks and admiration of the entire House.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/12">We are also working multilaterally. The 149 trucks from the World Food Programme and UNICEF entering Gaza in recent days included food supplies funded by the UK. Thousands more trucks laden with aid paid for by British taxpayers can enter the moment that the Israeli Government let them in. Today I am announcing an extra £40 million for humanitarian assistance in Gaza this year, including £7.5 million for UK-Med to sustain its vital operations in Gaza and save more lives.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/13">Accompanying the horrors in Gaza is an accelerating campaign to prevent a future Palestinian state in the west bank. It is embraced by Netanyahu, encouraged by his Ministers and driven by an extremist ideology that wants to suffocate the two-state solution, which is the only route to a lasting peace and security. We see it in the unprecedented pace of settlement expansion and in the shocking levels of settler violence—and even settler terrorism, for that is what the most egregious ideological attacks are. The deliberate attempts to squeeze the Palestinian Authority, unjustly denying them access to their own funds, harms Israel’s long-term interests in  the process. Now the Israeli Government are reintroducing plans to construct new units in the E1 area of occupied East Jerusalem. If built, that settlement would separate the west bank’s north from its south, and Palestinians in the west bank from East Jerusalem. These plans are wholly unacceptable, they are illegal, and they must not happen.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/14">We are striving to keep open the prospects of a two-state solution. UK assistance has been preserving the Palestinian Authority, contributing to essential Palestinian workers’ salaries and supporting them to progress critical reforms. Today I can confirm that we are enhancing our support, providing £7 million to strengthen the Palestinian Authority and Palestinian governance, implementing the agreement signed by me and Prime Minister Mustafa earlier this year, and delivering the reform plans that President Abbas has set out. I can also confirm that we are providing £20 million to support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency’s many services for Palestinian refugees.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/15">Alongside that support, we are leading diplomatic efforts to show that there must be a viable peaceful pathway to a Palestinian state involving the Palestinian Authority, not Hamas, in the security and governance of the area. Hamas can have no role in the governance of Gaza, and nor must it be allowed to use it as a launchpad for terrorism. Israeli Ministers should support the Palestinian Authority, not actively undermine their economy, as Ministers Ben Gvir and Smotrich are doing. The UK is co-leading with Egypt the humanitarian and reconstruction track for the forthcoming two-state solution conference, and we are pushing to agree plans for a credible next phase in Gaza, with a responsible, reformed PA at their core, so that we can turn any temporary ceasefire into a lasting peace.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/16">In our year in office, this Labour Government have acted to address this horrendous conflict. We restored funding to UNRWA after the Tories froze it. We suspended arms export licences, when the Tories had declined to act. We have provided nearly a quarter of a billion in humanitarian assistance this year and next, getting medical treatment and food to hundreds of thousands of civilians in Gaza. We have stood with the hostage families at every stage. We have worked with Jordan to fly medicines into Gaza, with Egypt to treat medically evacuated civilians, and with Kuwait and UNICEF to help children in Gaza.</p>
    <p pid="e595.1/17">We have delivered three sanctions packages on violent settlers, suspended trade negotiations with the Israeli Government, and sanctioned far-right Israeli Ministers for incitement. We have defended the independence of the international courts. We have signed a landmark agreement with the Palestinian Authority and hosted the Palestinian Prime Minister in London, pushing for the reform they need. We called for, worked for and voted for an immediate ceasefire and the release of the hostages at every possible opportunity, and we will keep doing so until this war is over, Hamas release the hostages and we finally have a pathway to a two-state solution. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

    <p pid="e598.0/1">I am grateful to the Foreign Secretary for advance sight of his statement.</p>
    <p pid="e598.0/2">The violence, loss of life and conflicts that continue in the middle east shock us all. Events in the middle east have a direct impact on our national interests and on people living on our own country, from concerns about family members in the region to demonstrations on our streets, and from the threats from Iran to the rise of antisemitism. We on the Opposition side of the House are clear that we want to see an end to the conflict in Gaza. We want to see the return of the hostages. The humanitarian support, which is so desperately needed, must get in. There must be an end to the terror inflicted by Hamas and Iran. However, the reality of peace and a sustainable end to the conflict in Gaza seems to be drifting further away.</p>
    <p pid="e598.0/3">What is Britain’s role when it comes to workable outcomes and practical solutions to advance an end to this conflict, and what diplomatic action is being taken with regional allies and the United States? Where is Britain’s voice and action when it comes to putting new pressure on Hamas to agree to the most recent US proposals to secure a ceasefire, and release the hostages who have been in cruel captivity for more than 650 days? As for the statement that the Foreign Secretary signed earlier today, can he explain what an “unconditional and permanent” ceasefire means for Hamas and the Palestinian Authority?</p>
    <p pid="e598.0/4">Last week, I met Keith and Aviva Siegel, and heard about their harrowing experience of being held in brutal captivity by Hamas. I pay tribute to them for their incredible bravery and resilience, and for their dedication to securing the freedom of the remaining hostages, from Gali and Ziv Berman to Matan Angrest and Omri Miran, and all those being held in barbaric captivity. They must be returned to their loved ones. The hostages are being denied humanitarian access by Hamas. What are the Government doing about that, and when was the Foreign Secretary’s last intervention on the issue?</p>
    <p pid="e598.0/5">The situation relating to aid for Gaza has deteriorated beyond all rational comprehension. The daily reports of casualties seeking aid are appalling, and we utterly condemn these attacks. But our words and political statements of condemnation are not saving lives, so what practical solutions, proposals and options have the Foreign Secretary and the British Government discussed with Israel in respect of aid supplies into Gaza? What dialogue is there to find agreement on the opening of access for that aid that goes beyond the current dangerous approach? I remind the House that the last Conservative Government, through Lord Cameron, secured new aid routes and better aid access to save lives. Surely the desperate urgency of the situation, which we all see, calls for such options to be considered once again.</p>
    <p pid="e598.0/6">I reiterate our long-standing position that settlements are not helpful to achieving long-term peace. Israel should not take steps that could make a two-state solution more difficult, and must use its legal system to clamp down on settler violence. We want a two-state solution that guarantees security and stability for both Israelis and Palestinians, and I am sure the Foreign Secretary agrees that it should come only at a time that is conducive to peace and cannot be the start of a peace process—certainly not while Israeli hostages are still in  captivity in Gaza. Does he agree that there needs to be a clear plan and international measures to see the exit of Hamas from Gaza?</p>
    <p pid="e598.0/7">As for Syria, the barbaric violence that we have witnessed in recent days cannot continue. All groups and minorities in Syria must be protected. The Foreign Secretary mentioned his recent discussions with the transitional Syrian leadership. Did he convey to those in charge that they have a responsibility to end the armed conflict in their country and guarantee the protection of all minority groups in Syria, before the international community removes sanctions and normalises diplomatic relationships? What assurances has he received from the transitional Government, and have those commitments been met in any way with measurable action? Will he update the House on whether any of the £64.5 million dedicated to Syria that was announced by the Government earlier this month will be used to deal with the aftermath of these latest clashes, and on how it will be spent? Does he deem sufficient action to have been taken by the interim Government on the destruction of chemical weapons? Does he believe that the Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham Government are capable of securing Syria’s borders, and does he intend to change the proscribed status of HTS? What is his assessment of the effect of the sanctions that have already been lifted? Have they had any unintended side effects? Syria’s future still hangs in the balance, and we need to be wholly evidence-led in our approach.</p>
    <p pid="e598.0/8">The Foreign Secretary did not mention Iran, but we understand from reports that Iran, Britain, France and Germany are due to hold nuclear talks in Istanbul on Friday. What is the purpose of those talks, is he co-ordinating actions with the United States, and what is the content of the deal that he wants to see?</p>

    <p pid="e599.0/1">I am grateful to the shadow Foreign Secretary for the tone of her remarks, and I am grateful for the cross-party consensus in the House that this war must come to an end. I note the huge concern that we all feel, not just in the House but in the international community, about the humanitarian suffering that we continue to see.</p>
    <p pid="e599.0/2">The right hon. Lady asked what more could be done and prayed in aid the work of the former Foreign Secretary, Lord Cameron. She will recognise that Lord Cameron and, before him, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25376" name="James Cleverly">the right hon. Member for Braintree (Sir James Cleverly)</phrase> raised the humanitarian situation with the Israelis. It has become steadily worse. The number of aid points is now down to four, and, while the new foundation is offering aid, people are dying as they scramble for that aid. I note that the right hon. Lady did not say we should return to the 400 aid points that we had in the past, and she will note that her Government did not refund funding to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, but we believe that the UN and its system are best placed to deliver aid to Gaza, and that is the position that we continue to maintain.</p>
    <p pid="e599.0/3">Against that backdrop, the right hon. Lady asked what we were doing on a multilateral basis and what we were doing in working with others to bring this to an end. I ask her to read the statement that has landed, which 31 countries have now signed up to. Of course we are pressing and working with colleagues. I spoke to Minister Sa’ar once again today, urging him to do the right thing—to secure a ceasefire, but also to look at the aid system that is not working.</p>
    <p pid="e599.0/4">As for governance, the right hon. Lady will know that in a couple of weeks’ time we will participate in the two-state conference that has been organised by France, and she will also know that that conference is now dedicated to looking closely at the governance arrangements that must be put in place. When Hamas leave—and they must go; they cannot govern Gaza—how do we ensure that it is not a 60-day pause, but that we bring an end to this and move to the two-state solution? The right hon. Lady knows our commitment to recognition, as set out in our manifesto, and the conversation about recognition that is going on internationally.</p>
    <p pid="e599.0/5">The right hon. Lady rightly pressed the case on Syria. When I met al-Sharaa, I made it absolutely clear that his Government had to be inclusive. I pressed him on his background as a terrorist, and on our concerns—the concerns that exist in this Chamber—but we must work with him to ensure that the Government are inclusive, and to ensure that security is fundamental. As the right hon. Lady will understand, there is much that we need to do to support them on counter-terrorism at this time, and, in a country where 90% of people are living in poverty, to ensure that people receive the aid and support that they need—and, indeed, that that aid and support go to the areas affected by the murders we have seen over the last few days.</p>

    <p pid="e600.1/1">Earlier today, 31 countries put out a powerful message: the war must end now, aid must go into Gaza unrestricted, the hostages must be released, and all parties must uphold international law. That powerful message was sent to Israel, and by return it was rejected. It was denounced by Israel as being “disconnected from reality”. So what now? In that statement, the 31 nations said:</p>
    <p pid="e600.1/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“We are prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire and a political pathway to security and peace for Israelis, Palestinians and the entire region.”</p>

    <p pid="e600.2/1">My right hon. Friend is right to call into question so quickly the Israeli Government’s rejection of the advice of their friends and 31 countries, which have come together to express their horror at people losing their lives when simply reaching out to get aid and humanitarian care. She referred to the debate about recognition. We will be working with our French colleagues, who are focusing the upcoming conference on how we get to two states; as she would expect, the UK will play its part. On the broader issues, I hope and pray that we get a ceasefire, and of course that will lead to further activity as we head towards the UN General Assembly.</p>

    <p pid="e600.4/1">I thank the Foreign Secretary for advance sight of his statement. I welcome his commitment to a diplomatic resolution in Syria, and to holding the Governments of Syria and Israel accountable for protecting all civilians, especially minorities.</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/2">The Foreign Secretary is right to say that the situation in Gaza is inhumane and grotesque and that a ceasefire is desperately needed. I welcome the aid allocations that he has announced, but the problem is that the situation is not new and that repeated expressions of regret by this Government have not prevented further carnage from being wrought by the Netanyahu Government.</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/3">The whole House saw the passion with which the right hon. Gentleman announced the British, French and Canadian joint position on <phrase class="date" code="">20 May</phrase>, and with which the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26446" name="Hamish Falconer">the hon. Member for Lincoln (Mr Falconer)</phrase>, sanctioned Ministers Smotrich and Ben-Gvir on <phrase class="date" code="">10 June</phrase>. In those statements, Ministers said that “we cannot stand by” and that they would respond</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/4" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“not just with words but with action.”—[Official Report, <phrase class="date" code="">10 June 2025</phrase>; Vol. 768, c. 913.]</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/5">I think they meant it, and yet two months later, the Secretary of State has only words, not action. Once again, his joint statement with other countries says only that</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/6" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“We are prepared to take further action”,</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/7">and yet children queuing for food or water are still being killed every single day as the Israeli Cabinet maintains its grotesque blockade of humanitarian aid. It now proposes an open-air prison for all Gazans, which, according to Ehud Olmert, would amount to “ethnic cleansing”.</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/8">Today, I spoke to the Oxfordshire doctors Nick Maynard and Nada Al-Hadithy from Nasser hospital in Gaza. They described the desperation of civilians facing the latest Israeli attack, on Deir al-Balah, and the deaths of patients for want of basic dressings, and said that IDF snipers fired directly into the hospital compound. Yet settlers in the west bank continue illegally to occupy Palestinian homes and land, and the remaining hostages, who have been held in Gaza for over 650 days at the hands of Hamas terrorists, are no closer to release.</p>
    <p pid="e600.4/9">I have written to the Foreign Secretary frequently to set out the many more steps that Liberal Democrats believe he should take, so I will simply ask him this. Does he truly believe that his Government are doing all they can to put an end to the terrible violence and starvation being visited on Gaza in clear contravention of international law? Can he explain why there have been so few consequences since he and the Under-Secretary of State spoke so powerfully in the last two months? And can he dispel the widespread view that he is not setting the policy he would choose, but that he is instead being reined in by No. 10’s desire not to upset President Trump by acting more boldly?</p>

    <p pid="e601.0/1">I associate myself with much that the hon. Gentleman said. It is a source of great regret to me that we have not brought this most horrendous of wars and conflicts to an end. My right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11656" name="Emily Thornberry">the Member for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry)</phrase>, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, referred to the Israeli Government’s response to the statement signed by 31 countries, which I had not heard because I have been sat in this Chamber. That ignoring of the international community is tarnishing greatly the reputation of Israel.</p>
    <p pid="e601.0/2">I listed in my statement the action that this Government have taken in the last year, since coming into office. The hon. Gentleman knows that this Government have led much of the multilateral effort, and that sits behind both the leaders’ statement a few weeks ago and the Foreign Secretaries’ statement today. We will continue to press. We continue, of course, to look at what further we may need to do, as he would expect. I wish I could say that if we were to recognise tomorrow, it would bring this war to an end, but I am afraid I am not sure that is the case. What is required now is painstaking diplomacy to get to a ceasefire, and my assessment is that we will not see that ceasefire until the Knesset rises.</p>

    <p pid="e602.1/1">Order. Once again, a very large number of hon. Members wish to take part in this discussion. The intention is to try to accommodate everybody, but that will mean Members exercising a degree of self-restraint that was not entirely evident during the previous statement. I leave it to you, but if you want everybody to be called, then please, we need questions, not statements. If I may say so, Foreign Secretary, we also need relatively brief answers.</p>

    <p pid="e602.2/1">The statement we have from the 25 or 31 partners takes us no further forward. It says:</p>
    <p pid="e602.2/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“We are prepared to take further action to support an immediate ceasefire”.</p>
    <p pid="e602.2/3">People want action, not more repetition of, “We call for”, “We demand” and “We urge”. We want action, and this is not action. We have had this so many times before. We have this terrible humanitarian crisis, the forcible transfer of civilians, and starvation by Israel. How can it be that we have a situation in which the IDF are firing at children and systematically going for the head, stomach and testicles for their sport, and in which Rafah has been razed to the ground and this euphemistic “humanitarian city” is being constructed, which the former Prime Minister of Israel has called a “concentration camp”? When are we going to take the appropriate action to bring about a comprehensive trade and arms embargo and concentrate the mind of Israel? Nothing else is working. They are not listening, and they are getting away with murder every single day.</p>

    <p pid="e602.6/1">Of course we all condemn the evil Hamas, but is not Prime Minister Netanyahu the biggest recruiting sergeant for Hamas? For every fighter he kills, he is radicalising the whole world against the state of Israel because of this appalling humanitarian solution. I agree with everything the Foreign  Secretary says, but are words enough? I wonder whether he will oblige the House and allow a free vote, which I bet would pass by an enormous majority, on a motion for further action against the extreme right-wing actions of Prime Minister Netanyahu, sanctions, and recognition of the state of Palestine.</p>

He showed us videos that would shock everybody in this House. Does the Foreign Secretary agree that Israel should face a reckoning in the courts for such injuries and deaths, and that the UK should force such a reckoning? More importantly, does he agree that recognising a state of Palestine is really about recognising the humanity of the Palestinian people, and that their children deserve to have equal worth to every child on this planet?</p>

    <p pid="e603.5/1">Each time Members come together for a statement on the middle east, there is a new horror to comment on, a new inhumanity unfolding and a new form of strong words from the Dispatch Box. Last week, IDF shells hit a church sheltering 600 civilians. Several people were killed. The Pope called it “barbarity”. Yesterday, a World Food Programme convoy came under fire from Israeli forces, despite numerous assurances that humanitarian operational conditions would improve. Innocent Palestinians who were queuing for desperately needed food were killed. According to Médecins Sans Frontières, we are witnessing in real time the creation of conditions for the eradication of Palestinian lives in Gaza. So I ask the Foreign Secretary: where is this Government’s red line? At what point does our basic humanity require us to take stronger action? Many of us in this House think the red line was passed a long time ago.</p>

At a time when we have got daily lynchings and expulsions on the west bank, and dozens being murdered as they beg for aid, I am just beyond words at his inaction—and, frankly, complicity by inaction. He said himself that there is a massive prison camp being constructed in the south of Gaza and he knows that leading genocide scholars from across the world are ringing the alarm bells, yet he has the temerity to show up in this House and wave his cheque book as if that is going to salve his conscience. Can he not see that his inaction and, frankly, cowardice are making this country irrelevant? Can he also not see the personal risk to him, given our international obligations—that he may end up at The Hague because of his inaction? Finally, frankly, I make an appeal to Labour Back Benchers: we cannot get your leadership to change their minds; only you can, if you organise and insist on change.</p>

    <p pid="e604.6/1">We have seen again images of children dying of starvation and malnutrition, and this comes after months of warnings from the UN system about the catastrophic humanitarian situation in Gaza. I welcome the Foreign Secretary’s announcement of more aid, but we know that the Gaza Humanitarian Foundation will not allow in more UK aid. He said to me 10 days ago at the Foreign Affairs Committee that if there was not a ceasefire, he would consider further action against Israel. As we have seen, the Israelis responded to the calls for a ceasefire by launching a new offensive in Deir al-Balah. What further actions will we take to try to end this catastrophic situation?</p>

While the occupying Israeli forces are accelerating the building of illegal settlements in the west bank, the scenes in Gaza are horrific, with almost 1,000 people killed by the IDF while just seeking aid. We are seeing starvation being used as a weapon, the forced displacement of Gazans and mass civilian death, and senior Israeli officials are using dehumanising language while proposing to concentrate Gazans into a mass detention camp. So I ask the Foreign Secretary: when will the Government take decisive action, with international partners, to prevent genocide?</p>

    <p pid="e610.1/1">I agree with the right hon. Gentleman that Hamas cannot continue to govern in Gaza, and I suspect that everyone in this Chamber agrees with that. I do believe that there are prospects beyond that. Indeed, the IRA laid down its arms, and that is a template for how to demilitarise and how leaders in this circumstance can perhaps exit Gaza. However, the continued undermining of the Palestinian Authority by the Israeli Government, including the starvation of funds, is an attempt not to get to a two-state solution which all of us in this House want to see.</p>

    <p pid="e610.2/1">We watch as families survey the ruins of their homes and are mocked by illegal settlers in the west bank, and we watch as a little boy looks at his dead relative, waiting for him to take another breath. I watched a mother whose baby had its leg amputated before it even got to take its first step. Where is our humanity? To have a two-state solution, we need two states. Let us recognise Palestine.

Friend, who I know is entirely sincere, that Members—and, indeed, the British people—have heard urgings, demands and outrage in this Chamber, yet the situation only gets worse, with more and more Palestinians dying, each life of incalculable value. In my Adjournment debate in April, I asked what more we could do to help the Palestinian people. When the Minister responded last week, he made some useful clarifications, including that Israeli settlement goods should be labelled so that British people can decide what they are spending their money on.

    <p pid="e613.1/1">The disturbing images from Gaza lead us all to the conclusion that this war must end. However, we must remember that it was started because terrorists raped, burned and murdered people, took captives and still abuse those captives today. The war could finish tomorrow if the terrorists released those captives and agree to a ceasefire. Much has been said today about Israel trying to starve the people of Palestine, but the fact is that since the new arrangements were put in place to stop Hamas stealing aid, 82 million meals have been supplied in Gaza. Instead of talking about a two-state solution and recognising a state that does not exist—and that, if it did exist, would be controlled by terrorists—our Government should be standing by the Israeli Government, who are seeking justice for their own citizens.</p>

    <p pid="e616.2/1">I welcome the Foreign Secretary reiterating this Labour Government’s total opposition to Israel’s military operation, something my constituents raise with me regularly, and our shared abhorrence at the sight of children being shot at as they seek food. The Israeli Defence Minister announced his plan to forcibly transfer all Palestinian civilians in Gaza to a camp in the ruined city of Rafah, which the former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has deemed a concentration camp in all but name. Does the Foreign Secretary agree that that is a completely unacceptable violation of international law that cannot go ignored, and will the Government guarantee further action against Israel if it proceeds with the plan?</p>

    <p pid="e616.4/1">Last week, as a Minister met Yair Golan, shaking hands, smiling and taking photographs, a Palestinian mother faced a dilemma: should she stay where she is and see the starvation of her children, or should she venture out and see the children being blown to pieces, adding to the 17,000 others who have died and the 10 a day whose limbs are blown off? These children do not need these empty words. Words will not stop their bleeding, they will not stop their killing, they will not nourish their bodies and they will not stop the tears of their mothers. I agree with the Secretary of State that even recognising the state of Palestine today would not make any difference to the children on the ground, so will he take a tangible step and propose a British-led, internationally supported hospital in Gaza, in partnership with a coalition of the willing, to provide some remnants of humanity in this darkest of hours?</p>

We were able, working with the UN system, to get some WFP trucks in—an increase over the last few weeks—and our EU colleagues have been doing a considerable amount with the Israeli Government to increase the amount of trucks.

All this time on, and after the statements that the Foreign Secretary has made, can I be clear: is he saying tonight that the   Government accept that there is a plausible risk of genocide? If he is not, will he instruct his officials to undertake an immediate review and report to Members as rapidly as possible? If there is a plausible risk of genocide, that would place legal duties on the Government—and all of us, I believe—to act accordingly. As we have seen in the past when we have had rogue states, like South Africa, the best form of bringing them to heel is financial sanctions. If the Foreign Secretary met the finance houses and banks in this country and they denied credit lines to Israeli banks, that would be probably the most effective thing we could do to bring the Israeli Government to their senses.</p>

    <p pid="e622.4/1">The people of Gaza are being starved to death despite UNRWA having enough supplies to feed the population for three months. It is not a matter of logistics; it is sheer cruelty. GHF ration centres are purposely located in the south in militarised zones with sporadic opening hours and sudden closures, leaving people with no option but to make that long journey on foot and wait many hours on the off-chance that supplies may become available—or they may be killed while trying. This is not just a genocide; it is now ethnic cleansing. When Israel’s Government are ignoring calls from 31 countries, what further action can we take?</p>

    <p pid="e622.5/1">As my hon. Friend has heard, what we are seeing is inhumane, it is deadly and it is depriving Gazans of human dignity. As she would expect, the Government, working with our partners, keep everything under further consideration.</p>

    <p pid="e622.6/1">We see the brutality and bloodshed in Gaza every single night on our screens. It is disproportionate and horrific, and it has gone on for far too long—bombs, bullets and now the blockades. There can never be any justification for shooting people while they wait and queue for aid. I know that the Secretary of State shares my desire for peace, a two-state solution, an immediate ceasefire and the flowing of aid into Gaza. Will he share what he is doing to help achieve that?</p>

Infected Blood Inquiry: Additional Report
</major-heading>
  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2025-07-21e.623.1" speakername="Nick Thomas-Symonds" type="Start Statement" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25279" colnum="623" time="19:44:00" url="">
    <p pid="e623.1/1">The infected blood inquiry’s additional report was published on <phrase class="date" code="">9 July</phrase>, and today I would like to provide the House with an initial response. I am grateful to Sir Brian Langstaff for seeking justice for victims and for the inquiry’s constructive additional report. His ambition was to ensure that fair compensation is provided without delay to every person who is eligible, and that resonates across the country.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/2">Before considering the detail of the report, I want to share the latest delivery figures from the Infected Blood Compensation Authority. As of <phrase class="date" code="">15 July</phrase>, IBCA has contacted 2,215 people to begin their claim, and 1,934 have started the claim process; 808 offers have been made, to a total value of over £602 million; and 587 people have accepted their offer, and over £411 million has been paid in compensation. That means approximately 60% of infected people registered with a support scheme have been contacted to begin their claim.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/3">I am pleased that progress is being made, but I acknowledge the calls from the community for faster payment. That is why the Government wrote to the Public Accounts Committee and the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee last month outlining the steps we are taking to remove administrative barriers to IBCA speeding up payments. I am also pleased to announce further interim payments of £210,000 to the estates of infected people who were registered to an infected blood support scheme and who have sadly passed away. That is in addition to the more than 500 interim payments that have already been paid, on which I will provide further information as soon as I am able to do so.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/4">The Government are committed to providing fair compensation to victims of the infected blood scandal and in the autumn Budget we set aside £11.8 billion to do that. The inquiry has recognised the Government’s commitment, saying:</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/5" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“There can be no doubt that the Government has done right in ways which powerfully signal its intent.”</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/6">However, I agree with Sir Brian’s statement that</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/7" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“there is still more to be done to ensure that the detail and operation of the scheme matches up to its intent.”</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/8">Sir Brian has made a number of recommendations on ways the compensation scheme could be amended to achieve a scheme that works for everyone. We will publish an update on gov.uk today setting out the Government’s approach to the inquiry’s further recommendations. I will deposit a copy of that update in the Libraries of both Houses. We will also provide a comprehensive response to all the recommendations in due course.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/9">The report includes several recommendations for IBCA on speed and transparency. I reiterate that the Government still expect IBCA to contact all registered infected people to begin a claim, and to open the service for affected people, by the end of this year. The announcements I am about to make do not change that position.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/10">On Friday, Sir Robert Francis and David Foley confirmed that they will accept the recommendations that the inquiry made to IBCA. They have committed to working with the community to develop plans for designing   and implementing those recommendations. IBCA will design and introduce a process for registration. It will also update its sequencing in line with the inquiry’s recommendation, noting that that will inform the order in which it opens up to cohorts this year. IBCA will introduce a process for prioritisation, recognising that community involvement is needed in tackling any uncertainty that may be introduced.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/11">Alongside that, I have asked for a review of IBCA’s delivery of the scheme to ensure that it progresses as quickly as possible. That will be supported by the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority and led by an independent reviewer. I expect the review to begin in August.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/12">The inquiry has made recommendations across nine key areas to ensure that infected and affected people feel that they have overall been compensated fairly by a scheme that is designed and delivered with their input. Separate to the delivery of compensation by IBCA, the inquiry has made recommendations relating to the design and structure of the scheme. The Government will accept, and implement as soon as we can, seven of those sub-recommendations, so that IBCA can get on with paying compensation. Others will require engagement with the community before changes are made, in line with the spirit of the inquiry’s report.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/13">When I gave evidence to the inquiry in May, I said that I would take a constructive approach and look at the issues that had been put to me. The inquiry has made eight sub-recommendations in those areas, and I am pleased to confirm to the House that I will either accept them or agree with the inquiry that the community should be consulted on next steps. I can confirm that we will remove the 1982 start date for HIV infection to ensure that anyone infected because of infected blood or infected blood products with HIV is eligible for the scheme regardless of the infection date.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/14">We accept the inquiry’s recommendation on affected estates; in fact, I will go further than the recommendation. The inquiry recommended that if an eligible affected person has sadly died or dies between <phrase class="date" code="">21 May 2024</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2029</phrase>, their claim does not die with them but becomes part of the estate. I will extend that by a further two years until <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2031</phrase>.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/15">The special category mechanism has been a concern for members of the community and for this House. Again, I promised the House that I would consider it, and I am pleased to say that we accept that change is needed to acknowledge the special category mechanism as part of the supplementary route severe health condition award. We will engage with the community on how best to realise those changes.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/16">Another area that I committed to considering was the reinstatement of support payments to partners bereaved after <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2025</phrase> until they have received compensation. Again, I accept that recommendation. I will ensure that those impacted will also be able to continue receiving those payments as part of their compensation package.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/17">Unethical research is one of the most shocking aspects of this scandal. I can also confirm to the House that we will consult on revising the approach for the additional autonomy award on unethical research, including the scope and value of the award. A number of hon. Members have raised that with me.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/18">The final area that I said I would consider was whether further supplementary routes for affected people could be introduced. The inquiry recommended that we consult to understand the feasibility of their implementation, alongside changes in the exceptional financial loss award. I agree with the inquiry that consideration should be given to those issues, and consideration rightly involves those impacted.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/19">In addition, we are accepting further inquiry recommendations to remove the requirement for evidence of the date of diagnosis for hepatitis B or C, which we hope may allow claims for those mono-infected with hepatitis to be processed more quickly. By accepting those recommendations, we can start to implement the necessary changes as soon as possible.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/20">There are several recommendations on areas in which changes to the scheme are needed. We intend to engage with the community on how best to achieve them. The inquiry is clear: people impacted by decisions need to be involved in them, and that is what we will seek to do before implementing the changes in the scheme. That includes acting on recommendations regarding compensation for the impacts of Interferon. We will introduce a new core route infection severity band for those who received Interferon treatment, and consult on the evidence requirements and threshold for a supplementary route award for severe psychological harm. Additionally, we will work with IBCA to introduce a mechanism that individuals can use to raise concerns to aid continuous improvement of the scheme.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/21">As I am sure hon. Members understand, to do that the Government will need to make further regulations. Our top priority is to move quickly, so to make some of the simpler changes, we will bring forward a set of regulations as soon as parliamentary time allows. Those regulations will not implement all the policy changes recommended by the inquiry. In evidence to the inquiry in May, I said that I was open to changes that do not lead to further delays. I believe that making these changes recommended by the inquiry will not delay the speed at which offers are currently being made.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/22">A further set of regulations will be needed to implement the more substantial changes, particularly those for which we are taking time to engage the community on how those updates can be realised. I therefore expect this second, more substantial set of regulations to be brought before Parliament in 2026, but—and I really emphasise this to hon. Members—we do not expect this engagement to cause delays to the roll-out of the compensation scheme as it currently stands, which is absolutely crucial, as I said to the inquiry. We are responding swiftly and constructively to Sir Brian, and putting the voices and needs of the community first.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/23">I will also provide a further update on the Government’s response to the 2024 report. I have continued to engage with the charities named by the inquiry in recommendation 10. I recognise their concerns about the allocated funding, and can confirm that the Department for Health and Social Care is re-examining funding for this year and will look at options for the future.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/24">With regard to recommendation 2 on memorialisation, I am pleased to announce that, following engagement with the community, Clive Smith has been appointed as chair of the memorial committee. I am delighted to be  able to appoint a chair with his wealth of experience, and I am confident he will be able to bring the community together to make great progress on this work.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/25">The Government have made progress in implementing the recommendations, but progress is never a foregone conclusion. Sir Brian is clear about the importance of scrutinising progress in delivering what the Government have committed to, and I agree. I am pleased to confirm that I have asked the Public Administration and Constitutional Affairs Committee to take on the role of scrutinising implementation of the inquiry’s recommendations in the May 2024 and July 2025 reports. It is for the Committee to outline how it will approach that work, but I trust that it will see fit to follow the example of the inquiry through scrutiny of the design and delivery of compensation.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/26">In addition, today I am publishing a record of inquiry recommendations and the Government response on gov.uk, as promised in our response to the recommendation of the Grenfell Tower inquiry. Those records will be periodically updated to show implementation progress, and will include all recommendations of future inquiries.</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/27">To conclude, I quote directly from Sir Brian’s report, which he ends by stating:</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/28" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“Truly involving people infected and affected in how the state recognises their losses would start to turn the page on the past.”</p>
    <p pid="e623.1/29">He is absolutely right. Our focus as we move forward must be on working together with the community, with IBCA, and indeed with each other in this House, not only to deliver justice to all those impacted, but, essentially, to restore trust in the state among people who have been let down too many times. I commend this statement to the House.</p>

    <p pid="e626.0/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his statement and for advance sight of it.</p>
    <p pid="e626.0/2">On behalf of His Majesty’s loyal Opposition, I thank Sir Brian Langstaff for his initial work on the inquiry and for all his follow-up work. This additional report, focusing on compensation, is a significant and thorough piece of work that has been done in good time. Our thanks also go to those working at the Infected Blood Compensation Authority to get the money out to those who desperately need it. I know that my right hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25893" name="Richard Holden">the Member for Basildon and Billericay (Mr Holden)</phrase> welcomes the valuable insight that he gained from his recent visit to the team on the ground in Tyneside. Above all, we pay tribute to the victims, the families and the campaigners who have fought relentlessly and bravely on this issue.</p>
    <p pid="e626.0/3">I have previously raised in the House the concerns of victims and their families about the speed and structure of the compensation scheme. They have been repeatedly frustrated by a failure to speed up payments. Although there are signs that the pace is finally starting to increase, I know that their frustrations remain, and we share them. This scandal happened over decades, under successive Governments of different parties, but we all have a responsibility to do what we can to right the wrongs of the past as quickly as possible, and the Opposition will support the Government when they are doing the right thing in doing so.</p>
    <p pid="e626.0/4">I have also raised the issue of engagement and called on the Government to further solidify ongoing consultation and communication with victims and their families. It was disappointing to see that, as Sir Brian laid out in his additional report, sufficient progress has not yet been made on that. I welcome the Government’s response on that matter, but I urge them to ensure that that engagement work is carried out rapidly and urgently. Victims and their families deserve real action and, as the additional report makes clear, they have had far too many assurances but not yet enough substantial engagement.</p>
    <p pid="e626.0/5">I am pleased that the Government are now taking action on some of the issues relating to atypical personal or health impacts and supplementary routes, which I raised when we discussed the infected blood compensation scheme regulations in March. I know that will bring great comfort to many of those who have been infected with the diseases mentioned.</p>
    <p pid="e626.0/6">I appreciate that the Government are taking forward Sir Brian’s recommendation on a grievances mechanism, and I am certain that across this House we all hope that implementation of this recommendation and the others from the report will meet the terms of reference of Sir Brian’s inquiry and will complete the compensation and resolution process. However, the Government must ensure that this mechanism is an active one, not simply a recording device. While it is incredibly important that lessons are continuously learned from this tragedy, it is also really important that those cases that contain difficulties with regard to compensation eligibility—which we know make up a significant proportion—are addressed as a matter of urgency, and that all such cases, many of which will probably come through this new mechanism, are considered carefully, and that all information on the claim status and decisions made on it are communicated clearly and frequently to the complainant.</p>
    <p pid="e626.0/7">Above all, learning those lessons must not come at the cost of delaying payments to those who simply cannot afford to wait any longer. To that end, I would appreciate the Minister’s clarity on the number of personnel whom he expects to be tasked with the grievances mechanism and the oversight structure that will be put in place over it. Will that be the advisory board being established and, if so, what specific oversight powers will the advisory board have?</p>
    <p pid="e626.0/8">We support the Government in taking these measures forward, and we will do what we can as the official Opposition to help these actions be implemented, but it is incredibly important that the Government are clear to this House what measures they are putting in place to ensure that the steps announced here today are carried through and enacted efficiently and effectively. No amount of money can undo the harm that was tragically inflicted on so many, but a comprehensive and effective compensation scheme can offer a lifeline to victims and their families who have suffered far too much for far too long.</p>

    <p pid="e627.0/1">I thank the shadow Minister for his contribution and, in particular, for its tone. The cross-party way in which this has been approached has been crucial—I took that approach in opposition. I pay tribute to my predecessor as Paymaster General, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/24839" name="John Glen">the right hon. Member for Salisbury (John Glen)</phrase>, for the work he did in driving this forward. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that this additional report is a very significant piece of work, and I echo his thanks to IBCA’s staff.</p>
    <p pid="e627.0/2">On the speed of payments, the hon. Gentleman referred to the number of payments and of course IBCA has used the “test and learn” approach, but I want to tell the House that I have announced today a substantial number of changes to this scheme, but it has to be on the basis that that will not affect the current speed of roll-out of payments. That is why I still expect IBCA to contact all registered infected people to begin a claim before the end of the year, and indeed to open the service to affected people by the end of the year.</p>
    <p pid="e627.0/3">I also agree with the hon. Gentleman about the need for an active consultation mechanism, and I entirely agree about clarity of communication. I very much hope that we can continue this cross-party spirit into the delivery phase as that is so important.</p>

    <p pid="e628.0/1">Victims, survivors and campaigners have been fighting for decades for truth and justice due to cover-ups by public servants. Last year, the Prime Minister called for a duty of candour law to prevent future cover-ups, such as the infected blood and Post Office scandals, and I could not agree more. But if we are to restore trust in the state, does the Minister agree that it is high time for a Hillsborough law to be implemented in full, as promised by the Prime Minister last September?</p>

    <p pid="e628.1/1">I entirely agree on the need for a Hillsborough law, and I say to my hon. Friend that this Government are absolutely determined to get it right and to lead that culture of change that we need across public service so that people are not putting their own reputations or the reputation of institutions above public service. We are determined to lead that change.</p>

    <p pid="e628.3/1">I thank the Minister for his statement. We, too, pay tribute to Sir Brian Langstaff and his team for their ongoing work as they continue to investigate this appalling scandal.</p>
    <p pid="e628.3/2">Liberal Democrats know that the victims of the infected blood scandal deserve compensation. They and their families have been mistreated and have been waiting for decades to see justice. We welcomed the establishment of this scheme in August 2024 and the commitment shown by Governments from both sides of the House to justice for these victims.</p>
    <p pid="e628.3/3">However, Sir Brian Langstaff’s additional report has been excoriating about the glacial pace of payments and the abject failure to listen to victims. One of the report’s most scathing findings stated that victims of the scandal had “not been listened to”. As Sir Brian has reported, the experts who were responsible for the design of the compensation scheme were forbidden to talk with victims and their families. After so many years of secrecy, deceit and delays, excluding victims and their families was wholly unacceptable.</p>
    <p pid="e628.3/4">This report has been welcomed by many victims, including many of the 122 haemophiliac boys who attended the Lord Mayor Treloar college in Hampshire. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26325" name="Liz Jarvis">the Member for Eastleigh (Liz Jarvis)</phrase> has been a powerful advocate for these victims, and I thank her for her work advocating for constituents such as Gary, who welcomed the findings of this report. That  is why we are urging the Government to set out clearly and in detail the timelines for delivering compensation. We are calling on the Government to engage properly with victims and their families. Does the Minister agree that it is entirely unacceptable that victims were not involved in the original design of the scheme and that they had been consistently ignored? When can victims of the scandal expect the implementation of Sir Brian Langstaff’s recommendation to introduce a formal advisory body of victims for the Infected Blood Compensation Authority?</p>

    <p pid="e629.0/1">In relation to transparency on the expert group established under my predecessor, I entirely acknowledge Sir Brian Langstaff’s criticisms and points on that. The Government are now going to have to create new sets of regulations, and clearly I will have to reconstitute an expert group, but I give the House an undertaking that transparency will be at the heart of that group, including publication of its work and its minutes, because that is essential to regain trust.</p>
    <p pid="e629.0/2">The hon. Lady is also absolutely right about how essential it is to put the voice of victims at the heart of what we are doing, but I would also say to the House, in relation to today, that at the autumn Budget last year the Chancellor set aside £11.8 billion of funding to the end of the Parliament to pay compensation for victims, and the policy decisions that I am announcing today are currently estimated to cost around £1 billion in further compensation payments. The total cost depends on what is agreed following consultation with the community, but the Government have said—and we will stand by this—that we will pay what it takes to fund the scheme, and we will update the forecast costs at the autumn Budget of 2025. But victims should be in no doubt of the Government’s determination to seek justice.</p>

I am pleased to have appointed Clive Smith—that has already been done—and I am asking him to progress that memorialisation work, first, quickly, because the right hon. Gentleman is right about the passage of time, and secondly, in a way that brings the whole community together.

A Hillsborough law would end the culture of cover-up, which is why victims and families, including those from the infected blood scandal, fully support it. The Prime Minister promised that one of his first acts would be to introduce that legislation, but one year on we are still waiting. Does the Minister recognise the importance of fulfilling that pledge before Labour returns to Liverpool for the party conference in September?</p>

Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25803" name="Kim Johnson">the Member for Liverpool Riverside (Kim Johnson)</phrase>. Sir Brian Langstaff talked about the “pervasive” culture—the concept of people putting their own or institutional reputation above the public interest. The Government are determined to change that and to get the duty of candour right by working with the families, which I think is absolutely crucial.</p>

    <p pid="e630.3/1">As co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on HIV, AIDS and sexual health, I very much welcome the removal of the 1982 start date. Coincidentally, today is Zero HIV Stigma Day, so it is important to recognise the stigma that many people suffered as a result of contracting HIV through infected blood. I hope that one of the supplementary routes to compensation might be to those who suffered extreme stigma and discrimination, or severe psychiatric consequences from the contraction of HIV.</p>

    <p pid="e630.4/1">I thank the right hon. Gentleman for his comments about the removal of the 1982 date. I promised in my evidence to the inquiry to look at that, so I am pleased to remove it. He is absolutely right about stigma; I visited the Terrence Higgins Trust in recent weeks, and listening to the terrible stigma that people suffered is extraordinarily moving. He is right to remind us of that, and as we move forward with trying to deliver justice, we should all keep that at the forefront of our minds.</p>

    <p pid="e631.0/1">On behalf of the APPG on haemophilia and contaminated blood, I welcome my right hon. Friend’s statement. It is a major step forward. As he knows, the issue of engagement with the affected and infected community has been a major bone of contention since the expert group set the tariff. For over 40 years, that community have been ignored and lied to by the state, which should have been on their side. When Sir Brian Langstaff published his recent report, he said:</p>
    <p pid="e631.0/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“For decades people who suffered because of infected blood have not been listened to. Once again decisions have been made behind closed doors leading to obvious injustices.”</p>
    <p pid="e631.0/3">My right hon. Friend said that he will accept most of the recommendations, but if he is going to consult, he must consult with the community. Will he guarantee that he will set up a proper mechanism that will be approved by the community, and that he will provide financial support to those organisations that are giving advice to victims who are making claims?</p>

    <p pid="e631.1/1">First, on consultation, my hon. Friend is right. I am determined that we are going to get this right. Secondly, as I indicated in my statement with regard to the organisations and recommendation 10 of Sir Brian Langstaff’s May 2024 report, DHSC is looking not only at this year again, but to the future. My work in recent weeks speaking to charities has made it clear that they want to look beyond this financial year, and I agree.</p>

    <p pid="e631.2/1">I, too, thank the Minister for his statement, in particular the fact that IBCA will design and introduce a process for registration.

Can the Minister confirm whether that includes interim payments for unregistered victims, which was another recommendation in Sir Brian Langstaff’s additional report?</p>

    <p pid="e631.4/1">The very fact that Sir Brian Langstaff reopened the scheme for the additional report bears testimony to the fact that there is something sadly wrong with the initial scheme. I am wondering whether the infected blood victims will be warmly welcoming my right hon. Friend’s statement, or whether they will be a bit apprehensive, frustrated or disappointed because the Government have said that they will accept, at this point, only seven of the nine recommendations. Only 460 victims have settled to date, but many others have sadly passed on. Can my right hon. Friend clarify what will happen to those waiting to start their claim? They are the Tuesday night lottery club—they have been waiting for months for a phone call to tell them that they will get an invitation to apply   for compensation. Will new invites be put on hold while IBCA revisits the settled claims? Is it still a priority to start all living infected claims by the end of the year?</p>

    <p pid="e632.0/1">The answer is yes, absolutely. I would not have made such a substantial number of changes without assurance that it would not delay the ongoing payments. IBCA has said that there will be offers to all the living registered infected by the end of the year. That is unchanged by the changes I have made to the scheme today. The promise that we made to start the affected by the end of the year also stands. As I said a moment ago, IBCA has accepted the recommendation about registration. It has also accepted Sir Brian Langstaff’s recommendation about cohort prioritisation and is looking at that. I hope that my hon. Friend, who is a powerful advocate on these matters, will see that having said at the inquiry that I would look constructively at these issues, that is precisely what I have done. On the recommendations where we are consulting, that is precisely because I want the voice of the community to be heard.</p>

Very large sums of money will be paid in compensation, so can the Minister outline what provision there will be for the recipients to receive financial advice to make sure that they are not taken advantage of by unscrupulous people—for example, people trying to tell them how to make a claim that they can make directly?</p>

Brendan has just received an invitation to start the process for compensation, which I welcome, but how long can he expect that process to take?

There is absolutely no deliberate delay from the Government in terms of the money being paid.

I spoke on Thursday to the Health Ministers of all three of the devolved Administrations, including Minister Nesbitt in the Northern Ireland Executive. The hon.

That has been done to make sure that we can keep up the pace of payments at IBCA, but I give him the reassurance, which I gave to the Health Ministers, that that will be funded by the UK Government.

Will the Minister reconsider the rejection of the recommendation by Sir Robert Francis of an enhanced award for people with extrahepatic disorders resulting in long-term severe disability, including people currently included in the special category mechanism and its equivalents in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland?

    <p pid="e636.2/1">I beg to move,</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/2" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">That this House has considered the 80th anniversary of Victory over Japan.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/3">It is an honour to open today’s debate as we come together as a House and as a country to mark 80 years since victory over Japan, which brought an end to fighting in the far east. The anniversary will be commemorated on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase>. On <phrase class="date" code="">15 August 1945</phrase>, King George VI delivered a speech to the nation and the Commonwealth, saying,</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/4" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“now we shall have to work hard to restore what has been lost, and to establish peace on the unshakable foundations”.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/5">Eighty years on, we remember the British, Northern Irish and Commonwealth veterans—the second world war generation who gave so much, and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to secure our freedom and peace. To them, we say thank you.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/6">VE Day 1945 marked the end of the second world war in Europe, but thousands of British, Northern Irish and Commonwealth troops continued to battle against Japanese forces in Asia and the Pacific. Three months later, victory over Japan was declared on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase>, following Japan’s agreement to surrender unconditionally to the allies. The Prime Minister of the day, Clement Attlee, gave a radio broadcast to announce the end of hostilities, declaring:</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/7" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“Japan has today surrendered. The last of our enemies is laid low.”</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/8">Eighty years on, this Government recognise the huge importance of commemorating this anniversary. VJ Day is a moment to reflect on the remarkable perseverance and bravery shown by those who fought, or endured, the war in the far east.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/9">The human cost of the second world war was overwhelming. It led to death and destruction for millions of people. The dropping of two atomic bombs on Japanese cities—one on Hiroshima on <phrase class="date" code="">6 August</phrase> and the other three days later on Nagasaki—resulted in enormous devastation, bringing the six-year global conflict to a rapid end and introducing the atomic age. The end of the war brought sadness, relief, and renewed hope that families and soldiers who had long been separated would soon be reunited. However, it would take months and much effort to bring British service personnel back home.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/10">Shortly after VE Day, we saw the liberation of Jersey and Guernsey on <phrase class="date" code="">9 May</phrase>, and Alderney on <phrase class="date" code="">16 May</phrase>. It was a huge honour to visit Jersey and Sark this year for the celebrations of the 80th anniversary of Liberation Day. The story of the islands is one of perseverance, which I was grateful to hear more about when I attended a number of commemoration events there, but the period of time from May 1945 through to VJ Day on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase> was a period of suffering. Tens of thousands of service personnel from Great Britain, Northern Ireland and the Commonwealth fought and gave their lives,  including thousands of allied troops who were taken as prisoners of war and forced into hard labour. Many allied prisoners of war in Japanese captivity died before liberation in August 1945. Those individuals experienced unimaginable suffering, including starvation and disease, and their memory and sacrifice must not be forgotten.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/11">Alongside the British armed forces, hundreds of thousands served in the far east from countries including pre-partition India, Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Nepal, and from east and west Africa. The British Pacific fleet worked in parallel with our US allies, making the second world war an international effort.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/12">This year’s commemorations to mark VJ Day have been, and will continue to be, led by those with first-hand experience of the war. We acknowledge the importance of this, as this year is likely to be the last significant anniversary at which veterans who served in the second world war are present. The Government are honoured to be working closely with the Royal British Legion to put veterans front and centre of the VJ Day commemorations. I take this opportunity to thank the partners who have worked with us throughout this commemorative year, including the Royal British Legion, Imperial War Museums, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the National Theatre, Arts Council England, Historic Royal Palaces, the Together Coalition, the Big Lunch, Atlantic Productions, the BBC and the National Lottery Community Fund.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/13">I also thank officials from the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and from the Ministry of Defence. Of course, we have been working across Government, and in particular with the Ministry of Defence. I am joined by the Minister for the Armed Forces, and I have worked closely with my noble Friend Lord Coaker, who is with us this evening.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/14">As living history fades into the past, it is more important than ever that we listen to the stories of the remaining veterans who fought for their country in that conflict. The diverse armies that fought together for our freedom reflect the very fabric of modern Britain. The national commemorations will commence with a Government reception to celebrate and commemorate VJ Day with veterans. On <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 15 August</phrase>, the Royal British Legion will lead the nation in honouring and remembering those who fought and died during the war in the far east, with a service marking the 80th anniversary of VJ Day. That will take place at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire and will be broadcast live on BBC One from midday. It will pay tribute to British, Northern Irish, Commonwealth and allied veterans who served in the far east theatres of war, the Pacific and Indian Ocean territories.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/15">With veterans in attendance, the VJ service will be a tribute to them, involving 400 members of the armed forces, and the Red Arrows. The event will feature a guard of honour of the Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force. Music will be provided by military bands, and the battle of Britain memorial flight will lead a breathtaking flypast. The national two-minute silence will be held on <phrase class="date" code="">Friday 15 August</phrase> at midday to remember and thank those who fought for our freedom. The silence will be marked by all UK Government Departments, which will also fly the Union flag at full mast.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/16">The Government continue to support and promote a range of initiatives to commemorate the 80th anniversary of the ending of the second world war throughout the year, to Remembrance Sunday and beyond. To mark VJ Day specifically, the Imperial War Museum will screen a short film, “I Saw the World End”, produced by Es Devlin, to commemorate the dropping of the atomic bombs. There is a new augmented reality experience offering a deeper exploration of the second world war in Asia and the Pacific. Children and families will be welcomed to the museum’s sites in London and the north to participate in making paper cranes as a symbol of peace.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/17">We continue to promote a range of educational and cultural activities to help schools and communities to engage with the 80th commemorations designed to mark both VE and VJ Day, including: “Our Shared Story”, a collection of educational resources; “Letters to Loved Ones”, a project encouraging people to share family letters from the war to illustrate what everyday life was like—it was lovely to discover some of my grandparents’ letters from when my grandad, Bobby, who I am very proud of, was serving in the RAF during the war; and “The Next Morning”, a new production written by James Graham that focuses on the hopes, dreams and ambitions of young people after the second world war.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/18">The Government have provided funding to support arts centres, libraries and museums across the country to work with their local communities to develop activities that commemorate and reflect the VE and VJ Day anniversaries. I look forward to visiting one such project in my area, taking place at the Barnsley Civic, to hear more about its work exploring community solidarity in Barnsley from the 1940s to the present day.</p>
    <p pid="e636.2/19">My Department has been working with the Common-wealth War Graves Commission on the “For Evermore Tour”, which is travelling across the UK and global sites including cemeteries in Kenya, Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Japan. The tour will honour and shine a light on stories from those across the world who fought in the second world war, and I was grateful for the opportunity to see the tour at first hand in May. UK landmarks, high commissions in Commonwealth countries and prominent memorials will be lit up in white on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase> as beacons of strength and national unity, as they were 80 years ago.</p>

    <p pid="e638.0/1">We have just been through the centenary of the great war. Does the Minister agree that the difference between 80 years and 100 is that we still have veterans among us? Sadly, when we come to the centenary of the events we are commemorating this year, that will not be the case. Will she therefore make absolutely sure that it is the veterans who are centre stage during this commemoration?</p>

    <p pid="e638.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman makes an incredibly important point. I hope I have outlined this in my contribution, but I reiterate that we want veterans to be front and centre of these commemorations.</p>
    <p pid="e638.1/2">Importantly, commemorative activity is taking place across the UK, with each of the devolved Governments marking VJ Day 80. The Scottish Government will be leading a concert at Edinburgh castle, where I recently visited the national war memorial. In Northern Ireland,  a charity concert will take place in Lurgan, and I was pleased to visit the area a few months ago when I was invited by <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25562" name="Carla Lockhart">the hon. Member for Upper Bann (Carla Lockhart)</phrase>. I recently visited Cathays cemetery in Cardiff to see the work it carries out to honour the Commonwealth war graves. National wreath-laying at the Wales national war memorial will lead a programme in Wales centred on peace and reconciliation.</p>
    <p pid="e638.1/3">Those are just some of the events taking place across our devolved nations, and together they reflect a shared commitment to remembrance and recognition across the UK. More than 144 commemorations are taking place across the nation throughout August to mark VJ Day, from those that I have already mentioned to services in Lichfield and Norwich cathedrals, which the public are encouraged to join. We commemorate the end of the second world war throughout the year, and not only on VE Day on <phrase class="date" code="">8 May</phrase> or VJ day on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase>; troops returned home gradually throughout the year until Alderney’s Homecoming Day on <phrase class="date" code="">15 December</phrase>.</p>
    <p pid="e638.1/4">The strength and courage of those who fought are truly unmatched, and the horror that they suffered as prisoners of war in the far east is unimaginable. Strength is what we remember about VJ veterans: their unshakable resilience, determination, service and sacrifice in unimaginable circumstances, and the way in which they came together to support one another long after the war had ended. I am sure that I speak for Members on both sides of the House in expressing our deep gratitude to our great second world war generation. We come together in the House in a moment of unity today to mark 80 years since victory over Japan, in awe of those who gave more than many of us will ever have to give.</p>

    <p pid="e639.2/1">I thank the Minister for her speech, and for all the events that she announced: we will, of course, support the Government’s agenda in celebrating VJ Day. It is a privilege to respond to the Minister on behalf of His Majesty’s loyal Opposition.</p>
    <p pid="e639.2/2">The 80th anniversary of the end of the second world war is undoubtedly a cause for huge celebration. In May, the whole nation came together to celebrate the end of the war in Europe on VE Day. It was a special day with celebrations across the country, including many in my constituency. When we watched the national celebrations on television as a family, my two young boys took a particular liking to the Red Arrows flying over Buckingham Palace. I hope that in time they will begin to understand properly why we celebrate that important day and what it means, for it symbolises the victory of good over evil after nearly six years of unimaginable suffering, when a whole nation—young and old, male and female, rich and poor—came together to fight Nazi Germany, defeat fascism and liberate Europe, 80 years ago.</p>
    <p pid="e639.2/3">As the nation, 80 years ago, danced into the night celebrating the end of fighting close to home, thousands of British and Commonwealth soldiers were locked in a struggle against imperial Japan. It took until <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase>, after the United States had dropped nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, for the fighting to end in the far east. The campaign that began in 1941, starting with a surprise Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour, was vast: fighting took place from Hawaii to the north-east borders of India, and from Papua New Guinea in the south to Manchuria in northern China on the border of the Soviet Union. By 1945, across Asia and the Pacific, 365,000 British and 1.5 million Commonwealth troops were deployed, including the largest volunteer army in history, the pre-partition Indian Army of 2.5 million soldiers.</p>
    <p pid="e639.2/4">Despite the scope of that campaign, those brave soldiers, who frequently fought in horrific conditions against a formidable enemy, are often known as the forgotten Army to acknowledge the lack of reporting of the campaign in the mainstream media at the time; yet stories of heroic actions remain. Just last night, as I discussed the campaign in the far east with my parents, my mum told me about one of her uncles who had been a prisoner of war in that conflict in the far east. Then there are my two Westminster staff members who told me proudly about their great-grandfather and their great-uncle, both of whom earned the Burma Star.</p>
    <p pid="e639.2/5">Field Marshal Slim’s 14th Army was thought to be the most diverse in the world. More than 40 languages were spoken by troops, who were united in one ambition—to stand up and defend civilisation from barbarism and tyranny. Many people associate the fall of France in 1940 as Britain’s low point in the war, but the crushing surrender of Malaya and Singapore were at least as devastating: 9,000 British, pre-partition Indian and Commonwealth troops were lost, and about 130,000 were taken as prisoners of war. The famous films “The Bridge on the River Kwai” and the more recent “The Railway Man” show the brutal conditions faced by those taken prisoner, and serve as a stark reminder of the reason we had to stand up and defeat imperial Japan.</p>

    <p pid="e640.0/1">May I say how important it is that both Front Benchers have emphasised the atrocities that were committed against prisoners of war? Just as we remember the Nuremberg trials, we remember the Tokyo trials, at which many war criminals were convicted and subsequently executed. Is it not a measure of the importance of unconditional surrender that that at least removed the aura of divinity from the Emperor so that the fanaticism of religion was excised from Japanese society?</p>

    <p pid="e640.1/1">My right hon. Friend said that so eloquently, and he is clearly a very learned individual. I could not agree with him more.</p>
    <p pid="e640.1/2">Although we are all regularly reminded of the heroic invasion of Normandy, a 2013 poll of the British public by the National Army Museum in Chelsea ranks the battles of Kohima and Imphal as Britain’s greatest ever battles. As we commemorate the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, I hope we will reflect on some of the lessons of the second world war. I am proud to remind the House that soldiers from all over the Commonwealth—from  Australia, New Zealand, Canada, India, South Africa and many other countries—fought alongside British troops.</p>

    <p pid="e641.0/1">I commend the hon. Gentleman for what he is putting forward. He is right to say that some 40 languages were spoken among the 14th Army, which gives us an idea of its diversity. He mentioned the battles of Kohima and Imphal, which were the greatest defeats the Japanese army ever suffered. Does he agree that what we saw on VJ Day, which we are commemorating today, was one of the greatest armies in the world engaging in one of the greatest battles and defeating the Japanese? Even though atomic bombs were a part of that, the armies and soldiers on the ground made the difference.</p>

    <p pid="e641.1/1">It is always a great privilege to be intervened on by the hon. Gentleman, and I could not agree with him more. I thank him for his intervention.</p>
    <p pid="e641.1/2">In the far east in particular, there were troops from all different faiths: Christians, Muslims, Sikhs, Jews, Buddhists and many others all fought as one to defeat Japan. I have learned that my wife’s grandfather received the Indian Distinguished Service Medal as part of the 7th Battalion of the 16th Punjab Regiment. While moving through the Burmese coastline, he was suddenly surrounded by Japanese soldiers.</p>
    <p pid="e641.1/3">My wife’s grandfather was Lance Corporal Samundar Khan. His platoon was ordered to attack uphill so that the lead platoon could retreat. Carrying a Bren gun, Lance Corporal Khan led his men up the steep slope as heavy Japanese grenades rained down on them. With the gun at his hip, and despite being seriously wounded in the chest, he led the charge and drove the Japanese from the top. Khan, who was 18 and who lied about his age so that he could enlist to fight and to defend our nation, was wounded three times in two months. Khan’s story of bravery and heroism, though special, was not unique. To all those who fought against tyranny and defended democracy so that we can stand here today in the mother of all Parliaments, I say thank you.</p>
    <p pid="e641.1/4">As we look at the increased instability in the world, we should remember those brave soldiers who fought for our liberty and our freedom, and for the principles and freedoms that were underpinned in the Atlantic charter: freedom of speech and expression, freedom of worship, freedom from want and freedom from fear. They all matter today, as they did then. Those principles set a new world order. Although there are those who seek to divide us and who try to prey on our differences, we must draw inspiration from the heroes who sacrificed everything and who gave their lives for a better world. They rejected populism, they rejected tyranny, and they rejected the politics of hate.</p>
    <p pid="e641.1/5">Those who fought and died in the second world war truly were our greatest generation. I urge the Minister, on top of everything else the Government are doing, to encourage her colleagues in the Department for Education to ensure that the stories and lessons from the war, including the struggle against Japan, are never forgotten. I also ask that the Government build on the deep-rooted relationships with our allies who stood with us, so that we can stand up to those who would divide us today.</p>
    <p pid="e641.1/6">As we reflect on the war’s conclusion, I look forward to colleagues’ contributions. We must remind ourselves that our right to be here and to represent our constituents is possible only because of the brave men and women from across the world who laid down their lives for this country. Once again, I say thank you.</p>

    <p pid="e642.1/1">Eighty years ago, the guns finally fell silent across the Asia-Pacific, imperial Japan surrendered, and the most devastating conflict in human history came to an end. Today we remember not just the victory, but the immense courage and sacrifice that made it possible.</p>
    <p pid="e642.1/2">Just two months ago, I stood in this House to mark the 80th anniversary of Victory in Europe Day. Across my Slough constituency, communities of different backgrounds came together to reflect on that milestone. However, while Europe celebrated peace in May 1945, the war raged on in the east. Hundreds of thousands of British troops remained in combat across Asia and the Pacific, alongside millions of Commonwealth soldiers—the largest volunteer Army in history—who bore the burden of war with extraordinary resolve. Their service reminds us that victory was never the triumph of one nation alone.</p>

    <p pid="e642.3/1">I thank my hon. Friend and Berkshire colleague for that intervention, and he is so right in what he says. We must remember them.</p>
    <p pid="e642.3/2">As we mark this solemn anniversary, we must shine a light on those whose sacrifices have too often been overlooked. Their names may not appear in our history books, but their courage shaped the world we live in. At the time of my VE Day contributions to the House in May, it was my understanding that only two British-based veterans who served in the pre-partition Indian Army were still with us. It is with deep regret that I inform the House today that both veterans have, sadly, since passed away.</p>
    <p pid="e642.3/3">I would like to pay tribute to Havildar Major Rajindar Singh Dhatt MBE and Daffadar Muhammad Hussain, who was a local Slough resident. These two formidable Commonwealth ex-servicemen, whom I had the honour and privilege of meeting on several occasions, served with distinction and dedicated their lives to preserving the legacy of those who served. I am sure the House will join me in sending condolences to their family and friends. Their stories are a powerful reminder of the global nature of this conflict and the enduring bonds of service.</p>
    <p pid="e642.3/4">As a proud Sikh, I carry this legacy personally. My great-grandfather lost a leg fighting in the first world war and my grandmother’s brother and other family members served in the second world war. As I discussed  with my staff members Isabella Elie and Lewis Rantell, their stories are echoed in families across Britain and the Commonwealth. One such story is that of Patrick McAnulty, one of the thousands of British and allied prisoners of war who endured unimaginable suffering in captivity. Subjected to forced labour, starvation and brutal treatment, many POWs did not survive. Those who did carried the physical and emotional scars for the rest of their lives. Their resilience in the face of such cruelty is testament to the human spirit, and their sacrifice must never be forgotten.</p>
    <p pid="e642.3/5">As we reflect on the past, we must also celebrate how far we have come. The United Kingdom and Japan, once wartime enemies, are now very close allies. Today, we stand together in defence of peace and democracy. As the Defence Committee noted in its report on the global combat air programme, that partnership is a cutting-edge collaboration between the UK, Japan and Italy to develop the next generation of fighter jets. It is a powerful symbol of reconciliation and shared purpose.</p>
    <p pid="e642.3/6">As veterans share their stories during this 80th anniversary, we are reminded that remembrance must be more than ceremonial: it must inspire action. The lessons of history are clear, yet conflict persists from Ukraine to Gaza, Sudan, the Congo and more. These are not distant tragedies; they are urgent reminders of the fragility of peace. In my role as Chair of the Defence Committee, I am regularly reminded of the vital role that our current brave servicemen and women play in keeping our country safe, and I would like to recognise their contributions, too. However, recognition must be more than symbolic; it must be matched by action and support. So, in conclusion, let us remember, let us reflect, but above all, let us ensure that the sacrifices of the past are never in vain and that the peace they secured is never taken for granted.</p>

    <p pid="e643.2/1">It is an absolute privilege to speak today as we mark the 80th anniversary of victory over Japan, an occasion for national reflection, remembrance and gratitude.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/2">We in the Liberal Democrats are proud that so many of our colleagues have served in the armed forces. They, together with veterans and serving personnel across the UK, carry the torch of service passed down from that greatest generation—those who fought to preserve freedom and democracy in the face of fascism and tyranny. This anniversary is not just a historical milestone; it is a vital opportunity to honour those who served, fought and, in so many cases, made the ultimate sacrifice. Their courage shaped the world we live in. It secured peace, it secured democracy and it left a legacy of international co-operation that we must never take for granted.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/3">In the far east, where the war continued long after peace had been declared in Europe, tens of thousands of British and Commonwealth troops, including the legendary Fourteenth Army, fought under unimaginable conditions in the jungles of Burma, in the heat of the  Pacific islands, and in the face of fierce resistance. Fighting took place over a vast region, from Hawaii to India, and Allied forces faced disease, the constant risk of capture and the heartbreak of separation. Victory over Japan only came on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase>, after devastating losses on all sides, including the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/4">This anniversary carries a personal resonance for me. My grandfather served in Burma as a captain in what we believe was the Yorkshire Regiment, part of the British 2nd Infantry Division. He fought in the battle of Kohima, a brutal turning point in the war where the terrain, climate and conditions pushed soldiers to the absolute limits of human endurance. Like many people who fought in those conditions, he never spoke about his experience, but it was clear that the impact of the war stayed with him for his whole life. I remember him today with pride, and honour the sacrifice of all those who served alongside him.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/5">We have no surviving veterans who served in the far east in my constituency, but the memory of their service lives on powerfully in our community. On Victory over Japan Day, local residents flooded the streets in a spontaneous torchlit procession from Epsom town centre to the Downs. A 30-foot bonfire, built from the ruins of bomb sites, was lit by the mayor and effigies of Axis leaders were cast into flames. Across Ewell, Hook Road, Horton Estate and Rosebery Park, families gathered to celebrate, give thanks and remember. We remember still brave men from our borough, such as Sergeant Jack Canham, killed at Imphal; Lance Bombardier Alfred Cates, who died as a prisoner of war on the Burma railway; Corporal William Murphy, who fought and fell at Kohima; and Corporal Noel Seymour, a young RAF wireless operator, who died aged just 21. All are commemorated on our local war memorials and in the book of remembrance at the town hall. Their stories are part of Epsom and Ewell’s history, and they deserve to be part of our nation’s collective memory, too.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/6">The war in the Pacific was brutal. Captured soldiers faced inhumane treatment, while many of those who served in that theatre felt forgotten in the decades that followed, earning the title “the forgotten Army”. Today, we remember them. We remember the soldiers from India, the Caribbean, Africa and all those from the Commonwealth who fought under the British flag. Theirs was one of the most diverse fighting forces in history: men and women from across the empire, speaking dozens of languages, united by duty. Their contribution should be recognised not as an afterthought, but as a central part of our national narrative.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/7">I want to recognise and commend the efforts of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission and its global “For Evermore” tour, which has worked to preserve the memories of those who served, from Singapore to Kenya, from Hong Kong to Thailand. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission’s torch for peace is a vital symbol of remembrance, passed from one generation to the next.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/8">As we commemorate, we must also recommit to supporting those who serve today and those who have served. It is not acceptable that, in 2025, veterans continue to fall through the cracks, struggling with mental health, homelessness or poor housing. The Liberal Democrats believe in a fair deal for our veterans. A fair deal means action on homelessness, by building 150,000 more social  homes every year to allow every member of society access to their own home; a fair deal means proper mental health support, by providing mental health support and easy access to professional help; and a fair deal means making sure veterans count, by ensuring there is better recording of the physical and mental health outcomes of veterans, including waiting times for treatment.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/9">Those who now carry the torch—current service personnel—must have a fair deal. I am proud that last week my Liberal Democrat colleagues in the other place defeated the Government to extend the decent homes standard to Ministry of Defence accommodation. I hope that that remains in the Renters’ Rights Bill when it returns to the Commons. It is a basic principle: if someone is willing to put their life on the line for our democracy, they should at the very least have a warm, safe home.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/10">The injustices faced by many Commonwealth and other overseas armed forces personnel and their families must also be rectified. Some are still being asked to pay thousands of pounds in visa fees just to live in the country they served. Those fees should be scrapped. No veteran’s family should be priced out of their place in our society.</p>
    <p pid="e643.2/11">Finally, we must ensure that this 80th anniversary is a living act of remembrance, and we must teach our children the full story of the blitz and the Burma railway. In doing so, we preserve the memory of those who fought and those who never came home, and we pass on their stories with honesty, pride and gratitude. Remembrance is about not only the past, but the present and the future; and as threats to freedom rise again in our world, we must remember why they fought and ensure that we honour their legacy in our teachings, in our words and in our deeds.</p>

    <p pid="e645.0/1">It is my privilege to join colleagues across the House in marking the 80th anniversary of victory over Japan. It is a moment to honour the bravery, sacrifice and enduring legacy of those from our country and allies around the world who contributed in the Pacific theatre of the second world war. I have a direct personal connection to the Pacific theatre: my uncle, Jack Minns, served as a crewman aboard the plane of the Supreme Allied Commander South East Asia, Lord Mountbatten. However, it is of Carlisle’s own Border Regiment that I wish to speak.</p>
    <p pid="e645.0/2">The regiment served its country with distinction during the second world war and played a vital role in the allied victory over Japan. The 2nd, 4th and 9th Battalions of the Border Regiment formed part of the elite Chindit columns operating behind Japanese lines in Burma. The columns were hyper-mobile, self-sufficient units engaged in daring long-range jungle warfare.</p>
    <p pid="e645.0/3">In Imphal in east India, troops from the 2nd and 9th Battalions of the Border Regiment joined forces with Indian and East African divisions to resist the Japanese advance. This defeat of the Japanese forces prevented a wider Japanese invasion of the Indian mainland and is widely seen as a turning point in the campaign. The 9th Battalion of the Border Regiment went on to spearhead the capture of Meiktila in March 1945. This decisive  blow led to the fall of Mandalay and the liberation of Rangoon, and by May the Japanese had all but abandoned Burma. Amidst this are remarkable stories of bravery from individual members of the Border Regiment, including Private Joseph Arnold, a stretcher bearer who single-handedly carried back two wounded soldiers when others were unable to help.</p>
    <p pid="e645.0/4">In May it was my privilege to attend the “Turning of the leaves” ceremony at the regimental chapel of the Border Regiment in Carlisle cathedral, and to have the opportunity to pay my tribute to the courage, sacrifice and enduring legacy of our former local regiment. Last week I held a Westminster Hall debate on the incredible contributions of those who served in the RAF unarmed photographic reconnaissance unit. Of the four local men who served in this unit, one was Sergeant Charles Ross. While we know that he served in the far east, we do not know whether he lived beyond VJ Day—he remains missing in action.</p>
    <p pid="e645.0/5">I wish to place on the record my thanks to those men from Carlisle and north Cumbria who fought through floods, jungles and monsoons in Burma and India. Their tenacity helped stall and eventually defeat Japanese forces, and their perseverance and sacrifice will always be remembered.</p>

    <p pid="e646.0/1">Last weekend I met my constituent Margaret Barbour, of Rosefield farm near Annan, to hear about the experience of her father, Sergeant Major Jock Wylie, and to look through the letters, paperwork and photographs that she has kept. A riding instructor in the Lanarkshire Yeomanry Territorials, Jock was deployed in 1940 to the far east. By 1942, after the fall of Singapore, he was taken prisoner by the Japanese. Thus began three years and eight months of unimaginable suffering. Jock was not a “guest” of the Imperial Nippon Army, as their propaganda called it, but their slave. Jock spent time in Changi prison in Singapore before being sent to the notorious Kinkaseki jungle camp on Formosa—now known as Taiwan. Hundreds of Jock’s fellow prisoners died on that journey.</p>
    <p pid="e646.0/2">There, along with hundreds of others, he was forced to work in copper mines in horrific conditions, often up to 18 hours a day. Starved, beaten and stripped of dignity, men were tied to stakes under a burning sun, given salted rice or left in bamboo sweat boxes without water. Every day they were forced to take a walk past prisoners who had been beheaded for alleged misdemeanours and had their heads placed on poles, with their full military headgear still worn as the flesh around it decayed. Jock and his colleagues were reduced to skin and bone. He was over 12 stone when captured, and barely 6 stone when released. The first person to see him at the local railway station on his return burst into tears at the sight of him.</p>

    <p pid="e646.1/1">The right hon. Gentleman is telling a vivid story—one that would be very familiar to a former constituent of mine, George Money, whose daughter, Pam Gillespie, leads the VJ Day commemorations every year in my constituency. Does the right hon. Gentleman recognise that it is so important to tell these stories so that our generation and the next  generation recognise the sacrifice of these men, as well as the experiences of their families when they returned to them in that way?</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2025-07-21e.647.0" speakername="David Mundell" type="Continuation Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/11970" colnum="647" time="21:02:00" url="">
    <p pid="e647.0/1">I absolutely agree, which is why this debate is so important. Many of those men did not feel able to speak about their experience, or found when they returned to the UK that the public wanted to move on, now that the war was over. It is incumbent on us to relay these experiences, which is why I want to tell Jock’s story tonight.</p>
    <p pid="e647.0/2">Red Cross parcels rarely arrived in the camp, and dysentery, beriberi and malaria ravaged the prisoners. Somehow, Jock managed to stay alive, and he became a beacon of hope for other prisoners as, in the dark nights, he sang a song called the “Dumfriesshire Foxhounds”, a tune that lifted spirits and became so well known that even the Gurkhas and Australians joined in.</p>
    <p pid="e647.0/3">Jock never gave in to bitterness, but the scars he carried—both physical and emotional—never truly healed. When he returned to Lockerbie, he embraced his family and the life he had left behind, becoming a major part of the annual Lockerbie gala. He shared his stories not to gain sympathy, but to honour truth and bear witness. He spoke of the Gurkhas—the “bravest little men”, who moved like ghosts in the jungle. He never forgot the cruel warnings prisoners were given, after being forced to dig potentially their own burial pit, that if the Americans came, the prisoners would all be burned alive, as he had seen happen to Gurkhas in Singapore.</p>
    <p pid="e647.0/4">Let us take this opportunity to remember not just what Jock and his fellow prisoners of war endured, but what they stood for: duty, dignity and decency. We owe Jock—a man who, despite everything, found the strength to go on—and the men and women like him, more than monuments. Let us not allow the fading of photographs or the yellowing of old newspaper clippings to erase stories like his. Let us speak them aloud, share them and learn from them. When the last witnesses are gone, all that remains is what we choose to remember.</p>

    <p pid="e647.1/1">It is a huge honour to represent the ancient and loyal borough of Newcastle-under-Lyme in this House, and all those who served our country—the veterans and their families—to whom we owe so much. We are a patriotic community, which is why I was honoured to attend the recent reopening of the Tri Service and Veterans support centre in Newcastle-under-Lyme just two weeks ago. The centre does wonderful work supporting and standing up for our veterans and all those who call Staffordshire and Newcastle-under-Lyme home.</p>
    <p pid="e647.1/2">I am grateful to the Minister for setting out the support, funding and events that will allow our United Kingdom to remember, reflect and understand the sacrifice of those to whom we owe so much. My grandfather boarded a boat from Jamaica in 1941 to serve king and country, to help us to defeat the Nazis and to fight for the freedom and democracy that we enjoy today. They were and remain the greatest generation, and we owe them so much.</p>
    <p pid="e647.1/3">Every anniversary commemorating the allies’ victories on VJ Day is significant, but this year is even more significant, as we mark 80 years since the end of the  second world war, and because this may be the last significant anniversary that we share with the surviving veterans of that greatest generation. We owe them all a huge debt of gratitude. Those brave soldiers came from every corner of what was then the British empire. They fought and sacrificed so that we may speak openly and freely today. The efforts of those soldiers from across what is now the Commonwealth should serve as a unifying influence on us all today.</p>
    <p pid="e647.1/4">It was in Newcastle-under-Lyme that Reginald Mitchell, the designer of the Spitfire, was born. When the war arrived on the doorstep of a different Newcastle from the one I call home—the one in New South Wales, Australia—which suffered a direct shelling attack from the Japanese in June 1942, it was three squadrons of Reginald Mitchell’s Spitfire planes that would be sent to help to defend the shores of Australia from October 1942. From one Newcastle to another.</p>
    <p pid="e647.1/5">As many Members gathered in the Chamber tonight will know, I am a proud son of the Commonwealth, so VJ Day is particularly important to me due to the extraordinary contribution of Commonwealth countries to the war effort in the eastern theatre. How lucky are we that they served and stood up to be counted? As I said in my speech to commemorate the 80th anniversary of VE Day, there is no greater tribute to the greatest generation than continuing to push for a more tolerant, more respectful and more peaceful world. How proud am I, as a Staffordshire MP, that the arboretum in Lichfield will be leading our national commemorations as we give thanks to those who gave their lives for us?</p>

    <p pid="e648.0/1">I rise quite simply to honour all those who served in the Pacific campaign and in Asia during world war two. That included my own father—a very young Captain Amos at the time—who served at the end of the second world war after being redeployed from Europe. We also remember those who died on all sides, including thousands of civilians, and how strongly those events at the end of the second world war send the message that war is what happens when politics and diplomacy fail. Let us never forget that, along with the terrible consequences for those living with war right now.</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/2">Others who served in the Pacific campaign include many unsung heroes of the RAF’s photographic reconnaissance unit—I congratulate <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26403" name="Julie Minns">the hon. Member for Carlisle (Ms Minns)</phrase> on securing a recent Westminster Hall debate on that—whose courage and skill gathered intelligence, shortened conflicts and saved lives. That intelligence was as vital in the eastern theatre as it was in the western European theatre.</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/3">I will take a moment to acknowledge those from my constituency who served in the PRU, whose bravery was as extraordinary as their sacrifice. Flying Officer Eric Durston from Wellington flew solo reconnaissance missions, capturing images critical to allied planning. He was lost over the Netherlands in 1942. His gravestone at Bergen bears the inscription:</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/4" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“He died and never knew;</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/5" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">England, he died for you.”</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/6">It is signed simply, “Mother”—a mother whose heartache at the loss of her son at only 22 I can only imagine.</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/7">On Christmas eve 1944, Flying Officer Priddle from Taunton died when his Spitfire was shot down over Utrecht. More happily, Eric Hill—also of Taunton—flew Mosquitos across the Arctic, on the eastern front and over Germany on dangerous missions. One such mission—to photograph Tirpitz—was over 3,000 miles long and lasted more than 10 hours. It is thought to be the longest reconnaissance operation of the entire war. He survived and went on to fulfil the dream of playing, and later commentating on, cricket for Somerset. He is commemorated in the press box at the county ground a few hundred yards from my own home.</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/8">Those stories remind us that everyday folk get caught up in war and do extraordinarily courageous things. We owe it to those who serve to stand with veterans, to remember them and their sacrifice. It was therefore a privilege last week to take part in the debate on our Northern Ireland veterans. No veteran should ever be subjected to double jeopardy and pursued for doing no more than their duty.</p>
    <p pid="e648.0/9">I wish to bring to the Minister’s attention a veteran who desperately needs help—[Interruption.] I will write to the Minister about that veteran, who has only weeks to live.</p>

  <speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/debate/2025-07-21e.649.1" speakername="Gideon Amos" type="Continuation Speech" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26531" colnum="649" time="21:10:00" url="">
    <p pid="e649.1/1">I am extremely grateful to the hon. Member. Dr X served 25 years in the Royal Army Medical Corps and transferred to the NHS less than two years ago. He has been given the prognosis that he has only weeks to live, and because he has been in his transferred position with the NHS for less than two years he will lose his death benefits. I have written to the Secretary of State for Defence today and sent the letter to his office. I hope that Ministers will be able to look urgently at his case.</p>
    <p pid="e649.1/2">Those who served in world war two, including the pilots of the PRU who flew in silence, were part of the greatest generation. Their voices may increasingly be silent, but their legacy speaks volumes.</p>

    <p pid="e649.2/1">In February 1942, Singapore fell to the forces of the Japanese empire. Nearly 85,000 British, Indian, Australian and Malay soldiers were captured. One of those many thousands was Major Paul Robinson, a Sherwood Forester from Ilkeston. He was taken to join the hundreds of thousands of prisoners of war and civilians forced to build the Burma-Thailand railway. All the while, Major Robinson’s wife Hope waited at home without a single word about her husband.</p>
    <p pid="e649.2/2">In September 1944, 49 British prisoners of war were rescued by the Americans. Paul was sadly not among them, but two Foresters who knew him were and, on their return to England, his wife Hope interviewed them. The men believed that one day the war would be over, that they would be free and that fascism would be defeated. She reported what she had learned to the Ilkeston Miners’ Welfare and wrote a letter to the Daily Express.</p>
    <p pid="e649.2/3">What followed was extraordinary: in response, Hope received more than 5,000 letters from the families of soldiers far away, fellow distraught wives of prisoners of war, and those who just wished to express their sympathy and admiration. More than 2,000 of these letters are now preserved at Erewash Museum, in a permanent exhibition entitled “Letters of Hope”. Paul returned to Ilkeston in September 1945 and died there in 1997, aged 87. His wife passed away in 2008, but thanks to her daughter Penny, who donated the letters in 2015, they and their incredible stories are remembered.</p>
    <p pid="e649.2/4">I want to remember another Ilkeston man, Donald Rose, who died on <phrase class="date" code="">11 July</phrase> this year. At 110, he was not only my most senior constituent; for just over six months, he was our nation’s most senior citizen. Donald was a veteran of the second world war. He fought fascists in the deserts of north Africa and in the invasion of Sicily. He landed on the beaches of Normandy on D-day and helped to liberate France from Nazi tyranny. He saw with his own eyes the gravest evil of all, when he entered the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp and was met by 60,000 sick and starving prisoners and the bodies of 13,000, murdered and unburied. Donald Rose was a hero, and I know I speak for every one of my constituents when I say that we will all miss him and we will remember him.</p>
    <p pid="e649.2/5">Eighty years on, we must remember all those stories: the grandest deeds of courage and brilliance, the darkest acts of destruction and depravity, and the smallest expressions of love and hope. It has been an honour on this anniversary to share those stories with the House, and I hope that we will all continue to do so for many years to come.</p>

    <p pid="e650.0/1">On <phrase class="date" code="">8 May 1945</phrase> at 3 pm, Prime Minister Winston Churchill made a radio announcement that Germany had surrendered and the war in Europe had come to an end. In towns and cities across the nation, people gathered in their communities to remember those they had lost and, for so many, to rejoice that the war in Europe was over.</p>
    <p pid="e650.0/2">At the same time, half a world away, thousands of British, Commonwealth and allied forces were still involved in bitter fighting in Japan and the Pacific. Although part of the same war, the conflict in Asia presented different and in many cases uniquely harrowing challenges. Troops fought in jungles drenched by monsoons, on snow-covered hills and in the scorching tropical heat of remote islands. Prisoners of war faced the harshest conditions of brutality, disease and malnutrition.</p>
    <p pid="e650.0/3">Sadly, while <phrase class="date" code="">8 May</phrase> is taught and commemorated across the country, too many remain unaware of the sacrifice and conflict in Asia, or even when VJ Day is. The Fourteenth Army, which fought in the campaign in the Pacific, is called the forgotten Army. In the face of regional and growing conflict today, as we once again face threats from powers increasingly hostile to our values and way of life, it is more important than ever that we remember them.</p>
    <p pid="e650.0/4">In the Spencer family, the Army in Burma is hardly forgotten. My grandfather was a Chindit and fought in Burma. While he resisted talking much about his experiences, it is clear from what he did say what incredible sacrifices he and his fellow Chindits made for our  country. The experiences of the war lived on with him not just in memory, but in his health. He was medically evacuated back to the UK, suffering from tropical sprue and malaria and, like many others, malnourished and incredibly underweight. Back in the UK he was treated with cigarettes, which we now know is not helpful, and with tonic, which—although it was helpful—he consumed so much of that he damaged his hearing. He continued to have relapses of malaria throughout his life. He died before I was elected MP, but I am proud to stand in this House to pay tribute to him and to all who fought in Asia for our freedoms.</p>
    <p pid="e650.0/5">It is clear that, while the forgotten Army may have been forgotten, it is certainly not forgotten in this place this evening. I am grateful each and every day for the freedoms we enjoy in this country—freedoms secured because of the bravery and sacrifices made by those young men who fought and died in defence of our country and our way of life, and those who played the vital roles at home to make the war effort possible. Their sacrifice—their legacy—is our ability to have this debate this evening. We will remember them.</p>

    <p pid="e651.0/1">I am truly thankful to be called to speak today. In three weeks, we will remember as a nation the end of the second world war and the deliverance of peace from that bloodiest conflict. In this House, too, we remember the terrible scale and depths of human suffering, the more than 50 million civilians killed, the service personnel who risked their lives at home and abroad, those who gave their lives and those who came home forever changed by what they endured.</p>
    <p pid="e651.0/2">When the instrument of surrender was signed aboard the USS Missouri on <phrase class="date" code="">2 September 1945</phrase>, a young seaman of the Royal Navy was present. In the space of just a year, that teenager had already faced down the terror of kamikaze pilots and rescued sailors from submerged explosives. He later said:</p>
    <p pid="e651.0/3" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“You were in that situation, and you did what you had to do, whatever the circumstances. I went in a boy and came out a man.”</p>
    <p pid="e651.0/4">My constituent, Ken Tinkler, a witness to the momentous events that shape our world today, is still telling his story at the age of 98. I pay tribute to a remarkable life, well lived.</p>
    <p pid="e651.0/5">As the guns fell silent, the world learned the true extent of the cruelty that the imperial Japanese state had inflicted upon its prisoners of war. In Birmingham, work continues to this day to preserve the memory of those British and Commonwealth servicemen and women who were captured. After the war, many far east prisoner of war associations were created, and Birmingham’s is one of the few that is still in operation today. The Birmingham Association of Far East Prisoners of War has produced a VJ80 badge, expertly manufactured by Thomas Fattorini Ltd in the jewellery quarter in Birmingham. It depicts a Commonwealth torch, the everlasting flame, and I am proud to wear it in this House tonight. In preparation for this debate, I asked the secretary of the association, a constituent whose father was a POW in the far east, what words it would be appropriate to read into the record to commemorate him, his comrades and all others represented. She replied with this:</p>
    <p pid="e651.0/6" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“To remember them is to honour them.”</p>
    <p pid="e651.0/7">As the war fades from direct memory, it is important to say here, as we will shortly across the nation, that we remember the war and its end. We remember those who served, and we remember those who now are gone. We will endeavour to preserve and pass on those memories to our children and grandchildren, and onwards to the uncounted generations that are yet to come. They will not be forgotten. We honour them by remembering them. I am truly grateful to those who have made this debate possible, and for the funding that has been put in place so that we can mark the VJ80 anniversary appropriately.</p>

    <p pid="e652.0/1">For the avoidance of doubt, this speech comes from a place of deep appreciation for post-war Japan and for the enrichment it has given so many of us through its automotive and technological innovations and through global cultural phenomena such as “Godzilla”. It is starkly different from the Japan fought by our greatest generation. Less than a decade after the nuclear attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, “Godzilla” was created as a metaphor for nuclear weapons and their destructive power, but 2023’s “Godzilla Minus One”—greater and more destructive still—was also a metaphor for national guilt.</p>
    <p pid="e652.0/2">For everything we love about Japan today, it has never undertaken the societal reckoning with its past that Germany did following the fall of the Nazis. Across Germany stand the horrifying relics of the Holocaust. In Hiroshima, the A-bomb dome is a memorial to the victims of the atomic bomb. In the land of the rising sun, it is far more difficult to find such an open recognition of its wartime torture of prisoners of war or its atrocities against civilians, such as by Unit 731.</p>
    <p pid="e652.0/3">In 1936, under the direction of senior army surgeon Ishii Shiro, Japan focused on making disease a silent ally through human experiments and the study of biological and chemical weapons. Prisoners were kidnapped men, women—including pregnant women—children and even babies born of rape by staff within the compounds. They included political prisoners and anybody who had expressed to any degree anti-Japanese sentiment. Victims were predominantly Chinese, but included a significant minority of Russians. Experiments included withdrawal of half a litre of blood every two or three days until death. Some prisoners were frozen to death in experiments into frostbite or had limbs frozen and then shattered. Vivisection was regularly carried out to harvest organs from live victims, including pregnant women, who had been exposed to diseases and bacteria, sometimes under the guise of vaccination. Tens of thousands more were killed through engineered epidemics, with pathogens dropped over Chinese cities by Japanese aircraft. That is the context, Madam Deputy Speaker.</p>
    <p pid="e652.0/4">On this coming anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, let us consider the path that led to war and review the actions that led to its conclusion. Let us lament the terrible loss of life through the strategic bombing, firebombing and atomic bombing of Japan. But we owe it to our finest generation to do so in the full context. Perhaps someday our Japanese friends can finally lay Godzilla to rest.</p>

    <p pid="e653.0/1">It is an honour to rise to mark the 80th anniversary of VJ Day—the day when the guns finally fell silent and the second world war came to its end.</p>
    <p pid="e653.0/2">Portsmouth has been the beating heart of Britain’s naval power for over 500 years, and it played a crucial role in the Pacific campaign that led to VJ Day. Victory in the Pacific was hard won, and Royal Navy ships sailed thousands of miles from Portsmouth docks to join the fight. Within months of Pearl Harbour in December 1941, the Navy was deploying significant forces to the Indian and Pacific oceans. By 1945, the British Pacific fleet was the largest and most powerful fleet Britain had ever assembled, comprising four battleships, six fleet carriers, 15 small carriers and over 750 aircraft—all supplied and maintained, and many built, in Portsmouth and other British shipyards.</p>
    <p pid="e653.0/3">The fleet comprised thousands of personnel—sailors, aircrew, marines and support staff—who fought in the sweltering heat of the Indian ocean and weathered the typhoon of the Pacific, but many never returned. Portsmouth naval base worked around the clock preparing ships for service. The barracks housed thousands of men bound for the far east, and local shipyards built the landing craft, destroyers and frigates that would prove essential. The entire city, from dockyard workers to families who billeted sailors, was a valuable part of the war effort.</p>
    <p pid="e653.0/4">The human cost of victory was profound. Beyond those who died in battle, thousands suffered disease, wounds and psychological trauma—yet their sacrifice was not in vain. When Japan surrendered on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August 1945</phrase>, it marked the end of one of the most devastating conflicts in human history. The Royal Navy had played its part in bringing about a victory that would reshape the world, establish the principles of international law, and create the foundations of decades of peace and prosperity.</p>
    <p pid="e653.0/5">The lessons of VJ Day remain so very relevant today. The victory was achieved not through the efforts of any single nation but through alliances and co-operation. As we face new challenges in an uncertain world, the examples of those who served in the Pacific remain inspirational. I would like to mention the Royal Navy ships that have served since: HMS Daring, HMS Argyll, HMS Albion, HMS Sutherland, HMS Tamar, HMS Spey and, of course, HMS Prince of Wales, which is en route there as a special deployment in Operation Highmast. To all veterans and serving personnel, I say: thank you.</p>
    <p pid="e653.0/6">Finally, I want to pay tribute to two individuals—Lance Sergeant Harold Kennard from Stamshaw in Portsmouth, and Private George Ogle from North End, both of whom were captured and died as prisoners of war, making the ultimate sacrifice—and reflect on my city’s role in VJ Day. History is not made of distant figures, but by serving personnel from my city and by communities like mine that came together for a common cause.</p>

    <p pid="e653.1/1">The home front was an unrelenting struggle and the European theatre was the most mechanised slaughter ever witnessed on the continent, but the brutal fighting of the Japanese was incomparable. Young men would have heard the  tales of ferocious fighting on the ground, kamikaze attacks from the air, barbaric treatment of allied prisoners of war upon victory in battle, and mass suicides forced on Japanese civilians upon defeat in battle.</p>
    <p pid="e653.1/2">Those harrowing tales did not faze the good old men of east London or Essex, or, for that matter, the millions of brave British, Indian and Commonwealth soldiers who volunteered. Over the course of British involvement, loyal subjects of the Crown left their families, friends and native soil to sail to the far east to defend their empire. Many of those brave men were from England, including many from Essex. I remember especially the South West Essex Burma Star Association, which met at the Romford United Services club. I was honoured to be given honorary membership of the club by those old and bold veterans, who I was proud to meet and invite to Parliament in my early years as an MP. Their memory, and that of those who served in the far east, will never be forgotten.</p>
    <p pid="e653.1/3">For over 90,000 servicemen, it was only ever destined to be a one-way journey. Hand in hand with our American allies from across the pond, those gallant men fought to ensure the end of one of the most brutal and oppressive imperial powers, which could rain terror upon its neighbours no longer, and to ensure that freedom and democracy prevailed. Determined to fight to the bitter end, the imperial Japanese army fully intended to force an allied invasion of the Japanese homeland, which would have led to untold casualty on both sides. That was averted.</p>
    <p pid="e653.1/4">Often referred to as the forgotten Army, the soldiers of the Pacific theatre were the very greatest of the greatest generation. Their loyal service and valiant fighting brought victory home and secured us a peace that has lasted decades.</p>

    <p pid="e654.0/1">Their inspirational commander, General Bill Slim, was one of the greatest generals of world war two. His book, “Defeat into Victory”, which is about how he did it, is one of the greatest books ever written about that war. Does my hon. Friend agree?</p>

    <p pid="e654.1/1">I certainly do. General Slim is one of the greatest British heroes, and we salute his honour today as well.</p>
    <p pid="e654.1/2">The loyal service and valiant fighting of those servicemen brought victory home and secured us a peace that has lasted decades. Victory in the second world war enabled a thriving Commonwealth of Nations, global economic growth, the spread of democracy and the guarantees of the freedoms that we so treasure in Britain today. Those achievements are what our servicemen fought for, and we owe it to their memory to celebrate, preserve and advance them at every opportunity, as they did for King, country and Commonwealth.</p>

    <p pid="e654.2/1">It is an honour to speak today as we approach this incredibly important anniversary. Today is the day to celebrate the victory of democracy and freedom over fascism, as well as to remember all those who lost their lives, were taken prisoner or suffered during that fight. I believe that the most important thing we can do to honour their memory is to ensure that we never again return to the politics of fascism. Although VJ Day  marks the end of the war, fascist politics are on the rise all over the world. We must never allow ourselves to be complacent or to think that our modern world is immune.</p>
    <p pid="e654.2/2">My community has its own story to tell about VJ Day. Names are remembered and listed on the roll of honour at St John’s church in Blackpool. One of my constituents wrote to me about the story of her grandad, Harold Rhodes, who was captured on <phrase class="date" code="">15 February 1942</phrase>, alongside many other men, and taken to the notorious Changi prison camp. Harold was made to walk from Singapore to Burma via Thailand to work for the Japanese on the notorious death railway. He walked the last 100 miles of that 400-mile forced march on bare feet. It is said that one man died for every sleeper laid. Harold was released from Changi prison on <phrase class="date" code="">2 September 1945</phrase> and put on a ship for Rangoon, Burma. The purpose of the trip was rehabilitation for Harold and many other ex-prisoners, who were all extremely thin and needed to gain weight urgently. On arriving home after a three-month journey, he weighed 6 stone 5 lbs—heaven only knows what he weighed when he was released from Changi. Harold’s granddaughter—my constituent—says that he was the gentlest of men.</p>
    <p pid="e654.2/3">Harold’s story is that of so many men across the country. While Harold survived, many more died. Many starved to death and many died from cholera, malaria or dysentery. They are the men whose suffering we must remember. Their brutal treatment at the hands of the imperial Japanese army must serve as a reminder to us all of the horrors of war and strengthen our resolve to build a peaceful world. Their suffering did not end when the war ended. They spent their lives suffering from PTSD, limbs lost and long-term complications.</p>

As someone who previously represented part of her constituency, I know how much this will mean to her constituents. My grandfather had a Burma Star and he had scars all over his body. He never spoke of it but the long-lasting trauma these veterans faced lived with them throughout their lives and we do not recognise that enough. I would like to put that on the record.</p>

    <p pid="e655.1/2">My school friend’s dad, George Brooks, suffered for the rest of his life from the ordeals he endured in the camps.

    <p pid="e655.2/1">It is through our veterans that our collective memory of the second world war is best preserved, but as their bright flame is flickering it is important that a new generation—my generation—commits to re-telling their stories.</p>
    <p pid="e655.2/2">As a schoolboy, one of the pieces of work that has stuck with me the most was the “man behind the name” project, because it is impossible to think of the 5 million British young men—25% of adult men—who fought in  the first world war; that is 55 full Wembley stadiums. The “man behind the name” project was so powerful, with the general point being, “Go and pick a name on your local cenotaph.” For me, that was the one I passed on the way to Mrs Wood’s history lesson at West Hill school. We were told, “Choose a name and research that man, because when you learn about that young man—where he was born, his sweetheart, his job, his kids, not too dissimilar in age to yourself—you realise that it is not an abstract number, but 5 million young men with their own lives. It hits home.”</p>
    <p pid="e655.2/3">The man behind the name for me was Benjamin Ford, my great-great-grandfather. He died in Mesopotamia fighting the Ottomans. What struck me particularly was that I heard a lot about the western front but little to nothing about this other front where men like Benjamin died for King and country. It rather strikes me that the Pacific front in the second world war is often similarly overlooked. Today’s debate is important for highlighting those men who fought and died in the far east, particularly those fighting after VE Day had passed.</p>
    <p pid="e655.2/4">Just this weekend I was speaking to Theresa Haggart, a former local headmistress and stalwart of Windsor civic society, about her father, the late Charles Snelling; I want to take this opportunity to highlight the man behind that name. He passed in August 2016, aged 92. He came from a family with a proud tradition of national service. In the first world war, he was a regimental sergeant-major as part of the Canadian imperial forces, and in the second world war he was a radar engineer and operator. He spent time hopping from ship to ship, making repairs to essential equipment, and, like 365,000 other British troops, found himself thousands of miles away in the Pacific. Unable to share his precise location with his family, he sketched drawings of the local culture and the people he met on blank postcards, which he sent to his parents, letting them know he was okay.</p>
    <p pid="e655.2/5">Charles did not discuss his service, although he did feel that while VE Day commemorations continued to draw national attention, VJ Day came and went almost as an afterthought. I gently say to Ministers that this sometimes feels to be the case on the 80th anniversary—and that is regrettable. Victory over Japan marked the true end of the conflict, and no less was the sacrifice of those who gave their lives there, so let us all in this House play our part so that these stories, as they come down from generation to generation—</p>

    <p pid="e656.1/1">When we mark VJ Day—victory over Japan—we remember the true end of the second world war. The far east campaign saw some of the harshest conditions of the entire war: jungle warfare, searing heat and a determined enemy. It also saw acts of extraordinary courage and enduring suffering, particularly among those taken prisoner and subjected to forced labour. I pay tribute to my great uncle, Frank Mole, who was one of those men. The men and women who served there often came home to little recognition, but they deserve our greatest respect.</p>
    <p pid="e656.1/2">As the Member of Parliament for Aldershot, I was proud to pay tribute in the VE Day debate to the greatest generation of my constituency. Farnborough  and Aldershot are towns that have served as home of the British Army and the Royal Aircraft Establishment. Today, I want to mention—proudly, as chair of the Nepal all-party parliamentary group—a group whose contribution in the far east deserves particular tribute: the Gurkhas. Over 112,000 Gurkhas served in the second world war, and more than a quarter of them fought in the far east campaign. In Burma, they became legendary—skilled in jungle warfare, trusted by British commanders and feared by the enemy.</p>
    <p pid="e656.1/3">One of the finest examples of the Gurkhas’ courage is Rifleman Lachhiman Gurung VC. In May 1945, during the battle for Taungdaw in Burma, three enemy grenades were thrown into his trench. He hurled back two. The third exploded in his hand, blowing off his fingers and blinding one eye. But for four hours—alone, one-handed—he held the line, firing his rifle and calling out, “Come and fight a Gurkha!” When relief came, 31 enemy soldiers lay dead around his post. His platoon had survived. That story is more than legend; it is living history for my constituency.</p>
    <p pid="e656.1/4">Today, Aldershot is home to the largest Nepali community in the UK, some of whom are descendants of those who served. Their presence is not just a legacy of war, but a living part of our society and our future. VJ Day matters to them; it matters to us all. Today, as we mark the anniversary of Victory over Japan Day, we say once more: to the soldiers who trained on Aldershot’s parade grounds and fought through jungle and monsoon—</p>

    <p pid="e657.4/1">It is a great privilege to respond to today’s debate. I am grateful to all hon. Members for their contributions. As many have said, the Pacific campaign of world war two is often referred to as the forgotten war, but that is far from the case today. We in Parliament remember that epic and brutal theatre of operations, honour all those who served, and reflect on the terrible loss of human life—both military and civilian. It will certainly not be the forgotten war this summer as our nation joins in the commemorations.</p>
    <p pid="e657.4/2">As was frequently remarked when we debated the anniversary of VE Day on <phrase class="date" code="">6 May</phrase>, such events to mark VJ Day will be even more poignant and important because the living link to that time is passing. That living link has been sustained through so many family connections, as we have heard today.</p>

    <p pid="e658.0/1">I want to put on record the contribution of those from Northern Ireland who served in the far east. I think of Johnny McQuade, who was an MP in this House for our party from 1979 to 1983. He was an inspiration to me as a young boy back in the ’70s. I think also of Richie, a sergeant-major in the Royal Artillery Belfast Battalion, who went to camp in 1939 for two weeks but came back in 1945 having served in the far east. Those are two examples of Northern Ireland’s contribution to the far east war.</p>

    <p pid="e658.1/1">I totally agree with the hon. Gentleman. I always make the effort to recognise the contribution of the whole of our Union to our armed forces on all fronts in the second world war and throughout the history of our military.</p>
    <p pid="e658.1/2">As I have said, many colleagues have spoken about their family connections. I was very moved by the Liberal Democrat spokesperson, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26627" name="Helen Maguire">the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Helen Maguire)</phrase>, who spoke about her grandfather’s service at Kohima. That was a key battle in the Burma campaign, and it is from where we get the Kohima epitaph, which we all know:</p>
    <p pid="e658.1/3" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“When you go home, tell them of us and say, for your tomorrow, we gave our today.”</p>
    <p pid="e658.1/4">Those are immortal words.</p>
    <p pid="e658.1/5">I understand that we are grateful to my right hon.

He spoke so vividly of the horror of the enslavement of POWs and, in his words, the “scars that never healed”.</p>
    <p pid="e658.1/6">Having said that, we also heard from the Chair of the Defence Committee, <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25695" name="Tan Dhesi">the hon. Member for Slough (Mr Dhesi)</phrase>, who reminded us that today we have a strong relationship with Japan through GCAP—I was proud to be part of the global combat air programme as a Minister in the MOD—and also with Italy, which was part of the Axis powers in Europe. We enjoy brighter relations now, even though, as <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26532" name="Cameron Thomas">the hon.

That was an extraordinarily brave tale, and I am grateful to him for sharing it with us. We heard from my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25889" name="Ben Spencer">the Member for Runnymede and Weybridge (Dr Spencer)</phrase>. No debate on the far east would be possible without mention of the Chindits, which I understand were formally known as the long-range penetration groups. He reminded us of the ravages of disease, which is the scourge of our forces in many ways. In that case it was malaria, but there was also dysentery, which we heard about from <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26475" name="Lorraine Beavers">the hon. Member for Blackpool North and Fleetwood (Lorraine Beavers)</phrase>, and many other horrors were out there in the jungle during fighting.</p>

We heard a number of colleagues speak about specific elements of our armed forces and their service. <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26403" name="Julie Minns">The hon. Member for Carlisle (Ms Minns)</phrase> spoke movingly about the Border Regiment and described it fighting through monsoons. That was an extraordinary record.</p>
    <p pid="e658.1/10"><phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26430" name="Amanda Martin">The hon. Member for Portsmouth North (Amanda Martin)</phrase> very proudly spoke about the Royal Navy. She is very proud to have a naval constituency, and she is absolutely right to stress the extremely important role of the British Pacific fleet. In fact, I believe it played a crucial role in those final months as US forces were heading towards the Japanese home island, using our own fleet to enable that military progress, which was incredibly important.</p>
    <p pid="e658.1/11">The hon. Member for Blackpool North and Fleetwood spoke of the horror of the Burma railway, which many of us have heard of. I had a great uncle who was involved in it, but he would never speak of it, so shocking was the reality, despite being such a gentle man. The hon.

    <p pid="e659.0/1">Does the hon.

    <p pid="e659.1/1">The hon. Lady makes an excellent point. We know that war leaves lasting trauma, PTSD and so on, but perhaps it was particularly intense in those cases. As I said, certainly in the case of my family member, he found it so harrowing that he was never to talk about it for the rest of his life. The hon. Lady makes a very good point.</p>
    <p pid="e659.1/2">We heard many in the VE Day debate talk about the role of other countries in supporting our forces, which is particularly true in the far east. The Chair of the Defence Committee, the hon. Member for Slough, as well as the hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme and particularly <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26444" name="Alex Baker">the hon. Member for Aldershot (Alex Baker)</phrase>, spoke about the Gurkhas, reminding us that we had a multinational force. It was an extraordinary force, including 365,000 British troops, 1.5 million Commonwealth  troops and, as has been said, the pre-partition Indian army of 2.5 million soldiers. It was extraordinarily diverse.</p>
    <p pid="e659.1/3">To conclude, VJ Day was not just the end of the war in the Pacific; in effect, it was the end of world war two itself, which was formally confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="">2 September 1945</phrase>. It was a war of unbelievable savagery and suffering, in which it is estimated that between 70 million and 80 million people died, the majority of whom were civilians. As our direct, living link with those who served 80 years ago fades, it is right that we in this House play our part in commemorating this historic anniversary and publicly honouring the memory of all who served. Quite simply, we say thank you. We will always remember them.</p>

    <p pid="e660.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for her intervention, and for remembering Frank Jeremy Hedges in her remarks. It is so important that we remember all those who served in every part of the second world war. Just as we remember all those who served in the European theatres and who lost their lives, or who went to war and came back forever changed, we must remember all those who served in the far east, across the Pacific and the Indian ocean, and further afield as well. We must tell their stories with pride, so that their sacrifices live on.</p>

    <p pid="e661.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention, which gives me an opportunity to inform the House that there are resources available for our schools. “Our Shared Story” is one of those resources, which will enable people to find out more and tell the story in a way that is age-appropriate for all our young people. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising that matter in the Chamber today.</p>
    <p pid="e661.0/2">Eighty years may have passed since VJ Day, but that can never diminish the triumphs of that extraordinary world war two generation—the greatest generation—or the unimaginable sacrifices they made to secure a legacy of peace and freedom. When we commemorate the 80th anniversary of VJ Day, we will particularly remember the British and Commonwealth heroes who fought across the Indo-Pacific. We will remember those who fell on the battlefield; those who endured some of the most hostile combat environments in the history of warfare; those who were sunk on ships in oceans far from home; those who suffered terribly in prison camps, or on forced labour construction projects; those who continued fighting in the far east for another three months after VE Day; and those few surviving veterans of the campaign who are still with us today. We are eternally grateful to every one of them. Let the united message from this House go out: “Thank you for your service.”</p>
    <p pid="e661.0/3">Remembrance is not passive, and our duty does not end with words—it requires action. As we have heard in this debate, there will be events across the nation inviting people to take a moment out of their day to remember those who served. Just as we did for VE Day, we must do for VJ Day.</p>

    <p pid="e661.1/1">Does my hon.

Japan, once an enemy, is now an ally, defending the values of civilisation alongside our forces. Does he further agree that when my constituents light a beacon in Hillmorton on <phrase class="date" code="">15 August</phrase>, it will be a beacon of hope in our troubled world, and that we owe a debt of gratitude to those whose sacrifices made that victory possible?</p>

    <p pid="e661.2/1">I thank my hon. Friend for that. A theme picked up by a number of colleagues, including the Chair of the Defence Committee, my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25695" name="Tan Dhesi">the Member for Slough (Mr Dhesi)</phrase>, was that old adversaries can become good friends. When there are rising tensions and conflicts in the world, it is worth remembering, 80 years on from VE and VJ Day, that those nations that were at war with us all those decades ago now stand alongside us, with shared values and a shared outlook on the world. That is an important message to send.</p>
    <p pid="e661.2/2">In the moments left to me, I will mention a few of the speeches that we have heard today. I am particularly grateful to my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26430" name="Amanda Martin">the Member for Portsmouth North (Amanda Martin)</phrase>. As the MP for the other shipyard, as she described Devonport in the debate, let me say how pleased I was that she mentioned the sacrifice of the Royal Navy and all those who served in our Pacific fleet. I think in particular of those brave sailors who served on HMS Prince of Wales, HMS Electra and HMS Exeter, which went down in the east Java sea.  Those shipwrecks are war graves. Although we cannot see them in the same way we can see the rows of headstones in the cemeteries and the D-Day beaches, it is none the less important that we preserve them, protect them and tell the story of those who served.</p>
    <p pid="e661.2/3">I am grateful to all those who spoke about the importance of the Commonwealth forces, including my hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26541" name="Adam Jogee">the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Adam Jogee)</phrase>, who spoke about his grandfather who served. Indeed, a number of Members talked about their family members who served, including <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/25847" name="Saqib Bhatti">the hon.

Member for Windsor (Jack Rankin)</phrase>, who mentioned Charles Snelling, powerfully invited not just Members of the House but all those watching to choose a name on a war memorial and find out the stories behind those names, why they matter, and why their stories continue to be told. My hon. Friend <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26444" name="Alex Baker">the Member for Aldershot (Alex Baker)</phrase> spoke passionately not only about the Gurkhas, who I know she is proud to represent, but about Frank Mole, a prisoner of war.</p>
    <p pid="e661.2/6">It is so important in this debate that we remember all those who served in our forces, as well as the civilians who died in the conflicts, many of whom will not have names on war memorials. Equally, we must remember all those who died in Hiroshima and Nagasaki when the atomic bombs were dropped that brought the war to a close. In the moments left to me, I join the shadow Defence Secretary, who spoke so well about the debate, and echo the words of John Maxwell Edmonds in the Kohima epitaph:</p>

    <p pid="e663.3/1">I rise to present a petition on behalf of residents of the Castle Bromwich ward in my constituency.  It calls for Solihull metropolitan borough council to take action on the increasing number of parking violations in the area of Castle Bromwich infant and nursery school, where over the last 12 months parking practices have deteriorated. This is extremely inconsiderate: it is blocking residents’ drives and destroying the grass verges, and it is incredibly unfair on those who live locally. To make matters worse, when parking wardens visited they told the school staff that they were limited in the enforcement action that they could take because one of the “No parking” signs on Hurst Lane had fallen down. Most crucially, however, dangerous parking poses a serious safety risk to the children who have to cross the road with very poor visibility because of the selfish parking.</p>

Extending the Ukraine Permission Extension Scheme

    <p pid="e665.2/1">I am happy to have secured this debate on Homes for Ukraine and the Ukraine permission extension scheme.</p>
    <p pid="e665.2/2">The full-scale invasion of Ukraine by Putin’s Russia started on <phrase class="date" code="">24 February 2022</phrase>, eight years after the Russian invasion of Crimea in 2014. Now in its fourth year, this awful war has seen some 7 million members of the Ukrainian population of 45 million—more than 15% of the population—seek sanctuary outside the war zone. Just under 270,000 visas under the Homes for Ukraine scheme have been issued to Ukrainian guests here in the UK, of whom 2,399 are in Devon. Initially offering a three-year duration, the scheme was extended by 18 months under the Ukraine permission extension scheme in February 2025, nearly six months ago. That means that, with missiles and drones falling in record numbers on the cities of Ukraine, our guests who have integrated into society, taken jobs, rented flats and paid taxes are starting to face the fact that fewer than 12 months are left on their visas, which makes it hard, if not impossible, to rent a new flat or get a new job.</p>
    <p pid="e665.2/3">Let me give the House some basic facts about where we are today. New arrivals now only get 18 months to stay. The visa gives a special status to Ukrainian guests. They do not have refugee status; they do have the right to work, and they are supported by funding—for example, the monthly host payments, or help with rent. The three years plus the 18 months do not count towards any settled status here in the UK. The 18-month extension can be applied for only in the final 28 days of the original granted visa.</p>

    <p pid="e665.3/1">I am grateful to my hon. Friend for securing this debate, and for his excellent remarks. I am aware of two cases in my constituency in which, as he says, constituents have only been allowed to apply 28 days before the deadline for extension, yet UK Visas and Immigration gives itself a standard service time of eight weeks to respond to extension requests. In both cases, it has left my constituents unable to commit to much-wanted travel with their families in the window after the 28 days has elapsed but before they have received the extension. Does my hon. Friend agree that the Government should look at that?</p>

    <p pid="e665.4/1">I absolutely agree, and people in that situation are very worried—I have several in my own constituency. I have spoken to groups of guests in Newton Abbot, and they are mostly working, getting on with integrating into the local community and strongly supporting each other.</p>

    <p pid="e665.5/1">I commend the hon. Gentleman for bringing this issue forward. The reason so many of us are here is that it impacts each and every one of us, and I have a very strong Ukrainian contingent in my constituency. Many refugees have made their homes in our constituencies—in Newton Abbot, Strangford and elsewhere. Ukrainian children are being educated in our schools and making lives for  themselves, with their parents working, paying tax and spending in the local community. Does the hon. Gentleman agree that that must continue with as little stress and hassle as possible? The fact is that Ukrainians have become an integral part of all our communities.</p>

I have heard from a number of Ukrainians—particularly those from the east of the country—who cannot return home, as their home towns have been destroyed.

    <p pid="e666.2/1">Yes, I believe that we should be looking for a permanent solution and a permanent answer for the Ukrainians, and that is why I asked the Prime Minister about it last week.

    <p pid="e666.4/1">Yes, we need to do exactly that.</p>
    <p pid="e666.4/2">If the UK is to support the defence of Ukraine, we must continue to support the vulnerable Ukrainian guests in our country and to give them some certainty about their future. In my discussions with groups around the Newton Abbot constituency, I have heard many of their concerns. We have one family with a 17-year-old son with them. Ukrainian child passports have a duration of just four years, and they have to renew his passport. He has been told to do that, but he will need to return to Kyiv. His parents are now worried that he will either not be allowed to get back here, or not be allowed to stay here with an expired passport.</p>

    <p pid="e666.5/1">I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for making this debate possible. Can he explain to the House the attitude of the Ukrainian Government? Is it the case that most of the people here are dependants—women and children?

    <p pid="e667.0/1">The right hon. Gentleman has obviously been reading my speech. I shall get on to that shortly.</p>
    <p pid="e667.0/2">I have spoken to a Ukrainian lady and her elderly mother in Newton Abbot. This lady has lost her husband, her son and her father. Her home in Ukraine is in the Russian-occupied zone and, like much of her village, has been razed to the ground. Even when peace does break out, what does she have to go back to, other than landmines and unexploded bombs?</p>
    <p pid="e667.0/3">Ukraine is the home of the fabled Cossacks, and it is no wonder that the war was not over in the three weeks or so that Putin expected. However, that means that we have to think longer term about the Homes for Ukraine scheme visas. I mentioned that there are now some 7 million Ukrainians, out of the original population of 45 million, safely outside the country—that is 15%, or about one sixth in old money. It will not be practical for all of them to return to a country with a shattered infrastructure for a number of years. Clearing landmines, dealing with unexploded bombs, demolition and rebuilding must be done before most of the guests we have here could think about returning. My basic ask of the Minister and the Government is to look at a longer-term extension of the Homes for Ukraine scheme to give our guests certainty, in some part of their lives at least.</p>

    <p pid="e667.1/1">Could we ask the Minister for clarity about the women who have dependent children or elderly relatives, who are often unable to meet the income thresholds required under settlement routes such as the skilled worker visa or the global talent visa? Could we also ask for clarity for their children, who have learned English so that they are so fluent and who have had their education here, as they cannot look forward to going to college or university because they do not have a visa that will see them through that course?</p>

    <p pid="e667.5/1">Has the hon. Member seen the research produced by the University of Birmingham on the experience of Ukrainian refugees in circumstances such as those he describes, particularly loss of employment and loss of tenancies? Does he agree that landlords and employers should not be acting in this way, that to do so may be discrimination on the grounds of nationality, and that some form of remediation needs to be found in these cases?</p>

    <p pid="e667.6/1">I thank the hon. Member for mentioning a report from my old university, which I will go away  and look up. However, I think this is more about getting the visas extended, rather than pursuing the people who are refusing them.</p>

    <p pid="e668.0/1">I congratulate the hon. Member on securing tonight’s debate. Last month, I had the great honour and privilege of meeting the Ukrainian families who have made their home in my constituency. It now is their home, and they are so very welcome. I had a personal private conversation with each and every one of them individually, and everyone said to me that they so desperately need stability and security, which the current bespoke Ukraine permission extension scheme does not provide, because 18 months is too short, particularly for young students progressing from secondary school in Scotland to university. Does he agree with me that the Government must urgently review the short-term nature of their stay?</p>

    <p pid="e668.1/1">I thank the hon. Member for his intervention and will be moving on to that shortly.</p>
    <p pid="e668.1/2">I have been impressed by the way that the Ukrainians do not sit back, but get up and get working. In many cases, they have taken jobs way below their qualifications while they learn the language, settle in and find their way. Their children have integrated into schools and set out on paths to GCSE, A-level and degree courses. Despite the fact that they do not have the confidence that they will have a visa that covers the duration of those courses, they are still working hard at them.</p>
    <p pid="e668.1/3">I have one guest who is a fully qualified Ukrainian dentist—and we need dentists, especially in Devon. He has done the first part of verifying his qualification for the UK, but it has taken many months and cost £600. However, to become a fully qualified dentist, he needs to spend £4,300 and more time, and the waiting time alone may make that futile, given the short time left on his visa. Another bright young student has started a dentistry qualification at Plymouth University, but she asked me if she would be allowed to stay to finish it. Another family wanted to get a mortgage to buy a house, but they cannot given the time left on their visas. They are brave, inventive and industrious people, and we need to help them by extending their visa scheme.</p>

    <p pid="e668.2/1">Does the hon. Member agree with me that the Homes for Ukraine scheme matters? It is not just an immigration policy; it is about real families who have made a home in our communities. I am particularly thinking of a wonderful couple who came along to my surgery. The woman, who came from Ukraine, is working with a charity and brought her son, and is getting married to one of my constituents on <phrase class="date" code="">25 July</phrase>.</p>

    <p pid="e668.3/1">Absolutely.</p>
    <p pid="e668.3/2">I would like to give a couple of stories from Ukrainians here. I am keeping an eye on the time. This is from Anya Glebova in north Devon, who is hosted by Julie. I apologise, Madam Deputy Speaker, for using the word “you”. These are her words:</p>
    <p pid="e668.3/3" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“How do you live during the war? And can a person who has not experienced it understand us? I think not, because I myself did not believe that such a thing is possible in our time. But it turns out it is possible. That morning will remain in my memory for a long time, when I woke up to collect the children for school and a man who was in Odessa called and said that the war had begun, they were shelling us. To say that it was horror would be an understatement, but a completely different life began for us.</p>
    <p pid="e668.3/4" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">Since no one expected this, panic began: empty shelves in stores, lights going out and terrible alarm signals. My children and I went to bed dressed, so that at night during the alarm we could quickly run to the basement where we decided to hide. A suitcase with documents was constantly packed in the basement; there were warm things and blankets. When you hear a rocket, your thoughts are about the children and how to save them. Missile alarms become our daily routine: children playing hear the alarm and run to the basement or to the house where we made a small shelter. My husband was invited to the military registration and enlistment office, and taken to war. We were left alone at home without support and with constant worry.</p>
    <p pid="e668.3/5" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">Why did we decide to move? Because as a mother, I want a peaceful life for my children. I want them to sleep peacefully and study, so that they can see life. When I arrived here, not only the children but also I was afraid when a helicopter flew overhead. We saw a plane overhead when with my son in the garden, and it flew very low. I froze and when I turned around I saw my son, who was sitting by a tree, screaming at me. The horror of war cannot be put into words. It is when you go to sleep and don’t know whether you will wake up. It is when life can end in a minute. This is universal, since every day brought its own experiences, pain and despair. It cannot be described.</p>
    <p pid="e668.3/6" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">My husband made the decision for us to leave Ukraine, probably because he sees much more. For me, it was a difficult step, firstly, to leave my husband without support. He sometimes came home for two days, and it was always a holiday for our family. Secondly, to leave the home where the children grew up, where there were dreams, where every corner has its own story. But the safety of the children came first, so we decided to leave. Not knowing the language and taking a backpack with us, we set off for the UK, where our host Julie met us. A new stage in our lives began.</p>
    <p pid="e668.3/7" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">Thanks to Julie, we gradually got to know, and continued to get to know, the local system. My daughter immediately went to school where she was happily accepted, and she began to meet new classmates. Recently, she saw a plane high in the sky, took a picture and sent it to her father, saying that it was a piece of peaceful sky. My son is preparing to enter college, is studying English and going to the gym. I was almost immediately offered a job, where I work without knowing English. A foreign country, unfamiliar customs, lack of knowledge of the language—all this is covered by the sensitivity and care of people around us. The Ukrainian diaspora supports everyone, learning the language, helping to solve problems and always being in touch. Thank you for giving a peaceful sky to our children!”</p>

    <p pid="e669.0/1">I thank the hon. Gentleman for giving way. He talks about children. There are children in my constituency who came here as very small children and have only ever been in the English education system. Their parents are deeply concerned about what will happen to them going forward, so it would be appropriate for us to look to put in place permanent measures as soon as humanly possible. I am sure he would also want to join me in thanking the host families in my constituency, who I am so proud of and grateful to, and Refugees Welcome, which continues to work to help Ukrainian families integrate in our community.</p>

    <p pid="e669.1/1">I thank the hon. Lady for her intervention and I absolutely agree.</p>
    <p pid="e669.1/2">I want briefly to mention another story. This is of Mariia and Ksenia in north Devon, written by their host Helen. I apologise for my Ukrainian pronunciation. They said:</p>
    <p pid="e669.1/3" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">“On <phrase class="date" code="">21 June</phrase> Oleh Yurash age 28 was killed in Sumy in a missile strike. He was the husband of Liudmyla Yurash also 28 and father to Roman, four years old. Liudmyla is the sister of Mariia and Ksenia Yurash, my adult guests. He was almost unrecognisable.  Mariia and Ksenia travelled back to Ukraine to attend his funeral. Liudmyla was also carer for their mother, who recently had a stroke.</p>
    <p pid="e669.1/4" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">The girls’ father wants them to stay in the UK, where Mariia and her daughter are safe from the war, especially as Mariia is a single mother and the Russians have been kidnapping children. Mila is settled in the only school she has known, starting year 3 in September.</p>
    <p pid="e669.1/5" class="indent" pwmotiontext="yes">Ksenia is studying in order to be able to go to university. There is little education in Ukraine at the moment. They have already lost a brother and their father is fighting for his country. The thing that keeps him going is that his two younger daughters are safe. I hope that you can get the Government to see that we need to carry on supporting our Ukrainian family.”</p>
    <p pid="e669.1/6">I asked the Prime Minister last week about extending the scheme, and the Home Secretary was asked about it in a Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">3 June</phrase>. However, the situation is changing. Ukraine’s Government publicly changed their position in late May, asking all Governments where Ukrainians have sought safety and sanctuary since spring 2022 to provide them with a choice: to remain where their lives are being rebuilt or to return to Ukraine when it is safe to do so.</p>

    <p pid="e670.0/1">I thank my hon. Friend for bringing forward this debate. Only last month I had a resident in my constituency office desperate to renew urgently the visa of the Ukrainian she was hosting. I am sure my hon. Friend will join me in saying that while the heroes of Ukraine fight Putin, for us as much as for them, we should stand guard over their families.</p>

    <p pid="e670.1/1">The war seems further from ending—perhaps more protracted than ever. The EU clarified its position, extending temporary protection for all guests to March 2027 and requiring all member states to find ways for guests to have pathways to residency or settlement within those two years. The Home Secretary commented in a Select Committee that continuing the stability of education for children, university students and adults in training or apprenticeships is key and that enabling that continuity through housing and jobs is an important part of the Government’s support for Ukraine.</p>
    <p pid="e670.1/2">We need the Government to review the short-term nature of the Ukraine permission extension scheme urgently. Without urgent changes, we are at serious risk of putting thousands of Ukrainians—children as well as parents—into homelessness or worse, as the terms of their visas will be too short for them to carry on. We owe them much better treatment than we are currently giving them.</p>

    <p pid="e670.2/1">I am sure that my hon. Friend will want to share his sympathies for Julia in my constituency, who no longer has her flat or any accommodation back in Ukraine.

    <p pid="e670.4/1">I am grateful to <phrase class="honfriend" person_id="uk.org.publicwhip/person/26484" name="Martin Wrigley">the hon. Member for Newton Abbot (Martin Wrigley)</phrase>   for securing this debate on what is an important topic for us all. I know that he is a committed advocate for Ukrainians who have sought sanctuary in the UK, particularly in his constituency. I am also grateful to Members from across the House for their contributions.</p>
    <p pid="e670.4/2">The people of Devon have helped with the integration of more than 2,300 Ukrainians under the Homes for Ukraine scheme, as the hon. Gentleman referenced, and Devon is one of the few counties supporting over 2,000 Ukrainians. I thank him and everyone in Devon for making such a welcome contribution to what is, as we are all aware, very much a national effort. On that note, I want to recognise the contributions and stories that have been shared in this thought-provoking and important debate. We should honour the efforts and sacrifices made by families who have found themselves split up and living in different countries during this unprovoked war, with the constant and daily anguish that it will bring. I pay tribute to the many local authorities across the country and to the British public for the incredible generosity that has been shown to our Ukrainian guests.</p>

    <p pid="e671.1/2">Since their launch, the Ukrainian schemes have offered or extended sanctuary to more than 300,000 Ukrainians and their families.

    <p pid="e671.5/2">Members will also be aware of the UK-Ukraine 100-year partnership, which was signed by the Prime Minister earlier this year. The landmark commitment not only builds on the close relationship we already have with Ukraine, but seeks to formalise closer co-operation in a number of key areas such as trade, security, energy, science and technology, and educational benefits, including a youth compact. It is important that we see that work ongoing, with the partnership bringing economic, cultural and educational benefits to both our countries not just now, but in future.</p>

    <p pid="e672.0/2">I will turn to the Home Office’s role within what is clearly a cross-Government effort.

However, I confirm to the House that we will be extending the leave beyond 18 months. We are still working on the detail of that and will update the House as soon as possible. That is important.

It should be recognised that we are working with the Ukrainian embassy and other stakeholders across the country, including the Association of Ukrainians  in Great Britain, as well as the European Commission and other international partners.
