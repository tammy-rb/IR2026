It was great to visit the First Bus all - electric depot in York the other week , but I was saddened to hear just days later that First had withdrawn children ’s monthly bus passes . After meeting representatives of the company , they are reviewing that decision , but does my hon . Friend agree that travel to and from school should be affordable ? Will he meet me to discuss the future of buses in York ?
