I am sure the whole House will join me in sending all the love and best wishes to my hon . Friend and to her dear friend , Hannah Deakin , and her friends who are here in the Public Gallery today . I remember my hon . Friend mentioning and raising this campaign many times on her behalf . I can truly say that Hannah has changed the lives of many and she has changed policy . Her life will be long remembered by many , many others and we all pay great tribute to her today .
