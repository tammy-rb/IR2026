I welcome the moves the Government have made on this Bill . It is important that they have done so , but they could still go much further . I pay tribute to the work of the right hon . Member for Barking ( Dame Margaret Hodge ) on the all - party parliamentary group for whistleblowing , and to the organisations in this sector that do so much to bring light to what can be a very complex and detailed issue . The Minister talks about the UK having a reputation for allowing legitimate businesses to thrive , but we are here this evening to challenge the other reputation that has built up over the years . The UK has now become a hub for dirty money , which is funnelled through the UK ’s financial system by an army of enablers . This Bill is an opportunity to dam that flow and to stop this dirty money , but as the excellent “ Catch me if you can : Gaps in the Register of Overseas Entities ” report , published by the London School of Economics and CAGE Warwick , says , “ there is no point building a dam halfway across a river . ” Without closing the loopholes and the gaps , that is what this Government are doing . The Minister has promised consultations and further things to come in the future . It is fine to dangle these things before us , but we all know that we are heading towards an election and the Government can not promise to deliver on any of the consultations he hopes to bring forward . Whatever happens , there will be an election . This House is almost out of time , and we should take the opportunity tonight to do this Bill right . I will run through the Lords amendments , given the time constraints you mentioned , Mr Deputy Speaker . The Lords amendment on nominee shareholders was tabled by Lord Vaux , and as other Members have said , there is an awful lot more we could do on that . It is not enough for the Government just to say , as they did in their letter to Members , that such a measure would most likely be ignored by illegitimate actors and would be difficult to enforce . That is not much of a reason not to legislate and not to try . There is a real issue with how complex structures have been brought about , and the Government need to grab hold of it . This Bill is an opportunity to close a loophole before it is further exploited . Enforcement is a big part of this , and the Government do not enforce the current rules . Saying a measure would be difficult to enforce when they are not enforcing the rules to begin with does not give us great confidence . Between 2012 and 2022 only three fines were issued for false filing to Companies House . As of October 2022 , only one fine of £ 210 has been issued for not filing the person with significant control of a Scottish limited partnership . If the Government do not enforce the rules they have brought forward , they can not really ask for more rules . They need to get real about enforcement . They need to make sure the laws we pass this evening are effective . Updates to the register of overseas entities are a significant gap in the system . As others have said , updates can take almost an entire year , in which time other things could happen . Event - driven updates would hold companies to account . If we think about it , there will be paperwork when companies make any change , so they might as well do the update at the same time . That would be logical . Lords amendment 117 in the name of Lord Agnew , on the transparency of trust data on the register of overseas entities , makes a critical point . We must deal with trusts without further delay , without further consultation and without kicking the can further down the road . Here is the opportunity to do that . As Transparency International and the BBC showed in February , trusts are being used to hide the ownership of thousands of overseas entities under the current regime . They estimate that more than 7,000 overseas entities on the register , about a quarter of the total , are hiding the ownership of roughly 20,000 properties . Why would the Minister not want to close that loophole ? Why would he not want to improve this system right now ? It is not as though the Government were not warned on this . They are talking about consulting and doing more on it , but they were warned about this when we had the Joint Select Committee on the draft Registration of Overseas Entities Bill . In March 2019 , Professor Jonathan Fisher KC said : “ If I was asked to advise , on the face of the draft legislation , the first thing I would say is , ‘ Have you thought about setting up a trust ? ’ ” . He went on to say : “ I might say to someone , ‘ If you really want to do this Technicolor , why do n’t you have an offshore company and have the shares of the company put in trust , and when you set that trust up , why do n’t you think about setting it up as a discretionary trust ? ” If it is a discretionary trust , the beneficiary does not rank as a beneficiary in law ; all they have in law is the right to be considered by the trustee when capital income is distributed . ” So all kinds of things were already identified and very clear to the Government , having been highlighted in evidence , and they could have put these pieces of evidence into this Bill to make sure that we are closing the loopholes now , rather than allowing this to spiral yet further . It is also very evident that this database needs to be accessible to the widest possible group of people , because the law enforcement , particularly under this Government , does not have the money , expertise or time to go into this in significant detail . Let me highlight some of the scale of the issue . We owe a great debt of gratitude to Graham Barrow , as a researcher into these things , in his own time , as a Companies House geek . He says that the use of brass plaque addresses for company incorporations has increased since lockdown . He has done an analysis of two main addresses being used . In Shelton Street , between 2018 and 2022 , the number of incorporations at the one brass plaque address grew by 340 % , from 6,200 to 27,350 . Similarly , the incorporations in Wenlock Road also grew significantly , by 40 % . Those are just two addresses , and the numbers are increasingly significantly . That is due to the loopholes that the Government have allowed and the corporate structures that currently exist . We sought further amendments to tighten this and prevent these brass plaque addresses from being used for hundreds and thousands of companies . There is certainly more the Government could be doing to ensure that trusts do not fall down on this point ; allowing people to register trusts in a similar way will result in the same issues .
