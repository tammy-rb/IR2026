The commitment that this Government and my right hon . Friend have shown in pushing for the restoration of the Northern Ireland Executive is clearly demonstrated in the £ 3.3 billion for transforming public services , but what help are the Home Office and civil service providing to their colleagues in Northern Ireland to make sure that people there have the modern and efficient public services that they deserve , and how will that benefit all four nations ? Motion made , and Question proposed , That this House do now adjourn.—(Aaron Bell.)7.3 pm
