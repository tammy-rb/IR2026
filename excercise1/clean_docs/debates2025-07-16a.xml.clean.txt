Last week , four - year - old Eli Testa was killing in Rawtenstall cemetery when a memorial stone fell on him . All of Rossendale was shocked by this tragedy , so I hope the Prime Minister will join me in offering his deepest condolences to Eli ’s parents and family . Families in Rossendale are also deeply concerned about reports that Reform - led Lancashire county council is considering cuts to nursery funding , which would raise costs for working parents and might force some nurseries to close . If this is an example of the sort of efficiencies that Reform is considering , then all of Lancashire — indeed , all of us — should be worried . Will the Prime Minister join me in asking Lancashire county council to think again ? Absolutely . My hon . Friend has made a very important point . As I was saying , I would like to ensure that the names of the strike and union committee members are recorded in Hansard , so that their contribution to the fight for the workers ’ rights that we all enjoy today is remembered . They were Eliza Martin , Mary Naulls , Louisa Beck , Kate Sclater , Julia Gambleton , Ellen Johnson , Jane Wakeling , Mary Driscoll , Jane Staines , Alice Francis , Eliza Price , Mary Cummings and Sarah Chapman , whose great - granddaughter Sam is in the Gallery and has done so much to honour the incredible legacy of the matchgirls . There is a saying : “ If you want a job done right , get a woman to do it . ” Never has this been truer in the fight for women ’s rights than for the matchgirls , and I pay tribute to these extraordinary women .
