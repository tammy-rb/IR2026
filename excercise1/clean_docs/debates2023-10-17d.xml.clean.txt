My hon . Friend raises an important point , and I know she has secured a debate in the House this week to further explore these issues . She will be aware that there has been a 13 % increase in the number of midwifery programme place starters since two years ago . That is alongside the £ 165 million added to the maternity budget since 2021 and the key increase in midwifery places in the long - term workforce plan .
