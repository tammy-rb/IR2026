We are currently reviewing the flooding formula , which will address some of the issues that my hon . Friend has raised . We work very closely with the devolved Administrations , local resilience authorities and emergency responders regularly on how we can address this issue . The UK Resilience Academy will be launched in April next year , and it will be a great way for us to look at the lessons learned and at how we can strengthen our responses to such issues . As I mentioned , we have set up a flood resilience taskforce , which looks at constituencies such as the hon . Member ’s to make sure that they are not affected . The Government will invest £ 22.4 billion until March 2026 in improving flood resilience and better protecting communities across the country . DSIT is also looking at UK power networks to see what role they could play . On the emergency alerts that were issued on Friday , we are looking at the lessons learned to see how they could be used effectively if we roll them out in the future .
