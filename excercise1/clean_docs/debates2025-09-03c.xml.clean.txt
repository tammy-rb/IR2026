My hon . Friend is doing an amazing job of talking about the importance of small hospitality businesses to the local community . Does he agree that that extends beyond economic value to their value more generally ? The Golden Smog , a friendly family pub in my constituency , supports an inclusive basketball team and has raised £ 700,000 from its annual “ pALEgrimage”—it is like a pilgrimage but involves ale , so it is even better . Will he join me in congratulating that pub ?
