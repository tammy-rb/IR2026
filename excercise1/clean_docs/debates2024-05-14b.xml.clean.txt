I want to provide some reassurance to the shadow Minister . Under our scheme , no sexual offender , no terrorist offender and nobody who has been convicted of a serious violent crime or been convicted for four years or more will be eligible for early release . I would just remind him that the slight distinction between our scheme and that conducted under the last Labour Government between 2007 and 2010 is that we have a governor lock . That means that the governor of any prison can prevent an individual prisoner from being released early if they do not think that it is suitable to do so , and that was not the case under the last Labour Government .
