I hesitate to interrupt what is a marvellous speech and a great testament to the hon . Gentleman ’s service , but he mentioned the urgent request for vehicles that could withstand roadside bombs . I thought this might be an appropriate moment to mention that , in response to that , a new type of steel was developed in the UK : ballistic steel , which was invented at the University of Cambridge , developed at our steel research institutes and produced in south Wales . That was a great national response , and it demonstrates the importance of not only our steel industry , but our industry in general , in providing a rapid response to the requirements of those in the field .
