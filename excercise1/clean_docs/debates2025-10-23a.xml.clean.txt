The hon . Lady may not know that I was a pilot in the Royal Air Force . I used to do a lot of work advocating for young black people entering STEM — science , technology , engineering and mathematics — industries , so I had the great privilege of visiting Aberdeen on a number of occasions . Unfortunately , I will not be able to visit next week , when the Association for Black and Minority Ethnic Engineers holds its annual conference in the hon . Lady ’s constituency . The association was created by Dr Nike Folayan MBE and is supported ably by Falayo Osekita , who is a representative of Leonardo . Will the hon . Lady join me in recognising the excellent work that they do , creating a new history for her town ?
