At COP29 , under a Labour Government the UK reclaimed its position as a global leader on climate action . We recognise now that our security and prosperity hinge on addressing the crisis . Will my right hon . Friend join me in welcoming the progress made on climate finance , while acknowledging that there is much more to do to keep us on track on that road map and to keep 1.5 ° alive ? It was important that our Prime Minister was the only G7 Prime Minister to attend COP . My hon . Friend will recall that , last year , the Prime Minister at the time did not attend . It is hugely important that we reach the £ 300 billion for climate finance , which will help the global south get to clean energy . We hope that our global clean power alliance will be able to work with them , as they now have the money to do it .
