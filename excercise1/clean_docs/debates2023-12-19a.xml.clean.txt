I respect the hon . Gentleman , with whom I spent time at the Ministry of Justice , but he has suggested that this is “ talk ” . We are one of the key reasons why Ukraine is still a free country . It has regained about 50 % of the land taken by Russia , and we played a decisive role in that . I know that there is strong consensus on keeping it going , but I hope that that can be recognised . I have already listed the enormous amount of ordnance that we have provided : 300,000 artillery shells and 400 million rounds of ammunition . Of course we want to keep on doing that , and we are . I have also explained how we will be supporting Ukraine in the naval domain , which I believe will be crucial .
