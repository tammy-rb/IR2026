What an absolutely astonishing intervention by the shadow Minister . It was his Government who introduced the zero emission vehicle mandate , and we are not proposing to change the trajectory that they introduced . I would gently remind him that many fleet vehicles are in fact private vehicles , as people choose to lease their vehicles or access them through a salary sacrifice scheme . Last year , the UK was the largest market in Europe — in fact , in the world — for EV vehicles . He is talking nonsense .
