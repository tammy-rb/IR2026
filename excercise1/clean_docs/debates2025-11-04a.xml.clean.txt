I congratulate my hon . Friend on bringing this important debate . I have been to Srebrenica , and I was in Sudan in 2002 . As I travelled with my research team to the northern Nubian desert , our path was blocked by the presence of the Wagner Group , which was training the RSF militia and extracting vast quantities of gold . This is an internationalised civil war . Does my hon . Friend agree that an internationalised civil war requires an internationalised solution ? Britain is morally bound to play a leading role in assembling a coalition of the willing .
