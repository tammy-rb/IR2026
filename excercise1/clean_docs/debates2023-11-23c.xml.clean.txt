I very much encourage my hon . Friend to take this matter up with the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero , but for my part I understand that anyone bidding for contracts for difference , our main renewable support scheme , must submit supply chain plans , including how many applicants will support SMEs . The Department is also consulting on reforms that will give greater revenue support to applicants using more sustainable supply chains , including those that make greater use of SMEs .
