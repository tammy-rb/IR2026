Yesterday , Oxford doctors Nick Maynard and Deborah Harrington briefed parliamentarians very movingly on their experiences of treating people in Gaza . They impressed on us how important it was that they were kept safe , and how many of their colleagues had died . I am sure that the Minister and the whole House will thank them for their tireless work , as well as other aid workers , and anyone who gives over their safety to save others . They also pointed out that the malnutrition that we see is making patients more vulnerable to infectious diseases . A report released by the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine projected that if the situation continues as it is , there will be 74,000 excess deaths — that is , that number will die , over and beyond the number who have died by bombs , if something is not done . Does the Minister agree that we need not only an immediate bilateral ceasefire , but rebuilding of the medical situation in Gaza now , not later , because that is what is stopping people getting the life - saving treatment that they desperately need ?
