I have been contacted by multiple constituents who arrived in the UK via the ARAP scheme . They are extremely worried about their relatives , the hardship they have experienced and the threat of danger with the recent events in Pakistan . These cases range from somebody who worked for the British armed forces for eight years , a family member who is pregnant with two children , and a judge who has previously been in prison under the Taliban . Will the Minister agree to look at those cases , and will he also say whether he has the resources to resolve these matters urgently ?
