On a point of order , Mr Speaker . You , like me , have long been a supporter of Britain ’s nuclear test veterans , so I wonder whether you could advise me . Given that Government lawyers have finally admitted , after 73 years of denial , that tests may have taken place at the time that those veterans were in the south Atlantic — they say that “ information may have been recorded by scientists carrying out radiation monitoring ” — surely a statement in the House by a Government Minister is required . How can I facilitate that ?
