On Friday , the BBC interviewed an Egyptian economic migrant in Calais who said that he had tried and failed four times to cross the channel but , since the Prime Minister ’s agreement with President Macron , he was giving up : “ I do n’t want to go to Britain any more , because they are making it much harder for us . Every time we try , they deflate our boats and remove the engine . If they make it even harder , I ’ll stop trying . ” Does that not prove that this new deal to send migrants back to France can be a genuine deterrent , unlike the last Government ’s pathetic attempt to claim credit ?
