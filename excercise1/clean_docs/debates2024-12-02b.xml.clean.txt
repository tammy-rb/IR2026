I completely understand the challenge . Drawing a line between qualifying and non - qualifying leaseholders — between people who own a property and therefore suffer from things that have been beyond their control , and landlords that are businesses and therefore have multiple assets — will always be a difficult job . At the edge , where the boundary between qualifying and non - qualifying becomes blurred , there are some difficult cases . As a new Government , we are committed to working with people to understand better how we can go forward on that . As for the substantive point on where the liability should lie , it is about finding the right balance between those who built the building and those who live in it .
