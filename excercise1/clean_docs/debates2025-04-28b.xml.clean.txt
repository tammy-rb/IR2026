I completely agree with my hon . Friend ’s comments , and I pay tribute to the work of Blackburn Rovers in their community . We are probably all aware of the examples of Everton and Manchester United . Both are up to their ears in debt while either building or planning to build stadiums that cost between £ 750 million and £ 1 billion . If we look lower down the leagues , the sums are still eye - watering . York City lost £ 235 million last season , Salford City lost £ 5.3 million and Stockport County lost £ 7 million . It is difficult to see how , at some stage , without regulation , more and more clubs will not simply go to the wall . The financial precarity in football is such that it leaves the clubs open to bad actors seizing on their financial vulnerabilities to offer a route to potential success . I am , of course , referring to dirty money and the pernicious practice of sportswashing by dubious owners who see club ownership as a PR vehicle to airbrush their misdeeds and human rights abuses to reconstruct their reputations and exert geopolitical influence . It is deeply regretful that this odious and morally corrupting practice has been allowed to establish a foothold in our game since Roman Abramovich came to England as the owner of Chelsea football club with dirty money from Russia . He was found to have funded or donated over £ 100 million to illegal settlement expansion in the west bank . The other issue I want to raise is around agent fees . In 2022 to 2023 , over £ 408 million was paid by Premier League clubs to agents and facilitators , and in the football league over £ 65 million was paid in agent fees . Some agents are acting on behalf of both the player and the club and receiving remuneration from both . If that is not a conflict of interest or a potential bribe , I do not know what is . I strongly encourage the Government to look at this and try to stop as much money going to agents and get it back into grassroots football .
