Given that almost 9,500 bank branches closed over the past 14 years , on the Conservative party ’s watch , it has increasingly been left to the Post Office to provide vital banking services on the high street . I am sure the banking industry recognises its responsibility to work with us to ensure that sub - postmasters , whose pay has not increased for a decade , and the Post Office have what they need to help meet the critical cash and banking needs of all our constituents .
