The hon . Gentleman is welcome to choose his tone ; I will continue to the end of my comments . My job is to come and explain the Government ’s decision , and to be held accountable for it . That is what I am doing today , and what I will continue to do over the course of my remarks . It is right that the Government are then asked questions about their decision ; that is the nature of this democracy , as the hon . Member for East Wiltshire said . An important consideration in the Government making this decision was that evidence showed that sending people unsolicited letters is unlikely to affect what they know . That is why letters are sent only as part of wider communication campaigns . This evidence was not properly considered by the ombudsman . Another consideration was that the great majority of 1950s - born women were aware of the state pension age changing , if not of a change in their specific state pension age , as several hon . Members have pointed out . My hon . Friend the Member for Salford mentioned the statistic of 43 % , referring to the 2024 rather than 2023 survey . However , as she will know , that refers to all women , including some women as young as 16 ; if we look at the cohort of women born in the 1950s , the figure is far , far higher . On those and other grounds , we rejected the ombudsman ’s approach to injustice and remedy . Members will be aware that litigation is live , so I will not go into lots more detail on the research evidence , which is the core of that litigation . I will just say two things : first , our decision was based on published research reports , which were robust and met professional standards ; secondly , the same awareness research , which the right hon . Member for New Forest East disparaged , was used by the ombudsman .
