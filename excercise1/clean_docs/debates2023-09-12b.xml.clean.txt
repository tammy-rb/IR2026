It is a pleasure to follow the first three speeches — yours , Mr Speaker , and those of the Leader of the House and the shadow Leader of the House . One distinguished Under Clerk of the Parliaments — otherwise known as the Clerk of the Commons — was John Hatsell . In Orlo Williams ’s great book , “ The Clerical Organisation of the House of Commons 1661 - 1850 ” , Hatsell is described as attracting the confidence of leading politicians “ by his sympathetic understanding , though he was no sycophant of those in power . ” I think that is the right role for the Clerk and for those they lead in the Clerks department . Sir John drew the attention of a commentator in the Press Gallery three years ago . A Member of a particular party complained that , if everyone had to stay six feet — or two metres — apart , there would not possibly be room for all SNP Members to perch in their usual seats . The commentator wrote : “ The clerk , with the smallest flash of weariness , said most problems could be resolved by ‘ common sense and everyone behaving in a grown - up way ’ . Common sense and grown - up behaviour ? We may need to keep an eye on Clerk Benger . ” They added that Sir John was “ a model clerk : circumspect , bookish , fair … in the best sense , a modest public servant . ” I think that that is the kind of reputation that each person joining the Clerks department would wish to have , whether or not they achieve the highest office . Sir John was , in his academic life , an expert on Martin Marprelate ’s tracts , which basically mocked the Church of England . The style is described as “ a heady mixture of nonsense , satire , protest , irony and gossip , combined with pungent wit , full of the language of the street ” — or unparliamentary language . Were Sir John ’s predecessor , Sir David Natzler , here , he would say that the tracts were good preparation for the intrigue , deception and vituperation a member of the House of Commons Commission had to get used to in the old days . Mr Speaker , let me use the words of your predecessor , John Bercow , who said that the Clerk ’s department was “ unstinting , selfless , formidable and … quite exceptional . ” He went on to say that a good Clerk is “ Blessed with a brilliant brain , an understated manner , unfailing courtesy , and an absolute and undiluted passion for Parliament”.—[Official Report , 13 February 2019 ; Vol . 654 , c. 921 . ] Following his retirement as Clerk , Sir Thomas Erskine May — who , like Sir John , spent time in the Library as well as in the Clerks ’ department — went on to become Baron Farnborough of Hampshire , and he held that role for six days before he died , making it the second shortest peerage . I hope that Sir John ’s time at St Catharine ’s is longer and that , when he gets to Cambridge , he will understand what it is like to be a member of the Denis Thatcher society , married to a person more important than you are . His wife , Professor Susan , is an expert Anglo - Saxonist . I refer those who are interested to her Chadwick memorial lecture in 2017 on uncertain beginnings . I think the Clerk arriving in Cambridge will not be uncertain . As the 40th master of St Catharine ’s , I hope he has as good a time as we hope he has had with us , and we thank him for his service .
