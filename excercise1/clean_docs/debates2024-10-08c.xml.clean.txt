I am delighted to take part in this debate , as I am always grateful for the opportunity to praise and defend our public services , particularly our state schools , and the millions of people , including the vast majority of my constituents , who rely on them . The Opposition motion “ regrets that the Government has decided to impose VAT on independent school fees ” . Well , I regret that the last Tory Government did all they could to deliberately and carefully dismantle , defund and destroy our public services , including state schools , for 14 years—[Interruption . ] There is a huge amount that I could say , but we are pushed for time and many Members want to speak , including lots of Government Members . I know there are more of us here — Every day . Indeed . There is a lot that deserves to be said about our schools . We have heard many Conservative Members ask about the impact . They suddenly care about the impact of decisions made in this place , but where was their talk of impacts over the past 14 years ? In St Helens North , 81 % of schools have had real - terms funding cuts since 2010 — over £ 3 million in real terms , or £ 239 for every pupil . Where was the consideration of impacts when the last Government cancelled Labour ’s Building Schools for the Future programme and watched our state schools crumble ? Where was the talk of impacts when the last Government presided over a SEND system that is failing over 1 million children and that their own Education Secretary described as a “ lose - lose - lose ” ? Where was the concern for impacts when standards fell , which they did ?
