As ever , my hon . Friend raises an excellent point . That is what Operation Prosperity Guardian is all about : that taskforce enables shipping to be protected to an extent . He may be getting at the broader point of whether individual ships should be protected . The view that the world has taken is that Prosperity Guardian provides an umbrella to shipping more widely . The sheer volume of ordinary traffic through the Red sea means that we need that US - led international taskforce for the security of the Red sea and the gulf of Aden . This is incredibly important . After all , we are part of defending the international rules - based order in the actions that we are taking . Last week , I was onboard HMS Diamond — which is right at the heart of the issue in the Red sea — talking to our brave sailors who are out there protecting our critical sea lanes . The House will know that this is the first Royal Navy ship ’s company for 32 years who have fired in anger — or in self - defence , in their case . It was fascinating to talk to them about their experience and to witness their professionalism in dealing with this challenge . It really did not have to be this way . We worked hard to warn the Houthis off . At the start of the year , the world sent a very clear message to the Houthis : “ End your illegal and unjustified actions . Stop risking innocent lives . Please stop illegally detaining vessels and crews . Cease threatening the global economy . ” All those warnings fell on deaf ears , and eventually enough was enough .
