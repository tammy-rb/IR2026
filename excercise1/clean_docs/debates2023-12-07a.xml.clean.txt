I apologise for not being here earlier , Madam Deputy Speaker . Fly - tipping is the No . 1 issue in my constituency . Will my hon . Friend join me in praising Conservative - run Harrow Council for introducing free bottle waste collections and 24 - hour notice of fly - tipping clear - ups , and indeed increasing the number of fines for fly - tipping from 60 per year — under Labour — to 600 last year ?
