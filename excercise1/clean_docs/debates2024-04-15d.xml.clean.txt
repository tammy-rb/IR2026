All trans children and young people deserve access to high - quality and timely healthcare and support . Around 100 studies have not been included in the Cass report , and we need to know why.[Official Report , 22 April 2024 ; Vol . 748 , c. 663 . ] ( Correction)The Secretary of State is obviously not concerned about the way that the Cass report has been used to perpetuate a broader hostile environment towards trans people in the UK — a hostile environment created in part by the Government ’s delay in reforming the Gender Recognition Act 2004 . Misrepresenting the report , and the high - and - mighty attitude from the Secretary of State , helps no one . Will she commit to the extra funding needed to help young people have a holistic approach to their healthcare pathway ? I thank my hon . Friend for his question . We want to not just help with crisis support , but prevent our young people from getting into a position of crisis in the first place , so we are rolling out mental health support teams , ahead of our schedule , across schools . That is a really important piece of work that will help 44 % of the student population , but we want to go even further . In the 12 - month period ending in March 2021 , we increased the number of children and young people aged under 18 who received NHS - funded mental health services to some 758,000 . Of course , we want that support to be there in the community , but importantly we also want to help clinicians to understand that this is just one of several sets of conditions that they should have confidence to work on , in order to look after the child holistically .
