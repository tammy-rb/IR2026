First , I welcome the right hon . Gentleman ’s support for this action . He asked a series of questions , which I will rattle through . Were the actions effective ? Yes , they hit the targets . Were all the targets hit ? Again , yes . We are still carrying out surveillance to find out the exact impact , but I think we can be very confident that all the relevant objectives were reached . We combined very closely with our US colleagues , and sometimes interchanged some of those targets with them . The right hon . Gentleman will have noted that , on this occasion , we were involved in dropping munitions on more targets than previously , so we carried a slightly greater weight than before . The right hon . Gentleman asked whether the action was successful , and rightly pointed out that what we are seeing is rather more sporadic : the attacks , including on HMS Diamond and on merchant shipping , have continued , but in a much more ad hoc fashion . It is perhaps relevant that there has been no attack using multiple different weapons at the same time , which we saw , for example , on 11 January . The degrading will have had some impact on that . I will come back to the right hon . Gentleman ’s comments about the Prime Minister at the end — I want to set the record straight . The right hon . Gentleman asked about Operation Prosperity Guardian . The simple answer , of course , is that none of us knows how long it will need to continue for , but we want it to come to a conclusion as quickly as possible . We utterly reject any notion that these continued attacks by the Houthis are anything to do with the situation in Gaza . The Houthis are opportunist pirates who are using a situation to their benefit : a few years ago , they did not even support Hamas , but suddenly they want to be their greatest champions . They are over 2,000 kilometres away from Gaza ; they are simply using the situation to their advantage , and it is wise for the House to not over - link the two . None the less , the right hon . Gentleman is absolutely right to about the need to see a humanitarian truce and a sustainable ceasefire — that is the Government ’s policy . We are working extremely hard to try to achieve that , including through discussions that the Prime Minister , the Foreign Secretary and myself are having . Just yesterday , I was having those discussions in the middle east . The right hon . Gentleman asked about RAF flights . The issue is not getting the aid to location — I have been working very closely with the Cypriot Government , for example , on how we can increase the amount of aid . The single biggest problem remains getting the aid into the country . We had some success with getting Kerem Shalom open , but what we really need to see is Ashdod open , in order to route that aid to Kerem Shalom and straight into Gaza . The Government and I will continue to push for that route , but the problem is not the flights taking off ; it is the aid getting in . Finally , turning to the fact that it is myself as Defence Secretary standing at the Dispatch Box , rather than the Prime Minister , the first thing to say is that it is the Secretary of State for Defence who actually has legal responsibility for these actions — who signs off the targets and , indeed , the legal authority . Technically , it is me who should be standing here , other than for the first couple of rounds , where the Prime Minister was dealing with something new and it was therefore very appropriate for him to be at the Dispatch Box . The wider point that I would gently make to the right hon . Gentleman , though , is that the Prime Minister is in Northern Ireland today , doing incredibly important work—[Interruption . ] I hear from a sedentary position the suggestion that we should have been recalled yesterday , but I unsure whether that would have been entirely practical . It is entirely appropriate that the Prime Minister is in Northern Ireland . I would have thought that the House would welcome the fact that that historic breakthrough has been marked by the Prime Minister , and it is very appropriate that I am here today to explain the activity of Saturday night to the House . Although it is clear that the Houthi attacks have not ended , as the shadow Defence Secretary said , there does appear to have been a difference in the cadence . The mass attacks that we saw on 11 January , for example , have not been repeated , partly because the Houthis ’ ability has been degraded . However , we are always looking at other means , including routes via the United Nations , and at the wider picture of , for instance , the peace treaty between Saudi Arabia and Yemen . All those elements fit into the way in which we are applying pressure to try to bring the situation to a close .
