Before we begin today ’s proceedings , I would like to draw the House ’s attention to the new shield commemorating our late colleague Sir David Amess , which was unveiled earlier today at a small gathering of his family . Sir Davinine changed was a dedicated constituency MP and a powerful advocate for Southend - on - Sea , which was granted city status last year in his honour . He was a committed campaigner for the causes he believed in — most notably , animal welfare — and a highly respected and valued colleague , known to Members in all parts of the House for his kindness , his generosity and , of course , his friendship to all . He is sorely missed . We have already begun the reform programme and have just launched the nine SEND change partnerships , which are already starting to make a difference to the provision . I would just say to the hon . Lady that this is yet another area where the Labour party has absolutely no policies whatsoever.[Official Report , 25 October 2023 , Vol . 738 , c. 7MC . ]
