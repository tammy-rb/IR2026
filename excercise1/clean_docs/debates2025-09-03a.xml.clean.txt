The Minister will be aware that many trans people with gender recognition certificates followed all the legal processes in good faith , often over many years , and made legally binding commitments to live in their required gender for life . Yet now that they find themselves legally bound to live in one gender , they are at the same time being denied access to services and facilities aligned with that gender . How does the Minister plan to resolve those contradictory legal obligations , and what will she do to provide immediate support to the trans community ? The European Court of Human Rights has confirmed that at least 19 public bodies , including organisations across the policing , education and health sectors , are misrepresenting the law on single - sex spaces . That is a breach of the Equality Act 2010 , as confirmed by the recent Supreme Court ruling . Has the Minister been told which bodies they are , and how can women and girls have any confidence in them if they are knowingly and deliberately breaking the law ?
