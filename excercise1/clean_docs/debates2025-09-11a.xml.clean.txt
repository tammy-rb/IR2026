First , I thank the hon . Lady and all other members of the Committee for their engagement in this report and for the way in which they approach the work of the Committee as a whole . I may be slightly biased , but I really think they are quite excellent in the way they go about their business — I could not ask for a better membership . What we saw at Dover was truly shocking . We are still close enough to lunch that I am not going to give too many details , but the photographs that were provided to the Committee were truly horrendous . The hon . Lady suggests that the control points at Sevington and Bastion Point could be repurposed , which is an obvious solution . The conditions in which the Port Health Authority workers operate were disgraceful : working in big sheds that we probably would not keep cattle in , with holes in the roof and pigeons flying around . Meanwhile , just a few miles up the road , there are purpose - built facilities where workers would at least be able to change into their personal protective equipment and have proper showers at the end of the day . I place on the record the Committee ’s gratitude to , and my personal admiration of , Luzy Manzano and her team at the Dover Port Health Authority , who have done a remarkable job and a significant public service in bringing this to the attention of the wider population .
