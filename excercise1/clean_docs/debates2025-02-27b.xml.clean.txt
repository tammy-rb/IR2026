My hon . Friend speaks powerfully about the careful use of language and the way in which we all have a responsibility to uphold the highest standards on that . On her specific question , having had discussions with the BBC , I can confirm that this was not a BBC programme ; it was commissioned by an external organisation . That in no way absolves the BBC from the responsibility to undertake due diligence on a programme that it airs . When it is aired by our national broadcaster , it is granted the legitimacy of our national broadcaster , and that is why these standards matter . I will take away her suggestion about a publicly available translation guide , which might help to assuage some of the concerns raised by the hon . Member for Mid Buckinghamshire ( Greg Smith ) , and discuss that with the BBC .
