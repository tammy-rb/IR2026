Eighty - six per cent . of trains at Kearsley station in my constituency were delayed or cancelled in the past 12 weeks . That is widespread through Bolton South and Walkden . My constituent Sophie , who commutes from Walden to Manchester , told me that “ almost every day one peak time train is cancelled . And when the train finally turns up it ’s overcrowded ” . Recently , she was stranded for hours after constant cancellations because train crew were unavailable . Can the Prime Minister reassure my constituents that this Government are committed to building reliable railways after 14 years of Tory chaos ?
