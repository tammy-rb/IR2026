Will the Leader of the House join me in paying tribute to the longest serving leader and second - ever chair of Harlow council , Tom Farr , who passed away on Tuesday ? Tom devoted so much of his life to serving the community of Harlow as both a councillor and a secondary school teacher , and also as the chair of Harlow primary health trust .
