The hon . Gentleman is absolutely right to raise this . Under this Government , we have seen a 68 % reduction in carbon emissions , which is faster than the EU , the United States of America and others . We are world leaders in many technologies , not least offshore wind and , I hope shortly , in the next generation of carbon capture and storage . We continue to work very closely with businesses to help them build that resilience .
