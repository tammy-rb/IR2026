Following the end of headline judgments in September , Ofsted undertook the big listen , and listened very carefully to feedback on the way it conducts inspections while also reviewing the format for reporting on those inspections . I note the hon . Lady ’s comments in that regard . In the new system that has been designed , that work has paved the way for the roll - out of school report cards . Subject to consultations — both the Government and Ofsted are very open to the views of the profession — they will be rolled out in September . Alongside a reformed Ofsted , we are creating the RISE teams , comprised of leaders with a proven track record of improving school standards . Those teams will draw on bespoke improvement plans for stuck schools , with significant investment . The previous Government made £ 6,000 available for stuck schools ; under this Government , it will be more like £ 100,000 per school to drive that improvement . The hon . Lady ’s comments in relation to SEND are well made . As I said to the Chair of the Select Committee , my hon . Friend the Member for Dulwich and West Norwood ( Helen Hayes ) , that is something that Ofsted will be judging , looking specifically at inclusion as well as — not instead of — high and rising attainment standards in schools . The reformed accountability and improvement systems very much build on the work of the Children ’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill , which will : require teachers to have , or work towards , qualified teacher status ; ensure that all schools teach a cutting - edge national curriculum , following the curriculum and assessment review ; and restore teaching as an attractive profession through a floor , but no ceiling , for pay and conditions . All those reforms combined will drive high and rising standards and break down the barriers to opportunity for every child .
