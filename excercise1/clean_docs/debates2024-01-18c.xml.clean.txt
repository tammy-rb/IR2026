As I have said , if the House of Commons has indicated its will by the amendment , that piece of legislation moves to the House of Lords and the Government will respond at that point .

They are in place , and they are working on some of the complex issues the hon . Lady alludes to . The psychological support is now in place , but I am doing everything I can in every dimension of this complicated problem to deliver as quickly as I can .
