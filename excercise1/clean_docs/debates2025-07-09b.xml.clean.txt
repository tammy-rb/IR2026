As ever , my hon . Friend the Chair of the Justice Committee , gives a considered response and he is absolutely right . There needs to be a recognition of the scale of the problem and two things are required : investment and reform . When hon . Members read the report , they will see that Sir Brian is very clear that we need investment . This Government are already beginning to make that investment , through the additional Crown court sitting days that we have laid on this year ; running the system at system max ; additional funding for legal aid lawyers and criminal legal aid ; and £ 92 million to keep the sector going , on both the defence and the prosecutorial sides . We are making that investment but , critically , as Sir Brian makes absolutely clear , that alone will not be enough . We need to consider once - in - a - generation structural reforms that will run a sustainable , proportionate system that will allow us to deliver swifter justice for victims . Investment and reform : that is what we will be getting on with and that is what we will report on in the autumn .
