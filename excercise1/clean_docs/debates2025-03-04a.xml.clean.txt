I welcome the Minister ’s statement . The Israelis have done a huge amount to dismantle Iran ’s influence in the middle east , so will the Minister ensure that we carry on giving Isreal the support to ensure Iran is not able to re - establish that influence in some areas through Hezbollah and Hamas ? Will he also ensure that British companies are not supplying components to Iran through a series of countries with which they can trade , and that we are able to achieve our stated objectives on that supply chain ?
