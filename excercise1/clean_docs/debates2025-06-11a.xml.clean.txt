I thank my hon . Friend for raising this . I believe this Government will seize the opportunities of net zero for working people , creating good , skilled jobs and taking them off the rollercoaster of volatile fossil - fuel markets . Under past Governments , hard - working communities had their pride and their jobs ripped away , and we will never do that in relation to a transition . We have already seen £ 40 billion of investment in energy and renewables , and the CBI data shows that 38,000 jobs in Wales are linked to clean energy . I want to see more of that ; both the Conservatives and Reform are against it .
