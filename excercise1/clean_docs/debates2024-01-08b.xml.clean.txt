I welcome the Secretary of State ’s commitment to reaching a fair and reasonable solution to the strikes . Worcester went into this winter with the delivery of a new emergency department and was able to deliver 21 beds - worth of extra capacity over the winter , but I have heard from the hospital today that it is still facing intense pressure . Will the Secretary of State join me in paying tribute to the staff who are working around the clock to meet that pressure , and will she support the South Warwickshire University NHS foundation trust as it works to address some of the key transport bottlenecks on its site , in the interests of patients and staff alike ?
