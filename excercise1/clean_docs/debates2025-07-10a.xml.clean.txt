Next week is Bee ’s Knees Week , a chance to highlight the vital role that pollinators play in our environment and to encourage everybody to get involved to help these essential species . Will the Leader of the House join me in congratulating Cannock Wood and Gentleshaw Gardening Club on its recent successful open gardens day , which I went along to ? Not only does the club bring our community together in the most beautiful way , and inspire plenty of garden envy , but it also raises funds for the Bumblebee Conservation Trust — a fantastic example of local people making a national difference .
