It is a pleasure to follow such powerful contributions from Members on both sides of the House — from my hon . Friends the Members for Suffolk Coastal ( Jenny Riddell - Carpenter ) , for Southampton Itchen ( Darren Paffey ) , for Worthing West ( Dr Beccy Cooper ) and for Mid Cheshire ( Andrew Cooper ) , and the hon . Members for North Dorset ( Simon Hoare ) , for Harrow East ( Bob Blackman ) and for Bath ( Wera Hobhouse)—as well as the entire Ulster Unionist party delegation in the form of the hon . Member for South Antrim ( Robin Swann ) . I support this landmark legislation , which is an important step towards delivering on this Government ’s manifesto commitment to ensuring that the next generation can never legally buy cigarettes , and to creating the first smokefree generation . This is an overdue natural step towards tackling the scourge of smoking , which claims about 80,000 lives a year in the United Kingdom . Smoking is the No . 1 preventable cause of death , disability and ill health in our United Kingdom , and it is responsible for one in four cancer deaths , killing up to two thirds of smokers . In Wales , tobacco causes 3,100 cancer cases every year , and smoking is still the leading cause of cancer there . However , cancer does not respect borders , so the Bill will serve the health interests of our entire United Kingdom . I welcome that , and I also welcome the Welsh Government ’s commitment to supporting this legislation and bringing it into force in Wales from 2025 . In fact , the Welsh Government have been well ahead of the curve on this issue . As far back as 2016 , my constituency colleague Mark Drakeford presented legislation that would have banned cigarette use in public spaces , but it fell owing to shameless politicking on the part of Plaid Cymru — whose Members , I note , have not been present at all for this important debate . Rather than agreeing with the Welsh Government and introducing what would have been landmark public health legislation , Plaid Cymru ’s Members were joined by the Welsh Conservatives and the Members of the United Kingdom Independence party — remember them?—all of whom described it as unnecessary Government regulation . Plaid Cymru sided with the populist right in Wales to make a political point , and the people of Wales were worse off because of it . Undeterred , in 2021 the Welsh Government launched their tobacco control action plan , which includes actions to protect children and young people from the dangers of vaping , such as tighter regulations on advertising and on the sale of e - cigarettes . That is a clear sign that the Welsh Government take this issue seriously , and it is our responsibility here in Westminster to support and complement those efforts . This Bill illustrates that this Government take seriously their commitment to create the first smokefree generation , and to protect children from becoming hooked on vaping . Let us be clear : vaping is not harmless . In 2023 , Action on Smoking and Health estimated that 20.5 % of children aged 11 to 17 had tried vaping . Although vaping can be an effective way for adults to quit smoking , vaping can not be recommended for children , as it carries a serious risk of addiction and future harm . Accordingly , rather than being a deterrent to smoking , vaping will see more children , not fewer , being exposed to nicotine if left unregulated . That is why the measures set out in the Bill to implement a total ban on vape advertising and sponsorship , and , subject to consultation , on the sale of vape flavours that overtly appeal to children , are so important . I fully support them . This Bill is legislation that our teachers , headteachers , medical professionals and health services are all calling for . The vaping industry has been allowed to attract kids with different flavours and bright packaging . We would not allow that with any other addictive drug , and we should not allow it with vaping . In addition , the Bill does not deal with an aspect of vaping that I would be grateful for the Government to consider as the Bill continues its passage through Parliament . Currently , police officers do not have specific powers to confiscate vapes from children — a power that they do have with traditional cigarettes , pursuant to section 7(3 ) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 . Having spoken to South Wales police officers and police community support officers , I know that the power of confiscation is an important tool that they use to deal with antisocial behaviour in designated areas of Cardiff , but their work is neutered if they can not confiscate vapes . Although I recognise that if this Bill is passed , such powers will not be necessary in time — indeed , it will omit section 7(3 ) of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933 from 2027 onwards — I ask the Government to consider whether it would be useful to retain the power of confiscation and expand it to include vapes for the period between now and 2027 , so that our police officers have the same legal powers across cigarettes and vapes as a tool in their armoury to combat antisocial behaviour . Aside from that specific point , I reiterate my support for this important piece of legislation . Not only will it align this Parliament with the progressive actions of the Welsh Government on such important health matters ; it will bolster our commitment in this place to safeguarding public health . In so doing , it will save many thousands of lives from the scourge of cancer and protect children from becoming hooked on vaping .
