My hon . Friend is quite right to ask that question . We would all like to see gas setting the price of electricity more frequently . That is why we are accelerating the take - up of renewables , which were so pitifully low in quantity when Labour was in power . We need a Conservative Government to keep up progress and lower bills right across the country . As I say , we will continue to make calls on Israel—[Interruption . ] Goods made in the settlements are not allowed to be imported , and that continues to be the case . We continue to grow the work that we do on trade with Israel , the Palestinian Authority and the OPTs , and I know the Department for Business and Trade is focused on that development work .
