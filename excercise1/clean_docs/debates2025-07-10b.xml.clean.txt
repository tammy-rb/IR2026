The hon . Lady seems to want more delivery stats , so let me help her out . As my right hon . Friend , the Minister without Portfolio , said , we have had the highest growth of any G7 economy in the first quarter of this year , cuts in interest rates and an expansion of the warm home discount , which will mean that 6 million households will benefit from better insulated houses . I do not claim , in reading out these statistics , that everything is perfect — far from it — but I do believe that we have had change in the past year : change in the investment pattern of the country ; change in real wages ; and change in our trading position . That is change well worth having .
