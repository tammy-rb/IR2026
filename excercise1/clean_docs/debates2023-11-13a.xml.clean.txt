The hon . Lady ’s question is best directed to the Department for Business and Trade rather than DWP , as it relates to employment legislation and regulation . However , I am pleased to tell her that we have our 50PLUS champions , work champions in our jobcentres , the Midlife MOT and many other measures that are there to help exactly the people she describes . We fund apprentices to achieve English and maths qualifications by the end of their apprenticeships . We understand how important they are for people ’s long - term career prospects , and we are boosting the rate for those qualifications by 54 % from January . We are also piloting flexible English and maths requirements for young people with learning difficulties or disabilities , to ensure that they are not overlooked when it comes to apprenticeship opportunities . There have been transformational changes in childcare , skills , training and support for future employers , as announced at the spring Budget . It is absolutely the case that from April 2024 , eligible working parents of two - year - olds will be able to access 15 hours of free childcare per week from the term after the second birthday , plus there will be the delivery of more support for working parents of children over the age of nine months with 30 free hours of childcare . There is nowhere in the world that compares with our childcare offer on an ongoing basis . We have virtually Scandinavian levels .
