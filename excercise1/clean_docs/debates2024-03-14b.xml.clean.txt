All of us across the House appreciate the vital role played by local individuals and volunteer groups in constituencies . One such group in my constituency is the Friends Together Club , based in Coatbridge , which has been running for seven years and makes a real difference to the lives of 150 local people with additional support needs . Will the Leader of the House join me in welcoming the thrilling news that the following individuals are to be recognised by the Sovereign Military Hospitaller Order of Saint John of Jerusalem , of Rhodes and of Malta ? Liam Hackett will receive the cross of merit and Ena Hamill the silver medal , while Elainne McDermott , Patrick Allen , Yvonne Crowley and Elizabeth Locke will receive a bronze medal . This is a truly outstanding recognition , and richly deserved . May we have a debate in Government time about the importance of community volunteers across the United Kingdom , and the valuable work that they do for us ?
