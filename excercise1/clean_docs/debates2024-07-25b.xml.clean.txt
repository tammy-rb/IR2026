First , let me thank my hon . Friend and his family for walking across the country to raise awareness of child poverty during the pandemic . The Government recognise the disruption to education caused by the pandemic and the different access to online learning and IT equipment . We are committed to learning lessons from the past and making improvements for the future . In the immediate term , the Government have invested in delivering nationwide gigabyte connectivity as soon as possible . We are investing £ 5 billion as part of this project to ensure that the hardest - to - reach areas across the UK , such as my hon . Friend ’s constituency , receive coverage .
