It is a pleasure to see the hon . Lady in her position and to have worked with her many times on these issues in the past , across these Benches and in other formats .

We will continue to explore further options to strengthen our sanctions , including in the energy sector , and the Foreign Secretary did indeed raise the issue at his meetings in Mangalore .
