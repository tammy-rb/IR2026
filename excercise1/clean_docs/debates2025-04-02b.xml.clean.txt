Trelai primary school sits at the heart of my Camborne , Redruth and Hayle constituency . It is surrounded by an area that suffers from profound levels of poverty and deprivation . If ever there was an area that needed some good news on early years , it is mine , following the shameful neglect by the previous Government . Does the Minister agree that new childcare places in new and expanded nurseries , including at Trelai primary school , will help children from the most deprived backgrounds have the best start in life , after the life chances of children from deprived backgrounds were ignored by the Conservative party for years ?
