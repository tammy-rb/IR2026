I thank and pay tribute to my hon . Friend the Member for Birmingham Erdington ( Paulette Hamilton ) , who brought the debate to the House this evening . All hon . Members will agree that her passion and commitment to her constituency and this subject shine through . I can only say what an absolute honour it was to visit her constituency to discuss the work of the north Birmingham economic recovery board . I will come shortly to the situation in Birmingham and the approach that my hon . Friend recommends that the Government take . I hope that her remarks at the end of her speech on the purpose of politics and the role we all must play in giving everybody a chance and an opportunity in our society would be supported across the House , but she makes the case well for that approach . And so to Birmingham . This debate is important for many reasons , not least because some parts of our country suffer much worse than others with poor employment outcomes . The Government are committed to moving towards our goal of an 80 % employment rate , though some places in our country are already there . Unfortunately , that is not the case in Birmingham where the employment rate is around just 66 % . That is not acceptable because when some parts of our country fall behind economically , it is bad for those places and bad for all of us , because it means that some people in our country can not play their full role in our economic growth . Economic inactivity is also higher than the average , and that is why our reform plans take a different approach . We are no longer doing the same thing everywhere , but trying to tailor and personalise our employment support to where people are and what they need .
