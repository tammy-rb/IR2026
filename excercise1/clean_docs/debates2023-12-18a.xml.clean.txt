I thank my hon . Friend for making that point . As someone who was self - employed for not far off 15 years , I understand where he is coming from . Our work coaches at Jobcentre Plus offices engage with claimants to support access to skills provision . They get a comprehensive range of support , which includes apprenticeships , skills bootcamps , vocational and basic training skills , and careers advice , so that they can work in a way that suits them . Less than 1 % of workers on zero - hours contracts want more hours — it is more about caring or other flexibilities — but I am happy to look at the points he has raised in the Chamber today .
