Commuters at Arlesey and Hitchen stations in my constituency are driven to despair by the shocking state of Thameslink services , with delays and cancellations an all too frequent feature of everyday commutes . I welcome the urgency with which the Secretary of State is starting to tackle the long - term causes , from industrial disputes to fragmentation . In the interim , will she meet me to discuss how we can push Thameslink to do more to make sure we finally make these delays and cancellations a thing of the past ?
