I recently met a support group in my constituency of those who suffer from ME , chronic fatigue syndrome or long covid . Their description of the devastating impact of those variable conditions was very affecting . If one of those people were to have an improvement in their condition , meaning that they were no longer eligible for PIP , and then to represent for assessment , would they be entitled to return to the PIP level they were on previously , or would they be treated as new applicants under the terms the Secretary of State has described today ? The hon . Gentleman raises an important point , which is precisely what we want to look at in the PIP review , because it does not take into account fluctuating conditions . That is an important issue moving forward , and we will be absolutely determined to involve him , his constituents , and organisations that represent those with fluctuating conditions in the process of the review . Because PIP is not an in - work benefit .
