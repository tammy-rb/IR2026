There was a deal by WhatsApp that was never followed up by the Treasury or Ministers . There were no meetings between AstraZeneca and the Conservative Government . Their Government let Britain down every time , which is why the country turned to Labour , and Labour is delivering . Further to that point of order , Madam Deputy Speaker . Why detain the House ? Why do n’t I just apologise now , and correct the record ? I am grateful to the hon . Member for alerting me to that information . I am happy to correct the record , and I am happy to apologise to him for saying what I said earlier . I should also correct the thrust of my argument this morning , which was that there was insouciance during the period between the March statement and the general election in July . Actually , it was not insouciance ; it was just incompetence that meant they could not get the deal across the line .
