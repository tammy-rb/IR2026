Would it was so . My constituent Scott Young , a 34 - year - old father - to - be from Beverley , was left permanently blind in one eye after NHS failures , including a two - month delay to urgent surgery following a diabetic haemorrhage , which the trust now blames on admin mistakes . When the same issue threatened his remaining sight , identical delays occurred until I intervened . Yet the Hull University teaching hospitals NHS trust response contained factual errors , including claiming that a heart condition delayed surgery even though it had not been diagnosed when the delay occurred . Does the Minister agree that such failings demand accountability , and what steps can he take to improve the administrative processes within our hospitals ?
