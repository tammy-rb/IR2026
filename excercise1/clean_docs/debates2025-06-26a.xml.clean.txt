During the passage of the Bus Services ( No . 2 ) Bill in the other place , we committed to writing to all local transport authorities asking them to pause the installation of a specific kind of floating bus stop , where passengers get off the bus straight into a cycle lane or an island . That is because they have been identified through research as problematic for people , particularly those with vision issues . We have already done work with Active Travel England and Transport for London to identify a design standard . Fundamentally , this Government believe in accessible transport for everyone , and that is exactly our ambition .
