I just do not accept that at all . I gave a run through of a list of the £ 36 billion that is being put back into local projects , including £ 1.8 billion extra for the north - east . That could , for example , be an option for the Leamside line to be reopened . I would have thought that , rather than stating that none of this is going to happen , the hon . Member would be holding us to account to make sure it does , and that she might actually support investment . There will be as much investment — indeed , more — in all areas .
