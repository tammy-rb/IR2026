My hon . Friend will be aware of the consultations run by the previous Government on the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority . I have been reviewing those consultations and we are looking to publish the Government ’s response in the new year , but we are aware of the concerns from the sector , and from victims and survivors , about the scheme . We are looking at how much more we can do to support victims and survivors as a whole on these issues . Let me come to a close by again thanking my hon . Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East and Wallsend for securing this debate , and all the hon . and right hon . Members who have contributed to such a thoughtful discussion . Sexual offences leave devastation in their wake . Victims are often left traumatised and the very least they deserve is swift justice , but too often that justice process serves only to traumatise them further , whether it is because they are not getting the right support or because they are facing an agonising wait for their case to come to court , as we have heard so powerfully this evening . We have inherited a criminal justice system — and a criminal courts system in particular — in crisis , but the rebuilding effort is under way . We have an ambitious package of reform , we are thinking boldly , and while I am realist enough to know that change will not happen overnight , I can assure you all that this Government are up to the challenge . Question put and agreed to . House adjourned .
