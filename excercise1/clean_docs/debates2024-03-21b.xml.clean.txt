My hon . Friend raised this issue with the Prime Minister only yesterday ; she is a fantastic campaigner on issues relating to the Tamar bridge . I accept entirely that the Tamar Bridge and Torpoint Ferry joint committee has recently looked at the situation . An application is being considered by the Transport Secretary , and I am happy to meet her again to discuss it further .
