It is a pleasure to be able to discuss this issue in a new way with my right hon . Friend . We have been working closely on these issues within Government , and his commitment to ensuring that those eligible for these schemes have been able to come to the UK has been , without exception , incredible . Let me just add that since October last year we have been able to complete 24 chartered flights , and have relocated more than 5,500 individuals under the ongoing ARAP scheme . I certainly pay tribute to the incredible , tireless efforts of our British high commissioner , Jane Marriott , and her wonderful team in Islamabad , who continue to work day in , day out with the Government of Pakistan , their officials and their military , and help us to ensure that we can bring those Afghans safely to the UK in due course .
