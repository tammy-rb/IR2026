My hon . Friend obviously knows a great deal about this as a result of his distinguished 31 years of experience in the House , but pivotal role allowances have been in place for 10 years to help us to retain certain key individuals . A number of initiatives were introduced by my distinguished predecessor Lord Maude , the former right hon . Member for Horsham , and I intend to build on those , but I am happy to engage with my hon . Friend , because this is a serious issue . In 2022 , the last year for which we have figures , there was a 12.4 % turnover from the senior civil service , and resignations were at 5 % . We need to look carefully at what that means across different roles , and at how we can retain the specialisms for longer periods so that key Government programmes benefit from the sort of leadership that has enduring expertise at the table .
