I thank the Chair of the Transport Committee for her comments . She is right to recognise the excellent work that HS2 has done on skills and the workforce . We have over 300,000 people working on this project at the moment , and I think that HS2 has done good work on opening up opportunities , whether through apprenticeships for the next generation or through the supply chain . I will heed my hon . Friend ’s advice about learning from the speed and ease with which other countries deliver infrastructure projects .
