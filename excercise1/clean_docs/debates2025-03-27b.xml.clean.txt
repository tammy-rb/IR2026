Yesterday , the all - party parliamentary group on cycling and walking published its report on social justice as it impacts on vulnerable road users . Injuries to pedestrians could be cut significantly with simple zebra crossings without Belisha beacons . That would align with the 2022 highway code changes . Such crossings are common across the world , and they are being trialled around the corner from this building at the Department for Transport . Will the Government consider amending the guidance for highways authorities so that these crossings can be rolled out across the country ?
