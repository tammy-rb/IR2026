My right hon . and learned Friend is right to highlight the issue . A number of things have been said about this matter that are not the case . The money will be made available in Northern Ireland , and it has been set aside . If memory serves , it is about £ 15 million , but I would need to double - check — if I am incorrect , I will write to him . The reality is that we need decisions to be taken by a restored Executive , and the Government are keen to work with Northern Ireland Ministers to that end . I am grateful to him for highlighting this point and giving me the opportunity to say that the money will be spent in Northern Ireland .
