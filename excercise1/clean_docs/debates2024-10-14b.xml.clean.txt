I really regret this playground - style characterisation of issues that are so fundamental , particularly for those who live in Gibraltar . I mentioned the comments of the Chief Minister of the Falklands , and the right hon . Member has now forced me to quote them , given the nature of what he has just said . The Chief Minister said some of these claims are “ more about party politics , blame - gaming and Tory Party leadership issues … than ” they are actually about the sovereignty of people who live in the overseas territories . He could not have been clearer .
