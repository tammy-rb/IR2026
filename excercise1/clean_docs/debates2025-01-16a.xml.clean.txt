I thank the Secretary of State for her in - depth explanation of what the Government are and will be doing to ensure the safety of our children in the face of the most heinous crimes . Since the vote on the amendment to the Children ’s Wellbeing and Schools Bill last week and the subsequent attention that it attracted in the media , many of my constituents have written to me upset , angry and in fear over the grooming scandal . All the correspondence I have received demands a public inquiry into this scandal , to determine the failures — both historical and present — of the institutions involved that allowed these heinous crimes against vulnerable children to go on for so long and so widely , without being stopped and without the victims being safeguarded and protected sufficiently . In northern towns such as Blackburn in my constituency , crimes of this nature and grooming gangs continue to haunt our streets and vulnerable children . Can the Home Secretary confirm that further public inquiries and reports are needed to find out why this has gone on for such a long time ? We need to provide my constituents and everybody across the country with solace .
