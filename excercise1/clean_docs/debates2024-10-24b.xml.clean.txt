The hon . Lady raises an important point . We will be looking at the system as a whole , and at any legislation that needs to be amended or brought in to achieve our vision for an inclusive mainstem education that not only provides education for all children regardless of their special educational needs and disabilities , but provides specialist places for those with the most complex needs that can not be met within mainstream education . We know the evidence shows that , where those needs are being met within the inclusive mainstream education system , the need for EHCPs is significantly reduced .
