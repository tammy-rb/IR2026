We know the very basic facts , which is that the Director of Public Prosecutions asked for a statement from the Government to clarify that , at the time of the offence , China was a threat to national security . He says in his letter that such an assurance , or evidence , or a statement from the Government were not forthcoming . We know that the Government withheld that vital element of the case . The Minister is shaking his head , but who decided that , in the words of the DPP , it would “ not be forthcoming ” . Somebody decided that . He seems to be saying that it was the deputy National Security Adviser who is somehow accountable for making those decisions , but I question that point . To whom are they accountable , if not the National Security Adviser ?
