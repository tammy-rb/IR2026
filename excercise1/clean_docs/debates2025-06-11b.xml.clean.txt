I thank the hon . Member for championing this really important issue . My late mother had diabetes , so I know at first hand just what a struggle it can be and how important this is . Type 1 diabetes is not preventable , as she knows , but the sooner we can reach people , the sooner we can care for them . We have a screening programme in the UK available to families across the country , and over 20,000 children have already taken part . It is really important that we continue to deliver that , but I thank her for continuing to champion this and to raise her voice on this very important issue .
