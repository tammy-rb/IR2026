Like my hon . Friend , I recognise the impact the storm has had on individuals . We have been working closely with the Welsh Government on the civil contingencies response structures in response to Storm Darragh , and have convened an all - Wales civil contingencies committee . Officials in the UK Government regularly engage with the Welsh Government on this matter , and ensure that local responders are working effectively . We will be looking to see what else we can learn from this situation . As I mentioned , we have set up a flood resilience taskforce , which looks at constituencies such as the hon . Member ’s to make sure that they are not affected . The Government will invest £ 2.4 billion until March 2026 in improving flood resilience and better protecting communities across the country . DSIT is also looking at UK power networks to see what role they could play . On the emergency alerts that were issued on Friday , we are looking at the lessons learned to see how they could be used effectively if we roll them out in the future .
