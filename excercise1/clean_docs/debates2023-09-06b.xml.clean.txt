I did not notice my hon . Friend slink in behind me , but I am grateful for his moral support , Madam Deputy Speaker , even though by your order he is unable to vocalise it . On my support for sustainable aviation , I was pleased to host and address a new industry alliance , Hydrogen in Aviation , just last night here in Parliament . The alliance is designed to help the UK lead innovation in that field . That would , along with duty - free on arrival , better support our sector . Aviation and our ports are vital for UK trade and employment . We can do this in a cleaner , smarter way , and duty - free arrivals can play an important part for the sector . In closing , it is clear that the introduction of arrivals duty - free stores would support economic growth and provide a tiny boost to the recovery of aviation , travel and tourism from the pandemic . This plan would be funded by industry and would be at worst cost - neutral for the Exchequer . It is a low - risk policy that has already proven successful in some 65 countries around the world . There would likely be no impact on domestic high street sales , due to limited market overlap and differing customer behaviours in duty - free stores . By introducing duty - free stores on arrival , the Government can reaffirm their commitment to supporting the aviation , travel and tourism sectors , and the economic prosperity that they afford by providing employment to so many of my constituents , and to communities across the entire country . The policy is also popular with the electorate , so I hope that the Government will act swiftly to achieve this additional Brexit freedom .
