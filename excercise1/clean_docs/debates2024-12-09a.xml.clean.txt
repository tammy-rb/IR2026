I agree with my hon . Friend . Outcomes in some schools in Hastings are just not good enough . We are all determined to drive up standards . Department officials continue to work with the University of Brighton Academies Trust on that . We are committed to ending its current financial model and to collaborating with school leaders on future budget setting to ensure we can drive high and rising standards in every school , including in Hastings .
