I smoked until 30usb years ago and it was a very hard business to stop the evil weed . I come from a completely different era and I am considered something of a dinosaur . [ Hon . Members : “ Never ! ” ] But I do still hope to be here in 2040 . I wish to God that vapes had been around when I was going through the process of stopping smoking . Do we not need to be very careful that the Bill does not throw the baby out with the bathwater and stop helping people come off the evil weed ?
