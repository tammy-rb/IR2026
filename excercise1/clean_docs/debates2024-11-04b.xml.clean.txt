Everyone knows that a knowledge - rich curriculum is the reason why the English education system improved dramatically under the last Government . The embedding of academic rigour produced phenomenal results in PISA — the programme for international student assessment . With that in mind , will the Minister confirm that she has no intention of diluting the curriculum or any focus on academic rigour ? Central to our opportunity mission is that where someone is from should not determine where they end up in life . This Government are serious about supporting young people . We are working across Government to ensure that young people are supported in their communities through devolution , local growth plans , local skills improvement plans and the youth guarantee .
