( 3 ) The amendments made by this Resolution come into force at 6 pm on 22 November 2023 . And it is declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution should have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1968 . As a country , we are in a very different position from the one we were in a year ago . Back then , the Office for Budget Responsibility and the Bank of England were predicting a recession , but we have had growth . Debt was predicted to rise almost 100 % of GDP by the end of the forecast , but headline debt is now predicted to be more than 5 % lower . Rather than falling , average real incomes have risen . None of that happened by accident . It happened because of the difficult decisions we have made , which have turned the economy around . We have learned the lessons of what happened a year ago , but the Opposition have not . Today , we set out a plan for the economy that will grow our potential , reduce debt and reduce taxes , yet all Labour wants to do is reverse this progress by borrowing £ 28 billion . It is the same old Labour party . Let me begin with what we have achieved .
