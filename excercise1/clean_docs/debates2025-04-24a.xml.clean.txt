I thank the Minister for her reply and for the excellent work she has done in putting together the procurement strategy . It has been a passion of mine for many years that we do not use procurement just to get extra social value but extra economic value , which will help local firms and local growth . That is what this statement does , and I hugely welcome it . May I ask the Minister whether she intends to issue guidance to local authorities so that they know how best they can achieve economic value ? For example , they could proactively tell small firms what contracts are coming up or train them in how to tender , which is very difficult for them . They could also encourage small firms to break procurement into lots , so that they have a better chance of bidding . Finally , they could stop requiring an unreasonable number of years of accounts to be shown before small firms are permitted to bid .
