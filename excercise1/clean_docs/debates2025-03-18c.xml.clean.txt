The Resolution Freedom has warned that as a result of cuts in PIP , 62,000 people could lose about £ 675 a month , with the poorest families hit the hardest . Given that 870,000 children live in PIP - receiving households and 290,000 of them are already living below the poverty line , how can the Government justify pushing more disabled people and children into poverty rather than pursuing fairer alternatives , such as a 2 % wealth tax on assets worth more than £ 10 million , which would raise £ 24 billion — five times as much as the suggested savings from the proposed cuts ? Is “ austerity 2.0 ” really the change that people voted for ?
