I have been asked to reply , as my right hon . Friend the Prime Minister has been attending the G7 summit in Canada . In an era of global instability , we are working with our partners to urge de - escalation in the middle east , to put pressure on Russia to agree to a ceasefire , and to deliver security renewal for the British people . The Air India plane crash last week was devastating . Our thoughts and condolences are with everyone affected by this awful incident , and we are working closely with the Indian authorities to support those in need . Nine years ago , we lost our beloved friend and colleague Jo Cox , who was a beacon of positivity and courage . Her legacy lives on . I must take this opportunity to also remember Sir David Amess , who is much missed by the whole House . This Sunday marks Windrush Day . We celebrate the extraordinary contribution of the Windrush generation and their descendants to our country . This morning , I had meetings with ministerial colleagues and others . In addition to my duties in this House , I shall have further such meetings later today .
