We want to ensure that we support young carers in school , as well as other children who may be suffering from mental health conditions . This Government are entirely committed to supporting young people with mental health conditions , and we are making sure that there will be mental health support in every school up and down the country . For young carers who may be experiencing increasing mental health conditions , we are expanding the attendance mentoring programme to ensure that around an extra 10,800 young carers are supported , especially in the area of mental health . I note the hon . Member ’s point on that specific college . As he will know , the Chancellor committed £ 1.4 billion at the Budget to drive the delivery of the current school rebuilding programme for next year . Over the coming weeks and months , we will work with trusts and local authorities to identify which schools will be in scope .
