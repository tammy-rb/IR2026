The hon . Lady began by expressing concern on behalf of her constituents . She was right to raise that . I invite her and her constituents to consider the remarks of the Metropolitan police that the prisoner is believed to be a low risk to the community . It is important to stress that in the House . It is an overriding and overwhelming priority for me to increase staff numbers , and I am pleased that they are increasing . Of course , I want them to go up further , but it is positive to note that , since 30 June , there has been an increase of more than 700 full - time equivalent band 3 to band 5 staff — wing officers up to custody managers . I accept that we have further to go . However , it is also encouraging that the resignation rate is coming down . I do not suggest for a second that the work is completed — it is not , and it is perfectly fair for the hon . Lady to raise those points — but we are moving in the right direction . On the third point , the preliminary indications , subject to the investigations that I have ordered , are that the security posts were manned in Wandsworth at the time of the incident . We now need to know , given that they were manned , what went wrong .
