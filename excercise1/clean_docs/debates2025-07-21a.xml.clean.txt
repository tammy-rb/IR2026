I welcome the Secretary of State ’s statement and these ambitious reforms . Around 10 % of the UK ’s chalk streams run through Hertfordshire , and we are lucky that Hertford and Stortford is home to many of them , including the River Stort and the River Lee . As the Secretary of State announces further action to clean up our water and the water sector , will he reassure residents of my community that this Labour Government will protect our precious local chalk streams ?
