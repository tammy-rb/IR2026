My hon . Friend is absolutely right to raise this important matter . It is clear that foreign donations to political parties in this country are not allowed , but the Government do recognise the risk posed by malign actors who seek to interfere with and undermine our democratic processes . I am sure that the relevant Secretary of State will want to continue to update the House on this important matter .
