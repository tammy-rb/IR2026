A happy new year to you , Mr Speaker , and to all colleagues . As at October 2023 , 55.4 % of civil servants are female — a rise of 0.7 percentage points compared with 1 October 2022 — and 11.7 % of the UK regular armed forces and 15.9 % of Future Reserves 2020 are women , up by 1.2 percentage points and 1.4 percentage points respectively in the past five years . That means that the trend is in the right direction , but we can do better , and I am confident that we will do so across the defence enterprise .
