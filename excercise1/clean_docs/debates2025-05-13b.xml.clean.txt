Iran is now producing roughly one significant quantity of highly enriched uranium every six weeks . That is 40 times above the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action — the deal that we struck with Iran , which I have in front of me . I am really crystal clear about this . Iran must never develop a nuclear weapon ; it must reverse its escalations — we have seen that in its enrichment programme ; it must not carry out any critical weaponisation work ; and these terms have to be fully verifiable . Unless we get that , we will see a snapback of the sanctions regime that we struck with it 10 years ago . The right hon . Lady is right . On 3 May , counter - terrorism police arrested eight individuals , including seven Iranian nationals , as part of two separate police investigations . Of course the Minister responsible for the middle east , my hon . Friend the Member for Lincoln ( Mr Falconer ) , has spoken to the Israeli ambassador . As I said , on 4 March we put Iran on the foreign influence registration scheme . We keep proscription under review . We are fully engaged with our E3 partners , and we are very pleased that Germany now has a Government so that we can work with them together on the JCPOA and snapback , and of course we are speaking to Steve Witkoff .
