I regret the Conservative carping over the Diego Garcia deal . The negotiations were started by Conservative Ministers , who conducted 11 rounds of negotiations . The agreement safeguards the effective operation of the joint UK - US base for at least 99 years . It is supported by US agencies and is welcomed by India , the African Union and the UN Security Council — almost everyone , it seems , except the Conservatives .
