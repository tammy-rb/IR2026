I am really sorry to hear the plight of Shropshire farmers . We inherited the flood defence programme in disrepair , and thanks to 14 years of mismanagement and failure , communities are unprotected and families and businesses are forced to pay the price . We launched a flood defence taskforce to turbocharge the delivery and co - ordination of flood defences , and we are investing £ 1.5 billion this year to scale up flooding national resilience . I will ensure that the hon . Lady gets a meeting with the Minister .
