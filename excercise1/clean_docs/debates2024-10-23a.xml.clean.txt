The Secretary of State went to the international summit with the First and Deputy First Ministers and they are all working together on this . The Ballymena bus manufacturer , Wrightbus , recently signed a deal worth £ 100 billion to supply more than 1,000 buses to Go - Ahead . That shows real business confidence in Northern Ireland . We are also focusing on the skills gap . I have met wonderful skills providers across Northern Ireland to talk about how we can get people into well - paid jobs and to achieve faster growth .
