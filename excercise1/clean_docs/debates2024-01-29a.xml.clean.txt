The right hon . Gentleman has some gall asking that question , bearing in mind that , during parliamentary consideration of the Trade Act 2021 , he promised to negotiate a better agreement with the EU . Now we find ourselves having worse terms of trade with Canada than we had when we were in the EU . It is striking , too , that one issue that bedevilled those discussions on the EU - Canada deal is now supported by Conservative Members . The Secretary of State specifically sought to avoid investor - state dispute settlement provisions in the bilateral deal with Canada that has now collapsed . We raised those concerns at the time . This Bill and our accession to CPTPP will not make up for the tens of millions of pounds of extra costs that manufacturers and the car industry will face when exporting to Canada due to the loss of EU cumulation rights and the higher tariffs that will result from April . This Bill will also not be much help for dairy businesses that export to Canada . Cheese exporters are now facing tariffs of 245 % , because Ministers were too late to try to stop the loss of a vital quota for tariff rate reductions . Ministers had to be woken up to this issue by questions from the Opposition .
