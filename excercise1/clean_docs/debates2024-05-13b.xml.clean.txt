I am obviously concerned to hear that case . We have just had a consultation on the possibility of moving from collect and pay to direct pay for all claimants , which would certainly help to put a greater focus on compliance . Although I am more than happy to arrange a meeting , I am not sure that one with me would be much help , because I am not in charge of child maintenance . I will ask the relevant Minister in the Lords to have a meeting with the hon . Member .
