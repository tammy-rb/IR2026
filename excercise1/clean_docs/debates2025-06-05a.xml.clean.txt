Mobile phone signal across Bromsgrove and the villages is wholly inadequate . It regularly drops out , and that is if we are lucky enough to get a signal . Things are getting worse , particularly following the rolling switch - off of 3 G signals across the country . A recent real - world study in Worcestershire demonstrated that signal is actually 1,000 times worse than operators claim it to be . Does the Leader of the House agree that this is unacceptable and that my constituents deserve better ? Will she support my efforts to secure a debate on the Floor of the House and a meeting with the Minister to discuss improvements ? My constituent Caitlyn was coerced into signing a joint lease with her abuser just four days before he was arrested on charges relating to domestic violence . He was convicted , but she is still trapped in the lease for a property that she has never lived in and she is liable for rent that he refuses to pay . The estate agents tell us that they have a legal responsibility to chase rent arrears . Survivors in Caitlyn ’s position are unable to fully move on from their abuse , even after justice has been done in the courts . Will the Leader of the House help me to arrange a meeting with the Minister for Safeguarding to discuss a legislative solution to this problem and better support for survivors of domestic violence ?
