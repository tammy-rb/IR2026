As usual , I will listen very carefully to my hon . Friend ’s suggestions . As for addresses , I do not think the election system will change between now and the second half of the year , as we have now learned . I look forward to standing in that election , whenever it comes , and for my address to be recorded as an address in the Tunbridge constituency .
