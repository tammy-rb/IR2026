I will give way to the hon . Gentleman in a moment , because he knows more about this than many who have spoken . The reality is that Tata told us that it was looking to pull out completely from the United Kingdom . If the loss of 3,000 jobs is devastating — it certainly is — how much more devastating would 5,000 be , and 12,500 jobs in the supply chain ? It was a simple choice for the Government — not a good one — between seeing 3,000 people lose their jobs or around 17,500 people lose their jobs , and possibly even more . That is why the Government committed to pay £ 500 million towards an arc furnace . Let me make one other thing clear : the Government will not pay a penny to Tata until that arc furnace is built . I understand the hon . Gentleman ’s position and he is right to stand up for his workers . This is the reality of the situation : that plan has not persuaded Tata . Tata has not said that it is credible . Tata has said to me that it could not go along with that plan , because although one of the blast furnaces — blast furnace No . 4 — has a number of years to run , it would still come to the end of the life of the coke plant and the sintering plant , so if Tata went ahead with that proposal , it would keep open one blast furnace , which is still losing a lot of money , and then have to start importing all the coke and all the sinter that it would need for it . There is then the technical problem in that Tata says it would be very difficult indeed to build an arc furnace next to a working blast furnace containing molten steel . [ Interruption . ] The hon . Gentleman can shake his head , but that is what it is saying to us . That is what it has said to us as a Government and that is why we find ourselves in the difficult , unpleasant and awful situation of having to choose between 3,000 people losing their jobs and 17,500 people losing their jobs . That is why we came to the decision we did .
