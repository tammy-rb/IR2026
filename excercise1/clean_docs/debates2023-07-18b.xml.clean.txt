I thank my right hon . Friend for his work on the report and for his campaigning . Let me also say , however , that procurement has started to improve . In 2009 - 10 , the average time delay on a project was 28 % ; it is now 15 % . The average cost overrun was 15 % on a project in 2009 - 10 ; it is now 4 % . The direction of travel is improving . The number of civil servants at DE&S went from 24,000 to 11,000 , so we are cutting away the bureaucracy and the direction of travel is improving . In my time as Secretary of State for Defence , I was also determined to put to bed some of the problem projects that we were all inheriting . I am pleased to say that , as I speak , Ajax is back on track and starting to be delivered to the units . The units are starting to train in it now . We could all have a discussion about whether we would have chosen Ajax all those years ago , but fundamentally it has not cost the taxpayer any more money and it is being delivered to our frontline . I was determined to put that right , or take other steps to deal with it . That should always be the case . The other thing that I have always tried to do , which is not in the document but which I recommend in defence procurement , is to never defer — either delete or deliver . If you defer , it costs hundreds of millions of pounds . Deferring the aircraft carrier cost £ 1 billion under the Labour Government . Deferring the F-35 cost £ 500 million . Deferrals create the black holes . Delete or deliver , but do n’t defer .
