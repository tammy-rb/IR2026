The Government continue to take unprecedented action to support those who served us : through Operation Fortitude , we are ending veterans ’ rough sleeping ; Operation Restore encourages supporting their health and wellbeing ; and Operation Prosper is an employment pathway to help veterans secure high - value jobs . We are also planning to publish the UK ’s first draft veterans Bill , representing another step forward in our journey to make this the best country in the world in which to be a veteran .
