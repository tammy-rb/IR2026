Whenever my right hon . Friend and other members of the Conservative shadow defence team bring up the question of reopening this lawfare against our veterans , Government Ministers say , “ We will be sure to give veterans maximum support . ” To me , that implies not protecting them from the lawfare , but supporting them as they go through the process ; but the process is the punishment . Everybody knows that people involved in fatal accidents would serve only a limited prison term if , heaven forbid , they were convicted , but the probability is that they will not be convicted ; the punishment lies in what they have to go through before they are acquitted .
