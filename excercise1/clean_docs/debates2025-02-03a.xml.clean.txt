I would like to take this opportunity to welcome the Under - Secretary of State for Work and Pensions , my hon . Friend the Member for Swansea West ( Torsten Bell ) , to his post as Pensions Minister , and to place on record my personal thanks to his predecessor , my hon . Friend the Member for Wycombe ( Emma Reynolds ) , for all her hard work . Our new Public Authorities ( Fraud , Error and Recovery ) Bill will update the Department ’s powers to tackle fraud for the first time in more than years , including enabling our serious and organised crime investigators to apply for a warrant ; enter and search premises for evidence ; seize items such as computers and phones ; and bring criminal gangs to justice .
