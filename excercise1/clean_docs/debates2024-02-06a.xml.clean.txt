Eighty - five per cent of the funds recovered from the loan charge so far — about £ 3.9 billion in total — have come from the employees , therefore those who were running those schemes , so the hon . Lady is mischaracterising where we have gone so far . There has been one criminal conviction so far ; others are in place . I repeat what I said to the Opposition spokesman , the hon . Member for Ealing North ( James Murray ) , earlier : if they were that concerned about ensuring we go after the wrongdoers , they would have voted with us last night in the Finance Bill .
