I refer to my entry in the Register of Members ’ Financial Interests ; my former colleagues at the MCS Foundation have provided research in support of the Bill . I want to pick up on the hon . Gentleman ’s point about timescales , because in my experience this issue is the one that is raised most commonly by residents wanting to see action . Why on earth , they say , are new homes being put up without solar panels on them ? Time is of the essence , but is it not the case that we have already lost many opportunities to progress ? Regulations were due to come into force in 2016 that would have required all new homes to have zero carbon standards . Those regulations were scrapped by the coalition Government . [ Hon . Members : “ No , they were n’t . ” ] The briefing I have had says that they were scrapped in 2014 . [ Interruption . ] Either way , I am pleased to see cross - party support today to press ahead with this proposal at speed . Does the hon . Gentleman agree that speed is of the essence here to ensure that homes are not being put up without solar panels ?
