I am looking carefully at where we are with the plans for this year — obviously , there is a half - way point in that cycle — and at what policies we can put in place . At the beginning of October , the Chancellor announced a freeze on recruitment . I will be looking at what we need to do now to ensure that , as we move into future financial years , we use the benefits of efficiencies that exist and different ways of delivering services , which we can learn from across the globe and the private sector , so that we get value for money for all those who are employed and do a good job in the civil service .
