I am obviously going to have to repeat myself several times . I have set out clearly what is new today : the psychological support and the appointment of the necessary expert , in a matter of days , to take forward the work needed to get to the point where a comprehensive response can happen . We have committed to when the timetable will happen with respect to the final inquiry , and we are doing everything we can to reach that . While I recognise that that is a matter of three or four months further down the road , I am trying to make sure that , when the response comes , it is as comprehensive as it possibly can be , addressing all the dimensions of the misery that the hon . Lady movingly spoke about .
