We have the most robust export licensing regime in the world , and I am proud of that . That was a matter that this House voted on just a few years ago under the last Government , and the right hon . Gentleman will know that we made a decision to restrict arms sales to Israel that could be used in Gaza . I also refer him to the statements that I have made about Iran ’s nuclear intent , the work of the IAEA , the huge global concern and the UN resolution that the UK did so much to secure last Thursday . I call to mind the work of the IAEA , and refer my hon . Friend to the resolution of the UN Security Council just last week , all of which confirmed Iran ’s intent and its deception .
