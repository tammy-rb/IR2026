The health transformation programme that I mentioned will allow the introduction of a modern digital service , which is certainly not how the existing arrangements could be characterised . It is a big job — the programme will run until 2029 — but the outcome from it will be a process that is simpler and easier to understand , which I hope will reduce the stress to which the hon . Member has rightly drawn attention , and shorten decision times .
