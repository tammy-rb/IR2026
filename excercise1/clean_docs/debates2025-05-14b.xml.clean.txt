Maternity services in Yeovil are due to shut on Monday , after a deeply flawed Care Quality Commission inspection in January , and are to be moved to Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton , which does not have capacity for an extra 1,300 births a year . Although the closure is initially for six months , I have received no guarantee that the services will open again , which is creating huge fear . Will the Prime Minister or the relevant Minister agree to meet me and colleagues from the south - west to stop this decision ?
