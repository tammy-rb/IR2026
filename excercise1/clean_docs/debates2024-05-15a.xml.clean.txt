I know that this issue is very emotive . For all of us with constituents who are worried about their pension age , I remind them that pension credit provides a safety net for people on low incomes , so they should look at the benefits calculator on gov.uk . There will be a full debate on the ombudsman ’s report tomorrow , and the Government will take all views into account as we identify and implement the next steps . The ombudsman ’s report is complex and substantial , and the investigation covers 30 years . I appreciate that all parties want to see the situation resolved as quickly as possible . As the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has said , there will be no undue haste , and we will be listening to everyone .
