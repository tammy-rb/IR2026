At Fletton Quays in my constituency , managed by Gateway Properties , leasehold residents are reporting that service charges have increased by as much as 150 % in the last two years . Flats are under warranty and faults should be fixed by Western Homes , which built the property , but instead are being fixed by Gateway , which has increased the service charge and , I understand , has even been sending separate bills on top . I know that the Government have been keen to address issues relating to high service charges and the need for financial transparency for leaseholders ; can the Secretary of State provide an update on that work ?
