As the hon . Gentleman will realise , this is an operational matter for the Metropolitan police , and I am sure that they will provide further commentary at some point . I would be delighted to pay tribute to Dawn and the Rugby Street Pastors for their excellent work . Many street pastors around the country do really important work in keeping people safe and secure on nights out .
