I thank my hon . Friend for his speech and for highlighting the gaps that exist in local government . I am sure he will recognise that , as the Local Government Association and the National Housing Federation have said , only 80 % of local authorities have the capacity at the moment — in fact , it could be far less . Does he agree that that is a real concern ?
