I am grateful to have secured today ’s Adjournment debate on an issue that affects communities across the country : the condition of our roads . Although I will focus on the situation in Cheshire and in my constituency of Chester South and Eddisbury , and on what I believe is a failure by local authorities to get to grips with the issue , I will begin by setting the context and reflecting on the broader systemic problems with how we repair and maintain our road network . The Public Accounts Committee recently published a report on the condition and maintenance of local roads in England . It shows that this problem is widespread ; that the Department for Transport does not have a good grasp of the real condition of local roads in England ; and that funding arrangements to local authorities are likely to be pushing them to focus spending on short - term , reactive work . In my view , this reactive rather than proactive approach to road maintenance in Cheshire urgently needs to change . Instead of neglected routes being identified and tackled , particularly in rural areas , we see a pattern of piecemeal catch - ups on individual potholes rather than long - term , cost - effective repairs that offer real value for money .
