It is not entirely dependent on our AstraZeneca programme , and indeed , as I have already pointed out , the piece of work in which it was intending to invest — I hope I will get the science right — was changing the way in which it would create the nasal flu vaccine for children from an egg - based to a cell - based system . It has now decided not to do that , but to stick to the egg - based system . I think that if the chief scientific adviser or the chief medical officer has anything on which to update the House , he and/or she will do so .
