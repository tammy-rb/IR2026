Last month , I had the honour of visiting RBSL — Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land — in my constituency . Along with many defence companies and organisations , it is so proud of its effort to help Britain to defend itself here and around the world . The SDR provides certainty to industry , but we need to go further to ensure that every Government agency , body and Department — from skills and infrastructure to planning and the availability of land — gets behind its ethos . Does the Secretary of State agree that creating growth cluster zones will provide certainty to local communities and assist in that mission ?
