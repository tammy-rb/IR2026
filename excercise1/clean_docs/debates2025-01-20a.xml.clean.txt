I will be getting to 42 slightly earlier than the hon . Gentleman , as it is my 42nd birthday is tomorrow — I look forward to the cards in the post . More seriously , on the phasing of the programme , we have taken an approach that ensures that we can stand up and look his constituents and others in the eye , and say that we have an affordable programme that can be delivered according to the timetable that is set out . I know people will be disappointed by the length of time it will take and I am genuinely sorry that they were led up the garden path by our predecessors . That is why we have taken an approach that says that honesty is the best policy . We would rather be up front about the length of time and in the meantime ensure we are delivering the investment and reform needed to reduce waiting times and improve primary , community and social care services , so even as work continues to prepare for the Royal Berkshire hospital scheme , his constituents and others across Berkshire will begin to experience an improving NHS under Labour , as opposed to the broken one they experienced under the Conservatives .
