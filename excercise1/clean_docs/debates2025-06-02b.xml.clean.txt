Further to that point of order , Mr Speaker . We have followed—[Interruption . ] You want an answer from me , Mr Speaker , and I will certainly give you this : we have followed the procedure from the last defence review , when the shadow Defence Secretary , the hon . Member for South Suffolk ( James Cartlidge ) , was a Defence Minister . I was the shadow Defence Secretary at that time . We had no advance copy of the defence review . We were not offered a briefing , which I have offered him and the other Front Benchers . I am really concerned to ensure that the House has proper access to the report , but we have been following convention . You are quite right , Mr Speaker , that copies of the defence review are in the Vote Office , as is established procedure . They would normally be made available when I sat down after my statement . In these circumstances , following your encouragement , I suggest that Members of this House be given access to them in advance of my statement .
