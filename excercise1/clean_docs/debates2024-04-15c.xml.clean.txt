All trans children and young people deserve access to high - quality and timely healthcare and support . Around 100 studies have not been included in the Cass report , and we need to know why . The Secretary of State is obviously not concerned about the way that the Cass report has been used to perpetuate a broader hostile environment towards trans people in the UK — a hostile environment created in part by the Government ’s delay in reforming the Gender Recognition Act 2004 . Misrepresenting the report , and the high - and - mighty attitude from the Secretary of State , helps no one . Will she commit to the extra funding needed to help young people have a holistic approach to their healthcare pathway ?
