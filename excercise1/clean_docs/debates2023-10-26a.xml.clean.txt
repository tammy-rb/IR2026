The hon . Gentleman makes a fair point . The wait times for theory driving tests are within target . He is absolutely right to draw the House ’s attention to the fact that there is currently a longer waiting time for practical driving tests . That is why both I and the roads Minister , the Under - Secretary of State for Transport , my hon . Friend the Member for North West Durham ( Mr Holden ) , have tasked the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency , which has a plan to get back within target in the next few months , exactly to help those constituents of the hon . Gentleman who are keen to get their practical test and get on the road , so that they can take advantage of the freedom that being able to drive offers . I am sure the hon . Lady , my neighbour , welcomed the news yesterday evening that Go North East and Unite the union have managed to reach a settlement in the north - east . That is quite good news . I am sure she will also welcome the £ 163.5 million that we have put into bus service improvement plans , which include the option to do bus franchising . This Government have been happy to make that available to all local authorities .
