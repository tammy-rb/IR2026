I am delighted to rise today to bring before the House our landmark Energy Bill for its consideration . This world - leading , historic Bill — a Conservative Bill — will deliver for this country cleaner , cheaper and more secure energy . It will level up this country , while contributing to levelling down bills for the British people . It will unleash new technology , liberate private investment in clean technologies , modernise and future - proof our energy network , and deliver for this country and for future generations . The United Kingdom already has a great story to tell on reducing our carbon emissions . We have reduced our emissions faster than any other G7 nation . We were the first European nation to legislate for net zero . We have the first oil and gas basin dedicated to going net zero and the first , second , third and fourth - largest offshore wind farms in the world operating and generating power off the coast of Great Britain right now . We have eliminated our reliance on coal . We have grown to more than 40 % of energy being generated by renewables . We have announced further investment in carbon capture , usage and storage , and we are pressing ahead with Great British Nuclear , which I launched two months ago with an exciting programme for small modular reactors . We are on track to deliver 24 GW of nuclear power on the grid by 2025 .
