It is a pleasure to have sat through the Committee stage of the Bill and to hear the Government talk about the advantages we have from Brexit . I am pleased to hear that the Government have looked , and continue to look , extensively at the taxation system — in particular at the interpretation of VAT , as mentioned in this clause . One interpretation of VAT in this country massively affects people who are visually impaired and those who can not read , perhaps because of dyslexia : there is no VAT on books , but the Treasury apply VAT at 5 % to audiobooks . If that interpretation of VAT is to be taken as far as it possibly can , I am disappointed that disabled people are not being protected within the structure of the Bill , in the way that they have been for many years . Years ago , when I was disabilities Minister , I was told that VAT changes could not happen because we were in the EU . We are no longer in the EU and we can set our VAT rates as we would like . It would be fundamentally good if the Government came forward with an interpretation of VAT that said that people who rely on audiobooks , through no fault of their own , do not have to be penalised by VAT at 5 % . I am not talking only about the visually impaired — I declare an interest : I am dyslexic and rely on audiobooks , although not completely . People who do not read Braille are being punished as well . The Government continue to look at new taxation rules and new ways of making sure that people do not get around the taxation system , and it is clear that they are looking at the implementation of VAT . What better spring present for those who rely on audiobooks than for the Minister to say that he will meet me , talk about the issue further and perhaps look at the early - day motion in my name ?
