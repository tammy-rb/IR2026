We take very seriously the work that the Defence Committee does ; we enjoy reading the Committee ’s reports and , as I hope members of the Committee and of the House recognise , often take the findings into policy . I do push back gently , however , because in addition to the incredible work of QRA and the support the Royal Air Force has given to NATO missions over the last 18 months , since the start of the war in Ukraine , they have also been able to support carrier strike deployments , deployment on Exercise Red Flag , and indeed the deployment of a below squadron in strength , all the way across to Australia . That gets to exactly what I told my hon . Friend the Member for Witney ( Robert Courts ) : that this ability to deploy air force with greater agility , further from home , in more austere settings , is a step change for the Royal Air Force , allowing it to operate from more austere environments rather than solely from its home bases .
