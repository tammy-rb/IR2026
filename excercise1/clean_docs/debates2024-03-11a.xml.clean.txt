I am sure that the hon . Gentleman will be delighted to learn that apprenticeship starts are up by 3 % so far this year . That is because they are backed by record investment of £ 2.7 billion . Never before has a Government invested so much into high - quality apprenticeships and achieved so much in spreading opportunity across the country . As always , Labour Front Benchers are obsessed with quantity over quality . We have transformed the quality of apprenticeships . Seventy per cent of occupations are covered by over 680 apprenticeship standards . There has been a 6 % increase since this time last year in the number of under-19 starts , and overall starts are up by 3 % over the same period . The crucial thing is achievement , which is up by 22 % . Female STEM starts are up by 7.5 % , starts by people with disabilities are up by 6.3 % , and starts by people from ethnic minorities are up by 15.4 % , compared with 10.6 % in 2010 . Not only are we focusing on quality over quantity ; we are improving the number of starts and achievements too . My hon . Friend speaks a lot of wisdom . I congratulate Vandyke Upper School on its work . I have been to apprenticeship fairs and careers days at the Oasis Academy in Brislington . Huge amounts of work are going on with the careers enterprise company and the apprenticeship ambassador network , to ensure that there is a network member engaged at every secondary school and college . I have mentioned some of the other things we are doing to promote careers and apprenticeships in all our schools .
