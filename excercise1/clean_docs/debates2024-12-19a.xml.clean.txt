For now . For now , yes . I think the hon . Gentleman has made his point . My hon . Friend will be aware that foreign donations are not permitted in our electoral system , and that is absolutely as it should be . Our democracy does face daily threats from rogue states , rogue actors and others who try to disrupt it and to spread myth and disinformation , and these are issues that we should be very alive to . A merry Christmas to you , Madam Deputy Speaker , and to everyone across Parliament and in my constituency . Thornbury and Yate residents driving home for Christmas will face a second festive season of chaos on local roads , with at least one more still to come , thanks to the ongoing closure of the A432 M4 over - bridge . There is no conversation with the small businesses affected , or with residents living on the now choked local country lanes . Given that hundreds , if not thousands , of such post - tensioned bridges were built in the 1960s , ’ 70s and ’ 80s , this horror could be coming to many constituencies , but I have so far been unable to secure a debate on this important topic . Will the Leader of the House ensure that we can discuss the issue in the new year ?
