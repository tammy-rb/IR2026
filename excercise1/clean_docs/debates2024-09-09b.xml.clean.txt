Qualifications must deliver on our missions , enhancing and spreading opportunity , and growing our economy . The last Conservative Government botched the roll - out of T - levels and defunded them . That is why this Labour Government have announced a pause and review of qualifications reforms , to support skills growth and students , and to bring certainty where there has been chaos . This short , focused review , along with other measures , such as the curriculum assessment review and the creation of Skills England , will allow the Government to improve skills training , unlock opportunity and harness talent . It is certainly the case that there is a big workforce challenge , and making sure that we have specialists in critical areas is a central part of making sure children and young people can access the support they need . Our school support staff will play a crucial role in that , which is why Labour will reinstate the school support staff negotiating body . We will make sure that teachers have more training alongside support staff , in order to deliver better support and education for our young people , and this year we are investing over £ 21 million to train 400 more educational psychologists .
