Mr Speaker , it will not surprise you to learn that I completely disagree with the hon . Lady ’s assessment . I would point out that this Government have provided the transition board with £ 80 million . We have not seen any of the £ 20 million that the Welsh Labour Government have promised , but indications so far are that moving away from steelmaking would not have a direct impact on national security .
