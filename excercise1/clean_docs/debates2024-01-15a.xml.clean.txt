It is a pleasure to speak on Third Reading . It was important , when the Animal Welfare ( Kept Animals ) Bill was set aside , that a commitment was made to bring legislation forward , and this is a key element of it . It is a key element of our manifesto commitment that we will fulfil , and frankly the other House should stop bleating about this element . We will get the other aspects done . I myself am taking a private Member ’s Bill through that covers one elements of the kept animals Bill . We should not be playing tit for tat on this . It is about something that really matters , the welfare of animals , and this is a really important stage . The Minister has read out a litany of what we have achieved in our time in office . The one person who can not speak in this debate is my hon . Friend the Member for West Dorset ( Chris Loder ) , who took through the Animal Welfare ( Sentencing ) Act 2021 with the support of the Government . As the chief executive of the RSPCA said , that was a monumental moment for animal welfare legislation , empowering the courts to hand out sentences that more accurately reflect the seriousness of these crimes . I strongly support the Bill . I say to the House , and to the other House , that it is a simple , straightforward Bill and it could get through by the end of March and be done by Easter , without question . This is not the moment to add other elements left , right and centre . Let us keep it simple and keep our manifesto commitments . I hope the House of Lords respects the will of this House , and I look forward to the Bill not coming back but becoming an Act before the end of the spring .
