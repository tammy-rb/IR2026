I had a feeling that my hon . Friend might mention Avanti , and he knows my views . One of the first meetings I held as Secretary of State was with Avanti . I called in representatives of its Network Rail business unit for being one of the worst - performing operators — a meeting that was not held by any of my three predecessors while I was shadow Secretary of State . I made it clear that Avanti ’s level of performance will not be tolerated , and we will use all measures under its national rail contract to hold it to account . That does not exclude terminating the contract before it expires if Avanti defaults . We were promised High Speed 2 to Manchester , yet that was axed — in Manchester , no less — leaving a west coast main line that is now bursting at the seams . Meanwhile , passengers continue to suffer , with overcrowded trains and poor facilities , record - high cancellations — almost one in three trains is late — some of the most expensive fares in Europe , and regular bouts of industrial action . I call Vera Hobhouse . The A1 runs through my constituency , but the same issues also apply to the new A14 , with similar dangerous junctions . The 12 - mile section that includes the stretch between Keystone and Ellington has both crossovers and ungraded junctions . Does my hon . Friend agree that on those stretches , Highways England should introduce a reduced speed limit of 50 mph where there are dangerous junctions , as there is on the A1 , as an immediate measure prior to upgrading the junctions and improving signage ?
