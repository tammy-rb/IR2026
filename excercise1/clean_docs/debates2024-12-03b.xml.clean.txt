The hon . Member is talking about small businesses . Last week , I was proud to host the Federation of Small Businesses in Parliament . Representatives welcomed the Budget , particularly the increase in the employment allowance , which will see the smallest businesses benefit . Some 250,000 of the smallest businesses say that they are better off now than they were before the Budget . Are they wrong ?
