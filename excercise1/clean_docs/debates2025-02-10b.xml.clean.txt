I am grateful for the hon . Member ’s question — it is a good one . We are seeing more risks posed to our critical underwater infrastructure by players who wish harm to our national security . We already have brilliant capability in RAF Proteus , which is able to support our infrastructure and that of our allies . When the strategic defence review is published in the spring , I am sure that there will be more developments in that direction .
