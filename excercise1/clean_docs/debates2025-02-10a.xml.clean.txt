I rise in support of this important Bill , which is a crucial step as this Government regain control of our borders after the Conservative party lost control . My constituency is a diverse and welcoming place . We have a long and proud history of migrants from around the world coming to work and contribute to our community , and we have a proud history of welcoming refugees fleeing persecution and abuse . That compassion is part of who we are as a country , but our compassion must always come alongside control and a system that is fair . That is why my constituents are right to be angry about illegal crossings . When the last Government lost control of our borders , it risked lives and undermined our national security , and meant that people could cheat the system . It also meant that millions of pounds were being spent unnecessarily while our public services were on their knees . Enough is enough . This Government are determined to secure our borders . Whereas the Conservative party chose the path of sounding tough but failing to deliver , since the election this Government have rolled up their sleeves . Whereas the Conservative party picked fights with France , we have made landmark deals with international partners . Whereas the Conservative party spent nearly £ 9 million a day on hotels for asylum seekers , we have restarted processing to save the taxpayer £ 4 billion a year over the next two years , and to end the use of hotels . Whereas the Conservative party spent years pursuing the fiction of the Rwanda scheme to send a sum total of four volunteers , on our watch 32 charter flights have returned migrants across the world , enforced returns are up by 24 % on the year before the election , and our streets have been made safer through the removal of 2,500 foreign criminals . The Bill before us does two really important things . First , it removes from the statute book the fallacy of the Rwanda scheme — the so - called deterrent that saw 84,000 people cross the channel between the day it was announced and the day it was scrapped . Secondly , the Bill removes a hodgepodge of unenacted and unworkable clauses , whose sole purpose in law is to act as a monument to Conservative failure . Most importantly , this Bill delivers a range of counter - terror - style powers that I believe will enable us systematically to dismantle the vile criminal gangs who facilitate small boat crossings and risk lives . It introduces new offences , so that we can use every tool possible to put gang leaders away ; new powers to seize devices , check biometrics and share data ; and a new role for our new Border Security Command , so that we can ensure that all agencies work together . No more empty rhetoric ; instead , a common - sense , intelligence - led approach to border security . We are taking down the gangs and building the international relationships that we need to regain control . We have turbocharged our asylum system so that we can return people with no right to be here and allow those granted asylum the chance to work and contribute . A real plan . No more empty rhetoric from the Conservatives or Reform ; these are concrete steps to secure our borders , and I will be proud to vote for Second Reading today .
