I thank my right hon . Friend for his statement and for reminding the House about the first - time funding for coal tips . I notice that the Plaid Cymru Member , the hon . Member for Ynys Môn ( Llinos Medi ) , mentioned coal tips , but she could not leave the Chamber quickly enough — she could not wait for the end of the statement . I pay tribute to the local authorities , emergency services , volunteers and all those affected by Storm Bert in Cardiff , in Rhondda Cynon Taf and across south Wales . May I ask my right hon . Friend to speak to colleagues in the Department for Science , Innovation and Technology about looking carefully into the role of the Met Office ? It is clear that its response was slow and that there was an underestimation of the impact of Storm Bert : it put out a yellow rather than an amber or red warning . Our constituents have been let down by this incompetence before . It can not keep happening .
