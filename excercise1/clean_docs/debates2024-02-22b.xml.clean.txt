I rise to present this petition on behalf of my constituents in Hornsey and Wood Green , who are angry and disappointed that Barclays bank wishes to close its busy Crouch End branch , barely a year after it closed its Muswell Hill branch . Before that , it closed the Wood Green and Highgate village branches . It must be a world record for four branches of one bank to close in an area . It is deeply disappointing that a bank started off by Quakers in the 1690s has such a poor sense of how to serve its community . Many of those who signed my petition are older residents . They told me that they feel “ left out and discriminated against ” because they are being pushed online when they want to talk to “ people not machines ” . A lot said how anxious they were about becoming victims of fraud and how to travel to the next bank would take a round trip of an hour on two buses . Almost half of all banks across the country that were open in 2015 have closed . That is bad for customers , bad for businesses and bad for our dying high streets , and action needs to be taken . The petition states : “ The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urge the Government to act to protect essential in - person banking services . ” Following is the full text of the petition : [ The petition of residents of Hornsey and Wood Green , Declares that the petitioners are extremely disappointed at the announcement of the closure of Halifax 's Muswell Hill branch in November 2023 , further notes that bank branches are the heart of communities , and are relied upon by local communities , especially old and disabled people , those who need access to cash and those without internet banking ; further notes that they are also vital for local businesses . The petitioners therefore request that the House of Commons urge the Government to act to protect essential in - person banking services . And the petitioners remain , etc . ] [ P002857 ]
