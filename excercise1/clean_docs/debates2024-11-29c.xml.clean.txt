My hon . Friend briefly mentioned coercion , and the well - held fears of many of us in the House about the risk of coercion , particularly for vulnerable people . What does he make of the fact that in Washington state , where the relevant law is restricted to terminally ill people like this Bill , last year 59 % of those who went through with an assisted death did so because they feared being “ a burden ” to “ family , friends or care givers ” ? In Oregon , the proportion last year was 43 % .
