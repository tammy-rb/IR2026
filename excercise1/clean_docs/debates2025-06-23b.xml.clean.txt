Child poverty is a significant challenge in the north - east , and that is why it is right that Mayor Kim McGuinness participated in an early session of the taskforce and has shaped the agenda since then . The child poverty reduction unit engages regularly with colleagues from the north - east and will hold a dedicated session on strategy with the north - east child poverty commission this week . Mayors have been absolutely critical to the development of the strategy , and we will continue to work closely with them .
