I welcome the Prime Minister ’s recent comments about supporting and enabling the expansion of nuclear power stations in the UK through small modular reactors . The science and technology is well proven but other aspects must be developed alongside , including the provision of appropriate grade nuclear fuel and a permanent solution for nuclear waste . In recent days , I have met representatives of Urenco , a specialist provider of uranium enrichment and fuel and nuclear waste services , which is developing plans for the UK ’s first geological disposal facility . Will the Leader of the House make time for a debate on all aspects of the nuclear jigsaw , to ensure a joined - up and sustainable energy future ?
