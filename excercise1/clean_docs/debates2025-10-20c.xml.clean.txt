I recognise the challenge that we have seen , in part because of the big numbers of 16 to 19 - year - olds we have coming through the system . That is why we are prioritising investing in 16 - to-19 funding for our colleges and ensuring we have more capital available to create the places that are necessary , working with local areas . Running alongside that are our technical colleges , which will drive up standards , spread best practice and be hubs of excellence in their regions working with other colleges .
