I refer hon . Members to my entry in the register of interests . At his first Prime Minister ’s Question Time in July last year , I asked the Prime Minister to reassure my constituents that they would have a meaningful say over the new development in the green belt in their area . He said that the Government “ will work with communities”—but this Bill could not be further from that promise . We are seeing housing targets go through the roof in rural areas , as green - belt protections are removed . In my local councils of East Herts and Broxbourne , the targets are going up by more than 20 % and within Broxbourne district specifically they are almost doubling . The loss of protections for unrestricted sprawl around the villages I represent is extremely worrying for my constituents who live in those villages of Brickenden , Hertford Heath , Great Amwell , Stanstead Abbotts and St Margarets , as their unique character and historical charm could be lost forever . At the same time , targets are going down in London , where there is the infrastructure to cope . The plans do not add up . There is something in this Bill on which I can agree with the Government : the explanatory notes state that limited infrastructure delivery is a real cost on the lives of working people . I completely agree . It is far too common for new housing to be built without the increase in public service capacity to match .
