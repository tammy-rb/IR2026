I thank the hon . Member for his question . Many of these issues were raised when the statutory instrument passed through Parliament . The Under - Secretary of State for Justice , my hon . Friend the Member for Finchley and Golders Green ( Mike Freer ) , who is the courts Minister , has written to the Senior President of Tribunals to convey those concerns , and I think that is in part why my noble and learned Friend is meeting the Senior President of Tribunals tomorrow .
