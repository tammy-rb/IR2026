I met several union leaders a few weeks ago . On 2 October , the Chancellor announced that the civil service would be capped at the levels that were current at that time , which would save up to £ 1 billion against the trajectory that was then in place . As of September 2023 , there were 496,150 civil servants . It is an important Government responsibility to ensure that we have the right number of civil servants performing effectively and efficiently in public service , and we will continue to work on that . One of the strengths of the Union of the United Kingdom is that we can choose different ways of doing things , often achieving the same outcomes and certainly sharing our objectives . She will know this Government ’s record in this area : we have 1 million fewer workless households and , based on recent figures , we have lifted more than 500,000 children out of poverty . We all must work on these things , whatever particular systems cover our nations .
