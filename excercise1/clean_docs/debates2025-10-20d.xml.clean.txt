The Government made big decisions at the spending review to increase the overall funding available to 16 - to-19 courses . Next financial year , there will be an increase of over £ 800 million . That means that per - pupil funding is going up substantially . The large programme uplift sits on top of that , and the Government have made the decision to prioritise the large programme uplift for students doing multiple A - levels in science , technology , engineering and maths subjects . We still support the international baccalaureate and recognise it as a programme that can work for many students .
