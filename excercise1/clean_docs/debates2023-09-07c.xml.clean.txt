The Public Authorities ( Accountability ) Bill — the Hillsborough law — would require public authorities to admit responsibility following adverse and mass casualty incidents . Some 97 people died as a result of Hillsborough , and a scandalous cover - up went on for decades . Would the hon . Gentleman agree with me , my constituents in the Gallery and other constituents in the Gallery , that it is time to end the cover - up and to establish how many people have died prematurely as a result of Primodos ?
