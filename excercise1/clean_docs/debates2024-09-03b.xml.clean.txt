I am grateful to the hon . Member for raising those important points . On the UK ’s support , we have doubled the official development assistance contribution , recognising the severity of this crisis . I announced another £ 50 million of vital assistance on 22 August , bringing that up to £ 97 million , which will be focused on where it is possible to operate in Sudan . Much of the country is very difficult to access , including for humanitarian bodies and for those fleeing to South Sudan and Chad . The hon . Member talked about neighbouring countries . There are a number of countries that we would urge not to engage in destabilising activity ; I mentioned that point to the shadow Development Minister . Any activity that is not focused on humanitarian support or promoting peace is prolonging the war , worsening the humanitarian situation and creating a legacy for the future that will be difficult to deal with . We are seeing large numbers of unaccompanied children , for example — a really disturbing situation . We want that message to be heard loud and clear . I am grateful to the hon . Member for raising that point . I mentioned that the UK is supporting the Centre for Information Resilience , a research body that is gathering evidence of what is taking place on the ground . For example , funding is being provided for the Sudan witness project , which is investigating attacks against civilians and infrastructure . On the specific finding of genocide , I am clear that that is an internationally focused definition , but we are concerned that we are seeing patterns of violence that bear the hallmarks of that kind of development , so we are keeping that very closely under review .
