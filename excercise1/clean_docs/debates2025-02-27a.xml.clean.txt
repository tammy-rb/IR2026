I will not . After years of deadlock , it was this UK Government that stepped up with £ 25 million for the Welsh Government to keep coal tips safe . There is no better illustration of the new relationship between the two Governments than that co - operation on a matter that I know is of concern for people in former coalmining communities across Wales . Today ’s debate has raised some important issues and we have had some excellent contributions from colleagues . I will run through a few , such as that of my hon . Friend the Member for Neath and Swansea East ( Carolyn Harris ) . Whenever I hear the word “ Neath ” , I just think of the “ Neath , Neath , Neath ! ” rugby chant . That was definitely a “ Neath , Neath , Neath ! ” speech . On the contribution by the Member for Chester South and Eddisbury ( Aphra Brandreth ) , I recognise , having grown up very near to the border , the economic , cultural and personal ties that she described . My hon . Friend the Member for Newport East ( Jessica Morden ) asked for a meeting with her colleagues to talk about Newport . I will be delighted to do that . My hon . Friend the Member for Monmouthshire ( Catherine Fookes ) talked about the 21st century schools programme , as did my hon . Friend the Member for Clwyd North ( Gill German ) . My hon . Friend the Member for Monmouthshire also paid tribute , which I echo , to all the public sector workers of Wales . To my hon . Friend the Member for Wrexham ( Andrew Ranger ) , I was delighted to see Wrexham AFC promoted last season . I went to the game against Stockport at the end of the season and have , in my time , drunk quite a lot of that famous export , Wrexham Lager . My hon . Friend the Member for Cardiff West ( Mr Barros- Curtis ) talked about the political DNA in his constituency and about Ely , and I recognised his descriptions of the sports clubs . I have spent many weekends on the touchlines of pitches in Cardiff West and it is great to see the clubs going from strength to strength . My hon . Friend the Member for Montgomeryshire and Glyndŵr ( Steve Witherden ) gave a passionate speech about the history of his constituency , which is full of people with big hearts . He definitely has a big heart . My hon . Friend the Member for Mid and South Pembrokeshire ( Henry Tufnell ) mentioned his constituency ’s proud city of St David ’s and the £ 1 million regional skills fund that we have recently announced for Pembrokeshire . I was very interested to hear mention from the hon . Member for East Grinstead and Uckfield ( Mims Davies ) of her Wind Street escapades . I had some of those as well , so maybe we should have a chat outside the Chamber about that at some point . I want to wish everybody a very happy St David ’s Day . I thank them for their contributions and I look forward to celebrating on Saturday .
