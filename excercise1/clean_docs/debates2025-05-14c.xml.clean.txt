We have seen the contempt in which the Government hold the WASPI — Women Against State Pension Inequality Campaign — women , pensioners and the disabled , and their contempt for Scotland ’s energy sector , job creators and the hospice sector , but that is all a function of policy . Policy is discretional and therefore , for better or worse — usually worse — legitimate . Adhering to the ministerial code is not a matter of discretion . To be honest , it is a little beneath the Leader of the House to say , “ We do n’t announce things to Parliament first every time , but we do some of the time , and sometimes the House is n’t sitting . ” Every example presented to her today relates to a time when the House was sitting . When will she relay to the Government and the Prime Minister that Members are severely annoyed by the Government ’s repeated inaction ? For her information , contrary to what is being said by the three Scottish craws sitting on a wall behind her , there is no such duty on Scottish Government Ministers as that set out in section 9.1 of the ministerial code .
