On 30 April 1999 , three nail bombs went off in London , killing four and injuring 140 . One of them exploded at Brick Lane , the hub of London ’s Bengali community ; one exploded in Soho , at the Admiral Duncan pub , the heart of London ’s gay district ; and one exploded in Brixton , in an attack on south London ’s black community . The sick terrorist who committed those evil acts was motivated by hatred . He hated Bengalis and black people because of their race . He hated LGBT people because of who they love and how they live their lives . He hated those groups because they were different from him . He hated them because of who they are . I raise that appalling incident to remind the House that hatred comes in many forms , but whoever in our society it is against , we must all stand equally strongly against it . We must have hate crime laws that show that whether the hatred is for someone ’s race , religion , sexual orientation , gender identity or disability , Britain is a country that will not tolerate it ; that all hatred is equal ; and that all those who commit vile acts of hatred will face the same grave consequences . I regret to say that that is not currently the case . Today the law recognises five categories of hate crime — race , religion , sexual orientation , transgender identity and disability — but only two , race and religion , are treated as aggravated offences subject to stronger sentencing powers ; the other three are not . That discrepancy can not be right . We can not say , as a society , that some forms of hatred are more evil than others . I was at university when section 28 was introduced — I remember it vividly . It was more than a law ; it was an attack on the right of people like me to live openly . It stigmatised lesbians , gays and bisexual people ; and it pushed us out of public life . I went into politics to fight that cruel law and everything it represented . Hate corrodes our entire society . It does not just harm the individuals who are targeted ; it creates fear — fear to go outside , fear to speak up , fear to be seen . It silences people . It makes us all afraid . Research by Stonewall found that less than half of LGBT+ people felt safe holding their partner ’s hand in public . That is the impact that the fear of hatred has on people . It makes them afraid even to show the world that they exist . Unfortunately , far too many recorded crimes never result in charges . Of 11,000 disability hate crimes recorded by police , 320 led to prosecutions . Of 22,000 homophobic hate crimes , 3,118 led to prosecutions . Of 4,000 hate crimes against transgender people , only 137 led to prosecutions . Behind those statistics are real people , whose scars may heal on the outside but who may never recover from the fear and trauma that they have suffered . In 2024 , a teenage far - right extremist was jailed for targeting and attacking a transgender woman . Along with another young man , he kicked her to the ground in a park in Swansea and hurled transphobic abuse at her . In 2022 , Cassie , a PhD student and wheelchair user , was waiting outside a shop when two drunk men grabbed her wheelchair , pushed her down the road and made sexual comments . She had to escape by rolling into traffic . We must fight back against this hatred . We must show that we are not content to stick with the status quo . The victims of these attacks deserve to live in a society that says that we take this hatred seriously and will not stand for it . Victims must be at the heart of our criminal justice system , and we must ensure that laws protect them . That is why my new clause 122 is so important . LGBT and disabled people tell me that they do not feel as safe as they used to . We are seeing rising transphobia everywhere . Pride flags are being taken down at county halls , and some politicians are openly questioning whether disabilities are even real . I am proud that Labour , in our manifesto , committed to equalising our hate crime laws by making hate crimes against LGBT people and disabled people aggravated offences . I am proud to be bringing forward that change through new clause 122 . I hope that I can persuade all my parliamentary colleagues to support the new clause today , and to take this important step forward for equal rights . I thank my hon . Friends the Members for Burton and Uttoxeter ( Jacob Collier ) and for Penistone and Stocksbridge ( Dr Tidball ) for standing shoulder to shoulder with me throughout this process , and I urge the House to support the new clause . As MPs , we receive a wide range of correspondence from constituents during some of the most difficult times in their lives , but the email that I received from Emma Johnson was perhaps one of the most harrowing that I have ever received . It is because of Emma ’s story that I have tabled new clause 51 , and I will speak to it today . On 18 November 2022 , Emma had just gone into labour with her youngest child . Mother and child were okay when she received a call informing her that her parents had been tragically killed in a car crash . The driver of the other vehicle had no licence and was uninsured . On what was supposed to be one of the happiest days of Emma ’s life , she instead had to identify the bodies of her parents , Ian and Gail . When the case came to court , the driver of the other vehicle was charged with the lesser offence of causing death by careless driving , rather than by dangerous driving . That produced the sentence available to the court , even though he was swerving in and out of traffic , and drove without a licence or insurance . I put it to the House that this , by its very nature , is dangerous . Since the verdict , Emma has been fighting — not for vengeance , but to make sure that no other family has to suffer the same injustice . She has sought justice not just for her parents , but for other people who face the same heartbreak . She is calling for a simple but vital change : any driver who kills while driving without a licence or insurance should automatically face the more serious offence of causing death by dangerous driving . Today I say directly to Emma , who I know is watching , that I fundamentally agree with you . Your dedication to the cause is commendable , and you are doing your late parents proud . We know that road accidents happen , but if someone wilfully gets behind the wheel of a car when unlicensed and uninsured , and swerves in and out of traffic , that is not an accident ; it is a dangerous choice to put others ’ lives at risk . New clause 51 would rightly treat such behaviour as seriously as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol . It would close a loophole in the current law and bring greater justice for victims . If the new clause does not progress today , I ask the Minister to meet me and Emma to ensure that her campaign continues .
