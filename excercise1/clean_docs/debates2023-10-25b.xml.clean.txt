Let me say to the hon . Lady that as someone who was hospitalised after being attacked because of my sexuality , I know how difficult that is . It is not just the attack that is painful but what is left afterwards . I will continue to raise each of these issues , but I want to make this point . I keep hearing that we do not care about LGBT issues . It was this Government who introduced same - sex marriage , and it was this Government who introduced it in Northern Ireland . It was this Government who introduced Turing ’s law in 2017 . We have modernised gender recognition certificates and made them affordable . We have removed self - funding for fertility treatment for same sex - couples , lifted the ban on blood donation , and tackled LGBT - related bullying in schools . We have apologised for the way in which LGBT people were treated in the armed forces , and we have provided funding to ensure that LGBT rights across the Commonwealth are protected .
