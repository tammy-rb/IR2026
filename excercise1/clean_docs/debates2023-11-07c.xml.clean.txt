I am not sure about the link between that and energy security , but I can tell the hon . Gentleman that thanks to the efforts of my right hon . Friend the Member for Plymouth , Moor View ( Johnny Mercer ) , veterans ’ homelessness is at record low levels in this country . Rough sleeping overall is down by around a third since the peak , thanks to the actions of this Government and in particular the landmark Homelessness Reduction Act 2017 — passed by this Government — which has helped relieve or prevent more than 640,000 people from becoming homelessness . Returning to energy security , the Opposition want to ban all new oil and gas licences , risking our becoming even more dependent on Putin ’s Russia for our crucial supplies of energy . What is even more absurd about their policy is this : the Leader of the Opposition is not against all oil and gas ; he is just against British oil and gas . Unlike the Opposition , who want to pursue net zero with an ideological zeal — going even faster and further no matter what the cost or the disruption — we on the Conservative Benches are cutting the cost of net zero for working people , saving British families £ 5,000 , £ 10,000 or £ 15,000 , and that is the choice .
