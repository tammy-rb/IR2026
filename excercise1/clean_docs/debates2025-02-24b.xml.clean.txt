The hon . Gentleman talks about the Government ’s policies for growing the economy . A few months ago , we held an international investment summit , at which £ 63 billion of investment was announced . As I have mentioned , there was £ 2 billion announced in the Budget for the automotive industry . Interest rates have been cut three times , wages are up , and more than 70,000 jobs have been secured in the UK since the Government came to power . The International Monetary Fund and the OECD predict that the UK will be Europe ’s fastest - growing economy over the next few years . The industrial strategy was scrapped under the last Government ; our industrial strategy will be the backbone of ensuring that we deliver growth . The hon . Gentleman asked what we were doing . I have already set out the stability , investment and reform that we are bringing to the sector to make sure that it can thrive . Hundreds of thousands of people rely on the automotive industry through their work in it , or in its supply chains . Those are good , well - paid jobs , and we are absolutely determined to ensure that the sector grows . I thank the hon . Gentleman for his kind words . I should be clear for the House that the decision has not been made to not go ahead ; this is a delay and a change in timing . BMW is committed to going ahead with the investment . At the moment , its e - Mini is being produced in China . This investment will bring it here to the UK . Lots must be done in terms of energy prices , as he says . Building a gigafactory means significant reductions in energy prices , but the wider manufacturing sector is talking to us virtually every day about these kinds of issues . Through the industrial strategy and the reforms that we want to bring in , and by spending the £ 2 billion that we were allocated in the Budget , we hope to deliver a thriving automotive industry well into the future .
