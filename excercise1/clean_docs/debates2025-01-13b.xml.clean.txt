I welcome this action plan , which mentions data centres . As the Secretary of State may be aware , the Deputy Prime Minister is currently reviewing the need for a data centre in Kings Langley in my constituency . Both the report and the Secretary of State talk about ensuring that the infrastructure is in the right place . I am working alongside my constituents in Kings Langley , because the proposed site is prime green belt . If there is a need to build on and develop the site , housing would make better sense , because energy — a huge requirement for data centres — is not available nearby . How can the Secretary of State ensure that we are not encouraging the building of white elephants in the wrong places ?
