UK exports are increasing . Using current prices , they are up by £ 21 billion compared with 2023 . The UK trade show was a pilot programme that did not yield the successes we thought it would , so we have other schemes in place , including the UK Export Academy , international trade advisers , Help to Grow and the export support service . Focusing on Wales , we will soon be appointing a new international trade adviser to help SMEs . That is an extraordinary statement , because in the hon . Lady ’s constituency the greatest level of exports is from professional and business services , and those exports are increasing not only to the EU but to countries outside the EU . That is the reality on the ground , so our strategy is working . UK exports were £ 859 billion in 2023 — a figure that has gone up , not down , by £ 21 billion . The UK is the second biggest services exporter in the world — she should be proud of that because many such businesses are in her constituency . Those exports have increased to 54 % from 48 % , so there is good news , but we are keen to do more . We can get the best explanation from looking at the data behind what the hon . Gentleman set out . He obviously omitted the international reality . In the same report , the OBR referenced the “ sluggish growth ” in “ global economies ” and mentioned that British goods and services will outperform , on average , G7 countries . Those are the facts on the ground . When it comes to exports , we are exporting not only into the EU but outside the EU . As I said earlier , professional and business services are increasing outside the EU by 19 % . We have substantial programmes in place to help small and medium - sized enterprises . We are keen to learn and do as much work as we can . There will be far more work coming through as this is the year of the SME .
