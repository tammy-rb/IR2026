The sub - postmasters have no trust or faith in the compensation processes being handled by the Post Office or the Government . Today ’s commitments will still not deal with all the inequalities in the schemes or the undue influence that the Post Office still has on the process . Echoing the sentiments of some of my hon . Friends , may I ask the Minister to agree to place the compensation schemes into an external independent body , completely outside the influence of the Post Office ? I asked the Prime Minister , as my hon . Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow ( Rushanara Ali ) has asked , about the timescales for the legislation to overturn the convictions , but we still have not got an answer . If it is not before the general election , will it be before the summer recess ? Finally , when will people be held to account for this miscarriage of justice , be it within the Government , the Post Office or Fujitsu ?
