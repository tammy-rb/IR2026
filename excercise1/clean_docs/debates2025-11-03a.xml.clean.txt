As we approach Remembrance Sunday , many of those who served in Operation Banner will reflect on comrades whom they lost , comrades who were injured and comrades who still suffer mentally as a result of their deployment in that operation — the British Army ’s longest continuous deployment . The Secretary of State has said from the Dispatch Box that his Northern Ireland Troubles Bill will bring strong protections for veterans . It does not ; it brings the same protections for everyone under that Bill , including those who possibly perpetrated murderous acts of terrorism in Northern Ireland . So what can he actually provide regarding continuous support for veterans — something set out on the face of the Bill , rather than something that is not in the legislation but is promised by Government ? The protections were put in place for veterans after consulting veterans , and they are not unimportant : the ability to stay at home and give evidence ; the protection from repeated investigations ; and the right to seek immunity in a hearing of the commission — people already have the right to seek that in a coroner ’s court . There are , of course , two other protections : the protection from cold calling and the right to be heard through the statutory advisory group that will be established , working alongside the commission , which will have representation from a member of the armed forces or a police force . Those are very practical changes that we have made , which , as I said earlier , are not contained in the current legacy Act .
