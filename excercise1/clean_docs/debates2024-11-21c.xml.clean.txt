We are absolutely clear and the figures are absolutely clear , because they are based on actual claims for agricultural property relief that have been made in recent years . Those figures show that around three quarters of claims would be unaffected by the changes we have made . Does the Conservative party accept the principle that 40 % of the total value of agricultural property relief comes from ownership of the top 7 % of claims by land value ? Do Conservative Members think that is a fair system ? Is that fair to young farmers trying to get into the industry ? Do they support the additional £ 6 billion we have put into farming as a result of the Budget ? They can not support the funding going in if they do not support the measures needed to raise that investment in the first place .
