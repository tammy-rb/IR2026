I am very happy to meet the right hon . Gentleman to discuss any cases . On the conversation with the Pakistani Government , the main concern in relation to the Triples is about moving them out of Afghanistan and into Pakistan in the first place . The agreement we have with the Pakistani Government means that anyone who is being assessed as part of the ARAP scheme will not be deported back to Afghanistan , which is really important , but there is still a requirement to make sure that we can relocate eligible individuals and their immediate families to the UK in an appropriate and reasonable way . We are continuing that work , and we are continuing the dialogue with the Pakistani Government in relation to this issue .
