The hon . Member is talking about small businesses . Last week , I was proud to host members of the Federation of Small Businesses here in Parliament , who welcomed the Budget , particularly the increase in the employment allowance , which will see the smallest businesses benefit—25,000 of the smallest businesses better off now than they were before the Budget . Are they wrong ?
