Two GPs from Seatown , in my part of Devon , moved to Australia to practise a little over two years ago . Both are working as full - time GPs , with no gaps in their career , and they now wish to return to east Devon to help ease winter pressures . Retesting someone who returns to England is lengthy , costly and bureaucratic , and it does not take into account practice in similar primary care settings . Can NHS England not make it easier for UK - trained GPs working in Australia , New Zealand or Canada to return to general practice in England ?
