My right hon . Friend is absolutely right . In the UK , of course , we have our own , superb Rolls - Royce model of small modular reactor as well . He is right about the importance of our growing trading relationship with Korea . As a former Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport , he will also know that 71 % of our services trade with Korea last year was delivered digitally . We need to upgrade the deal to make sure that it reflects modern , digital trade as well . Both countries are making good progress in the negotiations .
