We do need flexibility in our schools . If the Leader of the Opposition had hopped off social media for a while , she would have seen the amendment put down this morning to achieve that end . She says that the Bill is not about child protection ; we had a young child killed who was taken out of school by an abuser . The Bill closes that gap — that is urgently needed . We have children who have not gone back to school since covid . The Bill closes that gap . She can make her points on academies and we can debate academies , but to vote against the Bill is a disgrace on all Conservative Members . We are grateful to those service personnel — not just the crew of the HMS Somerset , who were , as the hon . Gentleman rightly says , mobilised on Christmas day to respond to the EstLink 2 damage , but the 10,000 servicemen and women who were deployed away from home at Christmas — for their service . We know that they do it to keep the rest of us safe , and we are very grateful .
