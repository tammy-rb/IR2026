The actual allocations to schools happen in December each year in the normal way , so this situation will not affect the figures that local authorities have informed schools they will be receiving . Those are based on the October census of pupil numbers and the application of the local formula . We then fund the local authorities on the basis of the national funding . The record funding of £ 59.6 billion equates to an average of £ 5,300 per primary school pupil and £ 6,830 per secondary school pupil .
