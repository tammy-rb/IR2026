The Minister of State , Department for Transport , my right hon . Friend the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire ( Jesse Norman ) , who is the Minister for the future of transport , met Murphy Group this week . The Government remain committed to the lower Thames crossing as part of the responsible decisions taken to help meet inflationary pressures and balance the nation ’s books . We will be rephasing construction on the LTC by two years , as this will allow more time to take into account stakeholder views and to ensure that there remains an effective and deliverable plan that is in the best interests of taxpayers . I thank the hon . Gentleman for his question . I think he welcomes what we have decided to do with the 6.5 % pay increase , which leaves a typical teacher with £ 44,300 . We are reprioritising within the Department for Education ’s existing budget to deliver the additional funding to schools , but we are protecting core schools funding and frontline services . We have put in additional sums of money through the spending review and subsequent fiscal events : £ 330 million in 2023 - 24 and £ 550 million in 2024 - 25 . The numbers add up , and he will recognise that .
