late estimate have range of between billion and almost billion which be huge range the public rightly expect we to do all we can to minimise fraud in the use of public fund which be one reason why my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer have announce the establishment of covid corruption commissioner whose job it will be to track down as much as possible of the money lose to fraud

to announce that we would ringfence biological security spending across government will he uphold that commitment so that important resilience spending do not fall victim to day to day spending

relationship between the uk and scottish governments have deteriorate in the past decade and how we can improve it do the minister agree that in the next tranche of devolution we should look at how to improve relationship with the devolved administrations and regional authority perhaps we should set up uk council of ministers to involve ministers from all the administrations and regional mayor we intend to set up council of nation and region the hon member be right to say that we need to improve relation that be easy say than do because such organisation be run by political party but hope that the election result in all its facet represent the opportunity for bit of reset and well relation in future in just over month phase of the grenfell inquiry will report there will be implication for the entire government but what preparation have be make ahead of the report publication will the minister commit to engage with the bereaved survivor and the affected community before the government

the grenfell community and parliament will have the opportunity to provide the full and proper scrutiny that the issue deserve as my hon friend say it be important that bereaved family be also part of that process and we will work closely with the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that all those resident be part of it the government will do everything possible to drive

government do to work with local government and across the board to ensure that we be well prepared in future the government recognise that the pandemic have disproportionate impact on vulnerable group and minority community and that it will continue to affect many people it be essential that we review the way we prepare for future emergency to minimise disproportionate impact the chancellor

mission and we will learn the lesson of on behalf of the of people in my constituency who have serve in the armed force ask the cabinet secretary to explain why he be not join by veteran minister on

service than ever be protect call cat eccles for the final question constituent of mine be currently go through the process of adopt little boy she and her husband have one daughter already conceive follow several round of ivf but sadly that have since be unsuccessful for they and they have choose to adopt one of the many look after child look for love home my constituent run local business haberdashery and sewing workshop that be extremely popular with local people but in order to integrate the little boy into her family she have take time away from her business to be with he at home she have since discover that she be not entitle to statutory adoption pay as self employ person and will have to take this time off unpaid when adopt child from care there be really small window of opportunity to successfully integrate the child with minimal disruption cost to local authority for look after child be rise would you agree that extend adoption pay to self employ people in line with maternity pay would provide well outcome for look after child order we be all on learning curve but we do need to ask short punchy question also you mean but be sure that we will not be do that again on this perhaps the simple thing be for my hon friend to write to so that can get her question consider by the proper minister that complete question before we move to the business question shall let those on the front benches leave business of the house will the leader of the house provide an update on forthcoming business the business for the week commence july will include monday july second reading of the passenger railway services public ownership bill tuesday july second reading of the budget responsibility bill the house will rise for the summer recess at the conclusion of business on tuesday july and return on monday september the business for the week commence september will include monday september general debate subject to be confirm tuesday september committee of the whole house and remain stage of the passenger railway services public ownership bill wednesday september committee of the whole house and remain stage of the budget responsibility bill thursday september second reading of the great british energy bill friday september the house will not be sit lieutenant colonel mark teeton be brutally stab in gillingham near the brompton barrack few day ago know that he will be in the thought of all member and will have our good wish for speedy recovery extend my thank to long serve doorkeeper john tamlyn who have serve this house for year four time long than have be member of this house he have witness many memorable scene over the year and by my calculation have see no few than prime ministers come and go well nine come and go and one arrive but be optimistic that between now and next tuesday he may make it come and go be sure that the whole house will wish john well in his retirement after so many year of distinguished service thank you we do not have timetable for the election of select committees and other committees know that select committees can sometimes be troubling for the government during my five year as minister be gently roast sometimes violently flambéed by many select committees you welcome thank my hon friend for that it be however important that we have select committees in place so that back bencher can hold the government to account if that be not temptation enough for the leader of the house let say this if her back benchers have select committees to serve on they may have less time to plot rebellion will she confirm that all select committee chairmen and member will be elect in september and if not in september when many member have express concern about the resumption of uk taxpayer funding to the united nations relief and works agency unrwa stand accuse of many appalling act include run school use antisemitic textbook encourage violence the document involvement of at least unrwa member in the october massacre and close link between unrwa staff and the hamas terrorist organisation will the leader of the house urgently arrange debate on this decision in government time and can she guarantee that no taxpayer money will support directly or indirectly hamas or any activity that encourage or facilitate terror the government have send mixed message about plan to scrap the very reasonable two child cap on welfare payment then on tuesday the government whip their mp to vote against scrap it there be significant back bench rebellion less than three week after the election not even theresa may manage rebellion within three week of an election so it be bit of first at this rate the government majority will be go by about easter of next year interruption look be always happy to debate these issue the leader of the house and the government will actually have my support on this issue she may not want it or welcome it but she will have it anyway so can we have that debate not least so that her own parliamentary party and back benchers can properly discuss this important issue understand that next week the chancellor may make statement on the public finance do the leader of the house agree with what the chancellor say during the election that party do not need to be in government to open the book because of the office for budget responsibility forecast will the government commit that any statement about public finance make in this house will be accompany by an obr forecast since we can see from next week business that the government be so keen to enshrine obr forecast far in law it seem clear to that we may be present next week with concocted and exaggerated claim about the public finance as pretext for tax rise so can the leader of the house commit that the election promise that government members make that there would be no tax rise beyond those in the labour manifesto will be honour in full finally the government recently announce the closure of the bibby stockholm barge will the government update the house on where those people will now be accommodate and at what cost also notice that the government have rebrande illegal immigration as irregular and have say that they merely want to control it say to they that enter this country by small boat be illegal it may help they to refer to section of the immigration act as amend if they be in any doubt the government objective should be to stop illegal immigration completely not merely to control it so will the leader of the house organise debate in government time on that that debate could cover what the government plan to do in place of the rwanda scheme that they have just scrap the first flight have be due to take off yesterday july but the government choose to cancel it the deterrent effect that that flight would have have would have lead to cessation of channel crossing as all the precedent in australia and elsewhere have demonstrate we see it here with the albanian cohort last year as well the government needlessly cancel what would have be an effective deterrent measure will the government allow vote on that policy thank the shadow leader of the house and join he in pay our respect to those affect by the brutal attack in kent this week in our last business question before the summer recess mr speaker want to put on record my thank to you house staff security staff and other for all your hard work in recent week and wish you all some kind of holiday over that recess also congratulate our new deputy speakers they be break more glass ceiling with an all female line up that be the most diverse in our history on the same theme also send congratulation to baroness eluned morgan who be set to become wales first female first minister that be lot of first finally put on record my thank to the wonderful john tamlyn one of our fantastic doorkeepers who be retire after year of service the shadow leader of the house mention the number of prime ministers under which john serve but think most of those come in the last few year of his time as he say to early the last few year go lot fast than the early one also want to address the truly shocking footage we have see of an incident at manchester airport it be right of the greater manchester police force to refer itself to the independent office for police conduct give the widespread concern about the incident this week we have hear many maiden speech there have be lot of demand shall we say but it have be good to see the enthusiasm of many colleague from across these benches those speech have tell the story of our nation of people and place strive to get on and look after and look out for each other but be not sure that can agree that every other constituency be the good in the country because of course we all know that the good be actually manchester central this have be special week for we on the government side of the house after long year in opposition we have finally be able to win some vote in support of our ambitious bold fully cost king speech programme it be one to be proud of it be the opportunity and responsibility of government make real the shadow leader of the house ask about the election of select committee chairs he will know that negotiation be ongoing between the usual channel about how those chairs will be allocate once those be complete we hope to have the election as soon as possible as we end our third week in government it be clear than ever before that the conservatives fail in their responsibility and leave the country in state beyond our bad fear they do not like to hear it but they fail to take the tough and right choice it be as if they know that they be go to lose the election and leave the really difficult decision for we they do not like it but history will show it that be not just my view the national audit office find that the nhs have be leave in an unprecedented crisis the institute for fiscal studies say that we face some of the tough choice in generation the previous government own justice secretary admit that they ignore prison run at capacity because it would cost they vote to take action so be afraid that will not be take the shadow leader of the house advice on the issue that he raise the shadow leader of the house talk about redefine illegal migration remember the former home secretary the right hon member for braintree mr cleverly redefine the backlog under the last government as queue far from be stop boat have be come over in record number over the past year so the conservatives plan just be not work that be why we have already reallocate resource and start return illegal migrant which his government fail to do the shadow leader of the house will know that yes we be take action to ensure that all fiscal statement have office for budget responsibility oversight be not sure whether his party will support that next week the conservatives have their chance to govern and they leave the country in much bad state than they find it they do not fix the roof while the sun be shin in fact their whole house be build on sand we have be leave the job of rebuild from the bottom up on shaky foundation

conservative trussonomics of which the shadow leader of the house be an author we will legislate for great british energy when parliament return deliver energy security and low bill what contrast with the die day of the last government if he will forgive will not be take his advice will continue realise the change that the country be cry out for the footage of greater manchester police officer stamp on and kick man in manchester airport be truly shocking and disturbing that man be one of my rochdale constituent and be meet his family later today our police face difficult job every day to keep we all safe but they know that they be expect to demonstrate the high standard of conduct in their duty will the leader of the house make time for member to discuss the important issue of police

constituent be affect greater manchester police have say that the officer involve be immediately suspend from all duty and referral have now be make to the independent office for police conduct will ensure that the home secretary have hear my hon friend question and be in touch with he at the early opportunity to discuss the matter far call the lib dem spokesperson be pleased to see that the leader of the house have survive the first rebellion of the new parliament her government should take advice from one of my bath constituency most famous resident mary shelley and her creation frankenstein monster beware for be fearless and therefore powerful expect the prime minister hop that the new group of independent mps he have create will not become such monster scrap the two child

see the leicestershire flag fly outside parliament secure that for my county after thousand year without one move on to lincolnshire represent three county the government be right to build more house but in that process it be crucial that we make sure that council hold developer and water company to account in corby glen in lincolnshire there have be stink for well over year yet the labour run

with appropriately will the leader of the house tell we when the government intend to act what be their timescale what be the number they intend to change enough be enough the british people have have enough of their border be breach with impunity my daughter who be here today might have different view on whether be good or bad mum but that be another point with great respect to the right hon

the killing of hundred and draconian communication blackout that be cause immense concern to my bangladeshi community and the wide community thank my hon friend for that question the government be deeply concerned by the violence in recent day in bangladesh the loss of life be unacceptable and the right to protest must be protect and restore will ensure that the foreign secretary have hear her

that our prison be in crisis the male prison estate have be run at around capacity for month we now know that my predecessor warn downing street of the peril of inaction but rather than address the crisis the former prime minister call an election and leave we time bomb tick away if we do not act now and that bomb go off our prison will reach full capacity and the justice system will grind to halt the court would have to stop hold trial and the police would be unable to make arrest with criminal free to act without consequence the public would be put at risk if we do not act now this nightmare will become reality by september we have explore all the option available to we in the precious little time we have we can not build more prison or add more prison block and we can not fit out an exist site to make it secure enough to hold offender although we be deport foreign national offender as fast as legally possible we can not do so quickly enough to address the crisis although we must make progress on the remand population those who be in prison while they await trial such measure take time we do not have that have leave we with only one option to avert disaster the statutory instrument that we be consider today will change the law so that prisoner serve eligible standard determinate sentence will have their automatic release point adjust to rather than of their sentence that will mean that around offender will be release in two tranche in september and october they will leave prison few week or month early to serve the rest of their sentence under strict licence condition in the community thereafter all qualify sentence will continue to be subject to the new release point let turn now to the detail of this legislation the sentence that qualify for this measure and those that do not first this change apply to both male and female offender this be legal necessity and address the pressure in both the male and female prison estate although this measure do not apply to those serve in the youth estate where capacity pressure be less acute it do apply to few individual serve sentence under section of the sentencing act most of those serve these sentence be serve long term that be exclude from the measure as will go on to explain however few be in scope and be include because they be likely to end their term in the adult estate the provision also include those on detention in young offender institution and to year old who be hold in adult prison as such both contribute to the capacity crisis as the measure must balance address the crisis in our prison alongside the need to protect the public certain sentence will be exclude the bad violent and sexual crime which be subject to release will not be eligible neither will violent offence subject to sentence of four year or more under part of schedule to the criminal justice act sexual offence will be exclude include offence relate to child sexual abuse and grooming we will exclude series of offence link to domestic abuse include stalk control or coercive behaviour and non fatal strangulation national security offence under the official secrets acts and national security act and offence determine to have be carry out for foreign power will also be exclude as will serious terrorism offence and terrorism connect offence which remain subject to release at the parole board discretion so too will terrorism offence which be currently subject to release thank the minister for her statement clearly understand the government predicament and the reason for bring forward these legislative change but one matter that and other elect representative in this house have have to deal with in recent year be the predicament that victim face of meet the perpetrator of crime out on the street which bring back enormous trauma welcome what the minister say about some condition take precedence in relation to those be release but can she reassure the victim who be worried about what be happen we need to have that reassurance on the record in this house madam deputy speaker those people be worried and they want to be reassure thank the hon gentleman for his intervention he raise an incredibly important matter have have the feeling of victim very much in my mind as have be force to make this decision nothing in relation to the victim notification scheme or the victim contact scheme will change as result of these measure all the usual arrangement will apply and shall detail some of those little later in my speech return to the offence that be exclude in each case we have exclude specific offence rather than cohort of offender that be legal necessity it be only possible to make this change in law with reference to qualify sentence in addition to these exclusion there will be stringent protection in place around any early release this change to the law will not take effect until september which give our hard work probation service crucial six week implementation period probation officer will therefore have the time they need to assess the risk of each offender and prepare plan to manage they safely in the community all offender release under this policy will be subject to stringent licence condition where necessary multi agency public protection arrangement will be put in place to protect the public as will multi agency risk assessment conference which ensure that victim can be protect victim eligible for the victim contact scheme or the victim notification scheme will be notify about release and development in their case offender will be order to wear electronic tag where require exclusion zone and curfew will be impose where appropriate crucially if an offender break any of the condition impose on they they can be return to prison immediately be sure that the whole house will be pleased to hear of the safeguard that the lord chancellor be put in place be she confident that by the time the change to the scheme come into effect both victim notification and probation and indeed police and accommodation service will be in position to pick up those be release that be precisely why we have ensure that we have an implementation period for this policy change that work will continue at pace over the summer so that the probation service have the time to prepare proper release plan for offender who will be release as result of the change and to ensure that all our obligation to victim and the wide public be fulfil let also be clear that this change be not permanent we will review this measure within month of implementation at the very late in march at that point we believe that the situation in our prison will have stabilise and that we will be able to reverse the measure return the automatic point of release to of sentence want to directly address question raise during the oral statement in the house last week we have not include specific sunset clause within the legislation that would end it automatically we have pledge to be honest about the challenge in our prison and the change that we put in place to rise to they that be marked difference from the previous administration approach give the scale of the crisis that we have inherit place an artificial time limit on this measure would be nothing more than an irresponsible gimmick we have take the very deliberate decision not to reverse this measure until we be certain that prison capacity have stabilise the last government allow our prison to fall into crisis we will not introduce legislation that could force we back there again finally we will introduce new high standard of transparency every quarter we will publish datum on the number of offender release and we will make it statutory requirement for prison capacity statement to be publish annually introduce that legislation as soon as parliamentary time allow we be clear that this be the only safe way forward the house do not have to take my word for it we have hear senior figure in the police prison and probation all warning of what will happen if these measure be not take we have even hear my predecessor as lord chancellor come out in support of this measure thank to the action or rather inaction of the last prime minister our predecessor run the prison estate to within day of disaster as result they be force to introduce series of emergency measure such as operation safeguard which turn police cell into prison overflow and operation early dawn daily triage system that manage the flow of prisoner from police cell to the court they even come perilously close to trigger operation brinker which be effectively one in one out measure in our prison it be the very last desperate act available to forestall by matter of day the total collapse of law and order in this country the last government also introduce the flawed end of custody supervise licence scheme when this new legislation take effect it will be my pleasure to end ecsl with next to no implementation period ecsl release offender with only few day of warning and sometimes none at all that give the probation service no time to assess the risk of offender and next to no time to plan how they would be manage safely in the community this new legislation with its long eight week implementation period give the probation service the time that it need to prepare the last government early release scheme do not have the same exclusion that this new legislation have most notably it provide no exclusion for offence link to domestic abuse that mean no exclusion for stalk for strangulation for control or coercive behaviour or for breach of restrain order non molestation order and domestic abuse order all of which be exclude in the legislation present to the house today perhaps bad of all this quick fix be carry out under veil of secrecy number of extension be make to the scheme which first release offender up to day early then to day early and finally up to day early that last extension be implement without any announcement at all throughout no data be ever publish by the previous government on the number release it fall to this administration to reveal the true scale of the ecsl scheme only now do we know that more than offender be rush out under that veil of secrecy by the previous administration our approach will be different unlike under the previous government those sit on the opposition benches will never have to chase around this building to get hold of the number the number will be put in the public domain for all to see and scrutinise as they should have be all along ecsl be one of series of decision that this government believe must be examine more fully that be why have announce review into how this capacity crisis be allow to happen which will look at why the necessary decision be not take at critical moment we will shortly be appoint an independent chair for the review which will conclude by the end of this year let be clear the crisis in our prison be not over the prison population remain within few hundred place of collapse last week we temporarily close hmp dartmoor take around place out of the prison estate although we be able to withstand that loss of capacity any further change be they further loss of supply or an unexpected increase in demand could tip we into crisis the measure that have set out will take effect in september give probation officer the precious time they need to prepare during that time we will continue to monitor the prison population closely and we will be ready to introduce further emergency measure such as operation early dawn or operation safeguard if require have three prison in my constituency will the secretary of state explain how bad the situation will be if we do not act today thank my hon friend for that intervention if we do not act today we face total collapse of law and order in this country if we be force to enact operation brinker it will be one in one out system and we be then day away from the total collapse of the criminal justice system it be shocking state of affair that the previous government be entirely responsible for and it have fall to our administration to start to put these matter right with the decisive action we be take this be the only option on the table remind the house again that we have no choice other than to pass this measure to deal with the crisis we have inherit even once we have pass the measure we will not yet be out of the wood our prison be still in crisis the last government run the prison system on the basis of luck they hang on by their fingernail until they could hang on no long and then they call an election this government will never run that risk we will always take the necessary action thank the secretary of state for her reassurance on the exclusion of sexual and domestic violence sentence while prison be about punishment and keep our community safe one of the main way we can keep our prison population down be through rehabilitation rebuild life and reduce reoffende do she agree that education be central to that rehabilitation and will she meet and milton keynes college the big provider of education in prison to discuss how we can take it far my hon friend be right that ultimately one of the long term solution to the capacity crisis must be to reduce reoffende be just come on to that point in my speech will happily arrange for she to meet the prisons minister and will take close interest in what be happen in milton keynes let we be under no illusion the measure have set out today be not silver bullet it do not end the prison crisis it be not the long term solution instead it buy we the time we need to take further measure that can address the prison crisis not just now but in the future later this year we will publish year capacity strategy which will outline the step that the government will take to acquire land for new prison site and will ensure that building prison infrastructure that we deem to be of national importance be decision place in minister hand we must also drive down reoffende currently all too often our prison create well criminal not well citizen nearly of offender be reoffender strong probation service will be crucial to drive down reoffende and we will start by recruit at least new trainee probation officer by the end of march bring forward an exist commitment to address the immediate challenge we face today we will also work with prison to ensure that offender can get the skill they need to contribute to society on release as well as bring together prison governor local employer and the voluntary sector to help they into work because we know that have job make offender less likely to reoffend the last occupant of downing street leave our prison in crisis the secretary of state will be aware that cities of london and westminster have some of the high level of rough sleeping in the country with rough sleeper every night in westminster and in the city of london st mungo have highlight that of people release from prison into rough sleeping will reoffend within the year it be simply essential that planning process and need assessment take place before people be release local authority with the responsibility of prevent homelessness simply do not have the resource or working process to ensure that that planning take place will those process and resource be in place before the legislation be implement in september the point about homelessness and what it mean for recall into prison be incredibly important the implementation period allow probation time to prepare plan for every offender who will be release that be different from the previous government ecsl scheme which give no time at all some of these issue will be mitigate by that implementation period offender leave prison can access transitional accommodation for up to night if they be at risk of be homeless those provision will continue as this scheme be roll out be sure that many of we will have be appal by the comment of the former lord chancellor who say that the measure that this government be take be not take by the last government because you have to win vote how do the secretary of state respond to that the public make the decision for the previous administration by vote they out of office in such stunning manner we do have to win vote it be democracy at the end of the day but we must also govern the country in way that do not risk the total collapse of the criminal justice system it be sign of the tory party collective nervous breakdown in government that the risk of run the criminal justice system into the ground with the total collapse of law and order in this country be allow to happen in the first place this new administration will never take such risk and we be take these measure today to start put thing right and clean up the mess that we have inherit from the tory party the last occupant of downing street leave our prison in crisis they leave our criminal justice system at the point of collapse they be the guilty man know the historical weight of those word but they be apt the last government place the country in unconscionable peril this government legacy will be different prison system bring under control probation service that keep the public safe enough prison place to meet our need and prison probation and other service work together to break the cycle of reoffende today measure be not the long term solution be not pretend that it be there be hard road ahead of we but it be the necessary first step call the official opposition spokesman thank you madam deputy speaker and congratulation on your new role be grateful for the opportunity to debate the criminal justice act requisite and minimum custodial periods order follow the lord chancellor statement on prison capacity last week this statutory instrument be significant so it be right that we have the opportunity to scrutinise challenge and call on the government for clear answer to number of vital question although the si be comprise of only five clause and schedule its impact should not be underestimate it reduce the automatic release point for criminal on standard determinate sentence from of their sentence to subject to limited exclusion as the shadow lord chancellor my right hon friend the member for melton and syston edward argar have set out we recognise the challenge and significant pressure face prison and the criminal justice system as well as the need to ensure that they continue to function effectively those pressure be well known to the then opposition they be not sudden news in government in order to protect society we take the decision to toughen sentence for those who commit the bad crime in parallel we set in train the big prison build programme since the victorian era with thousand of additional place deliver and five of the six new prison either build in construction or with planning permission grant however what have huge impact on the prison population be our take the right decision not to mass release prisoner in the pandemic and not to scrap trial by jury during the pandemic mean that the number of remand prisoner await trial or sentence increase from around to around those decision which if recall correctly be not oppose by the then opposition be the right decision and the now government can not credibly claim they do not know about they public protection must always be central to what the lord chancellor do we have grave public protection concern about the government bring forward this statutory instrument to reduce capacity pressure in prison when the shadow lord chancellor press the lord chancellor on number of our key concern last week the lord chancellor be unable to provide the reassurance and commitment that we seek today as we debate the detail of the instrument must press she again and hope that she will respond in her wind up by way of context can the lord chancellor confirm the number of place available in the adult male estate as of this morning believe that the figure be around when she make her statement so that the house might understand the rate of attrition in prison place she fail last week to set out her criterion for end the effect of the statutory instrument after month more importantly why do the statutory instrument not contain sunset clause realise that she touch on that but give the significance of the power surely it be reasonable to sunset such measure rather than we give she blank cheque she could always return to the house to seek its agreement to renew the measure if need the si and support document suggest that the lord chancellor have not put in place any exclusion to prevent the bad persistent repeat offender who receive short sentence from benefit be that correct the si set out that prisoner may benefit from the change if their sentence be under five year be she aware that under the sentencing guideline section grievous bodily harm wound offence under the offence against the person act serious offence would attract sentence of up to five year would those who have commit that offence benefit from her prisoner sentence reduction scheme rise there will be an opportunity to respond to later as we know many offence link to dreadful domestic abuse and domestic violence do not appear to be among the lord chancellor exclusion as the offence prosecute would be for example section gbh or common assault what do she say to victim of domestic abuse who be worried that the way in which the measure have be draft risk allow their attacker to benefit from her early release scheme what percentage of those who be release when of their sentence be serve rather than will be recall back into prison for breach what step be she take to mandate the imposition of gps tag or other strict condition on those who benefit from the measure again there be no detail in the si what additional resource be be make available to probation by september when this early release scheme be due to start over and above what be already put in place by the previous government the lord chancellor state her plan for next march but what about this september when her scheme come into play how many additional staff will be in place in offender management unit by september to meet the demand of sentence and release point recalculation what additional funding be the ministry of justice make available to local authority and other housing provider to meet the short to medium term increase in demand for suitable accommodation in the come month last week the lord chancellor confirm her intention to temporarily fully close hmp dartmoor where do she intend to find the place lose more broadly she ask the house to support the open end measure in the si but be yet to set out any detail of long term capacity plan either how she will pay for and build more prison place over and above those we already commit to or whether she will reverse the change we make to toughen sentence for dangerous criminal which be it what be the plan while we recognise the need to address immediate pressure in the prison system we be deeply trouble by the lack of detail in this statutory instrument and its support document and by the huge gap that appear to exist which have set out blank cheque be be ask for and there be no sunsetting of this significant measure and no ability to amend the instrument to include sunset provision have highlight example of serious offence that appear not to be exclude offence that can often be link to domestic violence or wounding the absence of such measure and of clarity mean that this instrument be draft in way that be deeply troubling look forward to the lord chancellor response and reassurance during her wind up remark call bambos charalambous thank you madam deputy speaker congratulate you on your election and welcome you to your place as deputy speaker welcome this motion from my right hon friend the lord chancellor who be take the only realistic action open to she to deal with the critical issue of prison capacity with our prison project to be overflow by september this be another failure by the former conservative government the result of their continuously kick the can down the road rather than deal with the issue at hand the current situation can not come as surprise to anyone who have be follow the development in criminal justice over the past year prior to the election be call have the pleasure of serve for second time on the justice committee and on may this year in one of his last statement as chair of the committee sir bob neill kc say that prison be simply run out of space my committee have long since warn of the danger of successive government ignore the rise in jail number set against workforce recruitment and retention crisis and crumbling victorian prison estate minister and society must be prepare to invest in prison capacity and proper rehabilitation programme as the current situation be unsustainable that be the conservative former chair of the justice committee speak the warning sign be there long time ago but the failure to invest have mean that we be now reap this bitter harvest welcome the prison building programme and the renewal programme mention by my right hon friend the lord chancellor but in addition to the measure propose in this motion would like to suggest some further measure that may reduce the prison population over long term the first measure be address court delay in its report reduce the backlog in the crown court publish in may this year the national audit office find that at the end of december the outstanding crown court caseload be and of those case have be outstanding for year or more it also find that it take an average of day from offence to completion of case in the crown court and that staggering people be on remand as of the end of december one third be await sentencing and the remain two third be await trial the remand population be the high it have be in over year those figure be truly shocking and the issue of remand prisoner need to be address urgently the maxim that justice delay be justice deny be certainly apt and we should remember that delay in case go to trial also have adverse impact on the victim and witness one of the cause of the delay be shortage of criminal barrister and duty solicitor whose number have be in decline since in part that have be due to serious under investment in our criminal justice system over the past two decade hope that we will soon see the investment we need in the criminal justice system from this government on court date and the listing of trial very much hope that his majesty courts and tribunals service get smart in how it use time and space for court hearing the second point wish to make be about reoffende an issue that my right hon friend the lord chancellor have touch on accord the ministry of justice own figure from the last quarter for which stat be available of adult release from custody will go on to reoffend that figure be way too high as reoffende be so high it should come as no surprise that large number of people be be remand for non violent offence due to their repeat offending many of those repeat offender will have underlying vulnerability such as drug abuse homelessness and mental health issue which will not have be properly address unless there be co ordinate approach to tackle the cause of reoffende we will see this endless revolving door cycle in our criminal justice system that give court no option but to remand repeat offender into custody know that my right hon friend be serious about take action to address those issue and ask she to co ordinate work with other departments to help stop reoffende the final point wish to focus on be imprisonment for public protection prisoner who account for approximately of the prisoner in our prison in its report on ipp prisoner the justice committee say that our primary recommendation be that the government bring forward legislation to enable resentencing exercise in relation to all ipp sentence individual this be the only way to address the unique injustice cause by the ipp sentence and its subsequent administration and to restore proportionality to the original sentence that be give on previous occasion have make the point that deal with ipp prisoner who have spend more time in prison than they should have would not only help reduce the prison population but would right wrong in conclusion very much welcome this motion as short term measure to deal with the overcrowding in our prison also welcome my right hon friend commitment to an annual prison capacity statement which will allow we to see what effect this measure and other measure have on the prison population in addition to build more prison we need an investment in our criminal justice system and great recruitment and retention of barrister solicitor prison officer and probation officer be delighted to hear that my right hon friend have commit to recruit more probation officer that will certainly help to address issue that arise among people who be on licence after serve half of their sentence we need to clear the backlog of case in the crown court to allow remand prisoner to be deal with soon and we also need to address the root cause of both offend and reoffende finally we need to deal with ipp prisoner and see what can be do to release those who be over tariff hope that the motion will pass today it be very good start to tackle the gordian knot that we face still more work need to be do but have every confidence that the lord chancellor and her team will deliver call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you madam deputy speaker congratulate you on your election as well as the other deputy speakers and welcome you to your place would not go so far as to say that welcome the measure that have be outline today and what be be propose but and the liberal democrats recognise that this be probably the only step that the government can take to deal with the situation we be look to relieve pressure on prison against backdrop of concern that the prison population be rise beyond the operational capacity of the prison estate indeed as of july the prison population in england and wales be measure as whereas operational capacity be as member have highlight reoffende rate remain high with of ex inmate reoffende within nine year of release and reoffende within the first month it be estimate that reoffende cost our society more than billion year we should also recognise that violence against prison staff have soar as they cope with these capacity issue an average of attack be record every day last year across england and wales issue with staff recruitment and retention have persist with english prison run red regime due to fall below minimum staffing level at least time in it be right to recognise that the problem be partly due to the backlog in our criminal court which skyrocket under the previous conservative government find the official opposition response today quite stunning we want to work as constructive opposition so that we can help deal with issue around prison overcrowding so for they to press the lord chancellor for answer when they know the answer they know they before the last election be quite something as of march remand population have rise by to record high of over people account for almost of the total prison population it be quite clear that we need to take action on that issue back in november the previous administration recognise the issue around prison overcrowding and introduce their own emergency measure so surely they should recognise today that further measure be necessary this be about our criminal justice system as whole and trust in our criminal justice system as whole be at an all time low the new government talk about be government of service be police officer for year and consider that to be part of the public service have give want to mention the shocking footage from manchester airport yesterday as former police officer be deeply disturb by what see also want to share my concern and thought for the family of the two police officer and the member of the public who be seriously injure in car accident on the outside glasgow yesterday the issue face the lord chancellor be not limit to england and wales indeed the scottish human rights commission have today publish report criticise the scottish government glacial pace of change in tackle overcrowding suicide and mental health provision in our prison only last month the scottish government be make decision similar to those be make by this government in relation to release prisoner early although as with this government there be exception to that overall approach absolutely understand the concern of victim in see the early release of those who have offend against they and that be something we must continue to recognise although the government have outline that there will not be sunset clause in the si and that they be look to bring this to an end in month time would appreciate some clarity from the lord chancellor on report to this place on the progress be make this house can estimate whether the situation continue to be an emergency only if we have the datum and be aware of the effect of what be be propose today we need to ensure that what the government be do be the right thing but we also need to know what further step they be take we must address the systemic issue in the criminal court because these failure be fail victim on conviction in the first place the probation service be also critical part of this want to add that watch the maiden speech in the other place of the new minister for prisons parole and probation and be encourage by what hear the liberal democrats be clear that cut reoffending must be at the heart of the government plan to end the prison crisis we know that prison be in crisis they be overcrowded and understaffed and they be fail to rehabilitate offender but in order to prevent and reduce reoffende we need to ensure that we be improve the provision of training education and work opportunity in prison we should be consider through the gate mentorship programme and introduce plan to improve the rehabilitation of people leave prison the liberal democrats want to implement presumption against short sentence of month or less to facilitate that rehabilitation in the community as the minister in the other place recognise yesterday if we do not have the right condition in our prison we be only make our prison place where people learn how to reoffend rather than prevent it we need the probation service to have the resource it need we need to improve and properly fund the supervision of offender in the community with far great co ordination between the prison service probation service provider the voluntary and private sector and local authority and that will achieve saving in the high cost of reoffende the liberal democrats recognise that this be the only option the new government can take as say would not go as far as to say that support what be be propose but recognise on behalf of my party that it be the only option leave to the government at this time call andy slaughter thank you madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to see you in your new and much deserve place rise to support this difficult proposal from my right hon friend the justice secretary make speech in the king speech debate two day ago on the subject of prison condition include overcrowding do not intend to repeat the whole of that speech although it be tempting to do so especially for the bit have to leave out but even by the standard of this place that would probably be push it however would say that my right hon friend and her team include the new prisons minister in the other place lord timpson have set out with clear and serious intent to solve the problem leave by the previous government be afraid we see from the opposition spokesman the hon member for stockton west matt vickers exactly why the conservatives get we into this mess there be no attempt to be accountable he do not allow one intervention during that speech which think be almost unknown and we can understand why it be because there be no answer to the question that can be put to the opposition they have leave our prison in an absolutely disastrous state at capacity for the past month it be complete dereliction of duty there be acute capacity pressure and the impact assessment say that if we continue without take this action prison would shortly run out of place and the justice system would no long be able to function as intend the police would be unable to make arrest and the judiciary may not be able to impose immediate custodial sentence what an indictment of any government if the hon member think that the labour government be now go to have to release prisoner they would not want to release how would he describe the fact that the previous labour government have to release prisoner they do not want to release if that be really the good the opposition have get understand why the shadow minister do not take any intervention the conservatives have plenty of money for the rwanda scheme and other gimmick over the past month but they have no money no resource and no intent to deal with this and we have hear the reason for that they think they would win vote by leave prison in crisis situation be afraid that be another miscalculation it be true that this be not an easy decision be reassure by what my right hon friend the justice secretary say and by the si support document in that recall will continue as before the length of sentence will not change sexual and serious violent offence be exclude and the intention contrary to what the opposition allege be that this will run for no more than month those be all important safeguard it be also true that although there will of course be cost saving this will put pressure on the probation service the explanatory memorandum state there be package of measure to alleviate probation pressure include limit post sentence supervision to non multi agency public protection arrangements eligible offender so there be consequence here there be consequence for post custody accommodation service as we have hear which be not work terribly well at the moment there be also consequence for the police if there be situation of reoffende or recall that need to be deal with this will mean reduction from september onwards of minimum of prison place for period of time and that be simply necessary that be not really debatable and think that be probably why the opposition have not debate it today it be not possible for this to continue hope this short term measure will be successful and think it will be hope the safeguard will be in place and will be secure be also encourage by what my right hon friend say about the long term prospect we have to address the prison crisis over the long term in this country we have to reduce the number of people in custody by reduce reoffende it be good that we be build modern prison to modern standard but would like to see those modern prison not supplement but replace some of the disgusting and disgraceful victorian prison such as wormwood scrubs which until few week ago be in my constituency advise all member who do not have prison in their constituency or who do not regularly visit prison irrespective of their interest if they be attend this debate they must have some interest to go and look at the condition that persist because they be inhumane and intolerable that be not just matter for staff inmate and other who work in prison it be matter for all of we as citizen because we be not rehabilitate prisoner but let they out on to the street to reoffend without any support the need for today si be an indication of just how low the previous government have bring the system this be national crisis have no doubt that it be one of the reason for the previous prime minister call an early election because they simply could not face the consequence of their own action thank goodness we now have government who will grasp these nettle firmly and resolve the issue say to my right hon friend the justice secretary who know be passionate about this that this be not about just short term fix this be about long term change in how we use the criminal justice system in this country all part of which be in crisis at the moment if we can get into virtuous spiral rather than the downward spiral we have be in for the last year there be hope to improve the court system access to justice and the service provide include for victim and to deal with the crisis in our prison it be genuine pleasure to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker congratulation on your new role welcome the new front benchers to their position include the lord chancellor whom have know for number of year congratulate she on take up the post as well as the opposition front bench team it be right this have marginally be touch on that the first duty of any government be the protection safety and security of the public the state have to manage many measure sentence and crime and collectively we have duty to ensure that the british public be protect alongside robust measure on counter terrorism and back our armed force we also have amazing intelligence service that form part of the matrix that the lord chancellor will now become familiar with as well as keep our street safe by invest in the police and the criminal justice system part of that mean that the most dangerous harmful serious persistent offender should be in prison and keep off the street in order to keep the public safe and it be important that we have the right deterrent those on the government front bench be clearly make great deal of play about the role of the previous government and the decision make in the last parliament but it be tell that one of the first piece of legislation that this government be seek to pass be one that basically consider the early release of prisoner in matter of week have look at the impact assessment the lord chancellor will be familiar with it and note that it give option and option understand the situation that she have be ask to look at but in her closing remark would like to hear what alternative be consider other than the blanket scheme the lord chancellor touch on the previous parliament and for the record in the previous parliament we see labour mp campaign to block the removal of foreign national offender from be deport from our prison we see they oppose the police crime sentencing and courts act and the tough sentence that be introduce for sexual and violent offender will come on to the release of some of those offender shortly labour members oppose life sentence for people smuggler in the nationality and borders act which we know be make difference the release of prisoner and reduce the time that most offender stay in custody from of their sentence to will cause concern for the public particularly victim of crime would like to ask the lord chancellor about some specific area she have touch on they but would like she to expand on they in the early release provision clear offence such as sexual or domestic abuse offence have be list in the schedule she have outline community order and tagging but it be important particularly for woman who have be victim to know and understand what provision will be put in place for they there be also offender responsible for racially aggravate assault and the real harm that come with offender with past conviction for sexual offence or perpetrator of domestic abuse who might be serve time in custody for other offence and who could be free early what we know the lord chancellor will know this be that those type of perpetrator do not just offend once they have whole litany of historical aggravate offence we can not simply release those people out into the community because those blanket offence do cause problem she be well aware of the cross party nature of the debate on support for victim over the past decade have speak about victim bill as have she and it be about how we can work to achieve that there will of course be impact on wide service this have already be raise in particular by the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain and would like to ask about the impact on our police probation and housing service there be no clear plan in the impact assessment the lord chancellor say in her statement that that will come and that official be work at have no doubt that opposition members will hear lot of that term from those on the government benches the paper publish with this order give no indication of how local authority and which local authority will be particularly affect by the early release scheme it be important for local authority and the ministry of housing communities and local government in particular to publish that information with the ministry of justice the lord chancellor have speak passionately about the transparency she will bring on data release and number and urge that we should have that information soon rather than later labour member also mention homelessness that result from this measure particularly in the city of london and we see that already that be local authority duty and statutory duty be in place where we know such thing need to be manage there will be and already be pressure on housing stock and ask the government to publish list of local authority that will be affect be vital there be also implication for family and individual on housing register who will now be worried about the implication for they while they have be wait patiently on housing list there will be pressure on other part of the criminal justice system what resource will we put into the criminal justice system will resource be redirect what about police officer who will now be tie up monitor offender on early release and deal with those who reoffend the right hon lady have already speak about reoffende and breach of condition that will mean someone go back to prison but how will that be manage when police officer will be take away from police activity perhaps may politely say that clarity be require on such specificity for local authority and police force and our police and crime commissioner will also want to know more about this would like to press the lord chancellor on the timing around this decision it have be touch on already and the impact assessment state the lord chancellor announce her intention for this change to be temporary this change will be review after month to ensure it be still necessary it would be helpful to be indicative about the concept of the sunset clause she be familiar with sunset clause we have all debate such legislation and to be clear that this measure will not be permanent the public as well as member of this house need to be assure on that indeed all member who be vote today need assurance on that important point wish to ask about the reduction in the prison population by the impact assessment consider period over year and state the central scenario assume there will be few prison place require than would otherwise be need in steady state over year period the average annual saving for hmpps due to reduce prison running cost be estimate to be per annum price over the ten year period there would be transitional benefit of reduce the additional number of prison place that need to be construct with an estimate benefit of over billion that be significant money and will clearly have an impact on the prison building programme when the lord chancellor make her first speech on prison capacity and the strain she speak from the new five wells prison in wellingborough which be build and deliver under the last government it would be useful to hear more about the implication of that billion we hear during the general election that the government be to continue with the prison building plan and programme put in place and change the planning law but the impact assessment assume that there will be permanent reduction in the prison population of would like to hear more about the modelling of future prison place and number will there be an expansion of exist prison site there be plan for super prison in lancashire will that be expand alongside that we need to understand more about the financial impact of this policy and how the ministry of justice the treasury and the office for budget responsibility will be score this measure in the accounting the impact assessment suggest saving of more than billion by reduce the number of prison place to be construct as well as more than million year of saving by reduce the number of offender in prison it be balance act but for clarity when it come to law and order the government direction of travel on keep our street safe and the point have make we need to know from the lord chancellor whether these saving will be bank for the forthcoming fiscal forecast from the ministry of justice the treasury and the obr especially with the budget and the comprehensive spending review come in the autumn the government have afford the house precious minute to debate the early release of prisoner from where stand the prison building programme just by this impact assessment look as if it be be reduce and cut be worried that will put the public in grave danger and it be right that we continue throughout debate probably post recess now to discuss this matter this be one of the first legislative act of this government it will have implication for public confidence in law and order do not need to expand on that the lord chancellor be well verse in all this we have to be cognisant of the impact and what this measure mean for victim we should focus on that and the wide functioning of the criminal justice system the lord chancellor will know that in the previous parliament operation soteria in particular look at the integration of policing the criminal justice system the court system and the prison system to give confidence to victim of the most abhorrent sexual abuse will this proposal have knock on impact on some of those key programme would like to have some answer from the lord chancellor transparency be important and she have speak about it in this debate have grave concern as know do other on the opposition benches about public safety and security as well as the wide implication for housing prison probation the police law and order and public safety call naz shah may congratulate you madam deputy speaker on take your space even more so as female muslim in this house of kashmiri heritage it give great pleasure and pride to see not only female muslim deputy speaker of kashmiri heritage but also lord chancellor who be the first female muslim of kashmiri heritage in that role be sure the whole house and the whole country share our pride in celebrate britain the house and democracy at their good be grateful to the lord chancellor for all her work to address this issue pick up the mess leave by the previous government would welcome bit of humility from the shadow minister the reason we do not vote with his government policy be precisely because they do not have plan and they do not know what they be do otherwise we would not have to clear this mess up on their behalf the people recognise that and that be why we be have to deal with it make request to the lord chancellor that during her review she accept an invitation to visit bradford west and the muslim woman in prison project which support muslim woman in prison and their return out into the community we all recognise the disparity of service and rehabilitation when it come to people of ethnic minority heritage that be an open invitation once again thank the lord chancellor for give huge consideration to the sentence she be propose to reduce and make sure that we be still protect the public which the previous government fail to do by ensure that we keep serious offender out of that category and be do the good we can do for our country welcome you to the chair madam deputy speaker have only three brief point to make first we need an honest debate in this place about the purpose of prison it be true that prison exist to protect those who otherwise might suffer harm we incarcerate people because they be dangerous but prison also matter for the reason of punishment to incarcerate somebody who have do something wrong be to deprive they of their liberty to punish they we should be straightforward that most of our constituent believe in just retribution they do not spend their time like so much of the liberal establishment do agonise about the circumstance of criminal they be more concerned about the circumstance of victim prison work for that reason above all else it be deprivation of liberty endure by those who deserve to endure it my constituent and suspect those of member from all part of the house will be outrage by the idea that some of those people will now be let loose on our street accept that there be exception set out in the proposal before the house but have to say that have the previous government introduce this measure would have vote against it and will vote against it today table amendment along with the former home secretary my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham and waterlooville suella braverman and many other colleague that would have far alter these provision will not go into those in detail madam deputy speaker because suspect you would not allow to do so but advise the new lord chancellor to take look at they to see what further step can be take to mitigate this unfortunate circumstance for that be the least we can do my second point be about the specific of this proposal it have already be say that the way of deal with the prison population be twofold in essence one be to reduce the number of people on remand by improve the throughput of people from arrest to trial the second be to reduce the population by deal with foreign national offender remand prisoner represent about of the population foreign national offender now number as the lord chancellor will know in the many thousand we can take people out of the system by do those two thing and we can also build more prison accept that the previous government should have do more but this government should look at urgent prison building we be able to build nightingale hospital at stroke so why can we not have fry prison build as at least temporary measure to accommodate people who would otherwise commit further crime my final point which have be make repeatedly be be brief madam deputy speaker because know you will want to be so and want to support you as much as can in your new role be simply this if this be temporary provision as the former home secretary my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel just say why be there no sunset clause it be all very well say there will be review in month but sunset clause would mean that the measure have to come back to this house for further consideration that be the difference between something write in the legislation and something promise in the form of review have no reason not to believe the promise of the lord chancellor take they at face value but let we have some substance around those promise by build sunset clause into the legislation that would at the very least show the good faith that be necessary component of good governance prison work let we build more prison and say to our constituent that we will no long pander to the predilection preoccupation and prejudice of the liberal establishment but will instead speak for they for what they believe be what believe many more wicked people should be incarcerate for much long that be what they would say on the doorstep in any constituency it be about time that it be say here and be delighted that it now have be by call the lord chancellor to make her closing remark with the leave of the house will respond to the debate but let begin by say what pleasure it have be to do my first piece of legislation in this house under your chairmanship madam deputy speaker you be fellow small heathan brummie and it be no doubt great first for the community from which we both come be astonish by the shadow minister remark he say that he be deeply trouble by the measure but he and his party who form the previous government be not trouble enough to prevent the crisis from occur in the first place he know full well that they have leave no other option on the table but that which we be take and anyone with access to newspaper can tell that until about three week ago this be their own plan be afraid to say that that be the modern day tory party opportunistic cynical and unfit to govern the shadow minister ask number of question most of which have address in my opening remark let remind he he should know that our prison be at over capacity the exact number will fluctuate on daily basis but everyone who work in criminal justice know that our prison will overflow by september unless we pass this measure on the sunset clause and exclusion for domestic violence link offence will take no lesson from the tory party it bring forward the end of custody supervise licence scheme and that have no exclusion for domestic abuse raise that issue many time when be sit on the opposition benches and the then tory government simply stonewall and do not give any answer whatsoever be pleased to see that opposition members have finally discover that we should treat victim of domestic abuse differently from how we have previously but they should have apply that to the measure that be their government policy until just three week ago will also take no lesson from the tory party on the sunset clause remind they that the end of custody supervise licence scheme not only do not have sunset clause but be in fact extend by the previous tory government from day to day and then to day we then have the ignominy of the increase to day that come without any announcement whatsoever so when say that the government will be different from the last one mean it we have already be far more transparent than the previous government ever be or could have dream of being and that be the vein in which we will continue be pleased that my hon friend the member for southgate and wood green bambos charalambous raise reoffende which be also bring up by the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain as well it be critical that we get the rate of reoffende down let turn to the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes be slightly perturb that find myself in agreement with his first point agree that prison be about punishment but when of offender be reoffender something be go horribly wrong within our prison every time we have somebody come out of our prison estate who be well criminal than they be when they go in that create more victim and we be let our public down if we do not get the rate of reoffende down cut reoffende be strategy for put victim first and cut crime as much as it be about help those prisoner become well citizen hope that he will take my comment in the spirit in which they be intend which be good faith response to his remark and reflect on the necessity of the country finally get its shocking rate of reoffende down and put the public first return to the point make by my hon friend the member for southgate and wood green ipp prisoner be not include within this measure know that he and other in the house have support the possibility of resentencing exercise which we do not support in opposition that be not the government policy because while do want to make progress on ipp prisoner we can not take any step that would put public protection at risk it be delicate balance act but we will start with the measure pass by the previous government in the victims and prisoners act on the change to the licence period and the action plan which we will publish as soon as possible where possible want to make progress where ipp prisoner be concerned my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter make really important point on the cost there be cost to the action that we be take today but there would be much big cost to inaction if we fail to take this measure today we will face the total collapse of the criminal justice system that catastrophic disaster have to be avert at all cost let turn to the comment of the right hon member for witham priti patel be pleased about how she have approach the debate let assure she particularly on matter of national security such as they touch on my responsibility as lord chancellor that we will always take cross party approach and look to work together in the national interest the right hon lady raise important point about the join up between different service provider whether that be police local authority or other have already chair criminal justice board and we already have an implementation taskforce that will work over the summer to ensure that all the different agency be work together so that the roll out in september be successful my ministers will be work with ministers in the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that join up occur that be an important point and will be take close personal interest in the implementation could the lord chancellor expand probably not in this debate but over the summer or even in september on the local authority the point about prison building will not go away believe that we need more prison we should be build more prison and that should come forward from the previous prison programme there be the issue about finance the billion that refer to but will she commit to publish list of the local authority she be proactively work with which may be those from the previous prison building programme where we will see more prison will happily return or write to the right hon lady in respect of specific local authority the impact of prison capacity be uneven but it be also in flux on daily basis on money and the long term supply of prison place we will be publish year prison capacity strategy which will deal with the long term plan that our government have to increase supply of prison place we do indeed need to build more prison because as be say the present stock be not fit for purpose but if we build more prison to increase capacity we will just end up with more prisoner all the evidence suggest that prison population be supply lead industry and more prison mean more prisoner remind the lord chancellor that her colleague in the other place have make it clear that third of prisoner should not be there what will she do to look at alternative to prison for the sad and wretched not the cruel and dangerous let be clear to the hon gentleman and the house the government will ensure that we have the prison place that we need so that we can protect the public and deal with the supply side issue we have inherit from the previous tory government who do not build the place that they say would be ready by next year they deliver only in addition to provide the prison place that the country need we will deal with the problem of reoffende because we be determined to ensure that we do not keep create more and more victim that be strategy for cut crime and for put victim first the government have take action where before we come inaction once this action take effect from september we will be able to end the immediate crisis in our prison give we time to introduce desperately need long term measure this have be welcome by voice from across the criminal justice system from senior police officer to my predecessor in this role it be the only safe option available to we and to choose to act otherwise would leave our country in state of unconscionable risk one that be not willing to take for that reason commend the draft instrument to the house

work with you in the come week over the past two week it have be fantastic to watch so many new member hit the ground run in represent their constituent and it have be pleasure to see return member resume their business bring their considerable experience and wisdom to the chamber this new parliament offer chance to turn the page after the sorry and sordid record of the last we face crisis of trust in politic politician and parliament as we know it be great privilege to sit in this house to be an mp represent an opportunity to change the country for the well underpin that privilege be set of solemn responsibility chief among they be the responsibility that we all have to embody the high standard of public service those standard be articulate in the seven principle of public life which apply to all those who operate in public life and that inspire and inform the code of conduct for mps it be perfectly reasonable for constituent to expect that when they cast their vote in general election their candidate will be send to this house to serve they not themselves an mp first priority therefore must be to their constituent and the rule of this house must reflect that obligation this government be elect with mandate for change and the prime minister pledge to return we to politic of service today we take our first step to deliver that in line with the government manifesto commitment be propose tightening of the rule on second job for member of this house in the first instance under current arrangement member must not provide or agree to provide pay parliamentary advice they must also not undertake service as parliamentary strategist adviser or consultant the rule prohibit member from advise in return for payment outside organisation or person on for example how they may lobby or otherwise influence the work of parliament however the guide to the rule contain exemption the exemption mean that advice on public policy in current affair and advice in general term about how parliament work be not consider parliamentary advice during the election campaign make solemn promise to my constituent that would not take on second job apart from be chief of staff to my two year old son do my right hon friend agree that it be time to end public policy and current affair advocacy role so that we all have time to spend on the great job of all represent our constituent my hon friend make very good point that be exactly the purpose of the motion hope he have time to do his other job of be great parent however the exemption potentially act as loophole allow member to use their privileged position and knowledge for personal gain that may encourage not only potential conflict of interest but conflict of attention with too much of member time and energy spend on thing other than constituency or parliamentary business be very grateful to the parliamentary commissioner for standards for his advice on this matter and for the diligent provision of guidance to all member on adherence to the code of conduct the motion put an end to the exemption it send clear signal to the public that an mp first priority be to their constituent and to the country it be first step these change shall come into effect three month from the date this motion be pass which will allow member the chance to make any necessary change to exist contract or arrangement welcome the statement that the leader of the house be make do she agree that be an mp be an honour and privilege and should be full time job and that the problem of second job go wide than the limited issue she be address in her motion today an example of the sort of behaviour that in my view should not be permit would be an mp act as manage director of financial service company headquarter in tax haven in which case they might have conflict of attention potentially assist people to avoid tax when of course we should all be serve the public interest will she act urgently to put forward further measure to prevent the type of behaviour that have draw attention to the hon lady make really good point absolutely this be about conflict of interest and conflict of attention as have make clear and will far make clear in my opening remark this be first step we need to look at some of those other area to give our constituent confidence that this will eradicate the kind of behaviour that she describe this house have consider such issue before most recently the committee on standards review the code of conduct in the previous parliament the independent committee on standards in public life also look at the matter several time issue recommendation in and in on mps outside interest thank they for their work today change form part of an ongoing conversation that trust will continue as we begin to rebuild public trust in this institution we will go far the other motion before the house will establish new modernisation committee of the house of commons fulfil another manifesto commitment the committee will be task with drive up standard and address the culture of this house as well as improve working practice be one of many newcomer to this chamber first spend time in the chamber on friday afternoon when some irregular thing happen do the leader of the house agree that it be the conduct of member in this chamber as well as issue around second job and conduct outside that have give politic and all of we here bad reputation if we be to solve these problem we should recognise that when people turn on the television or watch parliament live they want to see people listen respectfully not heckle shout out or call name the hon gentleman make really important point part of what we be begin today be about restore respect for one another both in parliament and in politic have be really encourage by the enthusiasm that new member like the hon gentleman have for this agenda hope he will continue to be involve the modernisation committee will also look at reform to make parliament more effective bring recommendation and respond swiftly to the view of the house it be intend to bring more strategic lens to these matter and where necessary address the pace of change this be not to cut across the important work of exist committees but to highlight interdependency and facilitate close working describe it as clearing house draw on all the good work of other committees the government want to build consensus for any reform and bring the house together by consult widely the deliberation of the committee will be transparent and publish so that the thinking that have inform any recommendation for change be make clear to member very important aspect of the committee intend to listen to colleague regardless of their party affiliation as we take this work forward draw on the diverse range of view and experience represent in this house turn to the amendment on the order paper hope that can provide reassurance to member about some of their concern the exist committee structure in this house include the procedure committee the committee on standards the committee of privileges the administration committee and of course the house of commons commission will have vital role to play in the work of the modernisation committee indeed it will draw heavily on their work and their recommendation however the pace of change that we have witness in recent year demonstrate the value that modernisation committee will have when it come to enact recommendation the risk base exclusion of members improvement to the independent complaints and grievance scheme and the introduction of proxy vote to cover serious long term illness or injury be prime example of the glacial pace at which we often move the purpose of the modernisation committee be not to duplicate the important work carry out by exist select committees but rather to highlight and consider their recommendation in the round as the standards committee note in its may report the standard landscape in parliament bring together an array of actor and regulatory body whose arrangement be often consider in isolation from one another my hope be that the modernisation committee will be able to bring broad perspective to these issue and will work closely with the exist parliamentary committees whose report and evidence will shape its work the new committee will have the ability to collect evidence and for chairs to guest on it where relevant will be sure to rely on the expertise and experience of all member will my right hon friend explain the relationship between the modernisation committee and the ethic and integrity commission that be be set up thank my hon friend who have do much good work in this space over the year the government ethic and integrity commission will focus more on government member ministers civil servant and other whereas the work of the modernisation committee will focus particularly on the house of commons there may be relationship at time but they will have different remit and scope hope that answer my hon friend question satisfactorily as the propose chair of the committee reassure the house that my door will always be open to member and staff across the house see it more as task and finish committee that be good comment that the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain make to the other day that will take strategic look at recommendation from other body and committees but not duplicate their work note amendment table by the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman which be about the engagement of small party and their role on the modernisation committee hope that have go some way towards provide reassurance on aspect of that issue want to be clear that want member across the house to be hear but the committee also need to be an effective body that deliver change if the committee be to work swiftly and generate momentum behind proposal for reform it need to be of an appropriate size if each party be represent as the hon member amendment require the committee would have to grow considerably that would not be proportionate with other committees of the house which do not think be reasonable give the likely breakdown do the leader of the house understand that only three party will be represent on the committee it would be possible to flex that slightly and have voice from more than just three party on the committee while still keep it relatively small understand the hon member concern it be an unfortunate case of the mathematic that apply across all select committees on other occasion in past parliaments her party have benefit from the formula that be use beyond formal membership however reassure the house that want to commit to regular and meaningful engagement with any and all party represent in this house and with member who want to contribute this to seem little bit unfair political party that be represent in this house and get over million vote at the last election will have no representation whatsoever on these committees yet party that get million vote will have plenty of representation on they do the leader of the house think that be fair as the hon gentleman know his party have four other member in this house the house be consider in term of its member not in term of the popular vote what he describe be consequence of formula that be long stand and have bring about effective representation on many select committees understand the mathematic one party have over member another have more than another have and so on and understand how committee be make up and how the government and the opposition work however when it come to more parochial thing and while be ever mindful that the government have the right to majority do the leader of the house agree that the northern ireland affairs committee the scottish affairs committee and the welsh affairs committee should include more representation from regional area perhaps there be an opportunity for wide debate on the make up of select committees can see some of the issue but reiterate that the modernisation committee need to strike balance between be effective and make fast progress it need to be representative but not too big reiterate to the small party my commitment to have ongoing meaningful engagement and to have they come regularly to the committee to give evidence and view of course the proceeding of the committee will be fully transparent we will have call for evidence and our deliberation will be regularly publish for the whole house to see my hon friend the member for ashfield lee anderson have just make very good case and have ask you specific question be it fair from your lack of reply think it be implicit that you agree that it be not fair you have it in your power to change that as matter of fairness and of listen to small party if you do not agree with that think constituent all over the country will find it absolutely astonishing order will member refrain from use the word you you be speak through the chair what be fair be that this house be make up of member of parliament who be elect by their constituency and select committees or sub committees be make up of proportion of those member that be fair and it have always be the case as an incoming government with clear mandate for change clear mandate to rebuild trust in politic and restore respect for parliament and with very large majority in the house we could have proceed without try to take the house with we not set up committee but simply table various motion on diktat basis but do not want to take that approach want to take the house with we and to represent parliament as whole all party and all committees that be why commit myself again to enable the small party to have regular meaningful engagement with the modernisation committee on issue of particular concern to they give that this be select committee that you be set be sorry give that the right hon lady be set up the committee specifically through motion on the topic of modernisation be this not an opportunity to demonstrate tiny bit of that modernisation by ensure that the small party not necessarily one member of each of they be represent in its make up would that not serve as an indication of good will towards the concept of modernisation as have say the committee will engage with the small party regularly and meaningfully let we say that there be one more place for representative of small party who would that place go to would that member represent the various view of all the small party would they represent reform the greens the scottish national party or the democratic unionist party everyone would have strong and differ view about that when it come to represent properly the range of view across the small party the commitment to ongoing meaningful engagement regular dialogue and invite all the small party to address the committee on regular basis reflect that range of view far well than have one representative on the committee also want to reassure the traditionalist among we as have say previously this be not about alter the tradition and custom of this place rather the modernisation committee will build on the work of its namesake appoint in early labour administrations those predecessor committees achieve great reform in the way in which the commons work the introduction of public bill committees the arrival of westminster hall debate and change in sit hour and recess date all those reform improve scrutiny and help to make parliament more inclusive and family friendly place of work would welcome suggestion from member of further change that it might be useful for the modernisation committee to consider in order to make parliament more effective modern work environment that well reflect the country that it serve and to help the public understand well the work that we do and the fact that we be here to serve they let turn to the committee initial work hope that as one of our first step we will look far into the question of member outside employment we will aim to consider in conjunction with the committee on standards and the parliamentary commissioner for standards whether any more change to the rule or the code be necessary particularly change intend to ensure that member private or personal interest do not impede his or her principal duty to the house however the scope of the modernisation committee will extend far than second job beyond reform of the standard system the committee will consider the culture procedure and working practice of the house parliament ability to hold the government to account be essential our goal should be to maximise the time available for scrutiny of the government legislative programme while also ensure that back bench voice remain prominent and effective our constituent be well serve when parliamentary time be spend both on robust scrutiny of legislation and on debate in which the issue that matter most to member and to our constituent can be raise look forward to hear the view of all members when assess how we can well achieve that and whether change be require make parliament accessible to all members be of paramount importance over the year good work have be do on seek to tackle the inappropriate and wrong behaviour that we have all hear about and suffer from the speaker conference in the last session do important work on the condition for members staff be also grateful to paul kernaghan for his recent review of the independent complaints and grievance scheme and to alison stanley whose review precede his we will look at take his recommendation forward as recently as may this year the committee on standards produce an excellent report on the standard landscape in parliament bring together analysis of and recommendation on all element of the standard system those piece of work be essential and they can not be consider in isolation we need to take strategic approach to these issue so that gap in the system do not develop today we have an opportunity to set out clearly and firmly the standard to which we should all aspire in this house the standard that the public expect of their elect representative we have an opportunity to put politic back to service and signal an immediate end to the politic of self interest through tightening of the rule on second job we have an opportunity to establish body that will examine the house in the round and bring it up to date look forward to this debate and be grateful for the huge amount of interest that the modernisation committee have already garner it be great pleasure to address you by your new title madam deputy speaker you and be first elect in and it be real pleasure to see the first of the intake assume the chair to preside over our proceeding be delighted to be at the dispatch box for your first appearance in the chair the first of many over the come year and hope the come decade and congratulate you on your well deserve election as the leader of the house say at the beginning of her eloquent and detailed speech standard and integrity be critical to this house of commons we be the crucible of our nation democracy our constituent have send we here to represent they and they be entitle to expect the very high standard of behaviour from we as members of parliament we be fortunate that our standard in public life be high than those in many other country but there be no room for complacency and we should strive constantly to improve and perfect the standard meet in this house that be duty we owe the public broadly welcome the initiative take by the leader of the house but want to make couple of general point before turn to some of the specific matter before we first it be very important that these reform or indeed any reform command public confidence and be see to be conduct for the good of reason it be important for we to proceed on cross party basis because that will show that the measure be be take not for party political reason but for the good of reason as be sure they be and will ensure that they stick if there be broad cross party consensus whatever reform be make will endure and survive beyond any change of government in the future hopefully the near future from my point of view but not suspect from the point of view of the leader of the house with that in mind and give the need to involve all party we be talk not just about this parliament but potentially about parliaments for decade to come do my right hon friend agree that amendment in the name of the leader of the opposition be entirely reasonable and indeed address some of the issue that have be raise by the minor party because it would potentially bring they into scope my right hon friend make an excellent point base on his long experience of the house amendment do indeed address some of the point make in early intervention would like to take this opportunity to thank the leader of the house for the consultation we have have in the past three week follow our appointment she have be collegiate and constructive in our conversation and look forward to those conversation continue in that spirit but might be permit one very small grumble the motion we be debate today be lay relatively late on tuesday evening under the rule it could have be lay later so appreciate that it be lay little in advance but we do not have lot of time to discuss potential amendment between the two of we or indeed with other party will make request for the future if we be consider motion that touch on these issue and seek cross party approach it would be really helpful to have some more time so as to be able to hold discussion between the leader of the house and other party to see whether we can improve the motion know that we have discuss this in general term but it be only when we see the detail of the motion in black and white for example the one on the modernisation committee that we can discuss it in proper detail would appreciate have bit more time in future so that we can discuss that between we that might avoid the need to table amendment and it would enshrine the consensual approach that hope she will take let turn to motion which be list on page of today order paper under business of the day as the leader of the house have say the motion remove two exemption that exist in paragraph of chapter of the guide to the rule which mean that member will not be able to be pay for provide advice on public policy or current affair or general advice about how parliament work that be broadly reasonable proposition that we be happy to support have two question ask for clarification which perhaps she will address in she sum up first if member be pursue pay activity that be not specifically to do with offer advice of the kind mention for example they might be lawyer or do work with trade union on pay basis and the thrust of the work be not to do with that sort of activity but they briefly undertake activity that might fall into the definition how would the leader of the house view that be there an absolute and complete prohibition or be there some sort of materiality test that she would expect the standards commissioner to apply it would be useful if she could provide clarification from the dispatch box my second question be raise by colleague on occasion member may be pay for party political position or trade union position in the course of which they might give advice to give specific example it have be the case in the past that the chairman of the conservative party have be pay not as minister but by the conservative party would the new rule preclude that person or indeed someone be pay by trade union probably on the labour side from offer the conservative party or trade union advice on public policy matter would be grateful if the leader of the house could shed some light on how she envisage that work broadly however we support the change and will not be oppose they in the new spirit of cross party working which we be nervously embrace for complete clarity it be worth mention that there be third exemption in the rule that the leader of the house do not refer to limb of the relevant provision which be contain in paragraph of chapter limb allow members of parliament to be pay for make medium appearance journalism write book and deliver public lecture and speech for the sake of complete clarity it be worth say that the motion before we do not make any change to that third limb the leader of the house will tell if have get this wrong so member will continue to be able to be pay for those activity she might just confirm that but it seem fairly clear consequence of the fact that only limbs and be be delete and not limb will now move on to motion on the modernisation committee which appear on page of the order paper in principle the opposition will work constructively with the leader of the house and her colleague to achieve some of the objective that she set out in her speech we have no objection to the principle of the new committee of course we want to ensure that whatever proposal it bring forward be carefully scrutinise on hold the government to account there be lot of thing about the way this house operate that be very important for opposition party big and small but also for back benchers include government back benchers be sure that labour member have hear bit about private member bills which provide really good opportunity for back benchers on both side of the house to bring forward what be typically quite specific bills to bring about change that the government might not have time to legislate for back benchers can bring forward bill to do something that be important to they and think we all want to ensure that be protect similarly the backbench business committee set out the business for thursdays government and opposition back benchers can go before the committee and organise debate on particular topic which do as back bencher few year ago it be really good way of make sure that an issue that matter to back benchers get air not in westminster hall or on the committee corridor but right here in the chamber remember organise debate on the persecution of christians around the world which would not necessarily have be debate on the floor of the house use that mechanism it be debate westminster hall also provide great opportunity to raise issue of concern to member or their constituency opposition day debate be very important as well because they offer opposition members chance to hold the government to account there be whole load of area that we want to ensure be protect for government and opposition back benchers and for opposition party big and small be sure that it be not the leader of the house intention to undermine the effectiveness of the exist mechanism but if they be consider by the modernisation committee we will collectively need to ensure that the right of back bench members of parliament and opposition party be properly protect want to speak to the amendment table in my name and those of my right hon friend and hope that the leader of the house can offer some assurance that go beyond those she have give already if she be able to offer such assurance will not move the amendment but if her assurance be insufficiently robust will move the amendment and we will vote on they should tell members that typically business of the house like this be not whip we will not be whip conservative members who be free to vote accord to their conscience hope the government be adopt the same approach and allow government back benchers to exercise their conscience it be long stand tradition that the business of the house which this be be not whip we be each vote on the motion as individual member of parliament and not hope accord to party political direction hand out by the whips office that be the approach we be take and hope it be the approach the government be take as well to be clear the purpose of the amendment be not to impede or frustrate in any way the objective that the leader of the house set out in her speech which we accept in principle we support they and will work constructively with she and her colleague but some concern have be raise by my colleague some of whom may speak later who have previously serve on some of the committees such as the committee on standards in the last parliament the committee on standards be chair by the former member for peckham harriet harman she be the mother of the house and very distinguished and highly respected member for many year the committee have do lot of work in this area and it be quite complicated the way that the standard regime operate be not straightforward and the question be complicated when harriet harman chair the committee she spend lot of time think about this issue and publish the report to which the leader of the house refer various exist committee be relevant here particularly the procedure committee the privileges committee the standards committee and the administration committee they be all important committees of the house and have all do important work in this area they be all elect by the house and at least one of they the standards committee have external member think one of they be retire chief constable the committees have an element of independence and be concerned that the establishment of the modernisation committee might replace cut across or in some way supersede or impede the work of the other house committees which be highly independent with the amendment have try to make couple of thing clear so be look for explicit assurance from the leader of the house on the follow point the first assurance that be look for be that if the modernisation committee be go to consider particular matter it will consider all the previous work do by the four committees that have mention the procedure privileges standards and administration committees and will commission the relevant underlying committee to do fresh report on the matter in hand and report up to the modernisation committee think that be what the leader of the house have in mind and it be what she say to privately if understand she correctly but would be grateful if she could be explicit and make it clear on the record that that be how she intend it to work the second important assurance be that the view of the speaker will always be seek and fully take into account on matter that be relevant to the work of the committee the speaker be elect by all of we unanimously as it happen and his view and the view of the deputy speakers be important the third assurance be that matter that would ordinarily fall to the house of commons commission will not be usurped as it be by the committee the leader of the house say to previously that the function of the house of commons commission be not define but they be in the house of commons administration act in amendment and propose that the chair of the procedure privileges standards and administration committees be add to the committee so that it have member rather than that would make sure that there be an opportunity for small party to serve in that capacity and that the expertise of those chairs come directly to the committee in addition propose that the parliamentary commissioner for standards attend the committee they would not be member because they would have to be member of parliament to be member of select committee but an attendee or an observer so that the commissioner could offer his or her opinion on the matter before the committee receive paper and give other assistance as require all those amendment be design to ensure that the exist committees be properly take into account and involve and that their voice be hear because they be important committee with lot of experience if someone look at some of these issue at first blush such as second job they might think that they be quite straightforward but often they be not there be all kind of question about people who have family business or farm or people who practise medicine or be doctor that require careful thought do not want the work that have be do previously and that will be do in future to be lose be ask the leader of the house to give explicit assurance in her opening speech she give general assurance that those committees have vital role and that the modernisation committee would draw heavily on their work and not duplicate what they do but be ask for the specific assurance that have just set out if she can give all those assurance or substantial amount of they will not move the amendment because want to proceed in spirit of cross party harmony if at all possible the opposition stand ready to work constructively on these issue to ensure that parliament reputation remain the high of any parliament anywhere in the world harmony be in all of our gift it be great to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker it be my first time in the chamber with you in the chair and wish you all the good for the future welcome this government motion it be great be on the government side for the first time in year which fulfil another manifesto pledge within only few day of the election the introduction of modernisation committee have already cause lot of interesting discussion about its make up who should or should not be on it and why its introduction be important because standard and integrity in public life be important trust in politic be at an all time low and trust in politician be at rock bottom we need to change that the introduction of the committee together with other element in the labour party manifesto will make huge difference will focus on second job we should never forget the responsibility and obligation that come with be an elect representative politician and member of parliament in this mother of all parliaments in the mother of all democracy we should never forget what the general public put into we and their belief that we be their representative and voice in here many people who do not have voice particularly in deprive area put everything they have into the fact that their mp represent they fairly and justly in the commons that be important be an mp be not hobby it be not something that people can just fancy do perhaps people want to come on monday afternoon or monday night and leave as soon as they can and they plead with the whip to get away but this be full time job plus if it be not full time job plus for people my view be that they be not do the job if someone be elect as member of parliament with odd constituent that be full time job can not understand how other people have be able to take up other job and occupation and see be an mp as something that top up their massive salary elsewhere but that be what have happen and continue to happen be sure hon member present will agree that when we be knock on door during the election campaign people would often of they be very polite and say you all the same be tell few time you all liar whatever you say beforehand once you get into the commons you all liar take great exception to that but that be the general public perception they think that mp be greedy they be liar they be all the same they want to make as much money as they can and they be not bother about the people they represent that be what we have to try to clean up plead with my right hon friend the leader of the house to make that priority of the modernisation committee we have to clean up politic we be not all the same the vast majority of people in the commons and who be elect be genuine decent people who be there to represent their constituent and make life well even though that be difficult at time but there be huge lack of faith in politician and politic many people feel as though members of parliament have decent wage but member with second job allow the perception and the narrative that mp be selfish and greedy to continue be sure there be mp who be greedy but the general perception be that everyone be the same when be work at the pit never in million year thought that would be on salary of it be fortune an absolute fortune and we have to work for it and for our constituent the average uk salary be in the north east where live it be under so be fortune we be pay fortune man we be nearly millionaire know that be not true but make the point in area of great social deprivation no matter what we say or do where we perform or where we do not how many surgery we hold and how much casework we have we be see as just one of the mps in london who do not care once we get that train bus or car to the house of commons it be as if we become different people in the office for national statistics deem of household in northumberland to be suffer some form of deprivation last year sky news report that mp earn million from second income that be lot of money when many people we represent use food bank claim in work benefit and be suffer greatly as consequence of the cost of living crisis cause by year of destruction by the conservative government the figure of million from second income be enormous the former prime minister boris johnson earn million from write speech in his last year in the previous parliament have simple question how can someone make million during parliamentary year when they be suppose to be meet constituent what spare time might they have conclude that in many way such an elect representative be not do what they should be another former prime minister theresa may make million in the last year of the previous parliament exactly the same issue arise former conservative minister earn million as commercial barrister since be elect to parliament people should not be make fortune as lawyer when they be suppose to be in the house determine legislation and represent their constituent member of parliament should be in the house represent the people who vote for they whether on education matter employment or the cost of living crisis there be enough to fill five day week from in the morning till at night where any mp can find spare time be beyond hope the leader of the house can guarantee that clean up politic be the motion no priority as have say believe that most people who be elect to the house be here for the right reason by the way mp have to have skin like rhino because we get hammer right left and centre regardless of what we vote or do not vote for the motion be great way forward and be delighted that my right hon friend the leader of the house have table it it will address the issue have raise we lose credibility through the sleaze that happen particularly during covid people believe that all mp be make but not obey the rule we must change that perception the modernisation committee along with other measure in the labour manifesto will go long way towards restore trust with the general public it be much need call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to see you in the chair congratulation on your election it be important to be here today to debate what we can do to improve politic the public who send we here expect that we know that something need to be do and hope that the government will live up to their aspiration to offer change last week the leader of the house be kind enough to mention our previous work together on the exclusion ban be pleased to confirm that too look forward to continue those cross party effort in this parliament my hon friend the member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord will speak about second job later so will focus my remark on modernisation and the modernisation committee the modernisation committee that the previous labour government set up be not uncontroversial and we should recognise that the committee will not have an elect chair it will be chair by the leader of the house however as an opposition party member have have positive engagement with the leader of the house it be important to ensure that the committee act in the good interest of the house and do not supersede the remit of other committees such as the committee on standards which have lie member at its heart the motion be about restore trust in this place and in our system we know that that be need just by look at engagement in the recent general election voter turnout overall be only six in register voter either think it be worth engage with our democratic system or could do so in many constituency the proportion be even low in some it be as little as four in it be not hard to see why when we look back at the last parliament be new member in we come in straight off the back of the division of brexit normal life and parliament be then pause during the height of the pandemic just matter of week after we be back in this place follow the second lockdown the former member for north shropshire owen paterson be find by the house to have breach the rule on lobbying and the then government try to change the rule in relation to house business to allow he to escape censure follow that secure an emergency debate on standard under standing order no for new members information in order to secure an emergency debate member must stand up in support of the application be pleased to say that give the increase in liberal democrat number could muster the number from my own party now but in be pleased that mps from the now government as well as from the opposition support my application for debate on standard look back at that debate in preparation for today see that close with the following remark this be about trust it be about trust in the government that they will represent the house and not the government in house business and it be about trust in we as our constituent representative that trust once erode be very difficult to regain trust in our politic have be erode in this past week that include all of we here in this house on behalf of all our constituent we must do all in our power to do our good to rebuild that trust as we take the next step on standard official report november vol sadly that do not happen despite our good effort personally be proud that my amendment to our standing orders to stop mps vote on their own censure motion as the former member for north shropshire do be pass with the support of the leader of the house the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips and the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy who be in her place the amendment to the exclusion motion be pass early this year hope that that decision by the house send message about the seriousness with which we in this place view guarding despite some improvement we still have rule breaking and indeed law breaking bully sexual harassment and string of serious question about conflict of interest it be important to recognise that we be all tarnish by that brush the government proposal be also about make this place modern workplace it be easy for people to forget that this be not just place where politic and policy happen but place of work not just for we here in the chamber but for hundred if not thousand of mps staff as well as the house staff who support we indeed as we start this new parliament with new intake of mps the churn of staff will be significant website advertise political vacancy be currently overflow with opportunity but can not help but wonder after the past few year whether people will want to work here can this be see as an attractive workplace where people can be not only safe but secure and where they can forge meaningful career be sure that we all know people who we think be capable in fact more capable than ourselves of be effective mps but who take the decision not to put themselves forward for election on that hope the leader of the house will agree perhaps as part of the committee work or just generally to implement the jo cox civility commission recommendation in relation to the abuse of elect representative have the pleasure of be chief whip to mp have welcome new colleague to these benches know that the bad behaviour of some cause lack of trust in all of we be pleased to hear the leader of the house commit the modernisation committee to implement the independent review of the icgs publish in may want to draw the house attention to the third recommendation which say that if someone make complaint to party about something that fall under the remit of the scheme the party have to pass it on to the icgs to be deal with rather than attempt to resolve it internally be very aware that the violin for whip be very tiny but those whip do have difficult role to play in provide pastoral care and look at discipline for it make perfect sense to ensure that where there have be inappropriate behaviour there be guarantee of an independent review be pleased to say that what be propose in this recommendation be already part of the new liberal democrat parliamentary party standing orders and would be happy to sign public declaration accordingly on that basis also urge the leader of the house to commit to implement the next step recommend by the speaker conference which report last year have the privilege of sit on the conference and can attest to the time and cross party work that go into that report these package of change together would create something much close to modern human resource system which will benefit staff and mps think the public do accept that mp be different in that we be not employee but they also expect we to adopt modern hr practice where we possibly can the underlying point for and something that hope our new mps can take on board among the excitement and honour of be in this place be this our job be unusual but that do not make we special or different when it come to uphold basic standard say that as former police officer who be also not an employee during that time it do not give we free rein to treat other poorly we must not break the rule in fact we ought to be aspire to high standard to be exemplary because of these unusual and wonderful job that we get to hold and do for our constituent we also need to look at the practice and support in place to allow member to carry out their work effectively be disappointed to hear for example that the nursery in parliament can offer place only from give that increase number of new members with family responsibility be come here we need to ensure that we give people the support to carry out that really important job to the good of our ability let return now to the motion and the question of what the modernisation committee should be consider modernisation be not just about standard and behaviour and make this century workplace but about make this modern system fit for policy decision to be make for the benefit of our constituent we want workplace that ensure that democracy work the first proposal that ask the leader of the house to consider might not be in her party good interest as it want to power through its first day but in the spirit of put our democracy first urge she to be open to revisit the wright reform and review the determination of house time the report recommend that house business committee make up on cross bench basis be able to decide how much time be give to scrutinise government legislation that may sound boring and technical but it could be revolutionary the government would still be able to set the agenda and bring forward their manifesto and their legislation but they could not tell we in the opposition how much time we should take to properly scrutinise thing the wright reform be aim at end sleaze and make parliament and the role of parliament more meaningful those goal remain ever more relevant today implement this last change from the wright reform would make mps more powerful in represent their constituent it would connect we in meaningful way and allow the public to see that mp be work on their behalf it would certainly improve debate something that be hop will improve in this new parliament it would make we more open and allow the public to truly understand the nuance and difficulty that have to be handle in legislation indeed in that way it would also benefit the government modern chamber of representative also need to be fairly elect how many time have we hear someone sigh on the radio or in the pub and moan that politician be all the same that nothing ever change and that one candidate will inevitably win so there be no point in even engage there have be so much optimism in parliament since the general election and new members have be return want to ensure that we spread that optimism out to each and every voter sense that they matter and that politic and parliament be for they fair voting process be the absolute basic step that we need to take hear the comment of the hon member for ashfield lee anderson early in the debate assure he that the liberal democrats have for the first time ever deliver number of mps that reflect the vote share that they have in the general election we will await the outcome of the electoral commission report on the most recent election before we draw any conclusion especially when it come to voter turnout in conclusion my party and look forward to engage far with the modernisation committee and urge the leader of the house not to narrow its remit modernise this place be big job but it be surely worthwhile one if we can get that right we rebuild the trust that underpin our democracy and make the law and policy that come from this place all the well for it now call jack abbott to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for call to speak let say congratulation and welcome to your place have be move and inspire by so many contribution over the past few day and it be an immense privilege to be make the first maiden speech of today also offer my good wish to the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer who will also be make his maiden speech today not only be he my neighbour but he be represent place that be really close to my heart be incredibly proud to be make my maiden speech as the new member of parliament for ipswich however this be not my first contribution in this house yesterday ask question at pmq highlight the huge potential that ipswich possess but say that after year of neglect we desperately need government support to help revive our town centre however corner of social medium instead focus on very gentle joke have make when point out that my home county of suffolk once again have premier league football team unlike our friend north of the border in norfolk one keyboard warrior in particular take umbrage at that his name be ed balls and apparently he use to work here he say that norwich have have year unbeaten run in the old farm derby run that will now sadly be extend due to ipswich be promote to the premier league and norwich get knock out in the play off last season be sure that that will be bitter pill for town fan to swallow as they visit anfield the tottenham hotspur stadium the etihad and old trafford next season ed tweet also represent my most significant celebrity beef on social medium since steve brookstein yes the first winner of the factor nearly decade ago ipswich have rich and long history so rich and long in fact that be go to use this as an opportunity to settle an old score now that colchester have vacate its town status be lay claim to ipswich be the old continuous town in england no have not check that with the house of commons library as might have be give an answer that do not want to hear but two minute of search online tell that have decent chance of be right and presume that as be now state it as fact in parliament it now become true thomas wolsey be arguably ipswich most famous son and we in ipswich have be celebrate his legacy throughout the past year through the wolsey wolsey do not always get the praise he deserve climb the greasy pole will not win you many friend something to which member of this house will attest be sure however his story rise from humble beginning to become one of the most powerful statesman in england be remarkable and he leave his imprint on our town too ipswich can also lay claim to ralph fiennes constance andrews thomas gainsborough jean ingelow brian eno edith cook and even richard ayoade to name but few my job over the come year will be ensure that kid grow up in ipswich today get their chance to make their dream reality so that when my successor come to make their maiden speech they have few more name to mention too would also like to mention my predecessor tom hunt while an mp tom often speak about be neurodiverse and be open about challenge that he face grow up he look to tackle some of the stigma that still exist and that be an incredibly powerful thing for member of parliament to do on election night tom charitably mention our share commitment to improve the life of child with special educational need and disability an issue that have campaign on for many year in suffolk will now use my role to fight for those family here in westminster the send crisis be national issue and know many colleague from across the house will have hear countless story about the struggle that family have have to endure to access the service that should be theirs in suffolk we have have decade of the most grotesque and repeat failure remember five year ago after another damn report the front page of our local paper the east anglian daily times show the face of just some of the child and family who have be so badly fail by broken system with the heartbreaking desperate headline we must be hear as itv report show today so little have change half decade later those child and their family have still not be hear this be not just about the educational impact on child immense though they may be it be also about the exhaustion desperation and isolation that family suffer day in day out the month year even battle for an education health and care plan the time spend wait by the phone or checking email hop that they might finally get some positive news and the energy they have to find just to try to navigate this broken system fight through tribunal and submit mountain upon mountain of new documentation and information all while try to care for their family as labour government we can not let the suffering of vulnerable child and their family continue it will be my personal mission in this place to fight this inequality and injustice if can make one final plea on this issue as former teaching assistant and proud gmb mp urge that when we talk about the crisis in retention and recruitment of teacher we include specialist and support staff in the conversation they be crucial to break down barrier to opportunity too would like to touch on another subject that be incredibly important to the energy transition this be not just an environmental necessity but an economic imperative it can boost our economy reduce bill ensure great security and deliver the well pay job that we need with gb energy we will be able to achieve that if britain be to become world leader in this area as the labour party have pledge want ipswich and suffolk to be right at the heart of this national renewal why should we not be over the come year thousand of job will be create in new nuclear at sizewell in offshore wind and in solar be unapologetically ambitious for our town and our county do not want those job and that investment to drift away elsewhere want kid grow up in ipswich or people look to retrain and upskill to get those secure well pay job want local business to benefit from the billion of pound that will flow out of these project and want our area to be the centre of national excellence that be our future if we be brave enough to grasp it as labour and co operative member of parliament it be particularly welcome to that our commitment to community energy sit at the very heart of this mission the great ever expansion of community energy project deliver million new owner of energy will be genuinely transformational and as proud co operative party mp will champion the growth of such project so that local people will benefit from our green transition too many of we be just few week into our new role and as this debate be about second job will be honest in my contribution and say that have no idea why or how any member of parliament would have second job we all know what be talk about to be the member of parliament for ipswich be the great privilege of my life but to be frank it be not like any other job think about ipswich and its beautiful award win park its waterfront look absolutely glorious on sunny day the music festival that we have now which would have love to have be to as teenager be only slightly old now than be then and the fact that our town once again have premier league football club might have mention that already think about suffolk too the place move to year ago still hang out with my friend from debenham high school still play for the same cricket club the mighty eye and district cricket club my batting just as terrible and my bowling just as slow if not slow still want to walk around fram castle and along the beach of southwold aldeburgh and dunwich still pop into coes family business found nearly year ago and love nothing well than eat at the lighthouse restaurant or drink an adnams or an aspall in the woolpack or the greyhound be still surround by my friend my family and my neighbour not to mention million happy memory have be shape and inspire by they for nearly quarter of century have no doubt that will make some mistake along the way and know that there will be some time when my constituent disagree with but know that everything that do here will be out of service friendship and love for my home ipswich and suffolk call lincoln jopp to make his maiden speech join other in welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker thank you for give the chance to make my maiden speech and to contribute to this important debate on second job speak for the people of spelthorne pay tribute to all member who have make their maiden speech in particular my immediate predecessor the hon member for ipswich jack abbott he be clearly go to be fearsome and fearless advocate for his constituent base purely on the fact that he be prepared to risk the opprobrium of the people of colchester the people of norwich and perhaps most impressively of all mr ed balls congratulate he thank the house staff for the impeccable welcome that they give we all as new member be for quite long time soldier so be bring up on the mantra that two minute early be three minute late it be therefore no surprise that at five minute to on the monday after the election be the first in the queue at the top of the ramp see two armed police officer but there be also doorkeeper resplendent in his uniform of morning coat and gold badge and his beard not know what to expect approach he he say good morning mr jopp be beyond impressed he continue you might not recognise under this beard sir but matt and be with you in the scots guards in afghanistan go from be impressed to be deeply touch have have the chance to listen to large number of maiden speech have notice that when the name of the member and their constituency flash up on the screen that be sometimes meet with knowing smile and sometimes not depend on the name of the seat it be like that excellent episode of yes prime minister when jim hacker and sir humphrey appleby start discuss somewhere call st george island both of they suggest that they have some form of superior insight into st george island but it quickly become apparent that neither of they have any idea where on earth it be lest my maiden speech become something like that think that ought to tell the house where spelthorne be spelthorne be everything south of heathrow airport until the thames we be in the administrative county of surrey and the historic county of middlesex we be inside the but not in london crazily you can use an oyster card to take london bus there but not the train we be outside the clutch of the mayor of london dread ultra low emission zone charge but accord to the church of england we report to the bishop of kensington hon member might think that all those special circumstance would give rise to something of an identity crisis for the people of spelthorne but not bit of it because no one who live there actually call it spelthorne anyway instead people say they live in staines stanwell or stanwell moor in ashford shepperton or laleham in halliford charlton village or sunbury by the way all hon member sit in parliament today be here thank to notable resident of stanwell thomas later lord knyvet it be he whom the king dispatch to search the cellar beneath parliament result in the capture of the treacherous gunpowder plotter clearly lord knyvet ability to navigate this place be great deal well than mine pay full tribute to my immediate predecessor as member of parliament for spelthorne kwasi kwarteng who have represent the constituency since hon member will not be surprised to hear that his name come up frequently on the doorstep in the last general election kwasi be much respect back bencher and minister as well as be charismatic performer in this chamber strong advocate for small business in spelthorne he instigate the spelthorne business plan competition now in its year spelthorne people be some of the hard work people in the country so it be appropriate that should be make this speech in debate on second job many of my constituent have they too have have selection of job as friend of mine recently remark blimey lincoln year in the army and year in private equity where do you see more violence now be in parliament with the huge honour of represent the people of spelthorne and be strike by just how important that be particularly at the moment be sure that all member want to be strong voice for their constituent and local champion for their area and do too passionately however we be also here to fulfil our second job to make thoughtful contribution to the national and international debate on issue of great moment none of which be more important in my view than the defence of the realm give that the world be the most dangerous it have be since the end of the cold war we be have defence review which will take time but time may be run out and the right course of action increase defence expenditure be all too clear now let alone in month time when the review report gently suggest to all member of this house that to govern may be to choose but it be also to act and that the answer to autocracy be rarely more bureaucracy to finish on light note hope that hon member now know little bit more about spelthorne they be welcome to visit any time whether to hear about the work of bp global technology centre as it seek to decarbonise the world or to see the large film studio in europe and the second big in the world after hollywood they might instead be interested in flutter on the horse at kempton park not that we on the conservative side of the house be allow to bet any more or maybe just to potter along the thames like three men in boat madam deputy speaker say would finish and do not make promise can not keep make one promise to the people of spelthorne it be that if they elect we would move to the constituency thank solely to the effort of my amazing wife caroline we pick up the key to our new home in spelthorne on tuesday and will have move there by the end of the weekend that be the first promise have keep to the people of spelthorne look

long road ahead of we but be committed to the challenge after all nothing great be easy right hon and hon member will be conscious that number of people still wish to get in so unfortunately be go to have to put six minute time limit on speech from the next speaker obviously member make their maiden speech will be exempt from that limit call alberto costa thank you madam deputy speaker and welcome you to your new position also congratulate the hon member for telford shaun davies on an excellent and very detailed maiden speech no doubt he will represent his constituent very successfully be the only member in the chamber today who serve on both the standards committee and the privileges committee in the parliament all of the other mps bar one be no long in the chamber the amount of work that we have to deal with in the last parliament be substantial onerous and unprecedented as such welcome the comment that the leader of the house have make and broadly support the motion that she have bring before the house however would like to make couple of point that hope she will take in the spirit of assistance in which they be intend in the time allocate to will briefly turn first to the motion on curb some element of second job as they relate to parliamentary advice the leader of the house may not be aware of the background to that proposal and where it first come from in november the standards committee publish report the fourth of the session and annex of that report contain comment make by the then parliamentary commissioner for standards the committee myself and my colleague thoroughly look at the matter on cross party basis and conclude that we probably want to recommend the banning of pay parliamentary advice or consultancy we look at the wording in the house of lords because that be the wording that the then commissioner first look at that wording be broadly identical to the wording that we currently have so in our may report we come forward with the proposal that the banning of pay parliamentary advice should align with the house of lords code my question to the leader of the house be this be it her intention to ensure that the code in the other place be amend so that we do not have an oddity where for instance labour peer could carry on with the activity that she propose to ban but an mp in this house would be unable to do so that be not the objective of the standards committee when we first make our proposal so it would be very helpful if in she sum up she could confirm that the appropriate mirror change will be make in the house of lords will now turn briefly to the other much more substantial motion be sorry that there be time limit because have many thing to say about this motion but give that have very short period of time in which to speak will restrict my comment as the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain touch on we as house should remember that the standards committee be unlike any other select committee of the house of commons because half of its member be lie member people who be not member of parliament the total membership of mean that if we take out the chair from vote the lay member have substantive jurisdiction on that committee many of those lie member will undoubtedly be watch this debate can not believe that it be the government intention to create committee that will be look at standard even at strategic level that exclude lay member when the leader of the house be on the opposition benches she be strong believer in have lie member on the committee so will she look again carefully at her proposal not only take into account the balance of political party but importantly ensure that this new committee have lie member representation at least when it be discuss standard issue my proposal be that the seven current lay member of the standards committee could elect one from among their number to sit on that committee the other point want to make be make by the shadow leader of the house my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp and do not propose to rehearse they again suffice it to say that the leader of the house say that the chair of the standards committee the chair of the administration committee and so on would be gueste on to the committee but if the committee be to be an effective body that can deliver change as she hop we must ensure that these people be not simply gueste but that experience and knowledge be somehow bring in perhaps with ex officio member instead of full voting member suggest she look again at that proposal and perhaps make some welcome comment at the end to conclude the proposal be welcome one but urge the leader of the house to look carefully at bring lie member on to the committee call chris murray to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker it be great honour to make my maiden speech as you take your first day in the chair follow your election it be also great honour to follow the excellent maiden speech we have hear from my hon friend the member for ipswich jack abbott the hon member for spelthorne lincoln jopp and my hon friend the member for telford shaun davies they have make excellent and intimidatingly good maiden speech keep up with they will be full time job the constituency represent edinburgh east and musselburgh be geographically small but extremely diverse comprise city centre suburb town and village it stretch from the historic centre of edinburgh along the forth coast and be unrivalle in both its natural and architectural beauty it encompass niddrie and lochend hard work community of people who contribute much but whose talent and industry would offer yet more if opportunity allow hold back as they be by lack not only of work but of secure working condition there be lot of second job there organisation such as the greenhouse pantry in craigmillar help people keep their head above water in the cost of living crisis the constituency be also home to the diverse vibrant community of abbeyhill southside and leith links full of excitement and ambition but hold back by housing crisis edinburgh have see the sharp rent increase in europe through duddingston and craigentinny the seat stretch to portobello and joppa edinburgh seaside where group such as the porty water collective be fight the scandal of sewage in our sea also represent musselburgh the honest toun perfectly sandwich between capital countryside and coast where last weekend attend the kirkin and sashing of this year honest lad and lass billy innes and eilidh bonthron my constituency be home to two university the university of edinburgh at one end and queen margaret university at the other this make the seat both intellectually dynamic and young student and recent graduate make their home there and their idea skill and energy make they the engine for my constituency enormous potential have be strike by the contribution of these young people when the pandemic come they be the group least at risk from the virus but they unhesitatingly sacrifice so many moment in their life to protect other arguably no generation have give up so much for another since the war but to my mind their sacrifice have not be adequately acknowledge never mind compensate in this parliament we must secure for they well pay interesting job in the industry of the future decent affordable housing and climate that be not disintegrate before their eye in the past event in my constituency have ricochet out across the world the fiery debate of the reformation and the rational argument of the enlightenment be incubate in my seat in century past nevertheless be convince our good day lie ahead because my community have all the raw material for vibrant dynamic century the university and their research spin off in fintech and biotech innovative start up in their hundred and huge opportunity in the energy transition and green technology be all to be find there if we be to have the economic growth the government be aim for my constituency could be powerhouse of it incorporate as it do the historic old town of edinburgh culture hospitality and tourism form the economic backbone of my constituency not least in august when it play host to the edinburgh international festival and fringe be correct madam deputy speaker in think that the convention be that mps must inform another member when they visit their seat in that case expect my mailbox to melt down when everyone come to the edinburgh festival next month of course everyone be most welcome the edinburgh fringe be well know for its world class performance but also for amateur try to get attention by say something shocking the conservative leadership contender will fit right in while my constituency have many castle theatre and museum the most important building in the seat indeed in scotland lie at the foot of the royal mile in the scottish parliament at holyrood that be where the lifeblood of the scottish political heart beat and that be why it be fitting that make my maiden speech as we discuss how to modernise parliament it be safe to say that relation between this parliament and that one have not be good these past year that must change be hearten to hear in the king speech an agenda that will address that just as be when the prime minister first visit be to my constituency that speak to new era in scottish politic of respect constructive engagement and delivery and look forward to play my part in it as society change so the parliaments that represent it must change too both in their member and their practice this parliament be break new ground in how it represent modern britain not just in have the first woman chancellor woman deputy prime minister and labour woman mps but in have more minority more lgbt representative and more state educate mps be glad that in the latter two be add to the tally my generation grow up with scottish devolution have two parliaments be fact of life for we with the scottish parliament now year old there be much that this place can learn from holyrood and reciprocally there be thing holyrood can learn from here no parliament have monopoly on modernisation it be something to which we must all continually strive be pleased to see the member of the scottish parliament for the lothian region sarah boyack in the gallery have learn much from she and will continue to do so let our two parliaments co operate and learn from each other so that they make each other well in synergy and symbiosis rather than with rancour and anger let we remember as we modernise here that this be one of several parliaments and assemblies in this land while be discuss scottish politic let pay tribute to my predecessor tommy sheppard be an assiduous and dedicated constituency mp and for that he be hold in high regard by many in edinburgh in this place he be dedicated champion of peace and justice in the middle east and although he and may take different view on constitutional question hope my constituent will find continuity on both those score also pay tribute to his predecessor sheila gilmore who have be dedicate to improve the life of the people of edinburgh particularly the poor for many decade include five year in this house her commitment to the community even year after leave office be astounding and rarely have new member be so support by predecessor as have be by she the come year will be critical for my constituency if we can generate economic growth by attract the job of the future if we can ensure that people who work hard get good wage and decent condition and if we can seize the opportunity of the energy transition bring opportunity for the young and take our place as global cultural capital then we can achieve our potential for all its attribute and give the challenge we face my community need government focus on its priority in fact it need both its government and both its parliaments to do that it need both parliament to modernise to meet the demand of today and to not be distract by the argument of decade past and member of both parliaments to learn from each other practice and to spur each other on it need both parliaments to compete in claim credit for improvement in people life not in cast blame for what have go wrong for my part mean to be an mp for use and not for show everything do in this place will be aim at deploy the power of government to unleash the untapped potential of my constituency call blake stephenson to make his maiden speech congratulate

the swift conclusion that bit of modernisation in this house would not go amiss member will find that engage in that debate constructively and thoughtfully as we think about how this parliament and future parliaments should progress first congratulate the hon member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray have probably not pronounce that correctly and apologise not only to he but to all

woodland similar concern exist throughout mid bedfordshire whether in the green belt or not and those community have my full support let we remind ourselves that the green belt be labour policy and

say to be the most publish book in the english language record that perhaps one former member for mid bedfordshire be intent on challenge no doubt if ban on second job for member come to pass those on both side of the house may find that they also have natural flair for write similarly successful fiction we be large intake of new member we have an opportunity to challenge the status quo and to breathe fresh life into our politic modernisation must be thoughtful reflect consensus which certainly emerge in my election campaign that our politic must improve but we must recognise that this place need the experience and knowledge that come from work in industry commerce law and yes even in politic lest we become house of politician interested only in the next election the next poll and the next headline that be not what the people out there want they want competent government to address the issue that they be concern about and an effective opposition to hold that government to account will play my full role in scrutinise the plan that come forward to ensure that the parliament that be so proud to be member of embodie the standard in public life that the people of mid bedfordshire and across the country expect call alex barros curtis to make his maiden speech welcome you to your place madam deputy speaker thank you for allow to make my first contribution to the

distinction for year and he be quality act to follow that quality be clearly spot by the house when kevin give his maiden speech on june after finish it peter bottomley the last parliament father of

vol mr bottomley be prescient because follow the general election kevin be indeed appoint an assistant government whip want to place on the record my thank to kevin and his wife amy for their generosity advice and support have listen to number of maiden speech over the past few day of debate believe it have become tradition to refer to one constituency as the most beautiful in all the land as this place be steep in tradition with perhaps sprinkling of modernisation to come would not want to disappoint so can confirm that cardiff west be indeed the most beautiful or as we say in welsh prydferth or hardd until this election cardiff west exist entirely within the boundary of the city of cardiff but follow the most recent set of boundary change the ward of pontyclun in rhondda cynon taf now form part of it cardiff west gain be pontypridd loss as pontyclun be vibrant community full of good people and thriving high street that we must strive to maintain on that note thank my hon

fairwater and pentrebane pentyrch radyr and morganstown gwaelod garth ely and caerau to name but few each area be define by its own unique character but the common thread that run through they be proud community replete with family local activist sport club volunteer and faith leader all commit to serve the community they call home that become clear to during the election campaign as their newly elect member of parliament will work with anyone who genuinely seek to support cardiff west in the past few day the labour government have set out their plan to deliver on the commitment we make to the british people at the election throughout that election campaign meet countless constituent who demand change but not just for change sake they want change with purpose change that would improve their life by make work pay by deliver new deal for work people by rebuild their broken public service by make their street safe by offer more inclusive and tolerant discourse and by make an offer of future for our country that be more positive more hopeful and more honest of course for we to deliver that change we must embody that change and we need only look around the chamber to see that in this parliament woman be elect represent record high of just over this be also the most diverse parliament by race and this parliament include the large cohort of member of any parliament in the world progress do not always move in straight line but if one look around this chamber and consider the tenor of maiden speech we have hear in these last few day of debate we see that there be indeed reason for hope at the outset of this new parliament that deserve special mention while we can disagree in politic we should always strive to do so with decency honesty and respect do so be not sign of weakness but of confidence in ourselves be elect have be both thrill and humble in equal measure be sure that many of my colleague across both side of the house have experience not dissimilar thought and feeling however be not so blind by the excitement of be elect to this great place to forget that this be not about it be about what can and will do to repay the trust of my constituent and to fight for the cause that matter to they cause such as defend our art and culture particularly the cut that threaten the existence of the welsh national opera support our welsh and westminster government to cut the level of child poverty recruit the new teacher we need and cut nhs waiting time unlock our green energy potential to deliver cheap and green energy and make work pay by deliver on that new deal for work people ultimately of course it be not just about what we each say it be about what we do for so long as be here will work hard for strong and fair cardiff west finally want to thank those people but for whom would not be here give this maiden speech the first thank go to my family my mum my dad and my sister my family have inspire my value of public service and have make well person the other thank go to my husband who be up in the gallery with my sister we celebrate our six year wedding anniversary during the final day of the campaign but we actually meet more than year ago at time when be still struggle to acknowledge let alone accept that be gay through all that he have the love and patience to support in accept who be and to be honest about that truly would not be here without his love support and friendship as proud welshman and proud gay man be excited to play my part in the government programme of national renewal in so do will endeavour to represent cardiff west to the very good of my ability call ellie chowns thank you madam deputy speaker welcome you to your place pay tribute to the very moving and passionate maiden speech we have hear from across the house today probably do not have time to go through all the detail in they but shall remember not to fall asleep in the library recognise the passion with which many people speak about defend their constituent interest and in particular tackle child poverty would like to speak to the formal topic of the debate the modernisation of the house very much welcome the initiative by the leader of the house in set up the committee and look forward to feed into it in whatever way possible include through this debate modernisation should be about how we can become more efficient and effective as house and therefore more productive in our role as mps that be what we have be elect to do as mention hope the committee can be as representative as possible it strike that as more than half the mp be now newbie mp as indeed be there be perhaps an opportunity to ensure that the committee be balance in that way so that the voice of new mps who be able to draw on wide range of experience and perhaps have fresh eye and fresh insight which think be mention in one of the maiden speech be represent from my perspective as newly elect member would like to offer observation on three element of how the house operate to feed into the deliberation of the committee would like to speak about sit speak and voting very day to day activity have spend only three week in this house but know from conversation in the corridor that my observation be share by other member in all part of the house my first point be about sit we be in chamber that be far too small to fit we all know that be not novel observation but as newly elect mp find it really strike it be quite extraordinary have serve as councillor for several year and have serve as member of the european parliament in each of those chamber we would have our own seat and our own desk and we could plug in our device so that we could work off electronic material it seem extraordinary that we do not have space in this chamber for each of we to sit and speak indeed be amazed to discover that there be seat in this chamber on which we can sit but from which we can not speak that seem an extraordinary limitation on the ability for everybody to participate in our debate would it be wonderful if we all have somewhere to sit the limitation on space also lead to some frankly rather ridiculous behaviour such as the practice of queue up at the opening of the chamber to place prayer card and book seat at time of great demand such as the king speech or prime minister question that lead to contestation over space that simply would not happen if we have enough space for everybody while be on the topic of prayer there be practice in this place of have christian prayer as the daughter of preacher be very familiar with those but suggest that in this day and age in country of all faith and none it might be time to consider an approach little more like radio thought for the day with moment of reflection at the beginning of the day and an opportunity to hear view from people from range of faith and indeed with none will move on to speak be glad that time limit have be introduce for speech today be use to speak in chamber with time limit time limit aid the democratic process because they mean that everybody get fair crack of the whip and an equal chance to have their voice hear in the chamber if we have more time limit there would be more opportunity for people to participate and perhaps mp would be keener to participate in debate there be also the process of get slot have be busy bob up and down to attract your attention madam deputy speaker as do for five solid hour last week without manage to attract the speaker attention in recent day number of member have want to make maiden speech but have not be able to the practice of bob might be good for the glute but suggest that it be not so good for democracy perhaps we could find more efficient way of allocate speak time while we be on the topic note that the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain speak about the process for government or non government control of speak time an initiative to increase back bench influence over the allocation of speak time would be very useful my final point on speak be about the culture in this house in the few short day that have spend in this chamber have witness everything from excessive deference to frankly bray as other member have say in their maiden speech we really need to clean up politic we really need to show that we be all here to debate in as positive spirit as possible as the hon member for cardiff west mr barros curtis say it be extraordinary to that we do not have electronic voting we have semi system while have be here have participate in five vote which have take at least an hour and quarter if we add up all our vote it basically come to month of mp time it be an utter waste of time and totally unproductive we could be get through far more let we get rid of the vote lobbies we can double the physical size of the chamber if we get rid of they that be genuine practical suggestion we can take the opportunity of the decant process and have newbie mps to really modernise how we operate here finally if we want to be truly modern house of commons we need proportional representation call sureena brackenridge to make her maiden speech may offer you my congratulation madam deputy speaker and also thank you for give the opportunity to make my maiden speech and in particular to make it during this fundamentally important debate which will ensure that we be not just government of service but house of service in my speech will mention many people who have do precisely that serve other it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns and to hear such excellent maiden speech from member on both side of the house it be an honour to serve the community where be bear raise my family and work in local secondary school as science teacher and then deputy headteacher pay tribute to my predecessor jane stevenson and give parliamentary boundary change eddie hughes as well thank they for their faithful service to our community also wish to honour the late ian brookfield former leader of wolverhampton city council who sadly pass away at the age of after short illness ian fill any room and be political giant his legacy of celebrate the diversity of our city and fight for the vulnerable will not be forget take mere glance at the roll call of previous mp who have serve wolverhampton north east and you soon realise that there be big shoe to fill jennie lee who when first elect be too young to vote be instrumental in establish the open university ken purchase who serve for year be deeply respected constituency mp ken play pivotal role in the campaign to save our beloved wolverhampton wanderers football club lose our club would have be devastating for the local community not only in economic term but in term of our identity as city that truly love our football club return member my hon friend the member for wycombe emma reynolds be minister in the last labour government and know

find what you love and go for it with everything you have finally my humble thank go to the electorate of wolverhampton north east who put their trust in to those who do not vote for please know that be here to serve you as well the damage do will not be fix overnight but the work have start will serve all constituent to bring the change you deserve congratulation to you and your colleague on your new role madam deputy speaker wish you the very good of luck in deal with all of we in our time here congratulate the hon member for wolverhampton north east sureena brackenridge on her excellent maiden speech and particularly on her passionate message to her student who be sure miss she very much too want to speak about the motion on the order paper there be huge amount could say about the way in which this house should be modernise have be speak and think about it for year be probably one of the few member who have spend many hour pore over the standing orders consider how they could well be change to improve this house not many people be quite as geeky about that as be however will not focus on that instead want to talk about the motion in front of we motion have be badge as second job motion it relate to pay employment but it do not include the pay employment that constituent think of when they think about second job they think about the member appear on gb news weekly but that be not cover in the propose change as the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns say constituent think about the people do work for financial institution but again that be not include in the motion the change to the rule be good but the motion should not be badge as relate to second job what it do be increase the transparency and restriction on members of parliament who seek to use their privileged knowledge to get pay employment we all have knowledge of parliamentary procedure because we be mp and the motion prevent we from use that to get money that be laudable aim but it be not the change that the house need in order to fix the issue of second job will support the government change but they need to go far far have several concern about the motion on the modernisation committee begin with its incredibly woolly remit which be to consider reform to house of commons procedure standard and working practice and to make recommendation thereon its remit be not to modernise the house of commons which would have be more supportive of if we give the committee an understanding that it need to drag the house into the century never mind the century by increase the amount of modern working practice and the ability of mp to represent their constituent in parliament that would be helpful but the remit be not there it be just to make recommendation so be disappointed that the government have not go far on that the issue of the make up of members be significant it be not just about the small party that be not the first second or third in the house want to have voice but about the way that the government have choose to arrange the committee and the number of member that they have choose to have on it which mean they have guarantee that it can not have northern ireland member the membership will be divvy up between the labour party the conservatives and the lib dems so there will never be dup member or anyone make decision on the committee who be struggle with the geographical challenge that be unique to northern ireland members the snp would have like seat on the committee be pleased to hear what the leader of the house say about try to ensure that all voice be hear but like the shadow leader of the house would like to have have more conversation with she beforehand about it so that we could have suggest our view on the good way for our voice to be hear if she really want to work collegiately we be happy to do that but unfortunately this have not get off to the most collegiate start the government should consider the good way to do that because be concerned about the geographical issue the leader of the house speak specifically about the experience of all member in this place would like the committee to consider hear from former mp who also have significant experience it may be that we do not currently have mp with certain disability or who have experience the proxy voting system but we do formerly during covid do huge amount of work with the procedure committee which meet online almost every day in the early day of lockdown we consider every possible way to make the house covid compliant and make huge number of recommendation to the government some of which could be incorporate to make the house more modern as time go on be pleased that the leader of the house commit that the modernisation committee will take evidence from those committees but there will still be no snp voice to feed into the modernisation committee because we be unlikely to get seat on any of those committees it be all well and good take advice from those place but the small party be again be restrict in how they be be hear be happy to support the creation of the committee but would appreciate it if the leader of the house try to work in more collegiate way than she have so far call neil duncan jordan to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker for give the opportunity to make my maiden speech in this debate congratulate you on your recent election and congratulate my hon friend the member for wolverhampton north east sureena brackenridge on an excellent address look forward to hear many more such

continue to play significant role in the town whether through the manufacture of yacht the fishing industry or associate tourism of course the most famous nautical connection be the headquarters of the royal national lifeboat institution which be celebrate its anniversary be happy to add my name to the early day motion table by my hon friend the member for hastings and rye helena dollimore on the rnli anniversary and to pay tribute to the man and woman who have volunteer over the year to save other irrespective of who they be or where they come from you will know madam deputy speaker that rise tide raise all boat it be important for member to understand that not everyone in poole be multimillionaire although the most expensive land in the country know as sandbanks might be home to footballer and celebrity nearly resident in poole struggle to cover essential cost from their monthly income accord to citizens advice one in three of those be in work in poole like the rest of the

the pleasure of meeting who run the community food store in st gabriel church in hamworthy it offer local family chance to buy the thing they need at very low cost but importantly in way that retain their dignity without that work many more family would be in severe financial difficulty that be why welcome the king speech and the commitment to make work pay as set out in the employment right bill

improve their term and condition as well as make the improvement need to address low pay and inequality in the workplace ban zero hour contract end fire and rehire and give day one right on parental

second day run with you in the chair may say what pleasure it be to follow the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan wish he well along with all the other who make their maiden speech today this house be enrich and bless by the contribution of member from all part of the house it augur well for the future we all benefit when everyone bring their knowledge and their expertise of other subject matter to the chamber in the very short time that have wish to refer to the important conversation that need to be have about mps and double jobbing as mp and elect representative our three main priority be accountability scrutiny and representation there be way to be critical and compassionate in relation to this subject for instance we should consider those who may have have establish business before they come to this house report in indicate that mp declare more earning from directorship pay employment and shareholding than they do from their parliamentary salary that put question in my mind on the other hand have never make any secret of how grateful be to be able to carry on with my role dedicate so much of my time as do other to do my job to the good of my ability but we have seven sinn féin mp who be elect but do not take their seat they do not get wage but they can claim for office expense undoubtedly there be issue in relation to double jobbing that need to be address but many of those be down to individual circumstance do not know everybody circumstance but an mp who be elect to this house could be here for five year for one term and at the end of it they will still have mortgage to pay what about the job or even the opportunity that they may have have before they come here just pose that as question be councillor and member of the northern ireland assembly before become an mp once be elect give up my council job and my role as an mla give the business that own to my son that be what we can do but consideration should be give to both side of the argument however my stance be clear my no priority be do the job that be elect to do which be to represent the people of strangford to scrutinise government legislation and to be hold accountable to my constituent the other issue that wish to speak to be modernisation can well remember come to this house sit on these green benches and feel the overwhelming weight of responsibility on my shoulder be innately aware of what it mean to have the honour of represent my constituency in the great seat of democracy although note the difference in the way that thing be handle when be first elect in and struggle to come to term with some of the traditional aspect of the house now treasure those tradition there be those who express the other point of view and want to see lot of change and then there be those who like see the tradition as something to hold on to agree with the rationale behind these timeless tradition which be something that be afraid we will lose if we blindly modernise mr speaker say to hon member if you want to catch my eye wear tie well everybody who can and should wear tie be wear one today support the rationale behind that think it be the right way to do thing if we do not move with the time then the time will move without we however urge caution we should ensure that not one thing be change simply because we can rather than because we should not all modernisation be welcome there be now rule in place that preclude from be an officer of more than six all party parliamentary group that have be difficult as be let some of those group down put that forward as point of view obviously other will take different view on that some modernisation be necessary the overhaul of financial claim be vital tool in restore public confidence modernisation of the voting system be necessary for functionality during covid and be thankful that the flexibility be there but we need to be incredibly careful if we consider change to commons voting that they do not result in more absenteeism and remote voting some have suggest that we change the voting system suggest that we do not modernisation of the maternity system be long overdue and be thankful for that we need modernisation but it must be for clear purpose and not for ease of operation the tradition of this place should not be dismiss as mere tradition there be wisdom behind many of they that must be protect urge the house to ensure that such protection be in place be all for modernisation as necessary but feel strongly that it must be do with wisdom and sensitivity and that our century long tradition should not be abandon to give an appearance of modern society yes would love to speak first in every debate but be not go to would not be allow to do so it would not be the right way of do thing respect the convention that would prevent it as ancient but necessary every single issue discuss must be consider in that way just because something have age do not mean that it cease to be of use that must be the premise of any discussion on modernisation in this great house in this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland well together with all the culture history and tradition from all part of society that we have here we can work together to make change in the right way not change for change sake but the change that be necessary call gordon mckee to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker congratulate you on your election and welcome you to the chair although it feel bit weird to welcome anyone here give that have be here for about two minute follow on from the excellent contribution make by my hon friend the member for poole neil duncan jordan for cardiff west mr barros curtis and for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray among other praise in particular my hon friend for edinburgh east and musselburgh both because he give an excellent speech and because his mum be one of my constituent as start this new job have be think lot about my family be do so while prepare my remark today be think in particular of my grandpa who be coalminer in the coalfield of lanarkshire just outside glasgow when be wee boy he would tell of the condition that he work in darkness he say so black that you could hold your hand right in front of your eye and still not be able to see it in that darkness he would toil away unable to imagine his own future let alone that of his grandwean as he would say all the while he toil he be inhale fume so toxic that later in life he would have lung cancer and live the rest of his life with just one lung my dad welder be here today off during the glasgow fair along with my mum who run her own business to watch from the gallery my career so far have be very different from that of my parent and grandparent for start they have proper job whereas be now do this for living but it have be different for two relate reason the first be the labour party both in the sense that it have help to provide with new job and in the protection that it have deliver for work people health and safety legislation deliver by labour and build by the trade union movement have end the kind of condition that my grandparent work in the second reason my career have be different be technology suspect that today in britain there be more bitcoin miner than coalminer and that be ultimately good thing coalmining be difficult hard laborious work as kid spend many long hour in front of my computer and while much of that be spend play fifa against my wee brother mark some of it be more productive because teach myself to code watch youtube video and over week month and year learn how to build software develop iphone app that be use around the world mean that code write on my laptop in glasgow could be push out to device around the world in second and that this year old kid in his childhood bedroom could run an app servicing people from los angeles to dubai if it can do that technology can reform our public service too technology might even help to reform this house as we be debate today hope and know that high growth innovative business in my home city of glasgow will be key part of that much have be say and write about glasgow over the year but one thing stick with in particular anthony bourdain be not man know for his parliamentary language so let we just say that he describe glasgow as the most unpretentious place on earth an antidote to the world in his word so unapologetically work class and attitude free think he be right because of all the thing love about glasgow it be our people and our humour that enjoy most if someone ever get wee bit too big for their boot return home to glasgow will soon put an end to that something be sure will be increasingly useful the long spend in this place unlike many glaswegians my admiration even extend to some of glasgow politician it be customary in speech such as this to praise our predecessor but know that for some that will be do through slightly gritted tooth at the end of long and bitter fought election campaign in my case talk about my predecessor with genuine warmth and admiration stewart mcdonald serve the people of glasgow south diligently and build an enviable reputation in this place he be particularly respect for his long stand support for the people of ukraine something that see he award the ukrainian order of merit if leave this place have do half as much as he do for people around the world fight for democracy will leave happy man before stewart there be labour predecessor there be tom harris who have be personally kind to john maxton now lord maxton whose son teach modern study in high school believe it or not although will leave it up to other to decide whether he do good or bad job of that and of course teddy taylor who be still remember fondly by many of my constituent would also like to mention two other member of this house who have big impact on my life both from glasgow the former member for east kilbride adam ingram grow up in the east end of glasgow and be one of the first people ever speak to in the labour party his advice and wise counsel have be constant source of support to over the year and be incredibly grateful the other be southsider my friend and the former member for glasgow central anas sarwar have the great privilege of serve as the director of anas successful leadership campaign to become leader of scottish labour three and half year ago as we sit begin that campaign it be hard to imagine what the future might hold but even in our most optimistic of moment do not think we would have predict this stand here as one of scottish labour mps have praise three glaswegians will do something unusual for glasgow mp and praise someone from edinburgh my right hon friend the member for edinburgh south ian murray have be friend of mine for many year and he deserve enormous credit for his long and lonely shift as the sole scottish labour mp and for be someone who recognise that the labour party have to change if it be to earn people trust once again it give enormous pleasure and pride to see he in his rightful place as the secretary of state for scotland that brief interlude aside we return to scotland real capital city be privileged to represent glasgow southside place that have have something of renaissance in recent year boast the trendy tenement of shawlands the tree line avenue of newlands and the beautiful conservation village of carmunnock among other my constituency contain many of glasgow beautiful park of which linn park queen park and pollok country park be just few in the latter hon member will find the burrell collection which be award the art fund museum of the year award after its reopening last year like many part of the city however we be not without difficulty castlemilk be an area with enormous spirit and the kind people anyone will ever meet but it also remain an area with challenge even today the simple act of get supermarket in castlemilk have prove difficult something hope to change as the local mp what be true of all my constituency be that it be an outward look diverse and welcome place the scots asian community in particular have contribute enormously to glasgow character and be very proud to represent they here in parliament immigration have make my constituency rich and it make our country rich too the southside of glasgow be also passionately pro european place although brexit be settle in the previous parliament intend to support the government move to repair our relationship with europe my first duty be to my constituency and my country be the member of parliament for glasgow south be the only job that will do so long as the people of glasgow south wish for to continue but also feel sense of responsibility towards the many million of people at home and around the world who do not have voice the people toil away in darkness just as my grandpa do all those year ago hope that none of we in this house forget the million indeed billion of people around the world who be not as lucky as we include those face persecution or war those without access to clean water or good education and those bind by modern slavery be one of the lucky few to serve in this place but will never forget the people who put here and the people who do not have voice deliver for they will be how judge my success call lisa smart to make her maiden speech it be an absolute honour to follow the hon member for glasgow south gordon mckee he speak passionately about his constituency and his love for his constituent be clear for all to hear it be also an honour to follow maiden speech from the hon member for ipswich jack abbott for spelthorne lincoln jopp for telford shaun davies for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson for cardiff west mr barros curtis for wolverhampton north east sureena brackenridge and for poole neil duncan jordan each be in their own way an act to follow thank the people of hazel grove constituency for place their trust in that trust be profound responsibility and be committed to repay it through hard work integrity and service to my community acknowledge the work of my predecessor william wragg who serve in parliament from until he stand down at the last election he stand up to those in power when he feel that it be need and he speak openly about poor mental health in way that be sure will have help to break down stigma on behalf of all resident of hazel grove wish he all the good for the future accept that may be little biased but hazel grove be quite clearly the fine constituency in the land it range from central stockport out to the edge of the peak district take in the community of bredbury bosden farm compstall great moor hawk green heaviley high lane little moor marple marple bridge mellor mill brow norbury offerton romiley strines woodley and some but not all of hazel grove itself whether the peaceful haven of our green space or the proud reminder of our industrial heritage hazel grove have it all we have the peak forest the macclesfield canal which have one of the steep lock flight in the country and our beautiful river the goyt the mersey and the tame it be no wonder so many people want to call our area home our river would be even more beautiful if the water company be not pump quite so much sewage into they we very much look forward to the government implement their plan to clean up that scandal however it be the people who really make our community start point social enterprise in woodley be tackle digital exclusion by give some of my more mature constituent the confidence to get online the cherry tree project in romiley empower young people to live their good life and nk theatre arts work with child and adult of all ability across the borough use creativity and the perform art to transform life local people have many of the answer that we seek on how to fix the problem we face as country my job and the job of this house be to empower they not tell they what be good for they be liberal and liberal democrat we exist to build and safeguard fair free and open society in which we balance the fundamental value of liberty equality and community and in which no one shall be enslave by poverty ignorance or conformity join the lib dems and get involve in politic because shout at the television be not bring about the change that we need my constituent have be very clear with that their top priority be our local health service they should not have hospital that be literally fall down they should not have to wait month or year for treatment and they should not have to struggle to care for their love one the phenomenal staff at stepping hill hospital should not have to wade through flood corridor to get to their patient because yet another pipe have burst as it do last weekend stepping hill hospital must get the repair it need and we need new additional hospital in the town centre so that local people can get the health and social care service they deserve will not rest until they do could not possibly make my first speech in this house without mention the last liberal democrat to represent my community andrew stunell andrew be the mp for hazel grove from to and he be that rare kind of politician who give politic good name he be an mp who set the standard to which all who come after he be rightly hold he be interested in do something not just be something he put his constituent first and bring about change in the law both as minister and as back bencher andrew make thing well for the whole country as minister he deliver the localism act but as back bencher he come top of the private member bill ballot in result in the sustainable and secure buildings bill become an act of parliament in more than all that he be one of the warm kind people have ever meet he be the kind of person you want on your team hard work honest and kind he help work out what it be to make difference in public life the people of hazel grove the whole lib dem family and will miss he and his guidance hugely be the first woman to be elect as the mp for hazel grove and take that responsibility really seriously be especially delighted to be member of the large group of liberal democrats ever elect to this house there be of we if we include the right honourable jennie go to comprehensive school and be the first member of my family to go to university before decide that shout at the telly be not bring about the change that want to see in the world and that stand for elect office be the way to be part of that change work in business as director of client relation my client be big pension fund charity and foundation be then the chief exec of charity educate woman and girl in the develop world for the past eight year have also be lucky enough to represent some of my constituent as an elect councillor for bredbury green and romiley on stockport council role have love be one of rather large number of colleague who come to this house know at first hand the value of local government and the desperate need for it to be fund properly turn to the substance of today debate which be standard and modernisation the main thrust of what we have hear from the government and the leader of the house that any further role should benefit an mp constituent be absolutely right in the short term we should of course stop mp from take on role as pay parliamentary adviser strategist or consultant in the long term daylight be often the good disinfectant so ask the leader of the house to consider whether publish any employment contract for outside arrangement with suitable redaction and the transparency that would bring would allow constituent to judge for themselves whether they be get value for money from their mp as new mp be strike and more than little bemused by some of the wonderful convention and habit of this house take it as read that colleague be honourable be good thing and refer to one another as the members for our constituency act as powerful reminder of who send we here but be also strike by how much modernisation be need we on the lib dem benches look forward to support the government when we agree but would expect we to urge persuade and on occasion push the government to go far and fast to make we the most effective we can be because our constituent deserve no less with so many newly elect colleague we have crack opportunity to change this place for the well it could be so much more efficient and so much more effective let we do that with fresh eye before we be all too institutionalised and think that some of this stuff be normal however that be also go to take some courage from the new government because make process and procedure less obscure so that more people understand they and make this place more efficient will mean that mp have more power and the government slightly less of it government especially government with new large majority be guess will probably grow rather fond of that power quite quickly so let we get crack alongside modernise this place we should of course reform our politic and our democracy more fundamentally the house of lords should obviously be elect and year old should be able to vote and we must replace the antiquated and deeply unfair first past the post system with fair proportionate voting system look forward to make the case for these change during my time here this election be the fourth time have stand to represent the people of hazel grove as the lib dem candidate and it probably take certain sort of stubbornness resilience and determination to do that it most certainly take the support of my family and especially of my partner ed be so grateful to he our mischievous rescue dog bonnie have not quite make up her mind yet about what she think about work away from home rather more but hope to be able to convince she that win be well than lose as it undoubtedly be win enable we to get stuff do and there be lot to do it be the honour of my life to be elect to represent my phenomenal community the people of hazel grove constituency they will be at the heart of everything do here and hope do they proud call hamish falconer to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker pay tribute to the many maiden

love with country and countryside that still call home today and county and people be now humble to represent in this place shock horror madam deputy speaker think central suffolk and north ipswich be bless with some of the most beautiful countryside in england but it be the history of the area that make it unique the anglo saxon king raedwald be one of the rich and most powerful of his era consequently suffolk have become treasure trove for archaeologist for nearly century my neighbour the hon member for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter can boast of sutton hoo but on my far eastern border just last year year old pre christian temple be discover expert can trace back human activity in the area almost year be fortunate to have the beautiful market town of framlingham in my patch it be home to framlingham castle former seat of the famous howard family and st michael church which contain the tomb of tudor royalty and nobility and which love to take my two child to see

history of produce great artist who be inspire by those surrounding thomas gainsborough john constable benjamin britten and even brian eno and ed sheeran to name few be all product of our wonderful county in some way or another be afraid to say that this child of suffolk be not bless with the same artistic talent the other great contribution that have always feel that suffolk make to our country be in food and drink have be tell by my wife that it be certainly domain in which have more expertise and experience central suffolk and north ipswich be home to aspall cider manufacture for almost year from apple tree in the ground of aspall hall it be now one of the most recognisable brand in the global drink market export product to customer around the world it be great example of global success by home grow british business we be great exporter of not only cider but sausage spud chocolate and condiment it be not uncommon to find suffolk produce in shop across the country it be for that reason that have in the past and will now in this place support initiative like that of my hon friend the member for hinckley and bosworth dr evans that give consumer in this country the opportunity to buy produce from producer in this country the suffolk farming and agricultural community be such an important part of our local society and they be also emblematic of our local culture and identity with their no nonsense attitude to hard work love for family and community complete and utter ambivalence to the weather and deep affection for our natural environment be sure that all member have their bias but be of the firm belief that the people of central suffolk and north ipswich be the fine our country have to offer while hope to be voice primarily for the people of suffolk and ipswich hope to use my time in this place to speak up for another cause in previous life before enter this place work under my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith at the centre for social justice and then as an adviser in the department for education in that time realise that the conservative party and conservativism have proud story to tell on the critical issue of help those who need help on offer the most vulnerable in our society not just handout but leg up and on stand up for what be just and fair in society more than anything they be about give people the opportunity to fulfil their potential count the ward of whitton whitehouse and castle hill as part of my patch whitton and whitehouse be two of the most deprived ward in our country castle hill be probably one of the most unequal by any measure ipswich be like its football team huge success story but large part of it include many family live in whitehouse whitton and castle hill have be leave behind the story be all too familiar the failure to adapt in post industrial economy generation of low wage work if not worklessness the proliferation of crime and high level of immigration that have cause degree of social polarisation for however long the people of central suffolk and north ipswich want to represent they will fight in this place to empower those people who feel left behind those who want to get on in life and those who want to and can reach their potential at time when faith and trust in politic be at an all time low among those who feel lock out of our economy and our society there be no more pressing cause than ensure that britain work for everyone today we be debate the merit of allow mps to have second job time and again on the doorstep during the election and across dining table for many year have hear from people rich and poor young and old left and right that they have lose faith in politician do the right thing believe it or not the nhs immigration job income and access to home be all hugely important to the voter at this general election but the most important thing to the people across my constituency from whitehouse to whitton kesgrave to claydon and ringshall to rendham whether they vote for or not be restore sense of moral probity and public spiritedness to our political system as we embark on this debate and other in this place let we keep that in mind before finish would like to pay tribute to my predecessor dr dan poulter he be as dedicate servant to the people of suffolk and ipswich as ever there be both as an mp and in his second job as consultant doctor he use his invaluable nhs experience when he be junior minister in the department of health and when he be on the draft bill committee review the mental health act for the first time in year we feel the benefit of his healthcare expertise in suffolk when he manage to save hertismere hospital which be previously in my constituency and be now in neighbour waveney valley and when he lobby the government for new accident and emergency wing for ipswich general hospital as many people know dr dan arrive in this house as member of my party and leave as member of another but do not feel any ill will for another political hero of mine winston churchill perform similar journey over year ago do not mind say it here madam deputy speaker too hope one day to cross the floor before give my whip heart attack should add not to swap political allegiance but as part of conservative party elect back into government take our place on the government benches that be whip issue line in the meantime though would like to thank my wife and my two little boy leo and jasper who be sure be watch on bbc parliament right now also thank the doorkeepers and the clerks also want to thank my mother who have be real troup to sit through nearly hour debate she look bright now than she do when put she in polling station as teller as be say look forward to work with member from across the house in the pursuit of deliver for the people of this great nation intend to start the front bench wind up at pm but call stella creasy thank you madam deputy speaker in the very short time available to let say after so many glorious maiden speech that hope that this place can rise to the occasion in term of what we do on this modernisation committee the truth be that we do not have any right as mps yet we come here to defend the right of our constituent that will matter because this should be modern workplace safe not just for we but for our staff and accessible not just for we but for anybody who come to see we and it should not be place that lead we to divorce drink and all the other thing that new members of parliament may have be warn about in one minute let tell the house what think we could do through the committee to redress the situation and give we some right if hon member employ young woman here somebody will take they out for drink to warn they about this place and the people that they should be aware of but that be not good enough we must enforce the finding of the paul kernaghan review and we must ensure that where people face bully and sexual harassment there be no unfairness no favour and no political interference because sadly no political party can hold its head up on that score we must learn from other jurisdiction around the world include new zealand australia and ireland about make this place family friendly that be not just about have workplace crèche but about holiday club and know what time we will leave here and get home no one in this place will enjoy do bedtime via facetime but unless we reform this place to make it family friendly that be the future ahead of all hon member and their family let turn to the gender sensitive parliament review that we sign up to in the kigali accord we must make that happen not just for the woman in this place but for all the woman and man to come there be so many thing that we can do through this modernisation committee which be welcome development but the test will be whether we do they urge all hon member new and old to make sure that happen call the liberal democrat spokesperson let say how impressed be by all the maiden speech that we have hear this afternoon in particular that of the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer who talk about the importance of restore moral probity relevant subject for today debate it be good to hear that he hear that subject raise on many doorstep during the election campaign so do it be good that he refer to his predecessor dan poulter who be an example to many people in this place he use his experience in another job will not say second job to inform debate and make sure that thing say in this house be base on experience and knowledge that can only be find through the personal experience of professional like he as members of parliament we be fortunate to have one of the most satisfying job in the world there should be no such thing as safe seat some kind of sinecure the job of mp ought to be earn through hard work and dedication the public put their trust in each of we to be their champion and their voice the liberal democrats welcome this debate on the code of conduct and in particular the fact that it will examine second job the primary focus of all member must be on serve those people who elect we and put we here in recent year we have see series of scandal that have weaken people trust in politic and politician and welcome the fact that the modernisation committee will seek to restore some of that trust aside from the scandal of the sort refer to by my hon friend the member for north east fife wendy chamberlain there be tiny number of mps who be really quite absent want to illustrate the problem with one of the more egregious example the case of the right hon and learn member for torridge and tavistock sir geoffrey cox who be not in his place but whom notify that plan to refer to he he be former attorney general and very eminent barrister with high profile career outside this place it be reveal that in he have earn more than million in single year include by represent tax haven in the caribbean however he be absent from parliamentary vote because of this outside work and in one case even vote by proxy from mile away between and the right hon and learn member declare more than of external earning for hour of work the equivalent of full day work while have contribute to just four debate in the whole of in the whole of the last parliament he contribute to just debate here in the commons look at hansard that include contribution to just one debate in and one debate in and there be no record of he have contribute to debate in month that be in stark contrast to what we hear about dr dan poulter it be not party political point dan poulter contribute to debate in the last parliament and make some significant contribution with his experience as mental health doctor the hon member for tooting dr allin khan be labour mp and doctor who put in shift in accident and emergency not just to keep up her medical qualification but because that enlighten the house and inform the legislation that we debate here no be take issue with that very very small number of mps who give the rest of we bad name by earn huge sum of money for the hour of work they put in outside of this place in what be frankly their first job not their second they and we must remember that our principal employer be the vote public in those area that we represent be elect as an mp be massive privilege it be role that we should strive to do our very utmost to fulfil we must work night and day to repay the trust that be put in we by voter the modernisation committee should ensure that we be focus first and foremost on our job here call the shadow leader of the house congratulation on your election madam deputy speaker congratulate one of your colleague at the beginning so let add my congratulation to you on your election to the chair let start by say huge congratulation and well do to the member on both side make some very impressive maiden speech today the hon member for ipswich jack abbott be struggle to see he in the chamber list all the premier league ground he intend to visit now that his team be in the premier league he do not mention selhurst park the home of crystal palace in the borough represent in parliament an accidental omission be sure my hon friend the member for spelthorne lincoln jopp make an excellent maiden speech wish he good luck with the upcoming house move he very wisely observed that he do not plan to place any political bet anytime soon the hon member for telford shaun davies give an excellent speech he clearly bring to the house experience as former chair of the local government association there be certainly no need for he to experience any impost syndrome we hear from the hon member for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray who speak extremely eloquently about his constituency and the edinburgh festival we hear from my hon friend the member for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson about his support for the modernisation of parliament and his commitment to public service here we hear from the hon member for cardiff west mr barros curtis who make an excellent and very eloquent speech the hon member for wolverhampton north east sureena brackenridge will clearly bring to bear her experience as former deputy headteacher the hon member for poole neil duncan jordan have possibly one of the narrow majority in parliament which he will no doubt be valiantly defend we also hear from the hon member for glasgow south gordon mckee the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart pay fulsome tribute to the work of her predecessor andrew stunell the hon member for lincoln hamish falconer have already assume ministerial office in fact can see his red ministerial folder on his knee meteoric ascent my hon friend the member for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer be apparently go to be the new ed sheeran of parliament that be what take from his speech anyway and his mum be with we today do speak to labour member whose mum be also here during her maiden speech few day ago apparently her mum fall asleep during the precede speech you can take that how you will laughter have congratulate new member on their really brilliant maiden speech let turn back to the substance before we my hon friend the member for south leicestershire alberto costa speak eloquently about the importance of ensure that we take on board the long expertise of the exist house committees in particular the standards committee which the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain also refer to at the beginning from the liberal democrat front bench the standards committee be elect by the house not appoint by whip as the new committee will be and have seven lie member who bring in external experience include as say early retired chief constable and other who bring genuine independence and expertise it be vital that we continue to draw on the independence and experience of the standards committee these be complicated issue we hear from the hon member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord wind up for the liberal democrats just moment ago how experience of practise medicine can help to enrich debate and inform the proceeding of the house as dan poulter do when he be both member of parliament and practise doctor such consideration need to be carefully consider be very much hop might even go so far as to say the leader of the house will give the house some assurance in her wind up speech in particular seek assurance that the procedure committee the committee on standards the committee of privileges and the administration committee will always be invite to report to the modernisation committee on matter that it be due to consider that the speaker will always be consult that the work of the modernisation committee will not cut across what the house of commons commission do and that the parliamentary commissioner for standards will be invite to make submission and give evidence where appropriate or necessary if the leader of the house can give strong enough such assurance about how the committee will function as well as an assurance that she will chair it on the basis of cross party consensus be prepared not to move my amendment therefore wait with trembling and eager anticipation to hear what she say be sure speak for we all when say that it be critical that we maintain standard at the very high level here to ensure that the public our constituent can have confidence in the work we do call the leader of the house may congratulate you on your election madam deputy speaker and on have already make good use of the parliamentary hairdresser hope that you will maintain that tradition thank so many member of this house for take part in this debate we have hear some excellent maiden speech my hon friend the members for ipswich jack abbott for telford shaun davies for edinburgh east and musselburgh chris murray for cardiff west mr barros curtis for glasgow south gordon mckee for lincoln hamish falconer for wolverhampton north east sureena brackenridge and for poole neil duncan jordan and the hon member for spelthorne lincoln jopp for mid bedfordshire blake stephenson for hazel grove lisa smart and for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer all make excellent contribution there be always competition about who represent the very good constituency but of course we all know that it be actually trust and dedication to constituency constituent and public service have be common theme today substantive point have also be raise about the modernisation agenda for which be really grateful the shadow leader of the house the right hon member for croydon south chris philp raise several issue welcome his engagement which have seek over recent day discuss our proposal with he well in advance of table they the size of the modernisation committee which be the subject of opposition amendment have be part of the conversation about representation across the house the current proposal be to have member under the current algorithm which be base on the make up of the house that will give nine place to the government three to the official opposition and two to the third party expand the committee to member would give place to the government party and three to the third party but the official opposition would still have three look at all the number and feel that have member would give the fairest distribution among government and opposition party go big still would not bring the small party into the mix which be why have make very firm commitment to have ongoing dialogue and meaningful engagement with they if the number include chairs of other committees the shadow leader of the house might actually lose his place on the committee because the other committee chairs would take up the official opposition place so ask he to think about the numbering the shadow leader of the house ask about the modernisation committee relationship to other committees it be essential to be clear about this have be very clear that it will be strategic overarch committee it will not seek to duplicate any of the work of other committees which would be waste of everybody time instead it will work closely with those committees commission their work seek their view ask for their report and their input and carefully consider their recommendation on all matter see this as sort of clearing house task and finish group that can more quickly bring recommendation from some of those committees to the floor of the house and take strategic overview of how the different issue interrelate the standards committee itself recommend that in its most recent report in which it describe the siloe and disjoint context in which we operate the right hon lady comment be extremely welcome but for absolute clarity can she confirm that when the new modernisation committee intend to consider matter it will first invite the relevant other committee of the house to prepare report and come back to the modernisation committee with it on the whole yes that be the intention and the hope some of those committees do not yet have chairs but that be certainly the modus operandi for which we be hop we do not expect to be do that work ourselves or duplicate it the standards committee which be raise early have completely distinct and different role because of the relationship with the lay member and with the standards commissioner as have say to the leader of the house privately be sorry mean the shadow leader of the house laughter be still get use to this gig as have say to the shadow leader seek the advice of the standards commissioner when consider how we would tighten the rule on pay advocacy and have follow his advice to the letter because think this be critical the standards commissioner would not want to sit on the committee because it would conflict with his role but see his role as be central to the drawing up of any further advice because he have to police it that be his job hope that satisfy the shadow leader of the house the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain and have work closely together and greatly value her input on these issue think that we largely agree on most of they we do need to take forward the recommendation on the independent complaints and grievance scheme review and that would be first task for the committee my hon friend the member for blyth and ashington ian lavery make an erudite speech as usual about trust and clean up politic and thank he for his contribution that be very much what we be seek to do the hon member for south leicestershire alberto costa have do invaluable work on this matter in the past in his role as member of the standards committee as have say be very conscious of the work that the lay member do and the need for that to play separate role in this context but as the hon gentleman will know the landscape review point clearly to the need for more strategic join up approach to some of these issue the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns as newbie present some welcome idea she reflect the enthusiasm of many other newbie and think the frustration of many of they as well listen to the speech of the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman from outside the chamber really do value her contribution to this debate and look forward to work with she would love to have she on the committee but be hopeful that we can find way for that ongoing relationship to be meaningful and regular and that she will be able to contribute some of the idea that she mention today in more formal manner my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy in very short space of time give some very good advice about the implication for safety and human resource on the estate and she be right to do so we do not hear many comment on second job but think we all agree that we need to take action in that regard and be glad to see the extent of the cross party support for such action hope we will not divide the house on these issue because think it important for we to stand together today we have see plenty of enthusiasm and support and hope that members will now support the motion question put and agree to resolve that with effect from october paragraph of chapter of the guide to the rules relate to the conduct of member be amend to leave out advice on public policy and current affair advice in general term about how parliament work and we now come to motion relate to modernisation committee remind

that this house do now kitchen may add my voice to the concatenation across this house welcome you to your new role madam deputy speaker also welcome my hon friend the member for coventry east mary creagh back to this house be delighted to see she at the dispatch box as the minister for nature she be most distinguished chair of the environmental audit committee and look forward to support she and our government in champion nature in this critical decade for the natural world thank she for join just day and half into her new post the meeting of the international conservation caucus which chair in parliament on tuesday her enthusiasm for her brief and for all that we hope this government will deliver for the environment be an inspiration to the dozen of mp and campaigner who crowd into what be be afraid much too small room on very hot evening nature be the source of life it be the foundation of everything we have and everything we value yet some economist talk as if the natural world be subset of the economic one something to be account for separately in fact the opposite be true the economist world be subset of the natural world when do we last receive an invoice for pollination service from bee when do the forest last invoice we for its flood protection however decline in our forest cover can affect everything from our food security to the destruction of our home decline in insect population can affect the yield of our crop we use nature because it be valuable we abuse nature because it be free because classical economic treat the service that nature provide as externality it fail to properly represent either the non market benefit of ecosystem or the environmental cost of growth more than decade ago give speech at the berlin summit on natural capital say then that the time when the earth could support human community without difficulty be come to an end the truth be that it have end we live in an age of planetary boundary and tipping point natural capital have be erode to such an extent that the complex mechanism of ecosystem service that nature provide have be compromise and we now need to repair and restore the earth ability to support we in simple term that be what the convention on biological diversity have seek to do since it open for signature at the earth summit in rio in it have be ratify by every member state of the united nations with the appalling exception of the united states of america its aim be the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefit arise from the use of genetic resource it have two supplementary agreement the cartagena protocol adopt in which seek to protect biological diversity from the potential risk pose by live modify organism create by modern biotechnological practice and the nagoya protocol which aim to share the benefit arise from the utilisation of genetic resource in fair and equitable way if the cbd be establish year ago why on earth be our biodiversity in the state that it be the most comprehensive report ever compile on biodiversity and ecosystem service by the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services tell the united nations nature be decline globally at rate unprecedented in human history and the rate of species extinction be accelerate and that the impact for people around the world be grave we have not make the progress that we need to the cbd set important goal and target to halt this frightening state of decline pay tribute to the canadian government who at short notice host and establish the global biodiversity framework it set in place four goal to halt human induce species extinction to use biodiversity sustainably to share its benefit equitably and to implement the finance of billion year necessary to achieve the first three goal it also agree vital target include the by target to conserve and protect of the planet land sea and inland waterway by and the reduction of perverse subsidy by billion year talk be cheap target be easy to set but difficult to implement and even more difficult to police and enforce that be why every country need plan specifically national biodiversity strategy and action plan or nbsap revise nbsaps must be submit in advance of in colombia this year the uk government originally commit to publish the nbsap in march and then may but be glad that they do not because the change of government should have afford official in the department time to radically revise the draft it be intend by conservative ministers to be merely restatement of what the uk be already do not the urgent and transformative action plan that be require to deliver on the four goal of the gbf thank the hon member for secure this crucial debate and agree with the analysis that he have set out on his point about the need to move beyond the previous government commitment this week environmental group publish new economic analysis that show that almost billion of investment be need every year in nature friendly farming to meet legally bind nature and climate target do he agree that it be vital for ministers to urgently confirm that the budget for nature friendly farming will be not only maintain but increase in this parliament be delighted to have give way to the hon gentleman who make fair and important point the way that we be incentivise farmer and land manager and the financial resource that we put behind that through the environmental land management scheme and other be vital the previous government put number of objective in place for the environment always commend their work on natural capital the environment act and the office for environmental protection the minister will know however that although the objective be commendable the implementation be often lack indeed the office for environmental protection late assessment of individual environmental target which be set under the act be that we be on track to achieve just four we be partially on track to achieve we be off track for achieve and other lack sufficient evidence to make an assessment let outline some of what hope to see in our revised nbsap when it be publish although our commitment to be to protect of our land sea and inland waterway by only of our land be effectively protect for nature at sea only of the network have effective management measure in place all four uk administrations need to act on the recommendation of the late special protection area review to protect threaten bird specie at sea special protection area sufficiency review be require to ensure that the current gap in our marine protect area network be fill the previous government do well to set legally bind target to increase species abundance and decrease extinction risk however all the devolve administration need to do so too most important those target must be match by cost delivery plan which should be publish to support the uk nbsap nature positive net zero future can be deliver only if action for nature and climate be hardwire into decision making all public body must have legal duty to help recover the natural environment we must ensure that government and industry take strategic approach to plan for new energy infrastructure which put nature at its heart and introduce mandatory reporting against the taskforce on nature relate financial disclosure align with global nature preservation and restoration target in the new government first spend review would like new uk nature fund to corral private sector funding to address the finance gap for nature the government should also commit to press forward with the forest risk commodity regulation and the renewal of important species recovery programme such as darwin plus and the species survival fund the uk be highly unusual in the united nations in that of all the biodiversity for which it bear international responsibility lie not within the uk itself but in its overseas territory and crown dependency those region incredibly rich in biodiversity though they may be do not have the financial resource to effectively conserve their own biodiversity yet only of the money that the uk spend on biodiversity actually go to they that be of spend for of the biodiversity for which we be the international guardian that can not go on and must be address in our nbsap and the long await publication of the uk overseas territory biodiversity strategy it be crucial that the nbsap be publish before the deadline and ideally before of the august deadline which come up next week for inclusion in the documentation that be important to show that the uk be take its commitment to implementation of the global biodiversity framework seriously the plan must not be ceiling on ambition and it should be open to revision always in an upward direction ask my hon friend the minister what step the uk be take to ensure that our nbsap be submit by the early deadline of august and be robust and ambitious contribution to the delivery of the global target the nagoya protocol and access and benefit sharing be now encompass in the convention by the work on digital sequence information on genetic resource the truth be that the pace of discussion be unacceptable we be now decade on from nagoya and there be almost no agreement there be agreement only that fund should be set up to share tiny fraction of the benefit make by sector such as pharmaceutical and food production the fact that the co chair can find agreement among the party only to such fund contribute to target be joke target talk of billion year by be mobilise to support biodiversity conservation that be in six year time yet at this year on from nagoya we can not agree whether the trigger for payment of such money should be at the point of access of the genetic datum the point of use or the point of commercialisation there be no agreement as to how the scale of contribution to the fund could be determine whether they should be or or whether the levy should apply to profit turnover or revenue it be an absolute mess hope that the minister will make progress on digital sequence information signature of the uk work at this october but more than that hope she will speak with our chancellor and our secretary of state for business and trade to arrange for high level summit to haul in the chief executive of big pharma who be drag their foot on this issue and encourage their sponsor government to do the same we have four year in which to deliver this target it require whole of government commitment to ensure that we succeed the issue link to one of the specific feature of in cali where know the colombian government wish to make great progress framework target aim at ensure the full equitable and inclusive representation and participation of indigenous people and local community in decision make process that be relate to biodiversity and it aim to foster inclusive participatory and right base approach to conservation be extremely grateful to the colombian ambassador who join we on tuesday evening and speak movingly about the need to ensure that those people who have for eon be the guardian of so much of the planet biological diversity should not find that their traditional knowledge be commercialise for other gain as they be leave impoverished their territory polluted and their way of life steal from they hope the minister will make space in her diary at the cop to meet the leader of those community in cali that bring to the question of who in government will be attend know the prime minister and other senior ministers have be invite what an amazing signal it would send to the rest of the world that the uk be back seriously engage on the international stage with the most critical threat face our planet if the prime minister be to lead our uk delegation and if not only the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs be to attend but the foreign secretary the cbd have sometimes be see as the cinderella cop to the climate change convention in truth they be twin crisis in which each turbocharge the other the loss of biodiversity will deplete all of the provision resource and ecosystem service on which human life depend this be not just an environmental problem but an economic and security problem have another reason for wish that the prime minister would go to cali hope he will announce that the uk be willing to host the next cbd cop in london in the fourth goal that be set in montreal at be the goal of finance and resource mobilisation where well to make progress on the financial framework for deliver our and target than the city of london the world financial centre government can not do everything on their own the role of the private sector in mobilise the resource of business and industry be vital refer the minister to the financing nature report produce by henk paulson the former us treasury secretary he talk of the clear and compelling economic case for finance nature conservation although it be important that business recognise the value of ecosystem service it must appreciate that it be far cheap to prevent environmental damage than to repair it afterwards that be why it be important that the government make it mandatory for company to report against the taskforce on nature relate financial disclosures london be the centre of the green bond market it be the right place and this be the right government to mobilise the financial flow on which the sustainability of our planet depend will take place mid way through the implementation of the kunming montreal global biodiversity framework possibly the most important moment for take stock of progress towards and chance to work in partnership with all country that be party to the cbd to ensure that we be move at the necessary speed and scale to meet our goal the government be proudly elect on promise to ratify the global
