oral answers to questions scotland the secretary of state be ask spring budget what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the spring budget on scotland what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the spring budget on scotland what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the spring budget on scotland we have again see calamitous event in scotland this week however wish humza yousaf very well for the future always find he to be very decent man to work with and there be no doubt that he be deal rotten hand although do not want to dwell unduly on the private grief of snp members very much hope that whoever become first minister will work with we on the issue that really matter to people in scotland such as public service and our economy and will not continue to obsess with independence this government be take long term decision to cut taxis for work people and to grow the economy the spring budget represent significant milestone in the uk government levelling up mission with investment into scotland burst through the billion mark in addition the scottish government will benefit from million funding uplift through the barnett formula for the reality be that the chancellor regressive spring budget leave the people of scotland behind in contrast the snp scottish government take the bold step of implement progressive tax scheme the westminster establishment argue that scotland income tax rate would somehow cause people to leave the country last week however it be reveal by his majesty revenue and customs that the opposite be true with many more taxpayer move to scotland than leave will the secretary of state join in welcome this brilliant news and congratulate the scottish government on stand up for the people of scotland the hon lady point would be relevant if that report be not from long before we enter into six tax band in scotland versus three in the rest of the uk absolutely do not agree with she the secretary of state mention levelling up which be curious we know that the budget cut public service across the board and cut scotland capital funding yet level up seem to benefit place such as the financial district of canary wharf which have benefit by per head be he suggest that scotland but not other part of the uk should accept austerity from this government that be ridiculous remark the levelling up agenda in scotland have be fantastically successful and there have be absolutely no austerity the scottish government have receive record block grant of billion the high since devolution begin be surprised that the snp want to talk about the budget because the scottish government budget put taxis up and cut vital public service so scot be actually pay more and get less what utter nonsense the hypocrisy of this tory party which be busy gaslighte the scottish public by complain about cut to capital spending while the tory government be busy cut or million from the scottish government capital block grant allocation be quite astonishing with westminster hold scotland back yet again can the secretary of state tell we as scotland man in the cabinet whether he argue against these cut will he argue for the scottish parliament to have the ability to raise more capital borrowing to mitigate these savage westminster cut and to help drive scotland forward in the fiscal framework settlement we make it very clear and agree with the scottish government that resource funding could be reallocate if they so wish from the record block grant into capital funding that be what have happen additionally they have the ability to borrow million if require also begin by pass on my good wish to humza yousaf and his family always find he very personable in my dealing with he although disagree with virtually everything he have say or do as first minister of scotland particularly put up taxis and deliver poor public service be my right hon friend aware that business in my constituency be struggle to recruit employee from other part of the united kingdom because of the high tax rate in scotland which be damage our local economy my right hon friend make good point be well aware as be business in dumfries and galloway that have six tax band in scotland but three in the rest of the uk be not the way to incentivise people to go to work in scotland or even to relocate their business there call the shadow secretary of state on this international workers day may day scottish television journalist be strike for fair pay be sure the secretary of state will join in insist that stv get back around the table with its journalist to thrash out an acceptable deal give all the news that be happen this week we need they back on the television too pay tribute to the outgoing first minister humza yousaf we may not have agree on everything but his historic appointment mark pivotal moment in our multicultural public life in scotland and wish he and his family well for the future the spring budget be just another moment that expose the damage do by the chaos of the former prime minister kamikaze budget the secretary of state have be spin that it bring taxis down but be it not the case that the tax burden in scotland and across the rest of the uk continue to rise the prime minister now want to mirror his irresponsible predecessor with an unfunded billion policy to get rid of national insurance altogether the secretary of state sit around the cabinet table so which one of these have they discuss to pay for this pensioner the nhs or income tax rise agree with the hon gentleman that the tax burden in scotland be too high and rise and people be pay more and get less fortunately the uk government have take the decision to partially offset that not through income tax cut but through national insurance cut with come off ni to pick up on his last point he be refer to an aspiration that this government have we have already reduce ni by third and we aspire to remove it altogether because it be tax on job this be billion unfunded aspiration and the secretary of state and the government will not tell we where they will get the money from scotland be trap between two chaotic and fail government we have have three prime ministers and we will have have three first ministers in as many year all the while the right hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn think he be already the first minister and call the shot although he have be shoot himself firmly in the foot what be abundantly clear to the people of scotland be that neither the scottish government nor the uk government be even interested in deliver the change that scotland need with neither government want to let the people decide will the secretary of state tell the house who he think be most scared of general election the tories or the scottish national party we absolutely do not fear an election whether for holyrood or general election as watch the nationalists implode again say bring it on hear they say the same from sedentary position interruption bring it on chap and chapesse over there start polish up your cv call the snp spokesperson too on behalf of the snp group put on record our sincere thank to humza yousaf for his public service over the month and year wish he nadia and the rest of his family all the good in their future let also observe that few people in scotland will see our proceeding today as scottish television be currently black out because of strike by tv journalist implore the management of stv to get back around the table with the national union of journalists improve its pay offer and try to settle this dispute the budget that be approve few month ago also contain forward planning assumption on income and expenditure over the next three to five year what assessment have the secretary of state make of those assumption on the scottish public finance as have say before we have record block grant it be run over three year period and it average out at billion and then there be barnett consequential add to that this year that figure be million base on the spring budget figure that sound like no assessment at all have be make the truth be that accord to the institute for fiscal studies these forward planning assumption involve public service cut of up to billion that can only imply savage cut to the scottish block grant in the next two to three year sadly these planning assumption and the framework be endorse by the labour party so if people vote either conservative or labour at the come election be they not consent to massive cut in public service in scotland of course do not agree with those figure public service in scotland be in desperate state in their recent budget the scottish government freeze council tax thereby put more pressure on local authority to deliver those public service defence spending what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for defence on the level of defence spending in scotland what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for defence on the level of defence spending in scotland scotland office ministers have regular discussion with the ministry of defence on all matter relate to defence defence spending contribute significantly to deliver thousand of high skilled job and investment in scotland welcome the announcement by the prime minister that we will increase our defence spending to of gdp in response to rise global threat clearly it be good news for the united kingdom and scotland in particular that of gdp will be spend on defence will my right hon friend update the house on the number of job that will be protect and potentially be create in scotland as result of this decision the short answer be that the increase investment announce by the prime minister will be focus on fire up the uk industrial base the whole united kingdom will benefit from that and it will ensure that our armed benefit from the late technology both of those thing will bring economic benefit and support job across the whole of the united kingdom include scotland at this time of heighten global tension and an illegal war in ukraine spark by the russians be confident that scotland will play grow role as the uk government ramp up their spending thank to the armed force parliamentary scheme have be lucky enough to meet some of the amazing military personnel and civilian work at his majesty naval base clyde will my right hon friend confirm that the increase in defence spending announce last week by the prime minister will bring benefit across the whole country whether at raf basis in my own constituency or at the many military establishment in scotland and that it be another clear demonstration that it be the conservatives who can be trust to defend and protect our entire united kingdom my hon friend be absolutely correct it be the conservatives who be trust to defend the whole of the united kingdom the snp have consistently propose abandon our nuclear deterrent include in its most recent independence paper the irony be that the snp want to be part of the nato alliance but not part of nuclear nato alliance vital part of defence spending be ensure that military personnel live in safe and suitable accommodation at last week debate on the renters reform bill my hon friend the member for north shropshire helen morgan ensure concession from the government on the standard of military accommodation what assessment have the secretary of state make of that in scotland the hon lady be absolutely right as the father of serve soldier completely agree with she hear from member of the military that they be disappoint with the standard of accommodation have raise the issue on uk wide basis and discuss it with the defence secretary he say the programme of improvement which start before last winter amount to million of spending far to the secretary of state comment about nuclear basis hope he be aware of the alarming rise in more serious nuclear safety incident at scotland trident nuclear basis on the clyde my question have reveal incident be log in and include six with risk of radiation leakage to the environment the first category incident in year have he concern if there be radioactive leak beyond safe level in many of these incident what report will his government produce to reassure crew and those live nearby that the nuclear infrastructure be not as one former downing street adviser describe it dangerously rot have visit faslane our base on the clyde it be an absolutely fantastic facility we do not comment on matter relate to faslane if the hon lady have any more specific question she should ask they at defence question but regard our nuclear deterrent and our nuclear facility we do not comment on thing that happen there youth mobility european commission scheme what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the european commission proposal for youth mobility scheme on young people in scotland what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the european commission proposal for youth mobility scheme on young people in scotland what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the potential impact of the european commission proposal for youth mobility scheme on young people in scotland be in touch with home office ministers regularly to discuss immigration matter that affect scotland this government have youth mobility scheme agree with country and we remain open to new arrangement with our international partner include individual eu member state have to say that be bemuse by that answer will never shake in my view that brexit be an act of gross harm against the next generation particularly in scotland where we reject it but we be where we be and the eu have offer the uk comprehensive youth mobility scheme up to the age of for four year that strike as fantastic deal scotland want to do it so why be the minister so keen to hold scotland back but my actual question be be he as delighted as think he must be that the labour party completely agree with he the hon member and the snp continue to obsess about brexit and the decision of the united kingdom to leave the european union this government be absolutely committed to offer young people opportunity to travel around the world during their education as demonstrate through our association with the horizon scheme and through the government ture scheme the youth mobility scheme would allow young people in my constituency of glasgow north east and across scotland to participate in youth exchange work study and travel across europe the minister get to do that be his message to my constituent that this freedom be for the like of he but not for the like of they the uk government currently operate successful bilateral youth mobility scheme with international party the country with which we already have arrangement include andorra australia canada hong kong iceland india japan monaco new zealand san marino south korea taiwan and uruguay interruption snp members may scoff at these country but these country be offer unique opportunity for scot to travel internationally and to learn as many of we do as well anyone in scotland watch this will be incredibly disappointed with the response that we have have from the minister to date in march the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie say on bbc scotland that young people be not reap the benefit of brexit do not often agree with my constituency neighbour in the south but he be absolutely right then and he be still absolutely right now be he not the big obstacle to opportunity for young people in scotland be the snp government by restrict the number of place for scottish student at scottish university so heavily the scottish government seem intent on drive young people out of our country have be involve in run number of our youth mobility scheme be fairly familiar with the concept that they involve such as capped number reciprocity the idea that we do not have large flow one way without it happen the other way limited term no access to the welfare system and the fact that people can not take dependant with they give their temporary status will the minister assure that we will maintain the position that we have under the former prime minister boris johnson that we will do this where it be in the uk economic interest and where we know that the main driver of issue such as immigration abuse do not exist that be why we have the scheme that we do with australia canada and new zealand and why we should maintain that open approach pay tribute to my hon friend for his work in this area and his continued interest in it the government have make it absolutely clear that we have no plan to agree an eu wide youth mobility scheme for the reason that he have highlight but we be open to negotiate with individual member state individual arrangement that suit the united kingdom and scotland cost of live what recent discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on the cost of live in scotland this government have demonstrate their commitment to support household across the united kingdom and in scotland with the cost of living with billion package of support one of the large in europe inflation be now at which be less than half its recent peak and be expect to fall to its target one year early than expect accord to the scottish parliament own research as well as the fraser of allander institute the scottish government child poverty target for be not set to be meet give the dereliction of their net zero target and the widen attainment gap do the minister agree that the scottish government have give up on govern and give up on the future of scottish child agree with the hon member the snp give up govern in scotland long time ago thank to its continue obsession with independence and referendum the uk government remain committed to support household across scotland demonstrate through our increase in work age benefit our maintain the triple lock for million pensioner and our cut to national insurance call the shadow minister wish humza yousaf well for the future but after his year in office nobody in scotland be well off and that be couple with our have prime minister who be cling on to power child poverty be up life expectancy be fall nhs waiting list be up drug death be up homelessness be up economic growth have flatline be it not the inescapable truth that scot have be fail by two government for far too long do the minister agree that what scotland need now be to be rid of both these distract incompetent and hopelessly out of touch government certainly agree that the snp government have not be focus on the day job they have be neglect scotland school nhs and transport network they have not be get on with the day job but the harsh reality be that whoever be elect to replace humza yousaf as first minister will still have the same obsession with independence and referendum uk internal market what recent assessment he have make of the impact of the uk internal market on the scottish economy the government assessment be that our internal market be the essential basis on which business be able to trade freely across the united kingdom minimise red tape and maximise opportunity in scotland of outgoing trade be with the rest of the united kingdom more than with the rest of the world combine the internal market be beneficial for all part of the united kingdom it be however more important to those area where there be border do the minister therefore agree that the internal market should be very helpful in maintain and develop economic activity in the borderland area and will he consider second borderland growth deal which would certainly help the area on both side of the border my hon friend be absolutely right the uk internal market be essential to promote economic activity ensure that business in the border in my constituency in carlisle and beyond benefit from frictionless trade with the rest of the united kingdom the borderland growth deal which include million investment from the uk government be sign in july and be develop range of project to far boost economic growth when the bbc have the headline on its webpage why have ireland get so much surplus cash be it not clear that the reality be that independent ireland be more successful in the european and world market than scotland trap in the uk ireland have surplus of billion to spend on its society the uk have deficit and cut which be hurt people will the minister remind we of the size of the uk deficit be very clear that scotland be well serve by be at the heart of strong united kingdom the spending figure of the scottish government be very clear in term of their dependency on scotland be part of the uk to support vital public service like the nhs school and the transport network call stewart malcolm mcdonald not here river and streams biodiversity what discussion he have have with the scottish government on the biodiversity of scotland river and stream water quality policy be devolve in scotland the scottish government be responsible for biodiversity in river and stream in scotland not the united kingdom government it be for the scottish government to take action in this vital area be it not the truth that scottish water stream and river be pure and clean because the scottish people reject the privatisation of water and lead by scottish labour make sure that we have scottish water in the public realm and deliver clean water for everyone the hon member be absolutely wrong accord to recent report untreated sewage have be release into scottish water and sea more than time over the past five year but only of sewage overflow in scotland be require to be monitor unlike in england and wales where nearly be monitor thank to the effort of this government unlike this government the scottish government and scottish water be fail to take tough action to monitor sewage overflow and protect our very important waterway protection of free speech what recent discussion he have have with the scottish government on the protection of free speech in scotland this government be commit to protect free speech it be the responsibility of the scottish government and scottish parliament work with police scotland to ensure that the hate crime legislation be implement and enforce in way that protect freedom of speech and have the confidence of people in scotland the scottish government hate crime and public order scotland act come into force this month and be already have chilling impact on free speech what lesson can the uk government learn from the introduction of this poor legislation in scotland yes and police scotland already have stretch resource not least because it have be check up on the snp finance for the last three year my hon friend be absolutely right and we do have concern that the legislation could have potential chilling effect on free speech but it be for the scottish government to speak to their own devolve law for my part believe it be an awful piece of legislation it lack clarity on what constitute an offence and importantly my right hon friend the prime minister have make it very clear that the uk government will not enact similar legislation call the chair of the select committee never before have such rubbish be utter about piece of legislation as have be utter about the hate crime act in one week the tories have try to repeal it which give that it mainly consolidate exist legislation will leave we unprotected against islamophobia racism and homophobia will the secretary of state now issue one of his famous colonial decree and tell the scottish tories to back off first of all those law already exist that be the important thing secondly be right about police resource there be hate crime report in the first week more than in any of the seven precede year it be ridiculous unnecessary piece of legislation prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday may know the thought of the whole house be with the people of hainault in east london follow yesterday appal attack such violence have no place on our street it be absolutely heartbreaking that teenage boy have die and can not imagine what his family be go through we send they our heartfelt condolence and offer our very good wish to all those injure reiterate my thank to the police and other emergency first responder for embody the high standard of public service under such awful circumstance know our thought be also with those injure this morning in an attack at school in sheffield this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house shall have further such meeting later today we know that more than one in five teenager be vape with some expert describe it as an epidemic yesterday new research suggest that teenager who vape could be at risk of exposure to toxic metal potentially harm brain or organ development agree with the prime minister in his wish to reduce the harm cause by smoking and vape through the tobacco and vapes bill do he agree that permit football strip to be sponsor by vape company send entirely the wrong message to young people and that it be time to ban vape company from advertising on sport strip thank the hon lady for her question obviously decision about kit sponsorship will rest with individual team but agree with she that it be important that we do everything we can to tackle the scourge of teenage vaping that be why be glad that she support our bill which will not only clamp down on marketing and availability of flavour target point of sale purchase but improve fund for trading standard to clamp down on those selling vape illegally to child my husband be veteran and the defence of the country be the government first duty in order to protect people across the united kingdom can the prime minister reassure the house that he have plan in place for back our world lead armed service and do he know why the opposition refuse to back his plan start by pay tribute to my hon friend husband and all our veteran for their service to our country in the most uncertain time since the cold war it be right that we build our security protect our value our interest and indeed our nation that be why this government have take the step to increase defence spending to of gdp make we the big spender in europe under nato when the labour leader stand up hope he stop dither do the right thing and confirm that he will back our plan to increase defence spending call the leader of the opposition join the prime minister in his word about yesterday awful event in hainault be sure that the whole house will want to commend the first responder and send our deep condolence to the family of the year old boy who be murder join the prime minister in his remark about the attack in the school in sheffield as well know that everyone in the house will be delighted to see his majesty the king return to his public duty and look so well we all wish he and the princess of wales the good in their continue recovery welcome my hon friend the member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter to his place on the labour benches after nearly two decade as tory politician and an nhs doctor he have conclude that if you care about the future of our country and our nhs it be time for change it be time for this change labour party as of today he be our new labour mp but be sure he will not mind my saying that hope he lose that title on friday when lifelong tory and doctor say that the only cure for the nhs be labour government be it not time that the prime minister admit that he have utterly fail be glad to actually see the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter in the house because he recently point out that resident under his local labour council be charge much more in council tax but in return receive low quality service he have be wrong about some thing recently but on that point he be absolutely right and this week people everywhere should vote conservative the prime minister come out with all that nonsense but he lock himself away in his downing street bunker moan that people be not grateful enough to he the reality be that tory mp be follow tory voter in conclude that only the labour party can deliver the change that the country need say to those tory voter that if they believe in well britain they be safe with this change labour party and it be for they in the two week since we last meet at the dispatch box have the prime minister manage to find the money for his completely unfunded billion promise to scrap national insurance we address that few week ago and be happy to address it again know that economics be not the right hon and learn gentleman strong point but he would do well to listen to his shadow education secretary the hon member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson who just this morning say no that not how it work indeed the institute for fiscal studies have also say that the link between national insurance and public service funding be like labour economic plan however it be crystal clear that there be one party that will deliver tax cut for work britain and it be the conservative party interruption order whoever be bang the furniture will have to pay for it if they damage it can we have less of that we be not in the sixth form now that be long ramble non answer to the question which be have the prime minister find the money to fund his billion promise to abolish national insurance whenever he be ask about the date of the election or about people pension he act as if answer straightforward question be somehow beneath he but pensioner and those who be plan their retirement deserve well than his contempt for their question if billion be cut from its funding the value of the state pension would almost halve so do not apologise for ask he order mr gullis you have the next question which you be not go to reach at this rate and you have the ten minute rule bill would be quiet for while if be you do not apologise for ask on pensioner behalf again whether the prime minister will finally rule out cut their state pension to fulfil the enormous black hole in his spending plan of course we can rule that out the right hon and learn gentleman should stop scaremongere because it be thank to the triple lock that we have increase pension by since and they will rise in each and every year of the next parliament it be labour who always hit pensioner hard it be his mentor blair and brown who break their promise raise pension taxis by billion and deliver an insulting rise in the state pension as one former labour adviser just say brown destroy our pension system they do it before they will do it again labour always betray our pensioner it be clear that the prime minister can not answer the question of where he be go to find this billion interruption no he have say where it be not come from he have not say where it be come from luckily for he one of his peer lord frost yes he again do know he say that to solve the problem of the tories spending plan the state pension age should be raise to understandably that will cause some alarm so will the prime minister rule out force people to delay their retirement by year and year in order to fulfil his billion black hole have answer this multiple time for the right hon and learn gentleman but be happy to say it again the conservative party be the party that have deliver and protect the triple lock ultimately he be not worried about any of this because as we all remember he have his very own personal pension plan indeed it come with its very own special law it be call the pensions increase pension scheme for keir starmer qc regulations it be literally one law for he and another one for everyone else the prime minister want to abolish national insurance which will cost billion and he will not tell we where the money be come from we be no close to an answer be go to persevere last year the prime minister be apparently draw up plan to remove the winter fuel allowance from pensioner his paymaster general go step far say these be the sort of thing think we need to look at will the prime minister now rule out taking pensioner winter fuel payment off they to help fund his billion black hole it be this government who just this winter provide double the winter fuel payment to support pensioner what be crystal clear be that we believe that the double taxation on work be unfair we believe that hard work should be reward which be why this week we be cut taxis by for everyone in work in contrast it be labour new tax adviser who think that pensioner should be tax more those be his word this adviser call they codger he think that support they be disgrace and he believe that their free tv licence be ridiculous it be labour who hit pensioner with tax after tax and they would do it all over again be it any wonder that the prime minister mp be follow tory voter in queue up to dump his party even the mayors who he be apparently pin his political survival on do not want to be see anywhere near he because until he start set out how he be pay for his fantasy economic he have completely unfunded billion promise that put people retirement at risk how do it feel to be one day out from election with the message vote tory risk your pension tomorrow voter will have choice it will be choice between mayors like andy street and ben houchen who be deliver or mayors like sadiq khan who simply virtue signal it be high taxis more crime and the ultra low emission zone with labour or low taxis and well service with the conservatives that be the choice from the west midlands to teesside to london there be only one choice vote conservative we can see the rwanda deterrent be work and we have now deport our first illegal migrant but unsurprisingly labour just do not care the shadow home secretary be busy pose for pic encourage more boat to come over the leader of the labour party have say he would cancel the rwanda flight he take the knee when sign letter stop we deport foreign national offender who have commit crime such as murder and rape and he would do deal with the eu surrender our border to legal migrant be it not right that only the conservatives will stop the boat and cut legal migration my hon friend be absolutely right our plan be work legal migration the late figure show be down by and student dependant down by we all know labour big idea it be to scrap the rwanda plan even when it be operational however as one senior labour adviser say to andrew marr just yesterday we can just come in tear it up and have nothing to put in its place be sorry to break it to labour members but that be exactly their policy while we be get on and stop the boat all labour would do be stop the plane call the snp leader on monday the armed forces minister could neither confirm nor deny that uk troop may soon be deploy on the ground in the middle east the public watching will be hop that member of this house do not have short memory when it come to the potential deployment and involvement of our military in the middle east can ask the prime minister to provide some much need clarity be he give active consideration to the deployment of uk force in the middle east yes or no mr speaker you would not expect to get into any operational planning detail but what will say be that we be absolutely committed to support international effort to get more humanitarian aid into gaza which think the whole house would support by land sea and air we have triple our aid commitment and right now together with the us cyprus and other partner we be set up new temporary pier off the coast of gaza to get aid in as securely and quickly as possible let we all be in no doubt aid be require in gaza and it be require because when people be not be bomb they be starve to death the solution to that be ceasefire and the opening of safe ground aid route not the involvement on the ground of uk military personnel these be dramatic and potentially dangerous development so will the prime minister confirm to the house today that before he make decision all member will be afford vote be not go to apologise for our armed force play lead role in support international effort to get more aid in indeed we be send royal navy support ship rfa cardigan bay to the region to support that effort the right hon gentleman talk about this conflict the fast way to end it be to ensure that we have hostage deal that get hostage out and aid in and for there to be sustainable pause in the fighting it seem clear that there now be workable offer on the table so hope he join in encourage all party include hamas to accept that deal so we can move towards sustainable solution my right hon friend decision to cancel lead to million for herefordshire pothole and transport infrastructure hereford hospital have new ward more bed and new diagnostic centre on the way million have be allocate to the river wye recovery plan inflation be down the rwanda bill have be pass and defence spending be increase do my right hon friend agree with that if he carry on like this he be go to win the next election be thankful for my hon friend highlight the work that the government be do whether that be increase our defence spending to keep we safe secure our border with our rwanda act cut taxis by or raise the state pension by be also pleased that locally in herefordshire we be fill in pothole help to save the river wye and improve local health service it be crystal clear that it be the conservative government who have plan and be deliver bright future for our country in february the foreign secretary say that it would be difficult for ground offensive on rafah to avoid harm civilian and destroy home and just yesterday the deputy foreign secretary admit that he be struggle to see how such an attack could be compliant with international humanitarian law all the sign be that netanyahu be about to defy the international community and that an attack on the million palestinians shelter in rafah be imminent if that attack begin will that be the moment when the prime minister finally find the moral backbone to ban arm export to israel and if not how much more suffering have to happen before he act to prevent further uk complicity in crime against humanity what the hon lady do not acknowledge at all be that israel suffer an appalling terrorist attack that kill hundred of its citizen and it do have the right to defend itself of course as have be crystal clear we want to see humanitarian law respect and adhere to by all party too many civilian have be kill and we want to see israel take great care to avoid harm civilian have make these point repeatedly to prime minister netanyahu specifically about the impact of any military incursion into rafah and we continue to say to the israelis at all level that we want to see more aid go in and bring about hostage deal so that we can move towards sustainable ceasefire the increase in funding for special educational need and disability be extremely welcome but challenge around the recruitment of community paediatrician mean that some child in leighton buzzard dunstable and houghton regis be wait too long for an assessment what can the nhs do to attract more of the additional doctor recruit under this government into community paediatric as specialty that be incredibly rewarding and important my hon friend be right and he join in welcome the significant action that we have already take to improve child health whether that be reduce sugar in child food or the million we have invest to improve the quality of sport and physical activity in school the nhs have establish special group to ensure that the recovery of paediatric service keep pace with that of adult elective care and he will be pleased that the nhs long term workforce plan which we have fully back double the number of medical school place in england and increase specialty training place that will increase the size of the pool from which community paediatrician can be draw in the future know that you mr speaker want to join in send condolence to the friend family and colleague of our former colleague lord andrew stunell who serve with exceptional diligence and grace as mp for hazel grove in this house and who pass away very suddenly on monday when the bbc end longwave radio transmission next year that will also end access to electricity tariff such as total heating total control which be rely on by almost million household across the united kingdom switch to smart meter will not fix that for most people not least because the roll out programme be so far behind will the prime minister or possibly the secretary of state for energy security and net zero get energy company the regulator and customer group together so that we can stop pass the blame around and find solution that do not yet again leave people in the highland and island behind and out in the cold understand that an agreement have now be reach to ensure that radio teleswitch service will continue until june next year ofgem be also engage with energy supplier on their plan to support consumer through the transition while household currently cover by the service should not be disadvantage by the switch off energy supplier be well place to advise on tariff for those who have be

pleased to see the thriving local technology and manufacturing industry which will help we deliver on our ambition to make the uk science and technology superpower he be right that we have record

bright future for family up and down the country include in his constituency hypocrisy need to be call out everyone in this house will recall the former irish prime minister in brussels with photograph of bomb custom post lament that any border between northern ireland and the republic of ireland be unworkable in breach of the belfast agreement and could result in such trouble again the hypocrisy of the irish government position have not be not lose on we with the irish police now task to patrol the border to protect from the unsubstantiated unfounded of asylum seeker who supposedly actually the reverse be true make their way to the republic of ireland from the uk via northern ireland will the prime minister challenge and call out those action and confirm what representation he have make to the irish prime minister and the irish justice minister about the integrity of our uk border the house will be aware that we have make commitment to avoid hard border on the island of ireland the hon lady make very important point that the irish government must uphold their promise too we can not have cherry picking of important international agreement the secretary of state be seek urgent clarification that there will be no disruption or police checkpoint at or near the border can confirm that the united kingdom have no legal obligation to accept return of illegal migrant from ireland it be no surprise that our robust approach to illegal migration be provide deterrent but the answer be not to send police to village in donegal but to work with we in partnership to strengthen our external border all around the common travel area that we share be the lord commissioner who sign into law the special pension of the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer he owe one the prime minister be right labour be an insult to pensioner yet last year our triple lock afford pensioner the high increase in year the prime minister be go to continue to deliver dignity in retirement be he not my right hon gentleman be right that we will provide dignity to all those in retirement that be why we introduce the triple lock and why this year the state pension be rise by be also proud of our record to bring pensioner out of poverty as have say previously the state pension will increase in each and every year of the next parliament he remind we of the increase unlike labour pensioner in this country can trust the conservatives in only one of the local authority area in england be nhs ambulance meet the national response time target for potential heart attack and stroke victim do the prime minister know which one it be when it come to ambulance waiting time in of course there be work to do but the place where they be the bad in the country be in labour run wales thank to our plan we have see an improvement in and ambulance time this winter compare with last winter we have more ambulance on the road fast discharge out of our emergency care centre and virtual ward bed as say there be more to do but the contrast with labour run wales be crystal clear it have the bad performance anywhere in great britain for six month thousand of my constituent have live with foul polluted air from the withyhedge landfill site the company be own by someone with previous conviction for environmental crime who few month ago give to help vaughan gething become first minister of wales after another of his company be loan from the development bank of wales oversee by the then economy minister vaughan gething do the prime minister agree that this serious matter demand an independent investigation it be not some internal labour party matter ultimately that company need to get out of my constituency and let people in pembrokeshire have their quality of life back my right hon friend bring up an incredibly important issue know that people in wales be concerned about the relationship he mention also agree with he on the need for transparency and an investigation regard the welsh labour leader because it be very clear that the situation be not at all transparent and answer be need it have be reveal by the observer newspaper that the conservative candidate for the mayor of london be member of the six facebook group mention by the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock they be full of islamophobia antisemitism and the most disgraceful incitement to damage property the bad bit for those of we who be in the house when our member of parliament be take be the death threat to the current mayor of london mr khan will the prime minister close down those facebook page which be begin by conservative member of staff and will he investigate the role of the current candidate and her membership of those disgraceful racist facebook group the election tomorrow will be fight on the substance of the issue that londoner face the labour record be crystal clear house building in london have collapse knife crime be rise mayoral taxis be up and driver have be hit with ulez charge the labour mayor simply pander to union and have decimate london night time economy that be his record and that be how he will be judge people across london know that they will be safe with the conservatives with low taxis and well service today be staffordshire day when we celebrate all the brilliant thing about the county of staffordshire will my right hon friend join in pay tribute to our brilliant police fire and crime commissioner ben adams and encourage the people of staffordshire to vote for ben tomorrow to ensure that staffordshire remain one of the safe place to live work and visit wish everyone happy staffordshire day my right hon friend mention the police and crime commissioner election it be right that she do because under this conservative government and previous conservative governments we have cut crime by over and deliver more police officer people with labour police and crime commissioner be more likely to be victim of burglary and be twice as likely to be victim of robbery as say last year knife crime in london go up by the fact speak for themselves vote conservative for safe street immigration update with permission would like to make statement on immigration the government be commit to reduce immigration both legal and illegal into the united kingdom legal immigration have rise in recent year in part because we have extend the hand of friendship to people flee conflict and persecution in ukraine hong kong and afghanistan that be the right thing to do but another factor have be the number of overseas student and worker and their dependant rise to unsustainable level the step that the secretary of state for the home department my right hon friend the member for braintree james cleverly announce last year to cut net migration will mean that around people who would have be eligible to come to the uk will now not be we have restrict most student from bring dependent family member increase the salary that most skilled worker migrant need to earn in order to obtain visa by nearly to stop overseas care worker bring dependent family member with they raise the minimum income for family visa to ensure that people be support financially and scrap the go rate salary discount for shortage occupation and replace the shortage occupation list with new immigration salary discount list the late estimate from the office for national statistics show that net migration in the year to june be low than it be six month early the figure be provisional and we need to go far but these be encourage sign the late statistic show that the number apply for skilled worker health and care and study visa in the first three month of be down by on the same period last year we remove from january the right of student start course other than those on postgraduate research programme and government fund scholarship to bring dependant to the uk via the student visa route the number of application for student dependant visa have fall by since our change come into force from march we have stop overseas care worker bring family dependant here and have require social care firm in england to be register with the care quality commission to sponsor visa in the year end september an estimate dependant come here via that route in the first three month of the number of application for health and care visa be down by this be just the start most of our change have only just come into force meanwhile we remain committed to stop the boat follow royal assent for the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration act and the ratification of our treaty with rwanda we can operationalise our plan to relocate illegal migrant to rwanda rwanda be safe country that have repeatedly show its ability to offer asylum seeker chance to build new and prosperous life it have strong and successful track record of resettle people host more than refugee and it stand ready to accept thousand more who want to rebuild their life and who can not stay in the uk once flight begin we will have add another vital deterrent to crack down on the people smuggle gang who treat human being as cargo the first illegal migrant set to be remove to rwanda have now be detain follow series of nationwide operation this week operational team within the home office have be work apace to detain safely and swiftly individual who be in scope for relocation to rwanda with more activity due to be carry out in the come week this action be key part of the plan to deliver flight to rwanda in the next few week we have make solid progress in stop the boat although we need to finish the job the number of small boat arrival fall by more than third in and our work with international partner prevent more than crossing last year as well as help to dismantle organise crime group since july our new agreement with albania have cut albanian small boat arrival by more than and we recently sign groundbreaking deal with frontex the european border and coast guard agency which mark another crucial step in the securing of our border an initial cohort in the thousand of suitable case for removal to rwanda have be identify and place on immigration bail with strict reporting condition we have range of measure in place to ensure that we remain in contact with individual include both face to face and digital reporting and immigration enforcement have range of power to trace and locate any individual who abscond as well as dedicated team of trace officer who work with the police other government agency and commercial company to help trace individual and bring they back into contact it would of course be inappropriate for to comment far on operational activity immigration have enrich this country beyond measure but it need to be sustainable and it need to be fair legal immigration should be focus on help those in genuine need and on ensure that our economy have the skill that it need in order to flourish it be simply not right for those who can afford to pay gangster to jump ahead of those who would play by the rule and whose need be great no one need to flee to the uk from safe country such as france both illegal immigration and unsustainable legal migration place intolerable burden on community and over time they will undermine support for immigration in general which would be tragedy that be why this government have plan which we be put into action there be furth to go but we be see its positive impact already commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement but have to say that this really be get quite difficult to watch not for the first time the minister have come to the dispatch box desperately fish for compliment when it be his government his home secretary and his prime minister who be the cause of the catastrophic state of both the work base migration and asylum system this be their bin fire their chaos yet they expect praise each time they half heartedly attempt to throw single teacup of water towards the flame net migration have treble since to barely comprehensible under this government the number of people cross in small boat have spiral from few hundred in to ten of thousand every year it be toe curlingly embarrassing to watch the minister claim that he have make solid progress on stop the boat when this year the number of crosser be at the high level on record more than between january and april it be excruciatingly painful to watch the home secretary boast on social medium about remove people with no right to be here when the removal of fail asylum seeker have collapse by under this government since when the removal of foreign criminal have plummet by and when he have completely lose track of the asylum seeker he claim have be identify for deportation to rwanda it be also painful to hear government figure brag in the medium that their rwanda policy be somehow success because single person who do not even cross the channel on small boat have choose to fly to rwanda voluntarily with thousand of pound of government money stuff into his pocket by the home secretary this be not policy it be headline chasing gimmick fiasco and farce labour have be absolutely clear that we reject the million rwanda scheme base on its unaffordability and unworkability it will cover only of small boat asylum seeker and the government have no plan for the other we will repurpose that money to smash the criminal smuggler gang with our new cross border police unit and security partnership with europol crucially our new return and enforcement unit will ensure that more flight take off to other country which will remove foreign criminal fail asylum seeker and visa overstayer so that we can restore some control and integrity to our asylum system in way that be firm fair and well manage we will also end the use of asylum hotel and other inappropriate accommodation for asylum seeker which be cost the british taxpayer million of pound every single day it be painful to hear the minister brag today about the reduction in the number of health and social care visa award as way of bring down net migration first because it be base on such small data sample secondly because this be only one sector of the economy and thirdly because the minister seem to care not one iota what the reduction in worker will mean for our elderly parent where be the impact assessment and where be the plan to recruit local talent can the minister explain why net migration have treble since his party pledge during the general election to lower it will he admit that the huge surge in work base migration over recent year be evidence of this government total failure to deliver on domestic skill and training labour push the government into scrap the unfair wage discount for job on the shortage occupation list which allow company to undercut british worker by hire overseas can he explain why it take so long for his party to steal our policy on asylum home office source have tell the times that only to detention space be reserve for migrant who be due for deportation to rwanda can the minister confirm that this equate to less than of the current asylum backlog in the uk the prime minister promise to detain everyone who have cross the channel on small boat over last year give that we have only detention space what will happen to the remain the government immigration and asylum policy have fail we need to put the grown up back in charge so that we can fix this break system and once again give our country an asylum and immigration system that it can be proud of what quite extraordinary response the fact be that this be government who have credible plan to bring net migration down by and all those measure be now in flight as have be able to set out for the house it be begin to deliver the result we say it would deliver will take no lecture from the shadow front bench about the issue of domestic employment be one of the ministers in the department for work and pensions that be proud to bring forward the back to work plan and the comprehensive reform of the welfare system that we be take forward as government we be also see enormous cross government join up to support more domestic worker into those role that be the right thing to do to support people in this country to take on those role and fill those vacancy and let we not forget the record of every single labour government without fail they leave unemployment higher at the time of leave office than it be at the start under this government we have see record low unemployment benefit community across the country we have begin the process of deliver the measure in relation to legal migration and we be also deliver when it come to illegal migration we have plan we be now get on and close asylum hotel have be close that be positive thing it be the right thing to do to make sure that we accommodate people in appropriate accommodation but get away from the model of provide hotel accommodation for people what be labour plan on that we have see massive gain when it come to asylum decision making and productivity around those process what be labour policy on that we have see crossing down by over third last year compare with the year before we have see albanian arrival fall by again what be labour offering to achieve likewise there be one we will continue to sustain the progress that we have make and we know from everything that have be say in recent day that the rwanda policy be begin to have the desire effect the deterrent be clear when it come to the hon gentleman meagre offering would just say that we have already double funding for the national crime agency for organise immigration crime work and we already have approximately official work on these matter within migration and border that be all that labour members be offer it virtually resemble blank sheet of paper the truth be that they offer no deterrent they have nowhere to send people they have no plan they have no solution they try to bluff that they do but they be kid nobody they be terrified that our plan be go to work they be terrified that they will have to scrap it and they be terrified that they have no alternative only we have plan it be deliver result and we will see it through again no hint of plan for how we deal with fail asylum seeker from country to which they can not be return without the rwanda scheme be pleased with the progress that the minister have make on reduce net migration but be worried about the figure that come out yesterday of the migrant who have be identify for removal only can be locate this reflect the evidence from the second permanent secretary to the home affairs committee early in the year when some fail asylum seeker who should have be remove could not be locate where be these people and what be the department do about track they down and make sure that they can be remove as need to happen as swiftly as possible my hon friend will appreciate that can not go into the granularity of the operational work that be ongoing to ensure that we can deliver on this policy but can say that an initial cohort of suitable case of around people have be identify for removal and they have be place on immigration bail with strict reporting condition for those outside that group there be still wide range of tool to maintain contact with they that include as say early face to face and digital reporting and many individual also reside within home office accommodation the minister for counter illegal migration my right hon and learn friend the member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson lead on this work and he be confident of the whereabouts once the decision to detain be make and this be just one of the cohort of people who may be eligible for removal to rwanda the policy be clear and we be get on and operationalise it that include detain people for the purpose of relocation call the scottish national party spokesperson it be hard to know where to start with this complete and utter drivel the minister come here today proud of this tawdry pathetic self defeat piece of fascist the they do not like it but it be true and will explain to they why the home office have put mr speaker they do not like the truth the home office have issue promo video this morning of people be detain and it absolutely turn my stomach this be government who glorify their state sponsor people traffic plan as they cuff people and take they out of their bed to be send to another country against their will it be sicken these plan be damaging to our society to our economy to the people who need care and to the people who want to love live and study here university be up in arm about the cut to student number it make absolutely no sense the draft rule that the government have issue on adult at risk in immigration detention be release this week but instead of take action on the serious recommendation of the brook house inquiry the home office be instead double down on its policy of indefinite detention and labour members be go along with all of this shame on they far from what the minister say small boat arrival be up this year rwanda be no deterrent because none of their other policy have prove deterrent the thousand of people they want to send there have disappear never to be see again and who can really blame they if they be go to be pluck from their bed and take away by ministers and send to country against their will indeed who can blame they the risk be that these people will end up be exploit because they have go into hiding they will be exploit they will be traffic and they will be vulnerable why be the minister not acknowledge the impact that this policy will have on vulnerable people finally if it be indeed the case that the person the government send to rwanda have not be grant refugee status in this country why be they not be return to their country of origin be it perhaps that that country be actually unsafe if that be true why be they not give refugee status here in the first place it be perfectly respectable position to want to protect our border it be right and proper to want to ensure that we have fair and balanced system of legal migration that be sustainable make no apology whatsoever and nor will this government or any of the ministers in the home office for place front and centre the determination to protect people life we have see too many life lose in the channel at the hand of evil criminal gang with no regard whatsoever for human life who take people money exploit they and send they out to sea in unseaworthy vessel candidly beyond that be not go to edify the hon lady contribution with anything far very much welcome the fact that the minister be able to come to this house with the first encouraging sign of low migration number which will be welcome widely outside this house include suspect in scotland do he agree that the lesson we should draw from this be that take practical detailed measure to crack down on the exploitation of certain type of visa route be the way to make progress on bring immigration number down rather than the windy rhetoric we hear from the opposition spokesman my right hon friend be distinguished former home office minister who have responsibility in the immigration space and would argue that lot of the measure that we have announce and that be now all in flight build on the early effort of colleague such as he he be absolutely right that the policy be balance and measure and that they deliver on the legitimate aim of want to reduce inflow of legal migration into our country to ensure fairness to ensure that the model be sustainable and to ensure that people who come here be able to be properly support think that that be something that the british people strongly support and entirely share his sentiment call the chair of the home affairs committee the national audit office estimate that it will cost per person to fly people to rwanda can the minister tell the house which airline he will use to transport people to rwanda what be his estimate of the number of people who will be send to rwanda in the first three month of operate the policy the chairman of the select committee for whom have enormous respect and admiration will understand why be not go to get into operationally or commercially sensitive matter on the floor of the house we have consistently see great effort to thwart this policy in whole host of sens over the course of week month and year we will not be thwart we have make commitment and we will get on with deliver this policy there be plan and as the prime minister have say we will send flight within the next to week that be where our focus lie and it would be entirely inappropriate to share the logistic on the floor of the house as mass migration have be show to depress gdp per capita and as it be clear that it be easy to control the much high number of legal migrant may encourage the government to return to their promise of have migration in the ten of thousand again be not go to set out today what the government future ambition may be what be able to say be that we have package of measure that be deliver reduction of in net migration span various different route think it be very credible offer to meet the ambition of the british people to bring those number down not least for the reason that my right hon friend touch on legal migration to this country need to be sustainable when we consider for example that we see care worker come with dependant do not think that any fair minded person would by any objective yardstick think that that be reasonable position that be why we be bring it to an end and be pleased that the measure we have introduce be deliver result the times report this morning that the number of visa grant for care worker in march this year be down on the figure for march do the minister expect that reduction to continue if he do who will do the work that those carer would have do and what impact do he think it might have on the national health service we have commit to monthly reporting on the net migration measure we have introduce to allow parliament and other to take view on our progress there be extensive effort across government to employ more people from our domestic labour force wish liberal democrat members be as enthusiastic as be about the back to work plan and our work on recruitment and retention we be take forward those credible effort to try to support more people in this country into these role we be also work intensively to improve the process for rematche individual who be already here on health and social care visa these be the right step to take and will not pre empt what the figure might look like in the come month the right hon gentleman will be able to look at they in the same way as everybody else it be interesting to hear the minister comment and to see the impact of thing that think it be safe to say he and would have want to do slightly early such as abolish the discount on the sol do he agree that the core problem be that all too often people see immigration as an alternative to policy that affect the domestic labour market rather than as something that support those policy sector and business that will be very keen to have meeting with he in his new role be not quite so keen to meet he when he be try to promote the disability confident scheme as minister for disabled people what be the government plan to make sure that future migration policy clearly link up with our wide policy for the uk labour market and to make sure that it be not open to lobby to try to avoid it my hon friend speak with real authority and experience on this issue recall our conversation in our previous ministerial role and he be absolutely right that immigration ought not to be the first port of call in meet our skill need and fill vacancy that be why the government have co ordinate plan with our immigration policy our back to work plan our health and disability benefit reform and our reform in host of other area that should be our focus would argue that there be strong moral case that invest in our domestic labour force to get people into vacancy be the right thing to do where there need to be practical approach to migration we should look at it but it most definitely should not be the first port of call welcome the comment on legal migration which be very important to many sector in northern ireland on the important and perplexing issue of illegal migration can the minister say something about what the irish republic government say this week about push back returnee to northern ireland can he confirm that the irish justice minister make up the fact that of the problem stem from northern ireland will he say something about the republic of ireland court claim that the united kingdom be an unsafe destination to return people to in the first instance will he please assure that northern ireland will not become dumping ground for the right wing problem be face across the eu as the prime minister have rightly say include at prime minister question we be not go to accept return from the eu via ireland when the eu do not accept return to france from where illegal migrant be come to the united kingdom the uk government position be clear we have regular and ongoing work on the abuse of the common travel area which be right and proper we also stand by our obligation under the good friday agreement would argue that the prime minister have make our position very clear chelmsford be very welcoming community we have welcome ukrainian refugee the family of those brave afghans who stand beside our soldier and the hong kong chinese we have amazing domestic abuse service and we have welcome woman and their family from all over london and the south east who be flee violent man we have build thousand of new home and because the labour mayor of london have so spectacularly fail to build new home we have welcome social housing tenant from all across london but this can not go on we have family who be unable to find home in temporary accommodation we have to control migration be delighted that the minister be close hotel will he please close the atlantic hotel and the legg street flat in chelmsford chelmsford have welcome so many and we can not home everyone be very mindful that my right hon friend community in chelmsford have be incredibly generous the uk government have be deliver work in conjunction with community to provide sanctuary for those flee the most dreadful conflict around the world include in ukraine afghanistan and syria as well as those flee the situation in hong kong she be also right to touch on the abuse of route which be precisely why we be introduce great care quality commission oversight and accreditation of the health and social care visa system hear my right hon friend representation on accommodation on which we have have conversation reduce inflow be critical to allow we to get on with closing hotel across the country and to get the accommodation picture into more manageable state it be clear that only this government have credible plan to reduce the inflow of people come here illegally via small boat across the channel we will see that through to make sure that we can get on with close more hotel as the policy be roll out it be see to be the brutal and inhumane financial fiasco that it be asylum seeker be detain as they turn up for their normal monthly reporting yesterday cause immense distress number of they will inevitably be send to the detention centre in my constituency we have experience of what happen when people be distressed in this way we have see suicide self harm and mental breakdown can have an assurance from the minister that the charity that support asylum seeker in detention include will have direct access to these detain individual and that these individual will have access to legal advice there be of course establish process whereby people can access the support that be appropriate in the circumstance have principled disagreement with the right hon gentleman on this point about detention and recognise that those in the scottish national party do not support detention either for the purpose of removal however where people be here who have no right to be here think it be appropriate that they be detain for the purpose of removal that be do entirely properly in accordance with the law with the proper safeguard around it as ever that will continue to be the case during the ongoing work as part of the rwanda relocation welcome the statement and in particular the news that in some category at least immigration be finally begin to fall on asylum specifically the irish foreign minister and former taoiseach micheál martin complain bitterly just few day ago that large number of asylum seeker be move from northern ireland into the irish republic sky news report yesterday that the irish government be seriously contemplate move police officer to the border to interdict that flow in effect that would create hard border on the island of ireland some of we be lecture for year include by today opposition spokesman that the irish government would never contemplate that in any circumstance so the stench of hypocrisy be strong will the minister assure that we will never allow the republic to return those people to northern ireland unless and until we can remove illegal cross channel migrant to france as for the contemptible remark of the snp spokesman let say that at least the uk have government which be more than we can say for scotland this week my right hon friend know that this government be resolutely oppose to hard border on the island of ireland understand that the secretary of state for northern ireland have request an urgent meeting with the irish government to seek assurance that there will be no adverse implication for the smooth operation of either the common travel area or the good friday agreement that be an important meeting and he be right to seek it reiterate that we would welcome return agreement with the eu we think it be right that we explore those opportunity and we will continue to pursue that when be first elect to this house we often debate safe and legal route but we do not hear much about that any more many of my constituent be write to because they want family reunion scheme for their relative in gaza recently co author report with helena kennedy recommend that the uk government have humanitarian visa for woman in afghanistan and iraq will the minister therefore tell whether the government have any plan to announce any safe and legal route before the next general election be sure the hon and learn lady have follow the position closely through the illegal migration act we make commitment which be reflect in the legislation to publish the cap and the statutory instrument that sit alongside it which will support our effort to provide resettlement opportunity in this country for people in the year ahead that work be on track and we will deliver on that commitment and will be able to say more in due course in december care england appear before my select committee and tell we that the care sector have be blindside by the change to ban overseas care worker from bring dependant to the uk the government impact assessment say that the policy would not affect the number of those apply to come here and help look after our constituent yet today figure show that care worker application have decrease by more than half we all want to see care sector sustain by domestic labour why would we however with vacancy to the end of march this year be that decrease the intention or the unintended consequence of these change as have consistently describe the situation on dependant have be unsustainable as say in answer to an early question we see dependant come with care worker that position could not realistically continue to be sustain we be in the very early stage of the delivery of these measure the health and social care change have only just come into force my hon friend will want to satisfy himself on this have look at the figure across number of month but reiterate that there be huge opportunity associate with domestic recruitment and enormous work be go on in government with focus on retention that be the right way to deal with these challenge but health and social care visa route be still available for people it be not unreasonable to think that in future individual without dependant will come they will still be able to come and that be entirely appropriate when the minister give statement to the house he say that the government have extend the hand of friendship to those flee persecution and oppression be he aware that considerable number of people who be in calais or who have cross the channel and try to get to this country be victim of human right abuse environmental disaster and war some of which this country have be involve in such as in afghanistan his answer be to demonise they and to try to force they to go to rwanda should he not think for moment of sense of humanity about people in desperate situation through no fault of their own look for place of safety in country that be involve in the war in afghanistan in the first place be exceptionally proud of the work that this country support by the home office and its team have do as part of the enormous resettlement effort we have take forward in recent year only last week have the real privilege to spend some time with team who have be support new afghan arrival through the afghan citizen resettlement scheme be incredibly move by that work those individual have come through safe and legal route and we will continue to see those commitment through the uk have play its part and it will continue to do so but what be not right in any sense be to give the impression that anybody ought to be get in small boat have pay an evil criminal gang to do so and come across the channel and risk their life we see young girl lose her life only last week nobody need to leave those french shore in order to find safety we do have safe and legal route and it be right that people come through those fifteen month after the government announce that they be take over the whole of raf scampton and put migrant there not single one have arrive we have fight the home office to complete standstill and everything we have say have be prove correct the cost be rise exponentially from million to million and the building be decay as be the runway the labour party have now join in my early day motion against this proposal we have involve the levelling up secretary who be now impose all sort of condition on the home office will the excellent first class minister before we today now ensure that his attention be laser focused on work with we and do what we have argue for from the beginning release the entire site to scampton holdings so that we can get the big and good levelling up we have ever have on former raf base my right hon friend be tireless campaigner for his constituent he know that be exceptionally sympathetic to try to deliver this regeneration project for lincolnshire appreciate entirely the enormous economic benefit and opportunity that it present for people in the scampton area from perspective of not only amenity but job we be work intensively with he and with the local authority to move this forward we do of course need to realise our accommodation ambition for that site in the short term but also want to find and agree way forward that mean that those regeneration ambition can also be realise as quickly as possible we now know that it be the government intention to pay board and lodge for five year for anyone voluntarily remove to rwanda that commitment will fall heavily on the next government if this one be even successful in get anyone to rwanda so how much be this nonsense go to cost it be fair to say that if we be to adopt the approach of the labour front benchers which the hon gentleman no doubt subscribe to we would continue to have uncontrolle immigration to our country via the channel he offer no alternative solution to the one that the government be take forward that be an unsustainable position be confident that the rwanda policy will help to bring to an end the channel crossing put the evil criminal gang out of business and get the issue under control that have to be right what be clearly unacceptable be to parade around with no credible policy alternative and just pretend that everything be go to be okay it be very encouraging to hear the news about the progress on tackle both legal and illegal migration and particularly about the operationalisation of the rwanda policy push on number of occasion for further scheme with other third country because we need to see that deterrent but be tell that we be wait for the delivery of the rwanda scheme now that we have deliver the rwanda scheme through parliament will the minister look again at further scheme with other third country so that we can offer the maximum possible deterrent to those try to come here illegally my hon friend be right on the point about deterrent he have be very supportive of our work that have see albanian arrival fall by again that show the value that deterrent have know the minister for counter illegal migration have be have conversation with the vietnamese about the small boat arrival we have see from vietnam we will continue to work hard to deliver more international co operation in this space also think it be right that the home secretary be spend considerable amount of his time and energy on inform the conversation internationally about what more we can do to tackle these migratory flow we know that where we lead the way in announce our rwanda policy other internationally be seek to follow yesterday my year old springburn constituent abdullah salimi be detain he be then take on hour journey from scotland to england suspect because in scotland he would get legal aid and he would have legal representation but down here he will have none during the hour journey he be give no water and no food be that right be that acceptable what be the reason for that he have his phone take off he so he could not contact anybody or tell anybody be that right be that acceptable what be the reason for that rise have finish email the home office last night and go to the home office this morning but official refuse to give any information go with letter for one of the minister colleague but they refuse to take the letter be mr salimi mp have the right to know what be go on in his life and the right to try to represent he why be be deny that and why be he be deny the right that the minister enjoy at the age of be british citizen who be in this country legally interruption if the hon lady will allow to finish the point it be entirely right and proper that people be detain on legal basis for the purpose of removal under this policy but there be always safeguard around that will gladly accept the letter from the hon lady and ensure it reach the right destination in the home office we will in the normal way look carefully at any concern she wish to raise recognise that she be entirely oppose to the policy objective we be seek to advance there be principled disagreement there she think be wrong about this think she be wrong but if she would like to share those specific point with will gladly ensure that she receive full response the sign of fall in net migration will be welcome across amber valley can raise my concern about the situation where young uk national work abroad for while and form relationship but be not yet earn enough to sponsor their spouse to live in the uk be there more we can do to help in this situation perhaps by clarify in the guidance that they can use both their salary to meet the earning threshold there have be no change to the way that the various family visa requirement can be meet through saving and the like we have good debate last week in westminster hall on the important safeguard of article right as part of the consideration of any application all those factor be give proper and due consideration to ensure we get the right decision on individual case we think it be right to introduce these salary change they be be increase incrementally and not apply retrospectively but as say there be an important safeguard around article right we have support this policy albeit with some reservation because we believe it be important to break the criminal gang model and ensure the stability of the united kingdom however be not convince today by the minister argument give that we be send one person to rwanda with in their pocket and we be still look for half the people who be mean to be send there this week the irish government in an attempt to divert attention from their own domestic failure on housing and immigration have start row about immigrant come from the united kingdom into the irish republic and have refuse to publish the deal it be the usual brit bash exercise that they engage in the minister have be ask twice today but have not give an answer so will he tell we what specific measure he will put in place to ensure that the cynical irish government do not simply bus immigrant to the border and dump they in northern ireland the situation he describe would not be appropriate that be matter for the minister for counter illegal migration who lead on that work within the home office we have be clear that if there be desire for return deal that need to be do with the eu in the way the british people would rightly expect on the right hon member early point about rwanda the voluntary return we see be part of an established approach to voluntary return that be in place even when the last labour government be in office we be now get on and deliver wide scheme the prime minister have be clear that we will operationalise that over the course of the next to week we be determined to send individual with no right to be here to rwanda and to put out of business the evil criminal gang responsible for the misery in the channel welcome the news about the reduction in the number of legal migrant immigration must be set at sustainable level so that migrant can integrate properly into our country do the minister agree that to fill any skill gap it be vital that we ensure that we upskill our own people and not become dependent on immigration will he confirm that his department be work with the department for education and the department for work and pensions to ensure we achieve that my hon friend be absolutely right about that there be concerted effort go on across government build on the back to work plan be play my part in discussion with colleague from the department for education the treasury the department for work and pensions and whole host of other departments include that of the minister of state department for business and trade my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who be in his place we be go sector by sector look at what more we can do to support the domestic recruitment of staff in the first instance that be the right approach to this it be not right to resort to immigration as the first port of call my hon friend support for those effort and endeavour be appreciate labour push the government into scrap the unfair wage discount on job on the shortage occupation list will the minister explain why it take so long for the government to adopt our policy do not see it like that labour policy be blank sheet of paper this government policy be credible offering to get on and deliver on legal and illegal migration the good news be that those effort be deliver result the minister have say that the number of application for skilled worker health and care visa and for student visa be down astonishingly he be proud of that international student bring massive economic benefit to the uk in my constituency alone that be worth million per annum they be also highly mobile if the graduate route be close we lose out economically but more importantly our business lose skill and the ability to develop and expand will the minister confirm that there be no plan to close the graduate visa route the hon member present the government position in would argue an inaccurate and disingenuous light the fact be that we want to see balanced approach to migration the position around dependant be not sustainable she will also recognise that there be proper process which be ongoing in relation to the graduate route the migration advisory committee be look at that route look at the datum and take representation and will report in proper way to the department minister will then take decision around those recommendation take full account of the fact and have proper conversation within government about the right way forward but it be entirely right that we wait for the migration advisory committee finding can the minister explain what will happen to the more than people whom the refugee council estimate can not be remove to rwanda or return to their home country since the introduction of the illegal migration act do he accept that those people stick in limbo be likely to be reliant on home office support or go underground will not get into the operational specific of the work that be ongoing to operationalise the rwanda policy we be clear that there be basis on which we can send people to rwanda for the purpose of relocation with the ultimate objective of put out of business the evil criminal gang who be responsible for bring people here but we work cohort by cohort and we take appropriate decision for individual accord to the circumstance that be relevant in each specific case thank the minister for his answer to all the question today clearly the government have policy that they be try to implement and think they need some support from member across the chamber to make that happen the home office have state that crackdown on visa have lead to an fall in skilled worker visa do the minister agree that our fishing sector rely on the provision of skilled worker what step can be take to ensure that the fishery do not suffer as result of what the minister have say today historically the government have be very generous and allow the fishing and seafood processing sector to have privileged position within the immigration system with quite considerable support there have be some legitimate and understandable concern raise around the risk of exploitation and the need to safeguard people properly make this offer again have make it previously to the sector if it have idea about how we can still uphold those duty to safeguard people and about how the english language requirement can still be meet in way that be conducive to help the industry would welcome those representation and that evidence base uk trade performance with permission would like to make statement on the uk trade performance when be overseas as secretary of state for business and trade other country speak with nothing but admiration and respect for what we be achieve in britain as the chief executive officer of nissan global recently remark it be surprising to hear people ask why they should choose the uk because in his word we have both great people and great talent here certainly in the firm that have visit up and down this country be proud to see our employer and exporter fire on all cylinder yet when return to westminster some people seem unaware of the progress that we have make as an independent trading nation today want to put that right the late trade datum publish by the office for national statistics and also by the united nations conference on trade and development should give everyone in this house cause for celebration and renew pride in our country they confirm that the strategy the public vote for on june be deliver leave the european union be vote of confidence in the project of the united kingdom and we be see result since that referendum the uk economy have grow fast than that of germany italy and japan and contrary to gloomy prediction our manufacture productivity have grow more than that of germany france italy and the usa accord to the late un statistic the uk outside the eu become the world fourth big exporter in overtake japan the netherlands and france the value of uk export be billion in the month to february that build on progress we have make in grow our export outside the confine of the eu export be now above when adjust for inflation service export be at an all time high summary of these figure along with the most recent business and labour statistic be publish on in april together they definitively disprove the claim of those who prophesy catastrophic economic collapse when we leave the eu to become sovereign nation today we be sell not only more service to eu country than ever before but record amount of service to the rest of the world too we be the large net exporter of financial and insurance service in the world far from an exodus of business out of the uk european firm have double down on their commitment to the uk in unilever choose to headquarter exclusively in london over rotterdam since cadbury have bring more chocolate production back to the uk from germany in the same year shell move its headquarters out of the netherlands and into the uk we be tear down the barrier to trade since the start of we have resolve barrier all over the world estimate to be worth more than billion to uk business over five year period in this be equivalent to remove around million worth of trade barrier every single hour british pork farmer be benefit from newly agree access to the mexican market which be worth million over the same period our work on bottle labelling for uk gin and whisky have drive up export to chile by tonne we have end the us ban on british beef and lamb we be work to deliver strategy on situation that face the whole world not just our friend and neighbour in europe this be crucial if we be to lock britain into the future of where global growth will be in the eu take more than of uk good export in this be because uk good export to the eu remain broadly flat while export to non eu country rise by around in real term we be go far to seize the benefit of an independent trade policy we have deal with country around the world with more to come under this government plus the most comprehensive trade deal to which the eu have ever agree later this year we will join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership one of the world big trading bloc this will mean that more than of uk good will be eligible for zero tariff in some of the asia pacific most dynamic economy british business be set to benefit as well as service export where britain excel our top good sale be in car mechanical power generator medicine pharmaceutical product and aircraft component we have one of the world large manufacturing sector productivity in our manufacturing industry have grow fast than in every other nation since hundred of business in steel chemical and other sector stand to benefit from the newly introduce british industry supercharger which be bring energy cost down for key industry our billion advanced manufacturing plan be open new market and remove obstacle to growth while help to crowd in new funding for plant and factory throughout the uk every penny the uk government spend on manufacturing be match fivefold by the growth creator of the private sector this pro investment approach be work the uk automotive sector attract billion worth of greenfield foreign investment in alone the labour party will remember mr alastair campbell who assert during the referendum that if we leave the eu nissan will leave nissan be still here the two new electric model be set to be build at its sunderland this year more minis be roll off production line in oxfordshire today thank to million investment from bmw these be firm that look for opportunity the world over and decide that the uk be the place to be listen to some of the remark make in this house and elsewhere people would think that our country be not worth invest in at all let we be clear the british ingenuity and industry that make this country prosper in the past still exist today and even if those on the opposition benches can not see it international investor certainly can the statistic publish by my department show that the uk inward fdi stock have reach more than trillion our fdi stock be the high in europe more than germany france and italy combine the most recent oecd datum show that our employment rate be high than that of the us france and italy the regulatory freedom that we gain by leave the eu have allow our smart regulation programme to cut the red tape that have be hold they back we have already reform the work time directive reporting requirement save business up to billion per year we recently announce that we will raise the threshold that determine company size reduce burden on small business and remove low value and overlap reporting requirement those change will make report simple and deliver saving of around million per year to uk company with small and medium sized company benefit by around million it be no surprise that the most recent natwest sme business activity index show that output be increase strongly drive by renew manufacturing sector expansion and company activity expectation remain upbeat these thing do not happen by accident and hope that hon member on both side of the house will welcome those figure have no doubt that this statement will disappoint some people as it do not align with the story that they want to tell of nation rive by injustice and economic stagnation cling to europe for any hope for the future that be not to say that everything be perfect of course there be still more to do but we be not alone in our problem minister in other country be quick to remind about supply chain issue affect everything from get car component to stock supermarket shelf they tell about how they be cop with problem in the job market as society from germany to japan get old only when be back in the uk be tell that all these issue be down to brexit far from it our plan be work and britain be thrive as an independent sovereign home of free enterprise and free trade that be what the recent figure publish by my department by the ons and by the un tell it be what our business exporter employer and investor all tell and hope that hon member present can see it too commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister as usual be grateful to the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement be always pleased to hear any positive news on trade and investment but she appear presumably inadvertently to have miss out one or two fact and issue in her statement under the conservative party business have suffer from endless turn and policy change that undermine investment there have be constant change on policy from net zero to corporate governance the government failure to address the big challenge face business such as skill shortage infrastructure issue and net zero have undermine business confidence foreign direct investment figure be down nearly since accord to the government own figure without an industrial strategy and with constant policy uncertainty more business will not have the confidence to invest in the uk specifically on trade british export in the past decade have grow slow than those of any other member of the besides japan accord to the office for budget responsibility since the secretary of state be appoint british export have drop and be expect to decline again this year with at good anaemic growth in each of the next three year minister have cut funding to help small business get to the international trade show that they need to attend in order to find new export market and have cut funding to allow business group to lead their own trade mission to win vital new order for british business farmer and conservative member think that the government record on trade negotiation be one of give away far too much for far too little in return minister deliver poor trade deal with europe that have put up barrier to trade raise cost for business and help to drive up price and there be no sign of any plan to use next year review of the trade and co operation agreement to try to address at least some of those issue then there be the conservatives failure to deliver on the promise in their manifesto at the last general election to have trade agreement in place with at least of the world and to have trade deal with the united states the target to deliver trillion of export have be move many time and will at well be deliver year late perhaps the right hon lady could answer the follow question last week we hear about the impact that the government constant flip flopping be have on the automotive sector with stellantis air serious warning what discussion have she have with the transport secretary to try to mitigate the impact of the conservative party chaos as the devastating news from south wales continue to come we have hear next to nothing from the secretary of state on the damage that she have allow to our steel industry do she still think that spend million of pound of taxpayer money to make thousand of people redundant and leave we as the first develop country with no primary steelmaking capacity be great deal as she say at the time give that this house have repeatedly be promise an amazing trade deal with india usually by diwali will the right hon lady update the house on the state of free trade agreement negotiation with india lastly give the medium report at the weekend which have cause concern will she update the house on whether fta negotiation with the gulf co operation council be still ongoing or have stall thank the hon gentleman for his question could see that it be very difficult for he to find thing to pick at in the statement so broadly welcome some of what he say which imply that the good news be true the hon gentleman start with the obr he pick that statistic very selectively of course export fall during covid export overall have grow many opposition members will say oh it just service that be because they do not understand the uk economy the uk economy be service so it be good that service export be go up that be what we mainly do in this country the hon gentleman ask about stellantis and talk about turn remind he that the whole house vote for the net zero by target it happen under previous conservative government but with the consent of the whole house when business talk we listen the opposition criticise we for make the change that stellantis ask for so why be he now raise those comment the transport secretary the prime minister and have discussion we do have discussion and we extend the zero emission vehicle mandate to ensure that we be not impose undue cost on people if they be not ready to take up electric vehicle we listen the opposition do not look at their plan for net zero assure the hon gentleman that business be absolutely terrified about what labour would do with its new green deal and all the measure that would just put cost on business and consumer the hon gentleman ask about steel be afraid that need to correct several point we save job in port job be go to be lose and we save if we want net zero transition we will have to move to electric arc furnace which require few staff the opposition can not blame the government for that while demand transition to net zero we save job in port talbot we invest million out of total billion investment make with tata it be wrong to say that the government be not save steel we be the only one who have plan for steel the opposition have no plan we have great plan which will transform and regenerate south wales the other thing that the hon gentleman say that be incorrect be about we have no primary steel production we still have british steel in scunthorpe there may be change in port talbot around move to electric arc furnace but he need to remember that even the steel production that we have there rely on import we do not have iron ore here so recommend that he get briefing on exactly what be go on with steel production in the uk on india the hon gentleman be right that deal be promise by diwali under previous prime minister but as soon as become trade secretary say in this house over and over that it be about the deal not the day we do not sign trade deal that will not make business happy we be keen to ensure that whatever we do will do right by our farmer the opposition laugh when pause the fta discussion with canada that be because what the canadians be offer be not go to be good the industry there be complain that the uk get too good deal from the cptpp but the opposition do not talk about that we be negotiate great deal for this country be very proud of the work that my ministers and my department be do thank the hon gentleman for his question be grateful for the statement it be wonderful news on export it show that all the pessimism at the time of the referendum be completely wrong fully support the approach of the secretary of state in delay the target for battery vehicle because people be not buy they in enough quantity but will she add to that by adopt the advice of stellantis not to fine motor manufacturer here for produce good petrol and diesel car before people be ready to buy electric one because that be put off investor understand the point that my right hon friend make this be something that we have hear from some body in industry the auto sector be give we two different message some people want we to bring the mandate forward and make the change fast other want we to delay it it be very tricky balance we understand the concern we do not want to put additional burden on business so he be right to make that point have make representation to the transport secretary but this be his policy area and he will make the ultimate decision call the snp spokesperson with these selective statistic the secretary of state would clearly make good cherry picker while clutch at straw at the same time the reality be that we still have cost of living crisis and would welcome she to my constituency to tell people there how rosy thing apparently be in the uk real gdp growth in the uk growth since before the pandemic be just that be one third of the eu average figure and one eighth of us growth the here and now figure be even bad the uk economy shrink in whereas there be significant growth in the and the oecd average now be probably the only time in live history that the uk economy have be on par with germany but sadly that be because germany be also an international outlier in lack economic growth volume of uk good import and export be small than in the big five year decline for which comparative record exist the secretary of state be right that export to the eu be up but import from the eu be also up so the trading deficit with the eu have increase by more than allianz trade have estimate that the introduction yesterday of new custom and check procedure on animal and plant product and good enter the uk will cost british business billion year uk energy also estimate that energy bill be billion year high due to post brexit trading arrangement instead of talk up the minimal saving from what the secretary of state call cut red tape wish she would tell the truth about the trading cost increase result from brexit red tape for business in the uk not to mention the impact of labour shortage this parliament be set to break lot of record we have the big drop in living standard the long decline in gdp per capita the steep five year decline in volume of trade and the stock market shrink at its fast pace in history which of these record break achievement for broken britain be she most proud of it be very interesting to hear the hon gentleman talk about his constituent what he should tell they certainly what would if be there be that under the seven year administration of first minister nicola sturgeon the snp welfare economy grow at half the growth rate of england economy if the snp have achieve growth in line with england it could have increase scotland economy by billion instead that welfare economy mean no growth because of scotland have the high income tax rate in the uk and high wage in the public sector than in the private sector the snp policy be not help the hon gentleman ask he do not want to hear the fact but will give he the fact he talk about the real pre pandemic gdp figure of course the pandemic have an impact we can not stand here and pretend that it do not even the statistic be quote show that covid have far big impact than leave the eu ever will just as russia war in ukraine will have far big impact than leave the eu he talk about international outlier which show that he be the one who be cherry picking we have to look at our peer country because we will not grow as quickly as develop country it be astonishing that he be also complain that import from the eu be up that show that despite our leave the european union trade be do well and thing be go well if his scottish government take some lesson from the uk government they would see much well thing happen for their constituent welcome the secretary of state statement and especially the fact that japan be mention on think five or six occasion the late statistic show there have be million increase in total trade between our two country which work out at an increase of would also welcome she to an event that we be host with baker mckenzie in the first week of june launch baker mckenzie uk japan connect which seek to foster business and trade between our country thank my hon friend for the question will check my diary to see if be available for the event but be glad that he raise the issue of trade with japan we sign an upgrade fta with japan after leave the eu so these roll over deal be no long roll over deal because we be add more into they especially the digital trade chapter these be deal fit for the century the age we live in rather than the century call the chair of the business and trade committee it be good to see the secretary of state in the house again know she have difference of opinion sometimes with the office for budget responsibility but can she confirm that the obr figure for march show that the uk have the low trade intensity in the there be important progress as she have report today but much of it rest on progress in our service trade which provoke the question of why we be not pursue service only trade agreement in more expansive way not least as the minister for trade policy be unable to confirm whether any comprehensive free trade deal would be sign before the election when he come before the committee yesterday he say that service only deal be not allow under world trade organisation rule which of course be flat out wrong the question want to put to the secretary of state be about our good trade the office for national statistics figure show that our good export have fall by about billion over year the risk be that that number will be hit even hard by the chaos at the border the new border operating model involve datum that be submit by trader but then not share with port sometimes two hour notice be need for journey that only take minute there be no standardisation of inspection charge and british chambers of commerce say that many business will be hit by thousand of pound worth of custom bill that they do not know they be on the hook for the question be this do the secretary of state warn her colleague in cabinet that there would be complete chaos and that the eu check that we be introduce would be disaster that be what small business be say to and know it be what small business be say to she thank the right hon gentleman for his question he ask why we be not pursue service only deal we have do two of those one with singapore and one with ukraine about digital trade exclusively however it be an area where we need both side to agree and most country still want good deal for many of the country that we be negotiate with good be still the large part of their economy we have to bear that in mind because trade deal be not one way story be glad that the right hon gentleman welcome my statement he will of course know that be not somebody who pretend that everything be perfect and nothing could be well do think thing could be improve but one thing we have to acknowledge in reference to his comment about the border operating model be that the people vote to leave the european union there will be opportunity and there will be cost farmer regularly tell we that they want well food standard check and other check at the border that will impose cost we have do everything we can to minimise those cost we have even find cost saving in do so have hear many scare story about what business will see at the border but not all of they will apply we be do everything we can to minimise the burden but the fact be that the eu impose the same measure on the other side and we need to give our producer level playing field it be pleasure to follow the chairman of the business and trade committee be relatively new member of the committee join this year recall my first meeting at which we hear that the uk have have the third high foreign direct investment over the past year we be behind only the us and china this week at our meeting with the minister for trade policy we hear about our trade deal with over country include the landmark cptpp do my right hon friend the secretary of state agree that that track record of success contrast starkly with labour track record under labour the uk share of global trade decline do she agree that just perhaps aside from the chairman of the select committee there be not single labour back bencher in the chamber who want to hear about that track record of success because they do not have leg to stand on thank my hon friend for the question she be right and be sure that the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas who be labour trade minister could verify those figure about our trade dropping indicate dissent he be shake his head in answer to my hon friend question we be often tell that we would never be able to get those trade deal we be mock and that nobody would sign any deal with the uk that be like what we have in the eu we get do and many of they we have actually improve on we in this house must remind people that we have do much good they may forget people live in the moment and we have to remind they of our record and this be record we should be proud of as much as we welcome the good figure that have be produce northern ireland still suffer from not have full access to the trade deal that the united kingdom have strike throughout the world with country what measure would ensure that we can take advantage of those deal and get rid of the injustice of the protocol and the difficulty that it cause business in northern ireland we have be do lot in northern ireland to increase investment and make up for any shortfall whether through our trade deal or otherwise the windsor framework for example be one thing that the prime minister have work on to iron out some of those issue we be look at where northern ireland can exploit the benefit of be part of both the eu single market and the uk single market which be unique position we know that there be some area in which thing be not exactly the same as in gb but we can look individually in specific trade deal at what we can do in service for example that should not be an issue we really see the difference in good we can do lot more and we continue to work on that do the secretary of state agree that if we cast our mind back to the time of covid when we be spend hundred of billion of pound just to keep the country function none of we could have imagine set of statistic as positive as those that she have give we may re emphasise point that have already be make in slightly different term there appear to be eight time as many people sit on the conservative front bench as there be on the entirety of the labour back benches do she take that as vote of confidence in the government positive message my right hon friend be absolutely right it be clear that labour do not like good news as soon as there be any labour members exit the chamber unless they absolutely have to be here it be disgraceful that there be not single back bench labour member other than the chair of the business and trade committee the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne the shadow minister the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali be blush because she know that it be true that be one reason why it be important for we not to assume that people see these statistic if we do not talk about they nobody else will enough people out there certainly on the labour benches will tell we how terrible everything be but we need to remind people about the good that be happen in complete contrast to the rosy picture that the government be try to paint there be some inconvenient truth that have be leave out from this week new check on food import from the eu will see cost for importer rise by which will have severe impact on small business and consumer alike will the secretary of state take this opportunity to lay out how consumer and small business will be protect from those severe new cost seem to remember time when some liberal democrats be complain that we do not have any check at the border and that that show that standard in this country be low if we do something they immediately make the opposite argument there be no consistency whatsoever explain in response to an early

united kingdom what discussion have she have with the department for the economy and the ni assembly about northern ireland contribution to create new employment in so that the figure can remain on the increase as they do in the year prior to think the point that the hon gentleman be make be that we can not be complacent about what be happen in either country even as we talk about good news we need to continue work to ensure that those thing do not disappear he be right that we should do as much as we can with the department for the economy now that minister be in place it will be lot easy for we to co ordinate and see how we can work together to increase employment and improve wage and productivity in both region welcome the secretary of state statement it be particularly encouraging to hear the news about the manufacturing sector however as she will be aware if growth in that sector be to be maintain continued government support will be need will it be forthcoming we have put in place billion advanced manufacturing plan for the manufacturing sector firm will need to ensure that they qualify for that funding we be also do what we can to bring in investment especially foreign

representative of the business in my hon friend constituency to have that conversation we be in the chamber to talk about the progress of british business so it be tell that labour mp have not bother to show up if today financial times be to be believe that be because they be desperately try to find business to talk about the late reversal of labour party policy which be on labour very damaging approach to the labour market its approach would place additional law on business that would stifle enterprise and hand out more bung to its paymaster in the trade union so do my right hon friend

much to get our regulatory environment right and thank my hon friend for all the work he have do in this area know it be something that he care about and thank he for many of the suggestion and much of the advice that he have provide to the right regulatory environment can and will deliver growth be terrify by some of the thing that see the labour party put forward and business do not like they either those flexible right from day one would mean that if business employ someone and they do not turn up to work on their first day that business could not sack they which would be disaster we have do so much on labour right but it be not the area that be go to deliver growth certainly not with the policy that labour be put forward warmly welcome the secretary of state statement particularly

vladimir putin illegal and immoral war in ukraine can the secretary of state assure that the ceramics industry will be able to take part fully and play big role in ensure that we export the very good of britain around the world particularly through future free trade agreement with country such as india yes that be right with our fta we be try to ensure that we deliver for business if business be

not talk enough about that we forget that until this country have broadly neutral or positive balance of trade but between and that balance go very negative we have struggle to restore that balance which have make we dependent on foreign debt and our economy fragile so very much welcome these figure it look like we be turn the tide also welcome my right hon friend focus on manufacturing which have very important part to play in our balance of trade but we must not forget about the small manufacturer she have rightly focus on the large one but nearly job in my constituency be dependent on export what help be available from the government to help small manufacturer which often face more barrier to export to also be part of this excellent recovery my hon friend make very good point through our export strategy we be do lot to provide support for business that may not be familiar with export or that need additional help we do that work with our trade commissioner in every region around the world as well as with international post one thing we have say in the department for business and trade be that this be the year of the small and medium sized enterprise quite lot of the time the news that we give be about the big billion for the ftse company but most people who work in this country work for small and medium sized business that be one reason why we want to reduce the threshold at which they count for the purpose of corporate reporting and regulation which should make their life easy and give they few barrier to trade it will help they to improve their export as well bill present russian state assets and reconstruction of ukraine bill presentation and first reading standing order no rehman chishti support by david morris afzal khan dr matthew offord and henry

reconstruction and rebuilding of ukraine include an assessment of the need of ukraine and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time friday may and to be print bill road traffic testing of blood motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to amend section of the road traffic act to provide that speciman of blood may be subject to laboratory test without the permission of the person from whom it be take and for connected purpose since be elect in my team and have deal with thousand of case to support my constituent across stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke however no case have be as move and upsetting or have have as much of an impact in the community as the tragic death of six year old sharlotte sky naglis on june sharlotte be out for walk with her father along endon road in norton green to get some sweet when she be hit and kill by john owen who be two time over the drink drive limit with class drug in his system and speeding while on his phone the impact on the local community be impossible to overestimate know that friend of sharlotte still fear cross the road or walk to school by themselves milestone that as any parent know be an essential part of grow up and know of parent who be so much more concerned about their child go out to play because of the fear that the same thing could happen to their love one as father myself be humble every time work with sharlotte brave and inspirational mother claire reynolds although she sadly can not be with we today as she be recover from surgery she have not stop try to get justice for her daughter claire and first start work together after john owen be give shockingly lenient sentence the judge who tell mr owen that he be an accident wait to happen sentence he to just six year and four month in prison where he would only serve two and half year behind bar claire sharlotte family and believe it to be an insult that the criminal who kill sharlotte would spend less time behind bar than sharlotte be alive however pass on my thank to the secretary of state for justice for support claire and by block the ludicrous and affrontive suggestion that john owen could have be move to category prison after serve just month of his sentence that would have rub more salt into the wound of all those close to sharlotte and be grateful that that sicken move do not go ahead while we be unable to increase john owen sentence what claire and want more than anything be to leave lasting legacy in sharlotte name we seek to amend section of the road traffic act by introduce sharlotte law this legislative change have one simple intention to put victim of road traffic incident and their family first under the current legislation blood sample can be take without consent when someone be unconscious and have be involve in fatal collision however those blood sample be not allow to be test unless that individual give their consent that not only delay the conduct of the police investigation but more importantly it prolong the pain for victim who be desperately seek answer claire tell that her experience be like torture for eleven week the family wait not know whether john owen would wake up and be hold accountable for his crime nor when they would get answer about what lead to sharlotte life be take to add further confusion if an individual regain consciousness but refuse consent for the blood sample to be test they will be guilty of fail to allow testing and will receive up to two year in prison however if that individual have take substance or consume alcohol to certain limit that would act as more serious aggravating factor and could increase their sentence beyond that additional two year we could perversely end up with testing of blood sample be refuse so that the accuse could try to get less sentence simply put this bill seek to achieve tidying up of the law enable answer to be gather by the police much more quickly avoid potential evidence become contaminate and give answer to the victim by state in law that once blood sample be take it can be test this seem particularly uncontroversial especially as the most intrusive part of this process the blood sample be take be already legal claire have be so brave and courageous since her daughter pass away and it be testament to her selflessness strength and resilience that in spite of all that have happen she be prepared to fight for justice and ensure that no other family experience the same fate as hers the petition support sharlotte law have have more than signature we have receive the endorsement of lead drink drive charity such as brake scard and the campaign against drink driving as well as the unanimous support of stoke on trent city council staffordshire police fire and crime commissioner ben adams and the sentinel newspaper claire and have meet the lord chancellor and the former roads minister my right hon friend the member for north west durham mr holden to discuss our campaign be pleased last week to meet the current minister the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the hon member for hexham guy opperman who update on the upcoming call for evidence and consultation for victim of drink drive incident this be absolutely vital because victim of these tragic case need to be able to explain how it feel when the law be work against they however have be inform late last year that this process would be start imminently urge the minister to provide specific timeframe for when this will take place victim of drink driving incident need to be prioritise and this can not come soon enough hope that during the process when it come the minister and his official will back claire and in our ambition to put victim first and to change to section of the road traffic act to introduce sharlotte law before conclude would like to take this opportunity to praise the hard work of councillors dave evans and carl edwards as well as the norton green residents association who have relentlessly campaign since this very tragic accident for new measure to slow down traffic along endon road to keep resident safe be extremely proud that this bill have the support of member from across the house this place always work far well when we work together and want to thank my right hon and hon friend who be back this important legislation this law be imperative the trauma and torture of lose love one be impossible to imagine let alone when it then appear that the law be block someone hope for justice want to see this legislation change for sharlotte and other victim of these heinous crime so that when their family friend and community go through untold grief they can have confidence that the legal system will protect and support they not the monster who get behind wheel with no thought for anyone else more than anything claire reynolds who see the murderer who kill her six year old daughter put away for just two year after go through eleven week of pain in not know what put he behind the wheel on that day deserve to see the law change so that no family suffer as

motor industry instance where the secretary of state have make regulation under section of this act and the impact of those regulation on personal datum protection and any significant trend in the collection of personal datum and whether further action be need to regulate the collection of personal datum for sustained public confidence in automate vehicle and the data protection issue that arise it be important that we have this continue monitoring and reporting with new technology it be inevitable that new issue will arise over time particularly as automated vehicle learn and change their behaviour accordingly the reporting be necessary to keep the regulation on datum protection under review as the technology develop the government must give further assurance in the bill that people personal datum will be protect before this bill become law and commit to the annual reporting set out in this new clause this bill would also be strengthen by new clause which would require the secretary of state to consult the information commissioner office before make regulation in relation to the provision of personal datum relevant to automate vehicle as have mention new clause would maintain monitoring of the provision make for datum protection and new clause would make this monitoring and reporting process easier as advice can be take from the ico rather than use parliamentary time again this will instil public confidence in the legislation as the advice will come from an independent body in order to operate automate vehicle must be able to collect datum and much of this datum will be personal the information collect will help to make av safe as the system learn more about the road and those use it strengthen the process of how any change to future protection be make will again assure the public that their personal datum will be secure further assurance would be give by amendment which seek to probe number of concern about data protection and ownership and seek to prevent the authorisation of company as self drive entity unless robust data practice be in place this amendment would ensure that person may not be an authorised self drive entity unless they meet the following requirement they have obtain certificate of compliance with data protection legislation from the information commissioner office for their policy in regard to the handling of personal datum their policy in regard to the handling of personal datum clearly outline who have ownership of any personal datum collect include after the ownership of vehicle have end and they be signatory to an industry code of conduct under the uk general data protection regulation would be very interested with regard to the latter new clause if the hon lady could explain why she feel or what feedback or evidence she have to think that the safety regulation system that be put in place will be inadequate to handle the concern she raise on second reading think be very positive about the bill introduction and see it as the bright new future but we should be careful to ensure we be take people with we as have say this be basically about make sure that people feel confident that their personal datum be really handle in the most secure way possible have table the amendment to provide assurance for the public that the government and everybody involve in this bright new future will really take very careful look at all datum protection measure if may quickly respond give that this bill have have remarkably untroubled passage through both houses to date and that both houses be inform by enormous amount of information from relevant party and member constituent have she any such reason think what she be say be that she have no reason apart from general worry about consent to think that what she be talk about will be necessary because she have no reason to think that the regulator will not be able to take this stuff into account when it come to review we will not push new clause to vote but want the government to ensure that all necessary and possible protection be be put in place this issue have be debate several time but we be look into the future and who know what the future hold we know that people be increasingly worried about their personal datum and that sometimes regulation be not as robust as possible this be basically plea to the government to ensure that all possible assurance be in place there will inevitably be huge overlap between personal and commercial datum with the roll out of automate vehicle personal datum should be ringfence and access restrict so that it can be use only by the relevant party in pseudonymise form we must consider question such as how insurance company will be able to access datum for example could insurance company track someone movement in an av to raise insurance premium if person be regular visitor to hospital or mental health clinic that datum would be attractive for insurance company that be an answer to the question from the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman datum sharing be still not as protect as some may wish and the amendment we have table be there to reassure the public in the absence of such protection different party might be able to share datum in an unregulated way we must ensure that the bill do not lead to the marketisation of people datum be also concerned that the government have not provide adequate protection for disabled people in the bill alongside the provision set out in new clause for continued reporting on datum protection from the minister the establishment of an advisory council as set out in new clause would give disabled people assurance that they must be consult if access issue arise the bill take the first step towards the creation of framework within which automate vehicle can operate new clause and would ensure that strong datum protection be in place from its beginning as say on second reading be otherwise supportive of the bill it be an issue we need to consider for the future and be glad that the government be introduce the bill rise in support of new clause and which be base on measure that we table in committee will also speak to amendment and that stand in my name and those of colleague in plaid cymru but will not detain the house too long as it be clear that there be broad agreement on the wide principle of the bill and the implication of the detail in it notwithstanding the amendment as member of the transport committee it have be clear to for some time that this framework legislation be require by and large the government have do good job with the sector largely content and no real opposition in this place to the vast majority of the okay will change that to decent job the minister be too grateful that say must return to the issue around clause which give the secretary of state power to legislate on devolved matter that may not be the bill intention but the possibility remain concern be grateful to the minister for meet to discuss the problem with clause in the end the meeting come after committee stage have conclude that be disappointing but it be reflection of the wild agreement and consent on all side for the vast majority of the bill result in an extremely swift conclusion to the committee the scottish government and their ministers and official have be engage with the uk government and their ministers and official on at least two occasion to discuss the implication for devolution of clause and the proper remit of both government in committee the minister be forthcoming about discuss matter far with the scottish government and thank he for that believe those discussion have take place it would be helpful if the minister give commitment on the record on the floor of the house that the scottish and welsh governments will be consult fully before the relevant power in clause be use by the secretary of state that be the case would it not make more sense for the government to accept amendment because that be all it seek the fact remain that it would be infinitely preferable to have statutory basis for the change that the uk government propose to make and one that respect and acknowledge the legal framework that exist under devolution in committee the minister maintain the line that the legal advice he and his government have receive indicate that these matter be all reserve but the scottish government be clear that their similar advice indicate that the matter be devolve my amendment would simply reflect the legal position as understand by the scottish government and outline by the cabinet secretary for transport at the scottish parliament net zero energy and transport committee last month she say that thing that relate to offence under devolve legislation and offence that would be part of devolved area these be the area that the provision would allow the uk government to legislate on or make provision for in the future we think it genuine issue of concern in the same session george henry national operation manager for road safety policy and education for transport scotland say will just try to provide an explanation or an example there will be devolve legislation that have be bring in either by road authority or even through the scottish parliament that clause allow the secretary of state to change that be the reason why we be not supportive of that this parliament that be the scottish parliament could make decision to implement measure for good reason such as low emission zone in an area that could potentially be change through clause whether or not that be the intention it give the secretary of state the power to do that hope it be clear to the uk government that this be not an issue of confected conflict something we be often falsely accuse of and there be clearly desire to make the bill work equally however we need it to work for everyone include the devolved administration as highlight in committee if the government objective be to ensure complete alignment between scottish and english traffic law that ship sail long time ago we have different speed limit regime different drink drive law and different approach to road traffic regulation in general wales too have indicate different priority to england by at least initially roll out national mph speed limit clearly there should be consistency across the island where appropriate about the basic framework under which automate vehicle will operate and the devolve administration have work with their uk counterpart to make that happen however that can not be allow to undermine the devolved position with regard to enforcement of the law where the bill will affect devolved law the minister have be forthcoming with include in committee about his commitment to constructive discussion with the devolved administration and welcome that again however with the great of respect for he in around six month we be expect change of government and he will likely no long be there and whatever pledge or commitment have be make can not bind his successor we need commitment in legislation that it would take an act in this place to amend or scrap amendment would ensure that where devolve competence such as those refer to in clause be at stake the devolve parliaments be guarantee their role as the provider or otherwise of legislative consent for this parliament to legislate on their behalf as have be the accept norm for devolve matter under the sewel convention for nearly year amendment would in essence codify the pledge make by the minister in committee about consult the scottish government that be good and wait to hear his response to the debate however believe well solution with respect to devolution be amendment which would require legislative consent motion to be pass by the scottish parliament and indeed the welsh senedd before uk minister could act rather than just consultation do not think that be particularly controversial if there be such disparate view from legal adviser about where the line of devolve power lie surely the uk government as self proclaim champion of devolution would be happy to codify exactly where that line lie and guarantee the scottish government and parliament of whatever political hue the right to determine their own law and regulation around automate vehicle now and in the future will wait to see what representation the minister make in his remark before decide whether to push amendment or to the vote call the shadow minister labour have table four amendment at this stage of proceeding to build on the work in committee the context of the amendment be that the bill follow four year of work by the law commission which include three public consultation and the commission recommendation represent one of the most thorough piece of work that it have ever carry out the bill build on and provide further clarity to the automated and electric vehicles act which originally set out the insurance framework for automate vehicle it be the first piece of legislation to set out an insurance framework for the operation of automate vehicle the transport committee publish report on self drive vehicle in and its recommendation include new legal framework in primary legislation the development of automate vehicle have number of potential benefit and after lose our place as leader in the development of the technology the bill can play its part in recover britain international position and establish one of the most robust framework for av in the world let we remind ourselves of some of the potential benefit automate vehicle could create market worth billion by and new job they have the potential to make road safe include for pedestrian and cyclist by remove the human error that cause of road traffic incident research from the society of motor manufacturers and traders suggest that if automated vehicle be deploy in substantial number life could be save and serious incident prevent up to well road safety also mean significant saving for the nhs research by axa show that in road traffic incident cost the economy billion of which billion be direct cost to the nhs in medical treatment and ambulance service av can improve connectivity in area where our public transport be fail passenger however such an improvement need to be make alongside long overdue improvement in bus service rather than see in isolation well access to transport be important for great many people include in rural area for old people and for disabled people an age uk study find that drive remain the most common form of transport for old people most us state germany and france be move forward with their own av framework so it would be mistake for the uk to fall far behind in an industry that could be worth billion globally by the uk be already run numerous automate vehicle programme include those by wayve oxa and starship let we consider where we be with the legislation in front of we and how we might build on the bill labour four amendment cover the following issue the establishment of an advisory council the accessibility format require of automated vehicle if use as public transport the requirement for the publication of list of datum require to be supply and remove the need for people injure by an automate vehicle to prove that the vehicle be drive itself if they make legal claim for compensation let we start with new clause in committee the minister say multiple time in fact that he be in agreement on the need for proper consultation and he insist that the government will consult properly however there appear to be something of gap between the government state commitment to consultation and what be happen in practice for example government guideline on minimum engagement for av trial do not currently specify that disabled people organisation need to be consult if the minister agree on the importance of consultation why be that not state in the bill if may say so that be remarkably weak criticism as the hon member acknowledge the bill have be develop say this with degree of ownership over considerable period of time with enormous input from involved party it be obviously of direct relevance to old people people with difficulty with mobility and people with disability the suggestion that somehow the government have by implication neglect those constituency be wholly mistaken will give the right hon member credit for his role in get the bill to this stage and he be quite right that the bill largely have strong support on both side of the aisle and across society think it do set the framework but there be concern about it and this be one of they will far set out the evidence base for that but before do turn to the impact of deindustrialisation and its legacy of inequality which have be sow into the fabric of our country the failure to work with trade union mean that the voice of work people be ignore community across the country be still pay the price for the reckless approach take the bill do not address directly the potential impact on job from the introduction of automate vehicle automate vehicle must be use for public good and consideration must include the future of job as much of the detail will be address through secondary legislation it be essential that union and other stakeholder be consult on it not least to ensure job transition will the minister clarify once and for all whether he and the government will commit to consult trade union throughout the roll out of automated vehicle so that we avoid repeat over and over the mistake make in deindustrialisation labour propose council would include wide scope of group include those represent people with disability pedestrian cyclist emergency service road safety expert highway authority public transport service manufacturer driver and insurance provider turn to the comment of the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman transport for all have highlight that there be still no requirement in the bill for disabled people to be consult or involve in develop the legislation which be crucial because of how much of the detail will be finalise in secondary legislation it have warn that if disabled people be not consult before this become statute inaccessibility could be become weave into the fabric of this new mode of transport before it even hit the road what discussion have the minister have with transport for all to address those concern how do he propose combat the risk that it have outline the approach to new clause be consistent with the approach that we have suggest in new clause new clause mirror the provision in the equality act on provide information in accessible format to bus passenger and apply they to automate passenger service bring the bill into line with the bus services act the question for the minister be if there be such provision in the bus services act why be there not in the bill the point about consultation with disability group apply to new clause and the law commission report repeatedly stress the importance of co production with disabled people and recommend that an accessibility advisory council be establish it seem odd that the government accept many part of the law commission report but not that one turn to new clause and datum sharing in committee the minister recognise the significance of the availability of datum to investigator and insurance company how do he plan to ensure that availability if there be no requirement for datum sharing in the bill that be concern for the industry he say that safety datum will be collect by the vehicle monitor by the operator and scrutinise by the government will he explain how that approach will address the intricacy of insurance access and dispute resolution how will the approach avoid dispute between vehicle operator and manufacturer the minister response to the committee be limit to the subject of share datum about safety concern however for the successful growth of this emerge market competitive market condition be need so in vehicle datum can not be restrict to vehicle manufacturer or withhold in real time from other market player that be recognise by the competition and markets authority in the guidance on motor vehicle agreement publish in june to accompany the competition act motor vehicle agreements block exemption order the guidance state in particular the advent of connected vehicle place supplier of motor vehicle in privileged position enable they to access and use vehicle information in way which may restrict competition between they include their authorised networks and independent operator the bill intend to allow the uk to be world leader in automate vehicle however our international competitor be make stride ahead of the uk they be hold comprehensive consultation to prevent anti competitive practice by vehicle manufacturer and undertake ongoing policy development for example the eu have extensively consult on this broad issue in address the regulation of datum under the propose eu data act could the minister therefore address the concern outline in new clause on new clause victim involve in collision with an automate vehicle currently have to prove whether the vehicle be in self drive mode at the point of collision could the minister explain how we can guarantee that victim will be compensate when the burden of proof be always on the claimant in legal claim and neither the bill nor the automated and electric vehicles act change that could he provide absolute clarity on whether that be the case if it be how will costly and lengthy legal dispute over insurance be avoid our four new clause and amendment be design to clarify matter and build on the framework of the bill which we support look forward to the minister response to my question thank the opposition party for their broadly positive approach throughout second reading and committee there be clear consensus across the house that we should embrace this new technology give all the opportunity set out by the hon member for sefton central bill esterson also thank my predecessor my right hon friend the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman as have be mention he help steer the legislation through this place and clearly still have great interest in the bill which welcome will be brief all the new clause and amendment apart from one be raise in identical form in committee and my comment will not change much from what say then by and large we agree with their various objective but we do not think they be necessary and in couple of case we think they be inappropriate on new clause and datum protection be clearly very important and the government support it but the new clause largely duplicate measure that be already in the bill or in other legislation this government take protection of personal datum very seriously it be an important issue and require careful consideration the bill do not seek to replace or change personal datum protection legislation nor do it enable that legislation to be contravene it be not bill about data protection any change to data protection legislation be beyond the scope of the bill it be the role of the information commissioner office to regulate data protection issue the ico have an obligation to report annually to parliament on the commissioner activity any report by the department for transport such as that require by new clause would risk duplicate that work also the department for transport be not the data controller of information collect by regulated body which mean that reporting would be inappropriate the purpose of the bill be to create comprehensive and effective safety framework for self drive vehicle information may need to be share to achieve that public safety and security must come first any regulation make under the power in the bill that permit further sharing or use of information would be develop in discussion with stakeholder and subject to consultation and would be lay before the house before come into force that provide multiple opportunity for input into and scrutiny of proposal regulation will also be subject to data protection impact assessment the secretary of state already have duty under article of the general data protection regulation to consult the ico on proposal for legislative measure new clause therefore duplicate requirement already in law new clause be unnecessary because all information relate regulation make under the power in the bill will already be subject to consultation under the requirement of clause clause specifically require that regulation that require information to be share by an authorised self drive entity or license operator must specify the purpose for which that datum be to be share it would be unnecessary and onerous to duplicate those publication and consultation requirement turn to amendment the protection of personal datum will be consider alongside the detailed development of authorisation requirement these requirement will be set out in secondary legislation and will be subject to consultation and impact assessment the amendment would place an additional burden on industry over and above what be require under exist datum protection legislation such as the legislation that cover the datum in our mobile phone at present certificate of compliance be not mandatory under gdpr in addition the scheme refer to in the amendment be industry lead and therefore not within the control of government so there be risk that they would not achieve the intend result on new clause the hon member for sefton central talk at length about the inadequacy of government consultation as my right hon friend the member for hereford and south herefordshire say there have be incredibly extensive consultation throughout this process have count five different way in which we will ensure consultation and engagement the law commissions of england wales and scotland have be look at the issue for four year and have be consult throughout the secretary of state for transport who have join we in the chamber and hold roundtable with whole range of road user group include group represent disabled people about the impact of the legislation will also meet disabled group once the legislation move through this house to consider some of the issue we recognise that engagement with all group include the devolved administrations be incredibly important the bill will provide new power relate to technical safety requirement which will be set out in statutory guidance and secondary regulation there will be consultation on those requirement with stakeholder include but not limit to the stakeholder identify clause follow the passage of the bill through the house of lords we have include statutory requirement to consult the three group with the most direct interest when develop the statement of safety principle road safety group road user group and the self drive vehicle industry that be not comprehensive list of those likely to be consult but it show the breadth of the consultation once in place the safety requirement for authorisation licensing and in use regulation will be monitor and enforce by the department for transport and its motoring agency on behalf of the secretary of state in line with all public body the department and its agency will be subject to scrutiny in addition there be an expert advisory panel on the department self drive vehicle safety assurance work which have be consult it provide advice and challenge the panel include representative from industry academia and road safety group we have give non statutory commitment to set up an accessibility advisory panel the bill establish new independent no blame incident investigation capability which will ensure that we learn effectively from incident that involve self drive vehicle finally the hon member for sefton central will be reassure to learn that clause already create general monitoring duty that require the secretary of state to publish an annual report on the performance of self drive vehicle hope that all those engagement that have make demonstrate that the government share the hon member view that scrutiny of implementation and learning from experience be vital all those future engagement be there which be why new clause be not necessary on new clause accessibility be an incredibly important issue have make it clear as have the secretary of state that accessibility be one of the strong argument for legislate for self drive car for many disabled people particularly partially sighted or blind people self drive car could have an incredible impact on their quality of life thank the hon member for sefton central for the new clause but it replicate power hold by the secretary of state on the provision of accessible travel information about bus to automate passenger service automate passenger service provide great opportunity to make travel more accessible and inclusive under the bill we already have the power to mandate that information be provide to user in accessible format through the permit condition that be more flexible tool than the regulation condition attach to individual permit can be adapt to fit wide variety of service some service may have alternative to the provision of accessible format information for example there may be member of staff in vehicle who can focus entirely on help passenger and provide that information in addition the bill expressly require the appropriate national authority to consider accessibility in decision to grant permit that ensure that accessibility consideration be build into service from the start it enable innovation to come forward in this nascent sector and operator to consider the good way for their service to be accessible and inclusive finally licensing and franchising authority will also be able to steer requirement about accessible information format they can champion local need through their role in provide consent for grant permit as result we do not think that new clause be necessary new clause extend insurer first instance liability for incident involve automated vehicle to all circumstance even when an individual be drive the compulsory insurance regime in the automated and electric vehicles act be create to ensure that victim of incident cause by automate vehicle receive prompt compensation the bill amend the act to ensure it apply to authorise automate vehicle however there be no change to the principle that insurer first instance liability apply only when the self drive feature be switch on new clause would create an unnecessary discrepancy in insurer liability for manual driving depend on whether the vehicle have self drive feature or not therefore ask the hon member for sefton central to withdraw new clause on the snp amendment relate to clause we consider that the user in charge immunity be reserved matter indeed the immunity will predominantly affect the application of reserved traffic offence as the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands recognise there be limited range of devolve legislation in this area and immunity will have only minor incidental impact on the bill we do meet to talk about it and we discuss it in committee but just to make it absolutely clear this be not about what the traffic regulation be in scotland what the speed limit be whether it be an offence to break the speed limit or drive in bus lane it be about whether liability rest on the driver or on the software company asde in self drive car it therefore have no impact on direct legislation in scotland more generally public understanding and confidence will be key to realise the benefit of self drive vehicle it be vital that we have clarity and consistency across great britain about how these vehicle can be use and what individual responsibility be this be the first recommendation by the scottish law commission and the law commission of england and wales in their joint report they state that they do not think the public would be able to understand different or partial immunity base on distinction between devolved and reserved law the power in clause be necessary to ensure clarity and consistency in the immunity application as the hon member acknowledge meet he and the cabinet secretary for transport in the scottish government to talk about that send letter of assurance afterwards and repeat what mention in that letter assure he that where we propose to use the regulation make power in clause we will always consult with the scottish government and with other devolved administration understand that the hon member for bath wera hobhouse wish to withdraw new clause be that correct beg to ask leave to withdraw the clause clause by leave withdraw clause fee amendments make page line after state insert or by traffic commissioner this amendment

be go to say number of thing but the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for south cambridgeshire anthony browne cover they in his response will resist the temptation which be not often resist to repeat they all will do by way of my remark be say few thank yous we be debate bill to have self drive vehicle but since we have not yet reach the point where we have self drive bills want to thank my hon friend the minister for his work in steer the bill not just on report today but through committee thank the chairs and the member of the public bill committee for their work both in committee and in take evidence also want to thank hon member on both side of the house even where there be difference on some of the detail for their overall support for the bill the bill be

have safe road with technology which will contribute to an improvement in road safety and continue britain leadership in that position be grateful for the support of colleague and hope the bill will

for the way he have engage with all member who take part in committee and the other stage add my thank on the record to the clerks the law commission those who submit write evidence and the minister for his response through letter after the committee stage agree on the benefit of improve road safety and the potential economic opportunity that the introduction of automate vehicle provide we look forward to the rest of the transport legislation come forward in however many week the current government may have on scooter bike and minimum standard for taxi in the transport bill that they previously promise but today we can agree that the bill should get its third reading and be grateful to all who take part in its consideration thank the clerks the chairs the member of the public bill committee and all those who submit evidence to it as the hon member for sefton central bill esterson say the engagement by the minister have be excellent will be keep close eye on the minister and

hear from laughter may say that very far from the sentiment just express the secretary of state have be very strong friend to the bill from the very beginning have steer the bill until the point where the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for south cambridgeshire anthony browne take over as he note pay tribute as he have to the quality of the work do by official at the department for transport and the bill team remind the house that this be an extraordinary moment we have take the next step in pioneer technology as single polity in advance of anywhere else it build on the work do in and presage very important safe and in many respect in transport term more prosperous future add my thank to everybody who work so hard to bring the bill forward as have say before the liberal democrats have be very supportive this be brave new world and assume that as we go along explore the new technology we will keep very close eye on the data protection issue that raise this be not the end of the road it be the beginning but it be an exciting beginning question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass business without debate immigration motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the draft immigration leave to enter and remain amendment order which be lay before this house on march be gagan mohindra question agree to rise to present petition on behalf of my constituent and commend the work of my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson the petition state the petition of resident of the constituency of neath declare that people who receive infected blood and who have suffer as consequence have along with their family wait far too long for redress the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to implement the recommendation in the second interim report of the infected blood inquiry without delay and the petitioner remain etc uk trade aviation motion make and question propose that this house do now holmes thank mr speaker for grant this debate on the importance of aviation to uk trade and to the future of our nation economy more generally let start by declare my interest as the founder and current chair of the all party parliamentary group for the future of aviation believe that aviation be strategic enabler of the kind of export lead high growth economy that member on both side of the house want to see research be prepare by manchester airports group and wpi economics of which have be give advance sight show not only the potential for the uk to become service sector superpower but the way in which we as an island trading nation be disproportionately reliant on aviation in comparison with similar economy my argument this afternoon be that we should recognise that the uk aviation network the third large in the world be vital asset and key component in the economy that we be seek to build far and that we therefore need the right kind of supportive policy environment to help it to flourish that include lean into the benefit and opportunity on offer from decarbonise aviation for the sake of environmental protection go fast and far than other country precisely because of how much we have to gain economically from the sector include the great british export business that rely on aviation for their own success figure publish recently by the office for national statistics show real term growth in the export of service in the year to the end of as for good the uk air freight contribution across all sector of the economy be more than billion against that backdrop and give that the uk be already the second large exporter of service after the united states respected think tank such as the resolution foundation be say that the path to transformative economic growth for the country lie in its become service sector superpower and strike up new service trade agreement with country such as singapore japan and australia the world bank recently conduct survey in which it look at the future of world trade it say that service be the area in which trade be mostly likely to grow and that britain be very well place to take advantage of that especially in the light of all the trade deal that we be do my hon friend be entirely right the united kingdom have strong record of be service economy and we could go still far now that we have leave the european union and be realise those trade deal both trans pacific and involve other part of the globe the uk should be sell more high value service in area such as banking and architecture in which we have competitive advantage to boost productivity and tax revenue and raise the trend rate of growth in the light of that manchester airports group have commission wpi economics to study the export growth potential of key sector such as technology and financial and professional service in which as my hon friend have just point out we clearly have great strength give the uk status as an island trading nation and our distance from some of the key export market that we need to target the research be also explore the importance of aviation and international connectivity to the growth and trade prospect of british business in those sector the research finding will be publish later this month and its publication will be mark by an event here in parliament but be pleased to be able to share few of the key headline with the house today the sector in the economy that be most reliant on air travel from real estate to finance and insurance create or induce some trillion of gross value add or economic contribution for the united kingdom key growth sector of vital importance to the economy and reliant on air travel such as financial service creative industry and real estate be project to grow by and respectively in the period to in the uk be rank fourth out of country in the global innovation index and the researcher have find that innovation and international connectivity be positively correlate if the uk want to grow an innovation base economy with concentration of knowledge intensive industry it must maintain and grow its direct connection with the outside world the uk have be rank fourth in the global knowledge index the global economy would lose almost of gdp be the uk not to send business traveller abroad and in respect of the total value of export add more than billion to the british economy and support hundred of thousand of uk business have more direct flight from the uk region to international destination could help to boost investment trade tourism and education opportunity as local business seek to leverage the additional connectivity at their disposal in the north of england for example that could play supportive role in the government level up policy as for london and south east england gatwick airport northern runway proposal would support more long haul service enable increase volume of cargo and service trade to and from key destination such as north america the middle east and asia london heathrow airport account for more than billion in uk trade pass through in deliver positive trade balance of more than billion business in these sector have be interview and have set out the role that international connectivity play and will continue to play across range of key activity secure investment clinch deal building maintain and inspect global supply chain and promote knowledge transfer if we accept that business travel and healthy grow aviation sector be precondition for the type of service lead economic growth that expert say the country should be go after we need to be clear eyed about the no strategic challenge that it face namely the achievement of net zero in carbon emission by that be the government ambition as the uk be disproportionately reliant on aviation to support growth give its status as an island nation we should lean into the economic benefit available from its decarbonisation go far and fast than other country the key technology to decarbonise aviation in the medium term be saf or sustainable aviation fuel which can reduce lifecycle emission by in comparison with conventional jet fuel the choice for this country be between import saf from other country to decarbonise uk aviation and reach net zero by and invest in our own domestic sector which provide secure home grow supply of low carbon jet fuel to build resilience into the economy and generate thousand of skilled job in the process if we end up import saf we will be at the mercy of volatile international energy market and in the event of global scarcity of supply it will push up airfare which in turn will push up the cost of do business for precisely those company identify in the research refer to company that uk business need to be travel and export more to grow our economy it have to be say that last week the government make very positive announcement about measure concern saf first they be enshrine sustainable aviation fuel mandate which mean that of all jet fuel need to come from low carbon fuel by secondly they be consult on revenue certainty mechanism which could help to incentivise and encourage the building of saf plant and infrastructure here in the uk however wide package of policy support be need to create the right environment for this industry to take off and for the uk to become global leader for example the department for environment food and rural affairs waste hierarchy need to be amend to secure domestic or black bin as viable feedstock or input into make sustainable aviation fuel use household waste to make green jet fuel be not just important because of the way it protect and help to sustain strategic enabler in aviation research from transport sustainability expert icf show that use such waste to make saf instead of its current use in incineration to produce electricity would help cut uk carbon emission too indeed the reduction in carbon emission would be at least five time great not least because nearly half of all electricity in the uk already come from renewable source again thank to the great stride that have be make over the last decade by this government cross departmental plan be need across whitehall to recognise aviation role in our make up as an island trading nation and in the type of economy we need to grow to become even more competitive my suggestion to the minister be that the department for business and trade have critical role to play in this plan because of the sector role in underpin the success of service export on which this country future prosperity rely the uk do not have to choose between grow our economy through international travel or travel less and protect our environment by innovate and be global leader in new sustainable aviation fuel technology we can increase our service and good sector and be at the forefront of new green technology we have some iconic british brand that have already demonstrate this last november experience the first transatlantic flight to use sustainable aviation fuel when virgin atlantic headquarter in my constituency fly from london heathrow to john kennedy airport in new york power by rolls royce trent engine use sustainable aviation fuel believe that we should be optimistic about our future economy and our environmental protection with britain global leader in both may pay tribute to my hon friend he have be an extremely persistent advocate of the aerospace industry and gatwick in all the year have serve with he in parliament be sure that if after he retire he go through all the meeting in his diary that he have about aviation his life will whizz past he because he not only always stand up for the industry but think very carefully about where it need to go if it be to continue its success grow and deliver the prosperity that our country need agree with my hon friend that have go through covid many of we wonder whether the aviation industry would bounce back as quickly as it have do notice that heathrow say the other day that it be busy than it have ever be the last time go to gatwick get the same impression it really be back on four cylinder now we be very good at aviation it be probably one of the legacy of the second world war when large amount of our gdp go into fighter bomber and technology post war we have always punch above our weight in aviation be surprise the other day when see some figure from the treasury that show that half of all airliner sell across the world in an average year have wing make in wales of course airbus have half the world market they be very good wing and they provide some very good job we still have rolls royce punch above its weight and produce innovative engine many of which be design to run on new fuel it mean that the company be go to be major player in future year do not think we will ever have hub airport in the same way that other do have one observation for the department for business and trade some of the express railway to our airport go very slowly and more investment in the link between central london and the airport would help the sector substantially there be great opportunity there we have some really good airport circle london and we have some very good regional airport include manchester and other we have bournemouth airport in hurn which be in the local authority of bournemouth christchurch and poole all the airport generate lot of job and opportunity and there be world of great competition out there many other country be put in runway and terminal they see the advantage of invest in aviation and we have to keep up with they and continue to punch above our weight thank my hon friend for what he have do for aviation look forward to hear what the minister be go to say in response thank my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith for introduce this debate and for his work in establish and lead the all party parliamentary group for the future of aviation be glad to hear he refer to the report by manchester airports group and wpi economics which have do some important research wish they well for the launch of their report my hon friend give an excellent speech and he be right on so many count the air transport sector be critical to the uk success as trading nation its speed and efficiency give our exporter the edge and connect this country to the world enable the face to face meeting that be the lifeblood of our world lead service sector as my hon friend the member for poole sir robert syms rightly highlight entirely agree that the government must keep strive to ensure that this vital sector thrive and continue to act as an enabler of global trade as my hon friend the member for crawley point out the world be change fast to succeed tomorrow the uk aviation industry need the right fundamental in place today that be why my colleague at the department for transport have develop flightpath to the future which be the government point plan to ensure that the uk continue to develop aviation as part of our critical national infrastructure it be our blueprint to make sure that we have the skill technology and infrastructure to deliver for aviation over the next year it will ensure that the uk maximise the benefit of aviation deliver economic growth increase trade and improved service for business and passenger also highlight that aerospace as major export be in its own right integral to the uk achievement as trading nation as my hon friend rightly say it add some billion year to our economy and employ over people across the country factory in north wales bristol derby prestwick and belfast deliver critical component for the world airliner and air freighter almost every aircraft that hon member have fly on relie on british engineering always find it inspire that roughly half the wing of all new commercial airliner be make in the uk and that third of global aircraft seat be make in northern ireland here again we be strive to ensure that we keep our leading edge and seize the advantage of jet zero future which my hon friend have so rightly highlight that be why the government and industry together have create the aerospace technology institute and the ati programme deliver long term and predictable funding that allow industry lead mid stage project to get off the ground the ati objective be simple grow the uk share of the global aerospace market while reduce aviation emission the result have be nothing short of transformative consequently the uk aerospace industry productivity have soar thank to the ati co investment alongside industry the uk be lead the airbus wing of tomorrow programme explore radical new approach to aircraft wing manufacture and design we be also power ahead in the field of engine manufacture with the world most efficient jet engine the rolls royce ultrafan on the horizon the ati have support over project worth billion since it be found help some incredible innovation develop by industry disruptor to take flight and attract foreign investor to these shore include boeing and safran give these achievement it be only right that we continue to strengthen the uk position in the global aerospace manufacturing sector and in the government most recent autumn statement we extend the ati programme budget for further five year in addition our jet zero strategy set out our plan for achieve net zero aviation by it include the new aircraft technology develop in partnership by industry and the ati programme there be clearly bright future ahead last year we get glimpse of this promise as my hon friend mention he get more than glimpse when the first net zero flight cross the atlantic power by rolls royce engine and use sustainable aviation fuel turn next to airport the beat heart of the uk trading economy already the uk and therefore its business boast the third large aviation network in the world after the usa and china as my hon friend know gatwick continue to demonstrate incredible innovation with its exist asset with the busy and most efficient single runway in the world know that there have be various proposal over the year to construct another runway at gatwick and understand that department for transport ministers will be look carefully at the late proposal all our airport be support by our world lead supply chain which be at the forefront of digital innovation and sustainable technology when it come to develop airport ready for the future for example nats the uk air navigation service provider lead the way in provide next generation solution to enhance airport capacity and performance reassure my hon friend that my department fully recognise the importance of airport in underpin the connectivity that be so vital to trade we will continue to work closely with other departments particularly the department for transport and airport stakeholder to encourage investment into the sector while support our supply chain to export their expertise to the world also commend to the house our recent future of flight action plan which provide strategic plan to deliver the economic environmental and social benefit that could be unlock by exciting technology such as drone and electric vertical take off and land aircraft want to thank my hon friend again for his work as passionate advocate for the aviation sector reiterate my thank to he for provide this opportunity to celebrate the achievement of aerospace and aviation in the uk and to discuss how this government can even well support the sector and our exporter the government have clear vision for the future of aviation in the uk we see it as critical enabler of trade long into the future allow community across the country to benefit from the prosperity it bring from crawley to havant from poole to uxbridge via the hamble valley and across the entire united kingdom the future of aviation be bright thank my hon friend for his leadership in this sector question put and agree to house adjourn
