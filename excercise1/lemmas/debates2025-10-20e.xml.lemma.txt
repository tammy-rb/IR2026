ehcp or local authority funding but would historically have benefit from independent education provision because of their send need one of their concern be that such provision can no long be afford

nursery such as these be essential for provide the high quality place we need and crucially for tackle early childhood inequality and close the attainment gap before child start school do agree with

alone with more to come next september encourage member across the house to get their local school to apply for phase grant as the minister have say nursery be an important part of the childcare

provision like this be accessible to family in my constituency and beyond absolutely thank the brilliant team at mousehold who be so dedicated to give every child the help and support they need this government want every child to have the good start in life which be why we have expand childcare entitlement be support school to open new nursery and after the conservative party dismantle they be bring back family hub in every community in our country my constituent seb tell how pleased he be when the government extend the role of free childcare but his nursery change the rule so that the free hour can be take only after and have to be spread over four day week that mean that the previously pay for care be not now free but cost more than before we know that this be happen across the country as nursery struggle with the job tax and other excessive cost so what be the government go to do to help those family get what they be entitle to encourage the hon lady to write to with the detail of that case because we be absolutely clear that in this rapid expansion of childcare which half million child have be able to access this september those hour should be available and it should not be the case that extras be charge or anything else be happy to look at the specific of the case the minister be new to the dispatch box so perhaps we can forgive she for suggest that the conservatives cut the number of family hub since we invent they focus on the issue of cost and move away from primary school private provider be find that the job tax and other hit be make it more and more difficult to pay the bill and ensure that that entitlement which we all want to see give to parent be deliver can invite the hon lady to give any reflection from her early day as minister on how we can deliver that can she reach out to those in the treasury and elsewhere to make they understand the ecosystem in which those provider sit sure start be one of the great success of the last labour government and it drive significant improvement for our child the conservative party systematically dismantle that across our country with significant negative consequence for our child and young people when this government say that we be prioritise early year we be put our money where our mouth be unlike the conservatives who have pledge with absolutely no plan with billion this year and billion next year to expand childcare and give every child the good start in life topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility the launch of labour good start in life campaign last week mark watershed moment the conservatives slash family service leave child and family across our country without support but labour be build back that support revive sure start for new generation it be more than just the best start advert that people have see on the telly and hear on the radio it be brick and mortar too from derbyshire to darlington and from staffordshire to swindon labour be give local authority the funding they need to open best start family hub so that community service be truly nationwide once again labour demand the good start in life for child grow up in our country that be how we will get record share of child school ready that be the difference that labour government make declare that use to work as university lecturer before be elect one of my constituent have already pay nearly for their french visa just to be able to undertake their year abroad as part of their degree these cost will exclude student from disadvantaged background from vital international opportunity will the secretary of state meet to discuss the excessive visa cost face by british student undertake international placement if the hon lady would be so kind as to

disappointed that this case will not be hear in court have hear the strength of feel right across the house and share member concern about the threat we face from espionage the witness statement

various threat pose by the chinese state to the uk and he do so in order to try to support successful prosecution this urgent question ask about the involvement of the home office follow the charge decision make in early under the previous government the crown prosecution service advise the witness that he could not share the evidence with other in government the home office involvement follow the charge decision that be take under the previous government be therefore heavily restrict to avoid breach the cps requirement listen to that order do not need any help from the government front bench this be very important statement that really do affect member of this house as have repeatedly make clear in this house ministers and special adviser be not involve in any aspect of the production of the evidence and stand by that statement today the prime minister have also make clear that he be inform of the cps decision only matter of day before the case collapse there be nothing that the prime minister or any other minister could have do at that point that would have change the law and the policy under the previous government between and those who have read the dnsa statement will know that they clearly articulate the threat pose by china base on the previous government policy at the time detail the damage cause by the allege offence ultimately it be an entirely independent decision by the cps to discontinue the case and the cps have confirm that it come under no outside pressure to do so like member from all part of the house remain very frustrated that this case will not be hear in court we want to see the trial go ahead have make it clear on many occasion that the decision not to proceed be an independent decision by the crown prosecution service and the director of public prosecutions have give assurance that there be no government interference in that decision note that the joint committee on the national security strategy will be undertake an inquiry on the case and intend to hold public evidence session the intelligence and security committee have also indicate that it will investigate we welcome the launch of the inquiry and the investigation with which the government will of course fully co operate have already set out the range of activity that this government be take to combat the chinese espionage threat and hope that that be well understand let also provide the house with the reassurance that the government will take all necessary action to keep the uk safe and secure call the shadow home secretary last wednesday the prime minister tell this house that no minister or special adviser be involve in the handling of the china spy case yet the sunday times have since report that the home secretary have hear that the case might collapse and have make representation to ensure the evidence put forward be as strong as possible so ask the minister when do the home secretary become aware that the case might collapse and what representation do she or her proxy make about the evidence and to whom why have the house be tell include just now that ministers and adviser be not involve in any way when the sunday times report that they be the sunday times also report on key meeting that take place on september meeting that the government originally deny take place be it true that jonathan powell chair that meeting do that meeting discuss the cps view that the evidence provide to that point be inadequate and the possibility of provide further evidence in the case will the minister agree to publish the minute of all meeting in which this case be discuss and the correspondence relate to it the sunday times report that follow the meeting the attorney general office be ask to speak to the cps do anyone from the ago speak directly or indirectly to the cps after that meeting can the minister confirm that dan chugg from the foreign office be at the september meeting and that it be the same dan chugg who approach the lord speaker with propose deal in which the chinese ambassador would be allow back into parliament the sunday times also report that the dnsa be understand to have acknowledge privately that the decision not to say that china be an ongoing threat be political in nature be that true finally the current government position have be that all the evidence provide relate to the previous government policy but we now know that that be categorically not true in paragraph of matt collins third statement from august this year which he copy and paste from the labour manifesto he stress the importance the current government attach to positive relationship with china weaken the evidence compare with and bring in current government policy contrary to what we have be tell in recent week why have the government be provide this house with inaccurate information and why do minister know what the cps want but refuse to give it to the cps with great respect lot of what have just be say do not actually relate to the urgent question that be initially ask by the shadow home secretary have to say the opposition position be confusing they initially criticise the government for intervene will answer the question be answer it think it be important that on these matter of national security we try to debate thing in reasonable and sensible way that be the approach that this government will seek to take if members order think we have have enough thank you mr speaker the opposition position be confusing they initially criticise the government for intervene then when it become absolutely clear that we have not do that they criticise we for not intervene they ask for great transparency then when we provide it they accuse the government wrongly of hang people out to dry give that this urgent question relate to the activity of the home office be not at all clear why the shadow home secretary think it be appropriate give accusation that have be make previously about hang official out to dry to name an official in the foreign commonwealth and development office how do that relate to the urgent question that be ask interruption order think need to help little bit it be in order to mention another department you can not ringfence this and not refer to other people it might not be comfortable but the fact be that question have be ask that be within order and that be what matter be grateful for your guidance mr speaker be simply point out to the shadow home secretary that conservative members have previously criticise ministers and the government for to use their word hang official out to dry and now the shadow home secretary have just name twice an official from the foreign commonwealth and development office interruption order have say to the government front bench that do not need any chipping in certainly do not need it from all along the opposition front bench do wonder whether at any point the shadow home secretary and certain conservative members not all but certain member have consider the need to have some humility and acknowledge their part in this these activity take place on their watch when they be in government and under the legislation of the time do just read that out answer the question order mr philp you have have the benefit of an urgent question have have the benefit some might say of listen to you so want you to have the benefit of listen to the minister the shadow home secretary would be well advise to listen to the point be make be seek to respond to the question that he and other right hon and hon member have raise be try to do that in good faith and would be grateful for the opportunity to do so remind the shadow home secretary that we be here today only because the previous conservative government do not move quickly enough to fix the glare hole that exist in our national security law the charge in this case as hope be well know be bring under the official secrets act this antiquated legislation be draw up before the first world war and the conservatives begin review it in because it be widely know that it be not fit for purpose but it take eight year for they to introduce the national security act fortunately the law have now be update with cross party support but not in time to protect our parliament from chinese espionage if the conservatives have act more quickly and the national security act have be in place when these allege offence happen the prosecution would likely have proceed interruption order look be try really hard people who hold position should know well let make this point crystal clear no member of this government nor any special adviser be in any way involve in the evidence submit to the cps or the decision by the dpp not to proceed with the case there be an important omission from the shadow home secretary remark as hon member will know the first substantive witness statement be provide under the previous government when the right hon member be home office minister yet neither he nor the leader of the opposition have take the opportunity to say what involvement conservative ministers and conservative special adviser have in the main tranche of the evidence the prime minister have confirm that no labour ministers or special adviser be involve with the provision of evidence for the case last wednesday during prime minister question the prime minister ask the leader of the opposition to confirm whether that be also the case under the previous government be in the house last wednesday and think that hear the leader of the opposition confirm from sedentary position that she do know the answer to that question but the conservative party have refuse to confirm if any conservative ministers or special adviser be involve in the provision of evidence under the previous government wonder if any of the former ministers in the chamber can provide the answer as ministers have repeatedly say from the dispatch box the government be extremely disappointed that the case do not proceed to trial gently say to opposition front bench members that they need to stop throw mud and start come to term with what happen on their watch the chair of the home affairs committee the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley and other relevant select committee chairs include have meet the director of public prosecutions and send he detailed series of follow up question the chair of the joint committee on the national security strategy my hon friend the member for warwick and leamington matt western have convene an inquiry and be likely to call number of relevant witness include government ministers the minister mention that the isc will be look at this matter can he assure the house that the government will co operate fully with those inquiry and response and that that be the good way to take these matter forward in thorough and timely fashion be grateful to my hon friend for his question and for the role he have play in these proceeding yes give he the absolute assurance he seek there be an important role for the house to play in look carefully at precisely what have go on that be why on behalf of the government very much welcome the work that will now be do by the jcnss and the isc both those important committees have an important role and be sure that hon member across the house will want to make other contribution as part of that process call the liberal democrat spokesperson what mess we have three question for the minister first what conversation have he have with all relevant parliamentary authority that might include the speaker office about plan to tighten vetting or ongoing monitoring of researcher and staff to ensure this do not happen again secondly in the witness statement release by this government there be reference to the use by the previous government of back channel to attempt to dissuade the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat and the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns from raise concern about confucius institute what be the minister understanding base on the evidence statement and any other information available of the meaning of back channel in that context do it refer to the previous government whips office government official or somebody else thirdly give that the prime minister spokesperson still refuse today to say that china be threat to britain national security would the minister be comfortable with labour mps accept meeting request from representative of the chinese communist party or any nation ally to china be genuinely grateful to the hon member for the point he have raise let take they in turn lead on behalf of the government on vetting and lot of work have take place in government since we come into office to ensure that the system and process that underpin our vetting be fit for purpose the hon gentleman be right to ask about it although it might seem like reasonably niche point it be an important one because our national security be underpin by our ability to vet those who have access to privileged information he for reason that completely understand make reference to link between the work that we be do in government and the importance of ensure that the appropriate vetting procedure be in place for this house know he will understand that fundamentally that will be matter for the speaker and for this house but can give he an absolute assurance that we will work closely with mr speaker the deputy speakers and all those in this place to ensure that we look carefully at what happen and satisfy ourselves that the vetting arrangement be absolutely fit for purpose the hon gentleman second point relate specifically to two member of this house do not believe that either of those two member be in their place today be keen to meet they and work closely with they and to ensure that the government be provide the support that they may want or require be happy to speak to the hon gentleman and to those member about the point that he have make with regard to the hon gentleman final point which be specifically about china hope he will acknowledge that the government have be crystal clear about our position with regard to right hon and hon member may chuckle but we have have this debate previously if there be member who think that the nature of our relationship with china can be define by single word then do not believe that they be serious about the nature of the relationship all member in this house have an absolute responsibility to decide for themselves what meeting they take with great respect to the hon gentleman do not believe that it be for minister to opine from the dispatch box about whether individual member should take meeting or not personally be very clear that china remain an active persistent and everyday threat to our country and have do so for many year in the light of this what step be the minister take on behalf of the government to ensure that parliamentarian across this house be much well protect in the year to come from the kind of foreign interference that we see regularly unfortunately on the last government watch be grateful to my hon friend not only for his question but for his previous service and for the work of his constituent with regard to underpin our national security he make an important point he will know as will you madam deputy speaker that the national protective security authority recently publish guidance design specifically to provide hon member with advice and guidance to ensure that they be well able to deal with the risk and threat that all of we in this house face on the second part of my hon friend question that be something that the government take incredibly seriously we inherit the defend democracy taskforce from the previous government that be good institution and have on many occasion pay tribute to all those conservatives members who be involve in set it up the prime minister have renew the mandate of the defend democracy taskforce it be the fulcrum point across government that bring the different departments and law enforcement together alongside member of this house to ensure that we be do everything that we can to address and tackle the threat that we face have always believe and maintain that that should be share endeavour right across this house and my door will always be open to member of the house who would like to discuss it rather think that in civilised country whether or not someone be prosecute depend on the evidence be it therefore wise for the witness statement to replicate word for word the word of the labour party manifesto and have it ever happen before always appreciate the leader of the house member father of the house forgive always appreciate the father of the house question because he bring long stand wisdom and perspective to these matter hope he will understand that in line with the point that he make about civility it be not for minister to critique the decision that be make by the cps the government have make it clear to the house on many occasion that this be an independent decision that be take by the cps and the dpp have be clear about the fact that no special adviser and no minister interfere in that process mr speaker share your frustration at the collapse of the case two question remain top of mind for member of the house and for people in my constituency first what be the minister assessment of the risk of spy on mps in this house secondly what be his assessment of the ongoing transnational repression of british national overseas passport holder in milton keynes and elsewhere across the country do it not show pattern of chinese government activity right across the uk which be risk to we my hon friend be absolutely right to raise her concern in the way that she do hope that she understand as the house do that this government have be absolutely clear that no interference in our democratic process be remotely acceptable and that there be no circumstance under which we will tolerate country wherever they may be seek to cause harm to anybody who be resident in the united kingdom she specifically mention transnational repression that be something that the government take incredibly seriously and we have do lot of work on it through the defend democracy taskforce let say again to she and to the house that it be completely unacceptable that china or any other country should seek to harm anybody who live here in the united kingdom first of all thank the minister for what he say about co operation with the work of the intelligence and security committee on this matter agree with he as often do that the government be entitle to clarity about what the question they be be ask be the question for be not whether the government seek to intervene to persuade the dpp to take different view do not think the government do that neither do think the government go back and seek to change evidence it have already submit the question be when the cps ask for additional evidence as it undoubtedly do whether the government choose to supply that evidence or not that be not about interference it be about respond to request make to government by the cps give that we now know that the request be to make it clear in term that during the relevant period china be current national security threat to the uk who in the home office or elsewhere decide that that could not be submit in further statement of evidence in very clear term be grateful to the right hon and learn gentleman the remark make early about the isc which he sit on be genuinely mean think that the isc have an important role to play in look at precisely what have happen here and give he an absolute commitment that we want to work very closely with his committee on this specific issue and on other let try to give the right hon and learn gentleman bit of detail because he ask his question in an entirely reasonable way reiterate the point which hope be understand by he and his committee that the final evidence go in august this year and there be nothing that any minister could have do post that hope he be crystal clear as be that there be no political interference let just say something about the dnsa he be an outstanding public servant who do very important job and do it very well and think it be terrible shame that there have be commentary about he as an individual he have act with integrity throughout this process and we as parliament owe he debt of gratitude for the service that he have offer let say something about the evidence that he give in each of the three statement the dnsa make it crystal clear that china pose wide range threat to the uk in his third statement he say the chinese intelligence service be highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operation against the uk to advance the chinese state interest and harm the interest and security of the uk he be very clear about that he add china espionage operation threaten the uk economic prosperity and resilience and the integrity of our democratic institution he have be very clear in the evidence statement that he provide do not think that there be much more that can add to that other than to reiterate that it be then ultimately decision for the dpp malign foreign actor will always try to find the next weak link and my concern be local authority which have the spending power of billion what action be the home office take to ensure that our councillor and other democratically elect people at the low level of government be also give the protection they need be grateful to my hon friend because he raise an important point we have defend democracy taskforce precisely to ensure that our response be root across government not only here but in the region and nation we work very closely with local government and be acutely conscious of the fact that important election will be take place around the country next may we be work at pace to ensure that those election can take place in an environment that we would all want to see can absolutely give he an assurance that we work closely with our partner not only in local government but in the ministry of housing communities and local government notwithstanding the home secretary reassurance about spad or ministers not be involve in the advice do the minister accept that this matter have reinforce the grow concern in this country about lack of clarity on our position towards china the fear of threat to our energy security from the involvement of chinese company and the super embassy in london my constituent be become increasingly concerned about the activity of the consulate in my constituency can the minister reassure we that this government will make their position towards china absolutely clear in the near future be grateful to the hon member because she ask an entirely reasonable and constructive question she acknowledge be sure that the previous foreign secretary make statement to the house about the china audit and hope she will acknowledge that the nature of the relationship be complex be not aware that anyone in this place think that we should not have some form of economic co operation with china it be in our country national interest to be clear eyed about the nature of the relationship where we be able to co operate economically where it be in our national interest to do so we should proceed but we should proceed as say with clear set of principle that underpin that fundamentally our national security come first this government will of course look for opportunity to co operate economically with china but fundamentally we will always do what we can to keep our country safe be sorry that the minister find himself in position which be not of his own making be also sorry that only four member of his parliamentary party out of over be stand up to contribute to the debate do he accept that one reason for the cloud of suspicion of political interference around this matter be the decision to appoint highly political special adviser as national security adviser for the first time that have put the deputy national security adviser in the firing line can the minister at least confirm that if and when as be sure it will the intelligence and security committee ask the national security adviser to come and give evidence in its inquiry that he will do so the right hon gentleman refer to what he describe as highly political appointment with great respect to he and he know that hold he in the high regard disagree with his characterisation of that appointment the national security adviser be someone who have huge experience of government be extremely well hon member may think it be not good thing that we have somebody occupy very important role in government who be know around the world the government contend that it be good thing we only need to look at the comment make by president trump foreign affair adviser just the other day commend the important work that the national security adviser have do he work incredibly hard to secure the security of our nation rather than talk he down we should get behind he and ensure that he be support to do the important job that he have be give as have be mention the spokesman for the prime minister when ask whether china be threat refer to the dnsa statement which say that china conduct large scale espionage operation that threaten the uk economic prosperity and resilience and the integrity of our democratic institution by anyone definition that would mean that china be threat be sanctioned member of this parliament that be what this be all about have be spy upon and have have wolf warrior from china follow around the world and impersonate very threateningly do the minister think that ought to refer to china as threat it be for the right hon gentleman to choose his own word he be very experienced member of this house the activity that he describe be completely unacceptable that be why this government have be clear on numerous occasion that we want to work across the house to ensure that all right hon and hon member have the protection they need to speak their view in this place without fear or favour if he want to discuss those matter far would be very happy to do so hope that we can find way of discuss these incredibly serious issue in more grow up way as have be the case previously after the cabinet office meeting of september do the prime minister receive note on this case in his ministerial red box and if so do he approve it additionally do the uk government give chinese official private assurance at any point and in any form that the application for the chinese embassy in london would be approve hon member will know that there be very long stand custom whereby minister do not comment on the content of the prime minister box but under these particular circumstance be very happy to confirm that there be no note to the prime minister may first invite the minister to clarify what he say in response to my question last week point out that in his letter to the select committee chairs the director of public prosecutions be clear that he have ask for statement that china be national security threat and it be not forthcoming the minister shake his head and appear to dispute that will he now acknowledge that that statement be not forthcoming furthermore when the dpp informally approach the government after the third statement of evidence have be supply to he to complain that the word national security threat be still not contain in that document the government consciously choose not to give any further response be that correct why at that point give all the thing that the dnsa have already say do nobody in the government think that they could use the three word national security threat this be the third time that have appear at the dispatch box to answer question from member include from the hon gentleman so hope that he will forgive if can not remember the specific detail of the question that he put to when we be last here have seek to provide clarity in response to the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis moment ago give detailed account of the three statement from the deputy national security adviser we have be clear as be the deputy national security adviser in the statement that we provide the fact that china pose range of threat to the uk be not in doubt as the government have say before the question in this case be whether the overall legal threshold for realistic prospect of conviction have be meet in the totality of the evidence available to the cps although understand why member will focus on the three individual statement from the deputy national security adviser there be clearly other evidence available for the cps to consider as part of this process could not have say more time or be more clear that the decision lie with the dpp last thursday the minister at the dispatch box agree with that china be indeed national security threat and the government have consistently say that they be disappointed as the minister know like to be helpful and constructive at all time so ask kc to advise as to whether private criminal prosecution could be bring under the official secrets act the advice have be that the answer be yes as long as it have the consent of the attorney general and as long as the government be helpful and constructive by provide evidence and witness statement will the minister confirm whether the attorney general will give such consent and provide appropriate evidence for the sake of clarity extremely disappointed be the phraseology that we have use we seem to have move on from the original question about the home office and the hon member will understand that be not responsible for the action of the attorney general or the solicitor general colleague in the other place and in government will have hear the hon gentleman question and would be happy to discuss it with he far think the reason we be gather here today although can not see into your mind mr speaker be because of the story in the sunday times that be why the shadow home secretary my right hon friend the member for croydon south chris philp ask this when do the home secretary hear that the case might collapse that be question be we not owe an answer to that question do the home secretary as the sunday times say then make representation as to the evidence be as strong as possible do she or do she we be here because of that piece mr speaker assume although can not know your mind that that be why you agree to this urgent question this minister refuse disgracefully at that dispatch box to answer the question about the role of the home office in this spy scandal will the minister now answer not with his obfuscation and not with his flannel will he answer the question directly we be here because of activity that happen under the previous government that be why we be here repeat the point make early about conservative members show bit of humility and give response to the shadow home secretary senior chinese government official invite britain to fulfil its obligation and honour its commitment over the so call super embassy but can the minister shed light on what those obligation and commitment be if he be go to say that no such commitment or obligation be offer can we file that under another threat to this country by the chinese we do not recognise those claim of course give the quasi judicial nature of the process it would have be entirely improper for anybody to have make any comment that basically cut across the legal process that be be lead by the secretary of state for the ministry of housing communities and local government appreciate the minister clarity which he keep talk about on that basis let say this the case collapse this be about leadership he have see all the evidence in public and all the evidence in private be china spy on two member of parliament in this case yes or no be happy to debate issue of leadership with anyone in this house not least because have spend all my professional life try to keep the country safe will continue to serve in government to make sure that we do everything we can to stand against the threat we face have hop enter into government that that process would be consensual and that we could work across the house to keep the country safe that have be the approach of this government and be sad that conservative members do not want to proceed on that basis do the minister believe that the collapse of this case have weaken the uk position on the international stage and that we will see more foreign state actor try to carry out operation of espionage against member of parliament that be precisely why we work closely with our five eye ally and why the united kingdom host the five country ministerial in london just couple of week ago this need to be shared endeavour with our ally our partner and our neighbour we have huge amount in common with our international ally particularly the five eyes alliance and this government will continue to work closely with they we will ensure that if any country whether china or whoever it might be seek to interfere in our democratic process or to harm those who live in our country we work collectively across those alliance to stand against those threat would like to ask the minister about another case of foreign interference in our politic nathan gill the former leader of reform uk in wales and constituent of mine plead guilty to accept bribe from russia he be stop by the police in september but only charge in february this year report now suggest that the kremlin operation target not only he but at least two other member of the european parliament and member of the house of lords what step be the government take to ensure that russian network can not continue to influence uk politic the hon lady raise an important case that will be matter of concern to member from right across the house can assure she that we take these matter incredibly seriously specifically with regard to her point about russia can also give she the assurance that she seek that we work incredibly hard alongside our ally to make sure we be do everything we can to combat the threat that we all know we face from russia think most people would consider thing that be threaten indeed to be threat so we can only assume that the minister have be instruct that he can not make such statement from the dispatch box will he help we to understand well the government position on their relationship with china be china an ally be it friend will he explain that would be very happy to do so repeat the point that make moment ago no one who want to be consider as serious think that the nature of our relationship with china can be define by single word hope that the hon gentleman acknowledge that as say week ago this government assess that china pose series of threat to uk national security from cyber attack foreign interference and espionage target our democratic institution to the transnational repression of hongkongers however we be also alive to the fact that china present the uk with opportunity as the world second large economy and the uk third large trading partner we have to be clear eyed about both the challenge and the opportunity have now ask the government why china be not include in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme three time on june be tell that particular report be come forward in due course official report june vol on september be tell no doubt we will have more to say about it in due course official report september vol and on october be tell any decision about the enhance tier will be bring forward in the normal way official report october vol the government be now panic about the chinese embassy decision they be desperately try to deflect from attention on the chagos deal that the national security adviser negotiate on and they appear to be decriminalise spy for china what be the government rationale for not include china within the enhance tier give the threat when will it be add be old enough to remember when conservative members say that we would not introduce the foreign influence registration scheme by july we work at pace to introduce the scheme on july the hon gentleman know the answer we be look carefully at whether other country should be add to the enhance tier but we will take that decision in due course and bring it forward in the normal way the minister be strive incredibly hard to answer these question some would say well with respect we will leave it at that the news of suspect spying in parliament be worry there be no that this pose huge threat to this country and to we as mps mr speaker we owe you debt of gratitude for the stand that you be take on behalf of mp to ensure that we be protect we thank you for that it be equally worrying that case such as this be under no scrutiny by the cps and no accountability be take what assurance can the minister give our constituent that the government will put pressure on the cps to prosecute this case will he please understand the level of disappointment and betrayal feel by mps because of the lack of action on the case it be always good to hear from the hon member and agree with the sentiment that he have express hope there be unity of view across this house that collectively we can be incredibly concerned about what have happen pay tribute to the work that you have do mr speaker through the speaker commission the government will want to work very closely with you and look carefully at the finding of your commission we need to work across this house to ensure that all the protection be in place so that as have say previously member can have their say in this place without fear or favour that be precisely why additional guidance be publish just week or so ago and why just before the house go into recess back in july write to every single member of this house spell out what support and protection be in place we take very seriously our responsibility to safeguard our democracy and we want to work very closely with mr speaker on that process the minister have be ask why further step be not take to provide the evidence request in this case know that the case be on the verge of collapse he may feel that he have provide clarity but be afraid that he absolutely have not will he ask the attorney general to come to this house and make statement about what the cps want and why that be not provide by the government with great respect it be the decision of the opposition to table the urgent question in the way that they do they could have choose to table it in the way that the hon member describe the attorney general and colleague right across government look very carefully at the circumstance of this particular case have spell out in some detail the information that the government be able to put into the public domain about the three witness statement publish by the prime minister last week the final piece of evidence be send by the deputy national security adviser in august there be nothing that any minister or special adviser could have do thereafter it seem to that the key question which have not be answer despite three session on this subject be the following we know that in april the evidential test for prosecution under the official secrets act be meet we also know that come september the cps be say that it be not meet the key question be what change part of the answer seem to come from the cps when it say that it ask for government information which it do not get to satisfactory level do that not suggest that there be failure on the part of government that contribute to the collapse of this prosecution if the government simply say on the one hand china be threat on the other hand it be an opportunity how could we ever put beyond all reasonable doubt in criminal case the fact that it be threat be that equivocation not the source of the problem as have say previously in each of the three statement the dnsa make it crystal clear that china pose wide range threat to the uk in his third statement in august he say that the chinese intelligence service be highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operation against the uk to advance the chinese state interest and harm the interest and security of the uk do not think that there could have be any great clarity the minister have repeatedly say that he be extremely disappointed that this case do not proceed to trial that be thin gruel if all the step necessary to ensure that it get to trial be not take with that in mind can he set out whether the report in the sunday times over the weekend that the prime minister and other ministers be aware of the imminent collapse on september be correct if that be correct can he set out what step the home secretary take to ensure that the cps have the evidence it need hope the hon gentleman understand that the point about the government be extremely disappointed be absolutely genuine could not have be clear from day one that the government be extremely disappointed that we will not be proceed with this trial however it be not for minister to opine on decision take independently of government final evidence go in in august and can give the hon gentleman an assurance that there be nothing the prime minister or any minister could have do thereafter the minister have be ask by numerous people not least by the shadow home secretary and by my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart when the home secretary know that this case be go to collapse we have not be give an answer the minister have also be ask by numerous people if the home secretary make representation again we have not be give an answer these should be relatively straightforward question with straightforward answer will the minister answer those question or give reason as to why he can not do so have do my very good to provide the clarity that hon member be ask for there be of course still an unanswered question about the position of the previous government the prime minister put that point to the leader of the opposition last week and there be number of former government ministers in the chamber perhaps they could tell we the answer be go to give the minister fifth chance to answer do the home secretary make representation when she discover that the case be about to collapse yes or no have give the house the order could we calm down marvellous call robin swann chinese official recently brief stormont finance minister on the status of local company in his constituency own by the chinese state information on that briefing release under the freedom of information act by the department of finance withhold detail cite freedom of information law that protect confidential information obtain from foreign state in the current climate and in the interest of openness and transparency do the minister agree that it would be good to release all the detail of that meeting rather than hide behind foi law the hon gentleman have ask quite technical question be not entirely clear which meeting he be refer to but be very happy to write to he with the detail on point of order madam deputy speaker the point of order will come after the urgent question and the statement can it wait indicate assent maccabi tel aviv fc away fans ban urgent question to ask the secretary of state for culture media and sport if she will make statement on the decision to ban maccabi tel aviv fc fan from attend their fixture against aston villa last week aston villa release statement that away fan would not be permit to attend their game against maccabi tel aviv on november the decision be take by birmingham city council on the advice of the safety advisory group and base on risk assessment by west midlands police that risk assessment consider range of factor such as the risk of protest the threat of wide disorder previous fixture with maccabi tel aviv fan and the impact on the wide community it be long establish principle set out in law that the police and safety advisory group be operationally independent of government and that it be for they to take decision on safety however this decision have far wide implication in any situation there be risk that must be assess but in this case the inherent risk that the event present be in no small part down to where the away fan come from and who they be it be in that context that the solution that be propose to exclude group from attend be wrong it choose exclusion rather than look at the full range of option available to manage that risk and include this be about who we be as country lot of the public discussion about this game have focus on event in the middle east let be clear it be perfectly legitimate to hold and express strong view about what be happen in israel and gaza people in this country be free to protest peacefully they be free to lobby government and event organiser about which country can participate in tournament and they be free to choose not to attend event or purchase product that they find unacceptable however they be not entitle to dictate who can participate in competition attend football match or walk the street for fear of threat or reprisal whatever one view on the event overseas that be fundamental principle that this government will fiercely defend let also be clear that the decision be not make in vacuum it be set against backdrop of rise antisemitism in this country and across the world and of an attack on synagogue in manchester in which two innocent man be kill it have real world impact on community who already feel exclude and afraid it be therefore completely legitimate to support the independence of the police to conduct that risk assessment and to question the conclusion that follow when it exclude the people at the heart of that risk follow the decision last week the government have be work with west midlands police and birmingham city council to support they to consider all the option available and to tell we what resource be need to manage the risk to ensure that fan from both team can attend safely if the assessment be revise the safety advisory group will meet again to discuss option in the past few day have speak to jewish community group sporting organisation fan group and aston villa football club to ensure we have the full picture possible the home secretary and the communities secretary have have extensive discussion with the police local government and other ultimately the law be clear that responsibility for this decision lie with local agency it be not for the government to assess the risk surround this football match but we be clear that resource will not be the determine factor in whether maccabi tel aviv fan can be admit the fundamental principle that nobody in our country will be exclude from participate in public life because of who they be must be uphold thank the right hon lady for those comment because be sure most of we in this house believe that the decision to ban maccabi tel aviv fan from the upcoming europa league game against villa be the wrong one it be also embarrassing and disgrace have we really reach the point where we can not welcome visitor from overseas to our second city because we can not guarantee their safety on british street and in british football ground this be not how modern britain should present itself to the world some astoundingly include some in this house have claim that the ban on israeli fan be for their own safety that safety have be put at risk precisely because of the anger and hatred be whip up by some of those very same people demand ban such as by equate football fan with terrorist we can not give in to that kind of rhetoric and hope the minister will join in condemn it football and all sport have incredible potential to bring people together it should not be use as deliberate tool to divide the uk have great and hard win reputation for host major international sporting event and ban an entire fanbase send the wrong signal and may jeopardise our ability to host such event in the future how disappointing this decision must be to the resident of birmingham who only three year ago welcome people from around the world to the commonwealth game which showcase birmingham and the west midland at their diverse vibrant and hospitable well we therefore call on the government to intervene and get this ban reverse aston villa and the safety advisory group may only be able to reverse the ban with guarantee of additional support from the government can the minister therefore confirm what additional resource may be provide and who will pay for they can she confirm when the home office and the department for culture media and sport be first make aware of the intent of the safety advisory group to make this obviously controversial decision be she confident that they talk to all the right people before make the decision if the decision be reverse what practical step will be take to ensure the safety of all fan and resident while many football team have some undesirable supporter intent on cause trouble let we recognise that the vast majority of fan want nothing more than to enjoy good game of football do the minister agree that if we be truly to wrap our arm around the jewish community as the prime minister promise follow the attack on the synagogue in manchester we need to take action and not just spout warm word finally be she confident that this incident will not jeopardise our ability to host major international sporting event in the future first may thank the shadow secretary of state for bring this urgent question to the house know the issue be of concern to so many parliamentarian and to so many people outside this place also thank he for his tone have watch with dismay as people in this debate have seek to use this moment to heighten tension and commend he for how he have conduct himself the shadow secretary of state ask particularly important question about who will pay across government the home secretary the chancellor the prime minister the communities secretary and be unite in say that we will find the resource that need to be make available once west midlands police have come forward with the risk assessment we will work as one government to make sure that those resource be forthcoming because of the important fundamental principle that be at stake about what sort of country we be the hon gentleman ask whether be confident that the decision have be base on the right information in recent day have see great many fact fly around that do not seem to have any evidential basis especially on social medium and we be work with our international partner to ensure that west midlands police have the full range of information on which to base an assessment the hon gentleman mention the impact that this be have on the jewish community absolutely feel and understand that and have have numerous conversation with member of the jewish community over the past few day we have vast experience of police event in difficult circumstance in this country and the hon gentleman be right to say that the behaviour of minority of supporter in every club and in this club in particular be reprehensible but that be not true of all fan what be astonishing in this case be that it be unprecedented in modern time for all away fan to be ban because of the behaviour of small minority and we be work with the police to help they to look at that in the round the hon gentleman be right to say that we need action not just warm word have meet jewish fan be particularly concerned about the impact that some of the event in the middle east be have not just on national competition but on grassroots sport have commit myself to work with they on that to ensure that young people in this country can turn up at local grassroots event and not feel anxious about participate or not be able to participate because of who they be finally the hon gentleman ask about the signal that this send to other around the world that be not lose on we we be tolerant diverse nation and birmingham as one of our great city be great example that be what we be fight to uphold and defend and that be the britain in which we believe the message from this government be that we will always defend that country we be well country than some of the comment that have be make and the action that have be take in the last week and we be determined to uphold that as my right hon friend will know from her discussion with the jewish community which will have be similar to those that have have follow the dreadful murder at the heaton park synagogue just over fortnight ago what they want be to be assure by the government local authority and other security authority that they can live and walk about in this country in complete safety whatever the risk assessment in birmingham be it would be disgrace and shame if this country could not guarantee the security of group of group of jewish fan come from israel walk down our street can my right hon friend give that assurance to this house this afternoon my hon friend be great champion for his jewish constituent have meet jewish community organisation over the last few day to give they that assurance that the government will always defend and uphold their right to participate fully in public life and that include be able to attend football match in number of the discussion that we have have with partner they have make the point to we that many of the people who want to attend this match as maccabi tel aviv fan be actually british citizen who live here in the united kingdom that should be in all our mind when we think about whom we be exclude from be able to attend call the liberal democrat spokesperson the decision to ban maccabi tel aviv fan from attend their team europa league match because west midlands police could not keep the fan safe be serious mistake and set dangerous precedent we appreciate the difficulty in ensure the safety of fan and local community but the liberal democrats believe that this decision must be reverse and that the government should work alongside local authority and the police to ensure that the match go ahead with both set of fan the situation at maccabi tel aviv match in israel this weekend remind we of the importance of ensure that our police force have the resource and support that they need to keep major event safe the uk have make significant progress in tackle football hooliganism but the police must always be prepare for small number of fan who seek to cause trouble will the minister recommend bubble like security restriction to boost security check and police presence around the stadium to ensure that everyone be serve and protect the home secretary say that she do not know about the fan be ban until the night before it be announce but she be apparently aware as early as last week that decision be be make can the minister clarify when the home secretary be make aware of the potential ban if she know last week why do she not intervene early thank the hon lady for her question will try to address they all think the home secretary have give full account of the fact that she be keep update about these event but the decision be not communicate to the government until sadly we see the statement from aston villa on the recommendation of the police want to be really clear that the police have role here that be operationally independent of government and that they have right and responsibility to assess the risk have no basis to believe that the police do anything other than act in good faith in try to make that assessment the reason that the government have intervene in this case be because we believe that it have far wide implication the upshot of the decision be that it breach fundamental principle about who be entitle to participate in public life and walk our street safely because of that we have be forthcoming with all the support and resource that the west midlands police may need in order to ensure that this game can go ahead in the manner that the hon lady suggest the people charge with the protection of public safety carry heavy burden and not all the information that they consider have yet be lay out in the public domain however have deep concern about the principle of block ban entire group of opposition fan some of whom let we not forget may be uk resident or national and about some of the description of birmingham in part of the press and other area of our political life that be not true account of our city do the secretary of state agree that birmingham overwhelmingly remain diverse and welcome place and will she join in commend the calm leadership that the council leader john cotton have bring to bear by call for review my right hon friend the communities secretary have work very closely with birmingham city council and echo my hon friend comment about the leader and commend the council for the constructive way in which it have work with we the police and other local agency in order to deal with this issue we have also work very constructively with the west midlands police aston villa football club and whole host of agency in order to try to resolve the situation he be right to say that it be unprecedented in recent time that an entire group of away supporter have be entirely ban from game and it be something that we in this country do not make habit of we have become very skilled at police football match even where there be considerable risk involve in way that include everyone finally may say that those who seek to divide and exclude people in birmingham should consider the signal that it send to the rest of the world about one of our great and vibrant city on friday the club chief executive raise concern about what the ban on fan actually signal the secretary of state will be aware that this be not the first time we have hear about jewish people not feel safe at either cultural or sporting event whether that be the scene at glastonbury this year or the boycott protest and cancellation of jewish performer at venue around the country be really grateful for the secretary of state commitment today but can she set out bit more on what specifically she be do to ensure that jewish people feel safe and welcome to participate in cultural life in the uk early this year host roundtable with lord mann and the board of deputies to discuss the role of jewish people in the wide range of public life particularly in relation to art film tv broadcasting and medium the hon lady be absolutely right to say that this specific case be not occur in vacuum and we be work on strategy to make sure that jewish people be include and that their contribution to british public life be recognise and celebrate would like to preface my comment by say that everybody in this place be horrify by the attack on the synagogue in heaton park and that my comment today be purely base on safety year before the hillsborough disaster safety concern at sheffield wednesday stadium be raise by an official but the ex council safety officer be tell by boss in to keep his nose out of such concern nobody in this place need to be remind of what happen as result of ignore that safety advice innocent man woman and child lose their life we have safety advisory group for reason and it be slippery slope when safety concern be ignore believe it be unprecedented for government to try to overturn such advice and respectfully disagree with the secretary of state that ban do not go on because we have have lot of case both nationally and internationally with the most recent one be napoli versus eintracht frankfurt can the secretary of state be explicitly clear have she see the safety advice if so do she disagree with the safety advice if she do disagree can she tell the house on what ground she disagree it be imperative that this house be clear because if the government be successful in have the decision overturn particularly after the scene we witness last night at the israeli derby people be go to ask question thank my hon friend as somebody who represent some of the hillsborough family say to she that we as government and as an individual member of that government take the safety of all fan and the wide community with the utmost seriousness we would never treat safety as secondary consideration my hon friend say that we be try to overturn the police advice we be do absolutely no such thing and think make that completely clear in the response have just make we be work with the west midlands police and local partner to make sure that we take into account the risk they have raise in order to ensure that this game can go ahead safely with both set of fan present in the discussion about and the consideration have give to the risk that the west midlands police have highlight what be completely different about this case be not just that it be the first time in this country since the early that decision have be take to ban away fan entirely from attend game but that the risk assessment be base in no small part on the risk pose to fan attend to support maccabi tel aviv because they be israeli and because they be jewish we should be appal by that and never allow it to stand commend the secretary of state for the tone and the clarity of her response to the urgent question echo what she say about the police make the decision in good faith but it be as she have say the wrong decision can also echo what she have say about this not be the sort of country to make such decision it be not the sort of city birmingham be either there be outstandingly good community relation there largely because of the excellent work do by the faith community across the city echo those comment and take this moment to pay tribute to those faith organisation the communities secretary and have be pleased to work with they in anticipation of the threat of significant disorder that have be make by people outside birmingham who seek to travel to birmingham to create strife their message be ours as well they be not welcome there it be report over the weekend that in august legal observer to one of the protest be arrest simply for wear star of david because it be consider to be antagonise now with the decision to ban the maccabi fan from come to the uk there be genuine cumulative effect on what it mean for jewish people in this country and the effect on the family of jewish people in this country who watch their friend and family be torture about whether or not they have role in this country any more we should all be significantly aware of that if this ban be allow to go ahead there will be this challenge the game after the maccabi game be with the swiss base young boys whose fan have be involve in two riot include hospitalisation if their away team be not ban the question should be what be different between the maccabi fan and the young boys fan and what be it that we want to talk about think my hon friend have put it well than could as the member of parliament for the very area set to host this match and for the community whose public safety many member of this house wish to play fast and loose with know the reality on the ground know that there have be deliberate disingenuous move by many to make this matter of ban jews and to conflate matter of police with those of religion just this morning see video of jewish community leader stand outside villa park say that they too support the banning of this team fan and will release that video outside the chamber those who be not welcome in aston be the hooligan who have long history of violence and vile racism with chant like the arabs we will rape their daughter and there be no school in gaza because there be no child leave in gaza it be these hooligan who be not welcome can ask the minister how many million of british taxpayer money her government be offer to overturn the respected expert judgment of the west midlands police and the safety group can just say to the hon gentleman that be appal by the specific incident and chant he mention and that none of we in this house should seek to condone they in any sense but can also say to he that it be entirely disingenuous to say that you respect cohesion and inclusion when you be seek to divide and exclude interruption order ask members to temper their language and not accuse each other of be disingenuous ensure that all fan can attend sporting event in safety and without fear must always be our first priority and we must fully respect the operational independence of the police can the secretary of state reassure the house that this government will provide the necessary resource to support local policing in this case particularly in the light of the heightened and very deep concern around antisemitism to ensure that resourcing be not the reason give for the block ban of maccabi tel aviv fan be really happy to give my hon friend that assurance as british muslim who grow up in birmingham and the west midland and do business there be deeply sadden by this decision be sadden for the british jewish community we be tolerant diverse nation and tolerant diverse region this decision be bad for two reason first it be bad for birmingham and the west midland and bad for the british muslim community many have reach out say that they do not want to be drag into this and that they feel similar amount of anger secondly my worry now be that flashpoint have be create there will now be those who will want to take advantage of the fact that it be in the headline there will be those who will want to come and cause trouble and drag birmingham name and that of the west midland through the mud acknowledge that too be sadden by the way this have play out be sadden about the impact on people in birmingham who have always find to be extremely welcoming and tolerant and who know that they be strong for their diversity not weaken by it the hon gentleman be right to say that recent event and the way in which number of people have seek to prey on they have heighten the level of risk that be something that west midlands police of course have to consider but my commitment to he and to all member of this house and to the people of birmingham be that resource will not stand in the way of this go ahead let just say from the outset that all form of bigotry be abhorrent dutch police report into the disorder in amsterdam at the ajax versus maccabi tel aviv fixture determine that maccabi fan tear down palestinian flag set fire to it and chant fuck you palestine that be vile disgust islamophobia in action how about prevent that from happen here because there be an extreme hooligan element of maccabi fan who consistently behave in that manner do the government not see that islamophobic behaviour be highly likely if these fan travel to birmingham what about the safety of our muslim citizen look everybody in this house be entitle to strong opinion but they be not entitle to selective version of the fact the hon gentleman be absolutely right to point out that among minority of maccabi tel aviv fan in the instance he raise there be appal behaviour which none of we include most maccabi tel aviv fan would seek to condone but there be also attack on those fan and that have form part of the assessment of risk that west midlands police have have to make think it be just worth reiterate the point about just how rare it be for away fan to be exclude wholesale from attend european football match in this country as my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell point out just moment ago we have have to deal with this in this country for very long time we have do it recently and in many part of the country we have find way to police safely and effectively it can not be beyond our collective wit to do so in this case as thing stand the decision to ban maccabi tel aviv fan reflect so badly on birmingham the west midland and our country and at time when football can often bring people and community together will the secretary of state assure we that she will do all she can to ensure that any review under way be conclude before kick off can hear and understand the right hon lady frustration we be work at pace and pull every lever at our disposal to give the police and birmingham city council the support they need the police need to be able to conduct that risk assessment and review thoroughly because the safety of fan and the community must be paramount we be work as fast as we can and be determined to get there as quickly as we can not least to provide clarity to both club so that they can make the necessary preparation order know that this topic be very important but need question to be short and answer to be just as precise first pay tribute to the volunteer who serve on the safety advisory group thankless but hugely important task who will be really worried about today the safety of football fan have at time be at the very bottom of priority in this place will my right hon friend reassure that the safety of supporter be absolutely paramount in the government thinking rather than the politic around this matter be really happy to give my hon friend that assurance thank he for the work he have do over many year and not just on hillsborough but on football as whole welcome the secretary of state remark and commend she for her conciliary tone and attitude yes safety be paramount for all football supporter but as she have say this be not take place in vacuum and this country be now in very tense situation she mention strategy go ahead to make jewish community feel more welcome can she outline wee bit more of that set out what we might expect and when we might expect to see it have be extremely concerned to hear example from the jewish community in addition to the specific instance that we be talk about with jewish film director have their show cancel not because it be to do with anything in israel or gaza but because they be jewish and jewish presenter be advise to stay off the airwave be work with they with the help and support of lord mann to ensure that we pursue an overarching strategy and have also have discussion with individual organisation to ensure that where those incident take place those individual know that they do not have to challenge those thing alone too thank the secretary of state for her statement and for the tone in which she deliver it the police always act in the interest of public safety and be sure there be no antisemitic intent it be the threat of the mob that have lead to this decision do she agree that we must never allow the rule of the mob completely commend the right hon lady for her statement which cover everything precisely disagree with one or two of those who have come out against she on this matter simply say this when the partial assessment be do everybody centre on what happen in amsterdam but when they play game in istanbul there be no trouble at all it be bit partial to choose one bit of evidence over the other simply say that with the rise of antisemitism now in the uk the right hon lady be make the right decision to protect those people be grateful to the right hon gentleman he raise the important question of whether this decision be proportionate and whether if there have not be risk to the maccabi tel aviv fan because of where they come from and who they be this decision would have play out in the way that it have that be what be exercise lot of member of this house and it be obviously view that we share be it not the case that the police act on intelligence believe that maccabi fan should not be allow to attend the match for public safety reason their record of hooliganism will have contribute to that such ban have happen with fan of other team across europe yet in this case there have be dangerous push to once again claim that any criticism of israel be antisemitic should the government not just admit that they have it badly wrong on this and let the police do their job without political interference surely the real issue here be the right of local people to be keep safe the difference in this case be that what have tip the balance of the decision be the risk present to maccabi tel aviv fan because they be israeli and in many case because they be british and jewish what have happen be that political campaign lead be ashamed to say by member of this house have cause the police to change their decision and calculation the secretary of state be right to suggest that this be not simply an operational decision she be talk good game but she also say that all she can do be question the conclusion of the police and now she be offer more resource and ask they politely if they will change their decision do the government not recognise that under the police act they have the power to direct police force to make certain decision and if necessary to dismiss the chief constable if they do not will the government clarify the law to ensure that they do have the power to overturn decision like this there be long establish principle in this country as set out in law that the police be operationally independent and be surprised to hear the hon gentleman seek to question that have be clear that the risk assessment and decision around what would be need for the game to go ahead safely with all fan present be for the police the right and proper role of the government be to work with and support the police to ensure that that happen it be not just question of resource we be look at whole range of factor and practice that be well establish in this country and across europe include ensure that there be transportation to get fan safely to and from the game we be look at the number of ticket sale make available to away fan as well as measure that have be try and test in order to ensure that those who would seek to create trouble be exclude from the game it be absolutely not right to characterise the position of this government as simply stand on the sideline the fundamental principle that people whoever they be should be entitle to walk the street and attend football game in our country be for we non negotiable be sure that the secretary of state will find the irony in the fact that last weekend as be sure they will next weekend premier league footballer take the knee to demonstrate the need to drive out racism from football what have happen here be antisemitism at its heart if the issue be the safety of the fan outside the ground it be the case in many away match that away supporter be escort by the police on coach to the entrance and then collect from the exit to go back to the airport there be no reason why that can not be do now will the secretary of state go back to the police and say let make people safe support tottenham hotspur and we have massive jewish population among our fan if this mean that we be not safe to go to aston villa because of attitude outside the ground that be demonstration that in the uk jewish people be not safe on our street fundamentally agree with the hon member first congratulate the secretary of state on the very clear message that she have give today be it not fact that despite some of the excuse come from member behind this be all about the religion of the supporter who will be attend this match and indeed that the only people they be likely to be in danger from be the hate mob we have see march across our street for month wave palestinian flag and support terrorist would she agree that the police ought to be tell you need to make the street safe for everyone jewish people as well as anyone else that be their duty and they should live up to that would say that it be all of our duty to ensure that we live up to that as country and in the vast majority of case we do also make the point to those who say that it be perfectly legitimate to try to drive the fan out of the game that our assessment be that the vast majority of maccabi tel aviv fan who want to attend be british the only distinguish feature be that they be jewish my jewish community have be come to for year to say how unsafe they feel and that antisemitism have rear its head in this country for many year the secretary of state tone be welcome and she be absolutely right but let put it bluntly jewish hatred in this country have grow and grow may ask the secretary of state to pull every lever she can to ensure that the idea of jewish hatred be not bear out by people say because you be jewish or because you be israeli we hold you all responsible for the action of government the reality be that that be xenophobia racism and antisemitism and it need to be call out be happy to join the right hon member in call that out will the secretary of state confirm that in come to the decision the authority in birmingham take account of the behaviour of maccabi tel aviv fan on many other occasion in many other place and decide it be unsafe for the match to be play in birmingham it be absolutely not about ban jewish people or any other people from go to the match or go to birmingham can we separate the issue about the behaviour of group of fan from the wide question of how everybody whether jewish muslim or anything else must be safe to walk the street of this country on the right hon member last statement that everybody must be safe to walk the street of this country agree with he perhaps he might make that point to the people he now associate with on his left and right because that be not what we have hear from they in the last few week can just clear this up have hear lot of hot take on social medium about the evidence on which the police rely to come to their decision it be right to say that the police as we would expect take into account in particular the game in amsterdam at which maccabi tel aviv fan be present and where small element cause the most appalling disorder but they also take into account the real risk present to maccabi tel aviv fan on the basis that maccabi tel aviv be an israeli team and many of the fan who would attend be jewish hope that the right hon member will be as exercise about that as he be about the behaviour of those fan hopefully we can rely on the police to arrest any hooligan who break the law whichever team they be support will the government take into account the fact that know the way in which terrorist mind work as there will be such concentration of police resource on this particular location jewish establishment in that part of the country need to be extra careful on that day such that advantage be not seek to be take by people who mean they harm the right hon member will be aware because it have all play out publicly that there have be specific threat against jewish people and jewish organisation we and the police be take that extremely seriously because of the way in which those on all side of the debate have seek to heighten tension over the past week there be concern about the safety of whole range of people across the community muslims jews and the wide community number of hon member have make the point that far more work need to be do to defuse those tension to take the heat out of the situation to support everybody in this country and in particular to be emphatic as the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke say just moment ago that nobody in britain be responsible for the event play out in the middle east to hold people whether british muslims or british jews responsible be entirely unacceptable last year the chief constable of the west midlands police force tell muslim elder that he would always police without fear or favour and that he would not tolerate any sort of racism but the banning of maccabi fan be quite clearly racism do the secretary of state agree that if the police chief can not police football match they should no long be in office do not think it helpful to question people motif in the work we have do with west midlands police have no hesitation in say that they have make an assessment of the risk as be their responsibility what happen next be not just question for they it be question for all of we the police have do their job to assess the safety and risk pose across the board the government have intervene in this case because the decision they have come to have wide implication that we believe have lead to the wrong decision and that can not stand however do not question the police motif for moment our job be to work with they and support they to be able to police the match in way that ensure that people can attend and do so safely the message that this decision send be that the police will bow to religious pressure and it legitimise antisemitism the secretary of state make reference to the game between ajax and maccabi tel aviv the vast majority of fan arrest that evening be ajax fan ajax be play chelsea at stamford bridge on wednesday evening but no one have talk about ban its fan from attend that game article of the europa league regulation state that to ensure that rescheduled match can be complete if necessary without spectator the home club must have access to back up stadium give that it be now likely that this fixture will attract bad faith actor to birmingham who be not fan of either team and who be look to cause trouble what assessment have the secretary of state make of play the match behind closed door at neutral venue or venue where the police be prepared to provide security we as government be not prepared to accept that people can not attend football match in birmingham because of who they be there be many many aston villa fan who be look forward to this fixture there be no risk pose by they it be in their home city and they should be able to attend it be also our strong view as the hon gentleman set out that the majority of maccabi tel aviv fan should be allow to attend as they have do safely at many other match and not be discriminate against because of who they be we be work with the police and other local partner to make sure that we do everything we can to achieve that end and deal with the wide issue that many member here have raise maccabi tel aviv racist fan hooliganism can not be separate from israeli militarism many of these many of these fan be active or former soldier who have take part in israel genocide in gaza they should be investigate for war crime the moment they set foot on british soil not welcome into our stadium let we be clear this labour government be no innocent bystander they have arm israel genocide they have provide diplomatic cover and they have shamefully deny that genocide be even take place so ask the minister be there anything this labour government will not do to defend the genocidal apartheid state of israel like the hon lady but have to say that she be do the people of birmingham no favour with that sort of rhetoric the conflation that she make between all maccabi tel aviv supporter and the action of the israeli government be precisely what the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold be say about blame british citizen who happen to support maccabi tel aviv for action that be take place in the middle east have to say that conflate be jewish and be israeli be in itself antisemitism think she should take more care with her remark birmingham good band be of course black sabbath and it have counsel we that if you listen to fool the mob rule this be case of mob rule here the secretary of state have do tremendous job of set out the government position will she review while maintain police order if mr kruger and ms zarah sultana want to continue their own personal debate they need to take it out of the chamber thank you madam deputy speaker back to the sabs will the secretary of state review the rule around sporting and entertainment event to make sure that this government and any future government be not render impotent in the face of the mob we be not consider make change to the principle that have stand for long time about the operational independence of the police but as have set out to other member we be clear that there be role for government here and we be determined to play our part in help to resolve this interruption have to say listen to the racket that be go on in the corner of the chamber that have just talk about the impact that this issue be have on young people in this country who be turn up put on their strip on sunday morning go to play football and find that they be not welcome that sort of behaviour be exactly the opposite of what this house should be model welcome the secretary of state and thank she very much for her statement be sadden to hear of this decision and more importantly the message it send to our jewish community this be dire situation and we must make use of uk policing service to find way for this sport event to take place and for fan to attend in safety jews be welcome and protect everywhere as be people of all faith and none scenario in which we give into intimidation and threat be slippery slope to appeasement within our country what step will be take to ensure the deployment of police from other area for instance the police service of northern ireland have be use just in the last month to do some of the policing police must be use to allow international supporter to attend and to send the correct message that we be one nation and that freedom be not zone or exclude in any area of this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland as make clear we be look at whole range of option to provide the support and resource that west midlands police need we be very clear that this can not be responsibility for it alone there be wide principle at stake and we be provide everything that it need in order that we can live up to the principle that the hon gentleman just set out the government politician from across the house and the medium establishment have condemn the propose ban of maccabi tel aviv fan as antisemitic yet this group have record of violent behaviour and racist chant include death to arabs and the mocking of the killing of gazan child give the uk adoption of the international holocaust remembrance alliance definition which rightly warn against hold jewish people collectively responsible for israel action do the minister agree that the conflation of criticism of israel with its ongoing genocide war crime breach of international law and current genocide trial at the international court of justice with antisemitism against british jews or jewish people in general actually undermine that definition interruption will not sit down be that the question indicate dissent quickly put the question and if the uk rightly impose cultural and sport boycott on country like russia over war crime why should israel be treat differently have make it absolutely clear that it be perfectly acceptable for people to hold strong and passionate view about what be happen in israel and gaza and that there be right in this country to make representation to sport govern body and the government about who can participate the hon gentleman be not listen so think will just leave it there antisemitism be vile and no one should be prevent from enjoy their sporting game whatever it may be simply because of their faith as football fan take the decision to ban any fan very seriously but the prime minister decision to interfere with the independence of west midlands police and the sag should concern all of we in this house especially when the same prime minister fail to intervene when british aid worker be kill while volunteer for world central kitchen fail to intervene when his own mp be deny access to israel and the west bank and fail to intervene when the israel defence forces board flotilla with british citizen onboard and detain they million will now be spend on football match to defend some hooligan it be not all fan who chant that there be no school in gaza because there be no child in gaza do the minister agree that the prime minister should respect the independence of the police and the safety advisory group have west midlands police make different decision really do wonder whether the hon gentleman would have come to this house to question that decision be afraid that suspect the answer be yes this be part of the problem with this debate the chant that he talk about think appal absolutely everybody in the house he characterise the government in particular way but he fail to make reference to the very many robust action that we have take around the israeli government action in gaza we have condemn they we have sanction member of the israeli government we have restrict arm sale to israel and we have be out there on the ground play our part in peace negotiation and push for aid to get in at pace we still be but he do not reference that because sadly think he be try to gain political support for his position only few of they have bother to listen to any of the debate but if hon member really want to resolve this say to they that they should work with we to ensure that all community can express their passionate deeply hold view in appropriate and peaceful way but that this country can remain an open tolerant diverse place where everybody be free to walk the street and attend football game regardless of who they be after the conflation of antisemitism with the banning of football hooligan who happen to come from israel and the abuse that and other people have receive for support the ban on safety ground must put on the record that and those people be not antisemitic never have be and never will be the prime minister describe the decision to ban the violent maccabi hooligan by west midlands police and birmingham city council safety advisory group as antisemitism the leader of reform the hon member for clacton nigel farage say that the police give in to extremist intimidation the leader of the liberal democrats the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey call for the decision to be reverse say you do tackle antisemitism by ban its victim and there be racist comment by the would be leader of the tories the right hon member for newark robert jenrick who say that integration have fail in birmingham let ask this be it antisemitic for the israeli police to cancel football derby in tel aviv last night after those same hooligan force the match to stop through violence and injury to fan and the police do we want those scene to be repeat in our stadium and on our street the decision that be make last night as understand it be on the basis of rioting occur at live event it be not decision that be unprecedented in the uk from safety advisory group in recent sorry do the hon member want to know my answer yes please in that case can we have little more decorum because there be people outside of this place whose life be be directly affect by the debate we be have and the tone of this debate the hon member try to equate the two but the truth be that he reveal himself in the language he use he refer to the banning of football hooligan and specifically to violent football hooligan but this be not decision to ban football hooligan it be decision to ban all away fan from game which safety advisory group have not do in this country for nearly year it be decision take not on the ground that he suggest which be the risk pose by maccabi tel aviv fan it be decision take in no small part because of the risk pose to they because they support an israeli team and because they be jewish would gently say to he that if he be conflate everybody who support an israeli team the vast majority of whom by definition will be jewish with violent football hooligan he should consider whether he can really stand in front of this house and say that he be not behave in way that be antisemitic do not want to continue the debate be the point of order absolutely necessary right now and relevant indicate assent indicate assent call ian byrne on point of order madam deputy speaker the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith state that maccabi tel aviv have play game in istanbul where there be no trouble at all uefa move the game to hungary after turkish authority refuse to stage it in turkey hungarian authority then have it play behind closed door hence no trouble be not sure that be actually point of order and do not want to continue the debate but the hon member have indeed put his point on the record rise be it an appropriate point of order yes call zarah sultana on point of order madam deputy speaker in my question to the secretary of state clearly state that the maccabi tel aviv football team be inextricably link to the israeli state which be an apartheid state the boycott of apartheid regime such as apartheid south africa be legitimate political stance to label such position as antisemitic as the secretary of state do be entirely false and dangerous and the way the secretary of state have refer to and my colleague be also laced with islamophobia order ms sultana should not have to repeat myself that be continuation of the debate and the urgent question have conclude education and skills strategy with permission mr speaker will make statement to update the house on the government work to transform further and high education in this country the house should be in no doubt transformation be what we need because the world be change with artificial intelligence machine learning green energy and new and exciting technology global force be reshape the world of work more and more quickly they bring fresh and exciting chance for growth and opportunity however unless education and training in this country also change we risk miss those chance and our young people risk be leave behind we have see that before under the previous government who think that college and technical education be for other people child apprenticeship start for our young people plummet they talk down our university and be more interested in headline for culture war than in head start for student we will never take that path know that member on both side of the house will agree that we in this country have duty to our people to our business and to our great history not just to keep up but to lead the way today we publish our education and skill white paper to seize the opportunity of this change world to deliver growth for our economy and opportunity for our community and to lead the way my vision for education in this country be skill system that drive growth and be more balanced more responsive and more reflective of the evolve world of work it will add dynamism invention and expertise to our economy and it will go far by invite work people to be part of that economic strength and to add to and share in that success the young person who have just leave school and be not sure of what be next deserve range of quality option to choose the route that be right for he great apprenticeship top course at his local further education college or to go off to university work mother deserve the opportunity to upskill and make the most of her talent for she it mean more than job it mean career security and opportunity want to see that opportunity cascade into our community with local business become more productive take on more people and pay high salary hustle and bustle return to the high street the skilled workforce that we need to build more local home and empower nhs staff with the right skill to deliver transformed service that be fit for the future get this country move again that be why the skill system be fundamental to national renewal the white paper be the turning point in how we go from quarter of million skilled vacancy sit unfilled to pipeline of top quality training to fill those job and create new one from muddle of confuse pathway to coherent system meet the need of the modern economy and from further education treat as the poor relation to our college stand side by side with our world class university the public will have hear such warm word about skill before and they will know that warm word often fizzle out into nothing no action and no change but that be no long the case because our reform of the skill system have already begin we have establish skills england reform the growth and skill levy slash red tape on apprenticeship introduce technical excellence college and stabilise university finance and we be roll out the youth guarantee today we be go far guide by our industrial strategy we will fill gap and meet need through our new foundation apprenticeship or through short course in priority sector which from april will be fund by the growth and skill levy to deliver growth we be invest million for our techfirst digital skill and ai learning million for engineering million for the defence talent pipeline and million to train more construction worker that be all back up by new technical excellence college clean energy defence digital advanced manufacturing construction what we need be technical excellence and that be what our college can provide through this white paper we will work with our fantastic fe staff we will draw on their passion and expertise we be strengthen professional development in our college partner with industry and build on the evidence of what work we will pair that support with improve performance measure to bring our college out of the shadow of the university route and to make it pathway of equal importance equal value and equal pride in the eye of the nation as the prime minister have say that will be defining cause for this labour government no long cinderella service but rather system of high esteem match high support with high challenge and spread good practice from across the country to deliver high standard in every college to seize the opportunity of the tech revolution this country need not just lawyer economist and scientist we need wind turbine technician video editor and builder career that we on this side of the house respect and work that pay and lift up community we be introduce rigorous study pathway give young people clear line of sight into great career that include level the brand new vocational pathway unveil in our white paper today sit proudly alongside level and level and build the skill and knowledge that employer value we be back those change with million of extra investment for young people in our college and sixth form next year above and beyond what be plan for this year and support more student that be why the target for of our young people to go to university be evolve because to compete in this change world we need to nurture much broad range of talent as the prime minister have announce we have new ambition no long just half we want two third of our young people to get into high level learning be it academic technical or an apprenticeship but pro technical and pro vocational do not mean be anti academic our university be stamp of quality recognise across the world source of immense national pride and driver of economic strength in our region to any young person grow up in england today say this if you want to go to university if it be right for you and if you meet the requirement this government will back you that be why we be introduce new target maintenance grant for those student most in need fund by levy on international student fee because in this country open up access for domestic student from disadvantaged community be my priority we also need system that deliver for work people live busy life that be why we be make high level learn more flexible and available in bitesize chunk with break point in degree and support by the lifelong learning entitlement but it be not only degree that matter want to see our university work with college to deliver more level and qualification and to spread that excellence far and wide make it easy for people to take those vital course in their local further education college and deliver the miss middle of skill that be so important for our economy and for our people seek their next promotion to safeguard the excellence in our university for future generation last november announce that tuition fee would increase by this academic year today confirm that we will increase undergraduate tuition fee cap for all high education provider in line with forecast inflation for the next two academic year we will future proof our maintenance loan offer by increase maintenance loan in line with forecast inflation every academic year to provide long term certainty over future funding we will legislate when parliamentary time allow to increase tuition fee cap automatically in the future link to quality we will not allow institution that do not take quality seriously make their student pay more charge full fee will be conditional on high quality teaching balance stability for university with fairness for student and taxpayer within this white paper be challenge to our university to build on what make they great drive up access drive out low quality provision improve collaboration and push forward innovation deliver the research breakthrough that will revitalise our economy and feed that energy back into our local community we will support every young person to take the pathway that be right for they technical academic or vocational but will not accept their have no pathway at all far too many of our young people find themselves not in employment education or training from there they become isolated from society disconnect from success and their hope fade and that must change we will strengthen the part play by school in the transition to education we will improve accountability with big role for strategic authority and we will introduce new guarantee any or year old not in education or training will automatically get place at local provider will not let opportunity slip away just as those young people be get go in life the white paper deliver on that promise to our young people to give they the skill that they need but the task of revitalise our skill system be not the isolated work of one department or another it be the collective undertaking of local and national leader together with our workforce business and trade union it be mission lead government in action and the prize be huge opportunity for our young people growth for our economy and renewal for our nation commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement will start with level if they be continuation of the reform that we begin to simplify the qualification landscape welcome it but without the white paper it be hard to understand whether that be the case there be fundamental question regard the announcement that the statement do not answer so hope the secretary of state will be able to shed some light on they today be level simply rebrande continuation of the reform that we begin or be they completely new qualification that will take year to develop what be happen with btec cambridge technical and other applied general qualification be they all be scrap if so what be the timeline for that the secretary of state say that she will consolidate qualification but into how many how will employer be involve in shape the new course as say in oral question early be deeply concern by report today about the introduction of the so call low level qualification aim specifically at white working class people there have long be term for that in education policy the soft bigotry of low expectation we reject that let be clear if this be plan it be an insult be we really say that white working class child be less capable of achieve the same qualification as their peer or that the answer to disadvantage be to lower expectation rather than to raise ambition we should aspire to the good qualification teacher and outcome for those from disadvantaged background we should not hard bake the acceptance of second well into government policy will the secretary of state guarantee that pupil who fail their english or math gcse will be expect to retake they or be she content to assign they to second tier qualification will she ensure that every single pupil whatever their background can expect to be support to achieve the same high standard the truth be that under labour young people be be badly let down youth unemployment be rise and job prospect be sink as result of this government choice the conservatives have clear plan to put an end to debt trap low quality degree and to double the budget for apprenticeship labour plan be all over the place at the labour party conference the prime minister declare that the ambition for of young people to go to university be not right for our time the prime minister clearly have not be pay attention as he abolish target that the conservatives have already get rid of what be more today plan as set out would mean two third of young people would be in high level learning but as understand it with only in high technical education or apprenticeship that would increase the proportion of those go to university from to around only prime minister like this one could abolish target that do not exist then accidentally announce one that go far than the non existent target he just pretend to get rid of it be rather rich for the secretary of state to boast that she have take decisive action to fix university finance the house will forgive if take that with pinch of salt before the election she promise that graduate will pay less under labour well it turn out that they will pay more quite lot more and every penny of the extra cost this year be swallow by labour national insurance job tax to be absolutely clear the rise in tuition fee be spending commitment as it cost the exchequer significant sum the cost do not just fall on student it fall on the taxpayer too when we be in government we introduce level and degree level apprenticeship and put english and math at the heart of all vocational qualification because that be what ensure that young people have the good start in life all this government be do be embed the soft bigotry of low expectation in our system and do nothing to help young people with debt trap degree it be not good enough it be real shame that the right hon lady can not bring herself to welcome anything that we have announce today it be par for the course that be how she like to do thing in government the conservatives talk about how they value education their record be very different of course the difference between record and rhetoric be the difference between our party and it be clear for all to see we be invest million more in further education while college be cut to the bone under the tories we be put real focus on vocational education and fe restore their esteem give they proper respect and simplify the qualification landscape that the tories make even more muddled and we be secure the future of our world renowne university do not hear whether the right hon lady accept disagree welcome or do not support what have set out today about university funding if she do not support it would like to know how she intend to safeguard our world lead university into the future as usual we hear plenty from the right hon lady about debt trap degree we often hear lot of talk about low value course or mickey mouse degree with an answer never give as to which young people should not be go to university which course that apply to or which institution she have in mind when she make sweeping generalisation of that kind it be always work class kid and other people child who will lose out from the snobbery that come from say that education be not for people like they this labour government will deliver world lead university system alongside brilliant technical and vocational route so that all our young people have access to brilliant career and training opportunity include throughout their life this be about choice for young people and find the route and the path that be good for they this labour government say to young people further study be important it be for you it matter to we and it should matter to you as well that be why we be bring change to the qualification landscape in answer to the right hon lady question we believe that level be welcome and important addition to the qualification landscape they provide high quality technical qualification with strong work placement alongside they and sit alongside well establish level but the rest of the system alongside that be missing we be make sure that we have good strong route through level that young people will be able to combine with level study that be for those young people who be not quite so clear at the age of whether they want to specialise in one particular area as the right hon lady will know level be the equivalent of three level and it require young people at the age of to make definitive choice about the future of their career we want to ensure that there be range of high quality option so that those qualification will move towards become part of the new level system we will launch consultation on how we deliver that and we be keen to hear from business as part of that the right hon lady ask about gcses and english and math resit and she criticise our plan to get more young people through their english and math gcse in order to do that there have to be stepping stone to make it happen an endless cycle of unnecessary resit be not the way to support more young people include those from disadvantaged background to get english or math gcse she and her party be happy to consign generation of young people to failure endless resit and sense of desperation we want to ensure that they make progress and master the basic then move on to get that good strong gcse pass this government will ensure that all our young people have the opportunity and chance that they need to get on the conservatives might be determined to ensure that few young people have the chance to go on to university and that our business do not have the skill they need but this labour government will ensure that apprenticeship start be there with good strong fe option alongside our world lead university that be what this white paper be all about call the chair of the education committee thank the secretary of state for her statement welcome the government focus on further education and skill which have be overlook for far too long and be critical to the delivery of the government mission my committee have recently undertake an inquiry into fe and skill and be pleased to see number of our recommendation reflect in the statement particularly in the commitment to address the vortex of failure in which the current system of english and math resit trap far too many young people welcome the priority of increase the quality of further education but there be two key contributor to quality that the secretary of state do not mention in her statement the first be the pay gap between teacher in school and teacher in fe college which be barrier to recruitment and retention for college the second be the inability of fe college to reclaim vat situation for which my committee find no justification and which city college norwich tell we make the difference of whole floor to new building that it have recently complete how do the secretary of state plan to ensure that the further education sector have not only the policy framework to improve quality but the necessary resource be grateful to the chair of the education committee we continue to keep all such matter under review and can be clear with she that we believe that further education college be engine of growth and opportunity in our community this white paper be about ensure prestigious world class system in which we will reform initial training in further education continue to invest in whole career professional development for fe teacher and build tie with industry to ensure that fe teacher have the great opportunity to develop their teaching skill and subject expertise to help young people to achieve and thrive alongside that we will match that support with appropriate challenge so that we continue to raise the bar on standard through the new ofsted system with the backstop of the fe commissioner call the liberal democrat spokesperson too thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement there be far too much in this white paper to respond to comprehensively in two minute so let focus on three critical issue the first issue be level the secretary of state talk about end confusion yet she be introduce new qualification that sound remarkably like btec they be flexible sector base and can mix with level btec already work student take they last year of university accept they and one in five uk worker have one if we be recreate btec why scrap they first we should keep both until so that we can compare outcome level reach uptake after five year so let we not repeat that mistake the second issue be lifelong learning the secretary of state rightly speak about the work mother need to upskill but will the support be sufficient to make that real the lifelong learning entitlement be welcome but the government have cut apprenticeship include those in shortage profession such as nursing and social work what confidence do the government have that their lle can cover the cost of provide that vocational education particularly in subject with high operating cost the third issue be the international student levy we support maintenance grant another manifesto commitment we make that the government have adopt but fund they by tax international student be self defeat this be incredibly tricky to model but analysis show that the levy could cut up to domestic student place over five year and reduce our economy by billion that be not help disadvantaged student will the secretary of state make the modelling transparent and promise that opportunity will not be narrow by the levy there be many more question but appreciate that do not have time to ask they all there be much to welcome in this white paper ambition but we must guard against unintended consequence and miss opportunity the lib dems stand ready to work with the government to get this right be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question level will replace around qualification for to year old at level the current system be fragment with vast array of qualification that be too difficult for employer and young people to navigate so we will introduce new level that be new vocational option that will sit alongside level and level at level to make sure we have the right qualification mix available for young people we will keep fund for most exist qualification in place until new level and other qualification come in but fund for all qualification in other level area under review will continue on the current timeline we will confirm the list of qualification that will have funding remove soon turn to the lifelong learning entitlement this be an important change that will transform the student finance system in england it will broaden access to high quality flexible education include for adult who want to go back into education it will launch in academic year for learner study course that start on or after january this will allow learner to use the new entitlement more flexibly than ever before to fund individual module as well as full course at level to regardless of whether they be provide by college university or independent provider the hon gentleman ask about international student and the international student levy to be clear international student make an important contribution to our country our community our town and city and our society however do think it be right that with the contribution we be seek through the international student levy we will be able to reinvest in new target maintenance grant for domestic student while welcome the hon gentleman support for the introduction of such new grant the liberal democrats will have to set out how they intend to pay for they rise order we will have just another minute or so of question because we have big debate later so colleague must keep their question short the previous government try hard to take hatchet to many vocational course reflect how little they value those hugely important subject and skill can the minister confirm that the new level qualification show that this government have listen to the education sector employer and student and will allow more young people great choice in achieve their pathway to successful future yes that be right level will offer genuine choice for young people to pursue several interest before specialise they will sit alongside level and level and will be link to the skill and knowledge that employer tell we they need and the career that young people wish to pursue this be an important step forward one that will ensure all of our young people have good range of option available to they have five child understand that not everybody learn the same way as all my child be different however what consideration have be give to the position of student with special educational need and disability and the rurality of constituency such as mine which can pose challenge yes on both point recognise the challenge that people in rural community sometimes face in access work placement and we continue to work with business and college to make sure they be available for level course on support for child with send many of our fe college already lead the way on what good provision look like they be an important step for many young people make that transition at include from specialist provision into mainstream provision as part of our wide send reform we want to make sure that child journey from early year through the school system and into further education and beyond work with those moment of key transition our fe college have critical role to play in that exeter have fantastic tertiary college exeter college which thank to this government will be technical excellence college for construction we also have an exceptional specialist math school that provide excellent math physics and computing education which be skill we really need in the south west how will these reform raise standard for every child in exeter to help make sure they reach their full potential technical excellence college include those in my hon friend community will act as hub of excellence that will raise standard across the fe sector each tec hub will offer advanced facility expert staff and high quality curriculum develop with the industry this will also allow other provider and business to meet the need of high growth sector include construction the government say that they want to simplify the system but the reality be that fund for further education remain chronically low will the secretary of state look again at further education funding stream for example let college reclaim vat as school with sixth form do and extend the pupil premium to level be grateful to the hon lady for her suggestion for further education we will invest nearly million extra in to funding next year alongside capital investment of over billion to support the expansion of capacity modernisation of college estate and delivery of training in the area of great need however there be more that we need to do especially in provide support for young people who be neet that be why today white paper set out our direction for make sure that all young people have good route into employment education and training this be timely set of proposal in an area that be too often overlook by government in my constituency further education have not function properly since the tories fail top down review of education in cheshire lead to the closure of the main fe campus neet level in winsford be now five percentage point high than the borough wide average to this end the propose enhance support for and year old to take up education or training and stay engaged will be critical what role can the secretary of state see the mayoral combined authority have in set the strategic direction and provide governance for education in place such as mid cheshire we do think there be an important role for our mayoral strategic authority especially when it come to support college and make sure we have good link up between college and business would be happy to look in more detail at the situation my hon friend outline the secretary of state have claim today that she be expand opportunity while raise tuition fee and cut international baccalaureate funding for sixth form in bexley with little notice who do she consult on the decision to cut ib funding what analysis be undertake and will she apologise to the school across the uk leave in limbo by her reckless approach to education as say next year we will invest million extra in funding we have seek to refocus the large programme uplift that sit alongside that investment on math and stem for those study four or more level because we think that be important for our industrial strategy priority but there will be transitional protection for those school affect student will still be able to study for the ib and school will be welcome and able to offer it through the funding stream they receive be delighted that bedford college have be name one of new construction technical excellence college back by million of government investment to train the skilled professional that the uk need for housing and infrastructure also welcome today measure to strengthen vocational qualification the new qualification to well prepare student for gcse english and math resit be positive but can the secretary of state confirm that those qualification will be fully fund give the current financial pressure on fe college we be invest more in further education with million extra next year we be also commit to establish more technical excellence college on top of the construction tecs launch in august include bedford as my hon friend mention those technical excellence college will act as hub of excellence raise standard across the sector and provide more opportunity for young people to move into career such as those in construction relate field that be why we have also bring in new foundation apprenticeship to give more young people the chance to understand broad range of offer within an area before decide to specialise as young people will now have to choose between level and the new level can the secretary of state explain what be the main distinguishing feature of the two qualification and what in broad term be the likely difference in career outcome the new system will involve level level and level level represent three level level be already well understand by many people in this country while level be relatively new addition but very high quality technical route alongside level there will be level these will not replace the large scale programme that level offer but will provide opportunity for young people to combine study of both academic and vocational qualification particularly those young people who be not quite clear at exactly which area they wish to specialise in this will allow for combination of study strongly welcome this strategy today particularly the commitment that the prime minister and the secretary of state have make to guarantee all year old college place however will she commit to work towards close the legislative gap where child between the age of five and with send can access home to school transport as can those with send from age to but between the age of and there be currently no statutory provision for they to have home to school transport an estimated one in seven disabled young people equate to people be unable to access college this year alone as result recognise the passion and expertise that my hon friend bring to this subject and would be happy to discuss that issue with she in more detail perhaps the big single barrier that prevent young people from rural community such as mine access vocational study through fe college be that they live so far away and travel cost fortune for student live in appleby kirkby stephen coniston or windermere it can cost they year to get to kendal barrow lancaster or penrith what will the secretary of state do to put an end to that barrier to young people stay in further education recognise the additional barrier that exist around transport which be particular challenge in rural community sadly although not uniquely in rural community that be part of the reason why this government be bring forward wide range reform include to our bus network to make sure that it serve the interest of community business and student much more effectively gather from my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister sit next to on the front bench that extra investment be go into rural bus service in his and the hon gentleman part of the world warmly welcome this statement one of the most shameful legacy of the last year in peterborough have be the rise number of young people leave school with no qualification and no hope with neet up and apprenticeship down skill be not just good for growth but good for hope good for young people good for their parent and good for community one of the most difficult part in the whole vocational network be the navigation that employer and young people have to do with career service which have be break over the past year can my right hon friend tell we more about how career service and good quality advice will be at the heart of reinvigorate vocational qualification in peterborough and the country my hon friend always champion young people in peterborough and the need to take action in this area we will ensure that young people have good career guidance and work experience the white paper also set out an automatic backstop for all year old that guarantee they further education place in reserve that will ensure that young people at risk of drop out of education be give place and wraparound support because we know that the fast we work with young people the more likely it be that that will be effective that run alongside strengthen requirement on school to make sure that their pupil have place in provision the secretary of state say that she want to see empower nhs staff with the right skill to deliver transformed service with which absolutely agree level apprenticeship such as those provide by cranfield university in mid bedfordshire be so important to deliver that but the department for education have cut funding to level apprenticeship mean that the department of health and social care will be fund ongoing provision do the secretary of state think it be responsible for she to balance the book of her department on the back of the nhs it be right that we refocus our skill system on young people and that be what we have do through the change that the hon member mention we have also make sure that continue to be eligible for the level funding that he talk about but make no apology for refocus the system on young people and their opportunity and be make sure they have every chance to get on my constituency be bless with two world class university and an excellent further education college that provide range of degree apprenticeship and qualification recently meet the samee charity which provide structured training programme for young people with learn difficulty to get into self employment can the secretary of state tell how this white paper support those type of training programme and support those young people to thrive it be good to hear about the provision that exist in her community in bournemouth we know that we need range of option for young people whether through further education or independent training provider also recognise the critical role that many who sit outside of formal system can play in support young people whether through mentor or ongoing support particularly those who have have difficult experience in life and be furth away from the labour market the education secretary focus today be on the new vocational qualification training which will be welcome for student in england in wales however where her party have lead the government for the past year the apprenticeship budget have be cut by will she be lobby the chancellor ahead of the budget to ensure that wales have fair funding settlement that would support apprenticeship wales and scotland both secure the big post devolution settlement that we have ever see yet they still continue to be against they thank the secretary of state for her announcement today particularly the plan increase in tuition fee and maintenance loan which will be warmly welcome by student and the two world class university on my patch the university of sheffield and hallam university will the secretary of state join in affirm that the government be commit to ensure equal access and full support for the disadvantaged will they explore whether we can address adequate maintenance support for child by increase it in line with the cost of living will no specific pathway be exclude allow student to have opportunity and drive economic growth my hon friend always champion the fantastic institution in her community and know the important role that they play in sheffield and the wide region provide job training and opportunity not just for our young people but for adult return to education that be why we have today take the decision to increase fee give institution the certainty they need while provide more support around maintenance loan and start the process of introduce new target maintenance grant for less well off student should add that as part of this reform we be also announce additional support for care leaver they will be automatically eligible for the maximum maintenance loan that welcome step will provide big support to some of the most vulnerable child in our country the secretary of state praise the fantastic fe staff and describe fe college as no long cinderella service but rather system of high esteem how do she propose to do that while still maintain the pay gap for fe staff compare with teacher in other educational setting recognise the challenge there it develop over many year and we as government inherit that we be invest more this year in further education and there will be million more next year into education which will make big difference but recognise the ongoing need to support our brilliant staff work in fe whether they be teach staff or support staff through our improve education together partnership in the department for education we be ensure that their voice be hear as part of the reform we be take forward welcome the secretary of state statement and the government continue commitment to promote vocational and technical education which be welcome can she outline how the white paper will address the capacity issue that lot of college and sixth form be experience include in my constituency that will help we get that neet rate down recognise the challenge that we have see in part because of the big number of to year old we have come through the system that be why we be prioritise invest in funding for our college and ensure we have more capital available to create the place that be necessary work with local area run alongside that be our technical excellence college which will drive up standard spread good practice and be hub of excellence in their region work with other college medium report but not the statement talk about the resit regime for english and math and hope that the young people who fail to achieve the grade but who thrive with functional skill be not listen to the shadow minister dismiss their achievement be the secretary of state aware that young people achieve in year be force to retake but if they achieve they be allow to take functional skill where young person fail second time there be no funding for college to move they across into that other pathway recognise what be come up but the young people in the system now need some urgent attention so that they do not fall into doom loop will she comment on that we want to ensure that more young people secure good strong gcse in english or math but we recognise that if someone secure grade in august and be then expect to resit full gcse matter of month later that be not likely to lead to the good outcome that we want to see we have focus on improve the teaching of english and math in further education and we have issue new guidance to give institution clear direction however think it right for we to help young people to secure firm foundation in the basic through the new qualification and then move on to gcse that sit alongside the change we be make for adult in respect of occupational standard to allow more of they to complete their apprenticeship as well constituent have write to to highlight that they have successfully complete level btec diploma in musical theatre to go on to university they need an extended diploma third year but their college will not let they do it because they have not achieve grade in gcse math which their university course would not require anyway so my constituent be be hold back from degree and career as result of not pass an exam in an unrelated subject how can we break down these barrier so that young people be not hold back in life we do want to ensure that more young people obtain that strong gcse pass at grade or above but about third of year old do not achieve that at present and sadly the number be even high among white working class pupil who be more than twice as likely as their more affluent peer to need to resit their exam that be something that we absolutely must tackle but if my hon friend will give some more information will be happy to look at the case in that wide context welcome the announcement that the government be enhance their provision of vocational qualification but when will the secretary of state outline dedicated strategy for young people with learn difficulty and disability recently hold heartbreaking roundtable with young people with learn disability in eyres monsell in my constituency although they have be do work experience for year when it come to give they full time work our corporate supermarket let they down they want to work they be able to work and with the right support they will work recognise what the hon gentleman have say and have hear of similar experience from my constituent and family across the country who have speak about the need to reform the send system across the board throughout education we want to build on what be already work well in provision to ensure that more of that successful transition can happen for young people with send we will provide more detail in the school white paper but want to acknowledge the incredible work that many fe college already do in support that transition we be continue to invest through the internship work consortium to ensure that support internship be there for young people who need they in my constituency major employer offer excellent apprenticeship but the number of place be limited they have tell that they would welcome the ability to share unsuccessful application with similar employer such as small and medium sized enterprise in their supply chain rather than their be lose to the system what can the education secretary do to encourage such collaboration between employer to boost the take up of high quality apprenticeship my hon friend set out what sound like an interesting and useful approach to allow employer to work together more effectively but we also want to see more collaboration between college and between college and university the white paper set out vision for more coherent system that will be easy for both student and employer to navigate but would be happy to hear more from my hon friend about the work that be go on in his constituency and to establish whether there be any wide lesson that we can take into the department to look into what more can be do torquay boys grammar school have long deliver the international baccalaureate my own eld son george have benefit from that and under the scheme have volunteer in care home he be now on the cusp of become registrar for care of the elderly during my meeting with the head of torquay boys last friday he express particular concern about the impact of the lack of social mobility and the impact on the ability to deliver language will the secretary of state think again about these cut to the international baccalaureate we be talk about relatively small number of student college and school will retain the freedom to decide what study programme they wish to offer their student but we as government have decide to reprioritise the large programme uplift on industrial strategy priority involve for example those study for four or more level in stem subject include further math we think that be the right decision but there will be transitional protection for institution that currently offer the international baccalaureate welcome the statement include the key commitment to break down barrier to opportunity to enable young people to gain the education that they deserve this new focus will also support the employer who have be consistently talk to about the skill challenge they face particularly those relate to vocational skill however kid in my constituency be often lock out of vital opportunity simply because of the lack of transport what work be the secretary of state do with transport colleague to challenge that barrier and ensure that those young people in my rural constituency have access to those technical qualification recognise the challenge that my hon friend have mention it be of course challenge for rural community in particular but it often affect area that be not rural because of our fragmented transport network and the lack of join up between transport system and the increase lack of bus service we as government be take action in respect of bus service to provide more opportunity for young people to get to college in order to study but also to grow business have see some fantastic work lead by many of our mayor to bring together well offer for young people to allow they to travel to place of study and to work placement and to gain access to other opportunity that be model that those in other area might be able to consider in the future welcome the government focus on vocational skill but fear that school in my constituency will struggle to keep pace with qualification change and that be too soon for the transition to level to be complete college such as esher sixth form college deliver btec and have do so successfully for many year what assurance can the secretary of state give to those college that they will be support in that transition and how exactly will it be implement by there will be consultation to which business representative of the education sector and other will be able to contribute we want to ensure that we get this right but we believe that it be necessary to simplify the vast array of qualification at level through vocational route and to align those route well with level study as well recently have the pleasure of visit north kent college in gravesend which be one of the new construction technical excellence college the announcement of the new level be welcome step give vocational education real parity of esteem with academic and technical route can the secretary of state assure however that the assessment of level will involve physically demonstrate competence such as practical or placement examination and build portfolio of evidence rather than exam base memory test which do not reflect real life will she meet to discuss that far would be happy to meet my hon friend and be delighted that north kent college will be one of our first new technical excellence college that will give young people in her community and beyond the chance to obtain well pay secure job in one of the government key area as we seek to build more home would be happy to discuss far with she the reform that we intend to introduce and there will be full consultation in which people will be able to take part welcome the statement in blackburn have be work with our college and jobcentre to help young people access real opportunity but in town such as mine which be among the most deprived in the country it be not talent but investment that be lack what strategy will the secretary of state employ to ensure that skill funding truly reach place such as blackburn and will she meet to discuss the serious shortage of esol space which be cause many constituent to wait for up to year out of work we be invest more in further education and also in our school system but we recognise that one in seven young people age between and be not in education employment or training we urgently need to bring that figure down because every single day we see the consequence of that failure both for the individual young person and for our wide economy that be why many of the measure in the white paper be about how we can give young people the support that they need if the hon gentleman write to will respond to his specific point about esol should draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as governor of sixth form college in stoke on trent and as chair of the all party parliamentary group on sixth form education the level provide an exciting opportunity for vocational qualification and the secretary of state be right to praise college but she will know that those same college be deeply worried about the defunding of btec and what that mean for student choice in the academic year will she give commitment from the dispatch box that btec funding will continue until level be in place and if she can not can she explain what young people access further education next year will be able to look to before they be in place student wish to study for large qualification should study for level where they be on offer but to ease the transition to level the dfe will retain funding for qualification with guide learning hour or below in level area until the new level be introduce for that area so we will be keep fund for most exist qualification we will keep that in place until the new level and other qualification come in and we will confirm the list of qualification that will have funding remove in due course we have new technical excellence college new defence academy and new clean energy college but not in scotland because further education and skill be devolve to the scottish government the scottish auditor general report publish this month show that funding for scottish college have be cut by do the secretary of state agree that only scottish labour can stop the snp systemically hollow out scottish college and rob scot of all age of opportunity include in my west dunbartonshire constituency agree very strongly with my hon friend as he say college in scotland have have real term funding cut in this parliamentary session accord to new report from audit scotland and the snp government have be accuse of guillotine the sector that go hand in hand with few opportunity for apprenticeship for our young people with start fall by nearly third in eight year under the snp government and that be before we even get on to their terrible record on the incredibly wide attainment gap and the shocking outcome for working class child across scotland that be why scotland now more than ever need new first minister in the shape of anas sarwar nearly of knowsley to year old be not in employment education or training one of the high rate in the country so very much welcome today statement by the way level leave not just my constituency but the whole borough of knowsley under the last tory government so we will take no lesson in aspiration for young working class people from they can the secretary of state tell how the measure outline in the white paper will ensure that knowsley young people get the opportunity their potential deserve one of the measure outline in today white paper be an automatic backstop for all year old that guarantee they further education place in reserve so that young people at risk of drop out get wraparound support to ensure that they remain in education or training we know that if we do not get that support in place ahead of the start of the academic year we will see big drop off and we also know the damage that that do throughout people life my hon friend consistently champion the need for expand provision in her constituency and as commit in oral question early would be happy to discuss that far with she point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker will not seek to repeat discussion from the urgent question early nor will repeat the comment that have be make about on social medium but may seek your advice on how member on both side of the house can be

government of mauritius hold under the provision of annex of the treaty to the presence of any indian or chinese civilian or military security force in the chagos archipelago it be pleasure to see you in the chair madam chairman and to speak to the amendment that stand in my name and in the name of other right hon and hon member as we open this committee of the whole house to debate labour chagos surrender bill it have be more than year since the surrender of the chagos island be announce with the prime minister the then foreign secretary now the deputy prime minister and the attorney general wave the white flag of surrender and put the demand of their left wing lawyer friend above the british national interest since then labour have deny this house vote on the whole treaty under the day process in the constitutional reform and governance act and have keep detail secret from we over in mauritius the prime minister of that country have be brag about how he squeeze concession after concession after concession out of labour it be shameful that we have find out more about the treaty from debate in the mauritius parliament and statement by its politician than from ministers accountable to this house it have be five month since the prime minister of this country sign away billion of british taxpayer money stumble through press conference rather than come to this house to face scrutiny and challenge at time of serious fiscal challenge for the public finance labour have impose billion surrender tax on our country money that could fund public service here in britain or support an easing of the tax burden instead it will be hand over to foreign government who be use this resource to cut taxis for their citizen not only be it shameful but ministers have try to pull the wool over the eye of the british people by use accountancy methodology and valuation to try to show far low cost even then it be an extraordinary figure of billion the chancellor may struggle with number but the british people do not they can add up and they see what the real cost of this be on top of that ministers still can not tell we from which budget in the foreign commonwealth and development office and the ministry of defence the money will come be the simple truth not that this deal be cheap than what be propose by the conservative party in government and actually have more protection bake into it think the hon gentleman need little memory check because we do not propose deal the british chagossians some of whom be watch from the gallery pay tribute to they for their dignified and strong campaigning over many many year have be betray by labour their right have be ignore as have their fear lead to hundred flee mauritius and come here labour surrender bill as present do nothing for they it do nothing for the marine protect area one of the most important and large marine environment in the world which have be protect while under british sovereignty and have become centre for scientific research and development that be at risk and promise and aspiration announce by minister to ensure that it continue be not reflect in the bill shockingly labour surrender bill as draft do nothing to safeguard defend and protect our national security labour be surrender british sovereignty and territory to country that be increasingly align with china the right hon lady describe this as surrender bill can she please tell which flag will be fly over the chagos island if this be so call british surrender it will be british flag that be fly be that point she understand there will be one flag that be fly and that be the white flag of surrender thousand of mauritian public official be be train or should that be china on course the chinese be pay for both russia and china be sign partnership with mauritius but labour surrender bill fail to protect our interest report today suggest that china and india be enter into negotiation to sign lease to island surround those on which british military operation will continue under the propose lease agreement do she think that connection to china would be risk and pose threat to national security my hon friend be right and that be one of the reason why we oppose this bill and have do so from the very start the promise give by ministers that nothing can happen in the chagos archipelago that threaten our interest be already be undermine mauritius be in discussion with india about security role that it can play in the archipelago and the uk be not even in the room if these discussion with friendly country be take place without the uk one can only wonder what discussion be take place in secret with china and russia there have be report that china be already negotiate with mauritius for peros banhos when he speak perhaps the minister can tell we what he know about that want to say on that point that this be absolute nonsense be the shadow minister willing to provide any evidence that that be go to take place this treaty protect the security of the outer island and expressly prohibit foreign force build basis on they something on which her government do not succeed in their negotiation be grateful to the minister but can he actually give the reassurance that no discussion be take place perhaps he can answer that question when he respond to the debate later the promise give by ministers that nothing can happen in the chagos archipelago that threaten our interest be already be undermine if these discussion with friendly country be take place without the uk can only wonder what discussion be take place in secret if such discussion be take place that would undermine the assurance ministers have give to this house and be an act of bad faith on the part of mauritius the house know that this government kowtow to the chinese communist party lead it to threaten our interest here now they be fail to take seriously the warning about china and the threat it pose to diego garcia our military asset and our interest in the indo pacific my right hon friend have highlight the prime minister misleading perhaps have to say inadvertently misleading we about the cost of this when the government actuary department have show that it be billion more than that he be suggest in his press conference that china russia and other order the right hon member may like to rethink his word about the prime minister bow to you ms nokes have misrepresent think be allow to say that no oh can not say misrepresented have inadvertently confuse the billion that be actually go out with the billion he claim be go out the prime minister equally inadvertently ms nokes make out that china iran and russia be in the column he use the word those oppose this deal although think each and every one of they come out publicly to say how much they welcome it can my right hon friend share any knowledge about that with we think my right hon friend make some very interesting point and perhaps not surprisingly one might ask the question be the government sleep with the enemy here will the shadow minister give way if the minister will allow will just finish this point the key thing we be ask for be reassurance from the minister and he will have more than ample opportunity later to respond to the point be make thank the shadow minister for give way but she and the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart have raise china russia and iran why do she think that the united states our close security ally back this deal if there be any possibility of any of the fantasy thing she be suggest take place they can not take place because the treaty prevent they she clearly have not read it it can be very easy to back something when you do not have to pay for it but let we move on now the government be fail to take seriously the warning about china and the threat it pose to diego garcia and our military asset and interest in the indo pacific labour surrender bill be bad for british taxpayer bad for our national security bad for the marine environment and bad for the chagossians it also grant ministers huge power to make further decision and avoid parliamentary scrutiny amendment would in effect block labour surrender treaty come into force and the dissolution of the british indian ocean territory unless and until minister reveal the legal advice they have receive about britain ability to extend and exercise sovereign right over diego garcia after the initial year period the government constantly claim they have secure the military base but they have totally fail to do that all they have do be pay mauritius billion to lease back base we currently own but only for year we have no certainty whatsoever about the fate of the base after the year period after pay mauritius billion it would kindly give we the option to extend the treaty for another year but on what term if we extend it will mauritius make it conditional on more extortionate payment what if we be outbid by hostile power in fact what be to stop china put in bid if no agreement be reach before the specify deadline and the base be offer to another country what will happen to all the fix asset belong to britain we have have no answer from the government on any of these vital point which be unacceptable and the term of the treaty and the bill as they stand be reckless amendment be necessary because the government legal justification for surrender the chagos island constantly shift because it have no legal basis as my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright explain on second reading the government entire legal case be spurious many of we have be ask where the bind judgment we be constantly tell be inevitable would actually come from no credible answer have be forthcoming we know it can not be the international court of justice and we know that case at the international tribunal for the law of the sea would see the uk able to put forward decent legal argument then the government completely contradict their own argument about the electromagnetic spectrum they be plan to dissolve strategically invaluable british overseas territory and they can not even tell we on what legal basis they be do so it look as though this be part of wide sinister picture the government relationship with china we know that the government be desperate for chinese investment to help grow our economy which they be trash with their reckless economic policy the deputy prime minister of mauritius have credit china for its support in enable mauritius to gain sovereignty over the chagos island why because china want to deepen its strategic partnership with mauritius which it believe to have strategic advantage once again the prime minister do not have the backbone to stand up for our strategic interest against china amendment would flush out the truth once and for all take together amendment and would delete huge and unacceptable henry viii power that the government be brazenly try to award themselves and would give this house the oversight it be entitle to on the implementation of the treaty it be wholly unacceptable in fact it be quite outrageous for the government to give themselves such sweeping power that they could through an order in council make any provision that appear to his majesty to be appropriate as result of the treaty this be totally open end power the military base itself be in scope and so be the right of chagossians the house should not be deprive of voice on these matter of huge concern our amendment would ensure that this house have voice and vote that be totally right and proper turn to our new clause the government could have insert money authorisation clause into the bill they choose not to and no wonder the government want to spare their own disgruntle mps the ugly spectacle of have to vote in favour of spend ten of billion of their constituent money to mauritius as britain economy sink under the weight of the chancellor inflation unemployment debt and taxis labour be ask the hard press british taxpayer already struggle under the weight of the chancellor punitive tax rise to stump up billion to lease back territory we already own and which we be not legally oblige to give away as it leave pensioner vulnerable and cold destroy family farm and crush business the minister be content to send our constituent hard earn money to mauritius with no string attach allow the government there to cut taxis tax cut over mile away and tax rise at home and labour be inflict this surrender tax on the british people because of its abject failure to negotiate we all know that when labour negotiate britain lose but this be new low at seemingly every twist and turn this government have roll over and capitulate to the demand of the government of mauritius the right hon lady mention that she do not believe there be legal basis what be the legal basis for the previous government when they conduct round of negotiation and achieve absolutely nothing be not sure where the hon gentleman have be for the past year and several month but we have go over this time and again in this chamber there be no legal basis we maybe will repeat this very slowly for his benefit we stop the negotiation thank the shadow minister for give way but must ms nokes correct the record here this have be repeat argument by the shadow minister and other claim that the then government stop the negotiation they do not in fact they carry they on there be statement on february reflect the continuing of the negotiation by the former prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak indeed they carry on into may just before the election it be there in writing on the previous government own website we have make it very clear repeatedly at the dispatch box lord cameron the then foreign secretary stop the negotiation rise be go to make some more progress my right hon friend be do very good job of forensically demolish the government case such as it be may just correct what the minister have say from the dispatch box there be very great difference between carry on and discuss negotiation and do deal as be the deputy foreign secretary under both my right hon friend the member for braintree sir james cleverly and my noble friend lord cameron can tell the house that the then government would never ever have do this deal secondly do hope my right hon friend will probe the minister far on where this extraordinary amount of money be come from be it the defence budget or be it the development budget since the labour party labour government have slash development spending from order that be very long intervention perhaps the shadow minister should take over my right hon and gallant friend and constituency neighbour make some very very important point he add certain weight and clarity to these discussion and urge labour members certainly the new member to listen to his wise counsel the house of commons should be give vote on the payment and that be the purpose of this amendment in scope will also be the chagossian trust fund which inexplicably british taxpayer capitalise and mauritius then distribute we pay and mauritius have total control over how it be spend we will have no say over its governance and british chagossians have no guarantee that they will benefit from it how can that be right the least this house and british chagossians deserve be vote on send the money what possible explanation could the government provide against that the former government set up trust fund of million for the chagos islander after four year only have be spend that be how they treat chagossians under the last government the point though be where be this money come from this house have not have vote where be the transparency where be the democracy turn to new clause and amendment as we have already discuss the duration of the agreement be matter of serious national security concern there be too many unanswered question about what could happen to the base we need to understand the basis on which the government have settle that especially as the then foreign secretary tell this house on october that the government would have right to extend the lease which we do not and the mauritian government claim the uk give up unilateral right of extension at their request if that be true it would be scandal no wonder we never get straight answer from ministers but then it be also scandal for labour to sign the agreement with previous mauritian government just before that country go into an election only for there to be change of government who then want to change the deal and extract more money extend the agreement be essential because we simply can not lose the base the house deserve to see the advice that the government be rely on when they ask we to sign this billion blank cheque do my right hon friend agree that under the bill if there be no agreement although we can be first offer mauritius can decide simply to close and fold the base leave it completely void so there be no protection against that my hon friend be right this go to the heart of the bill there be so many unanswered question which conservative members have be raise time and again for example how likely be we to be able to extend the base what will the structure of the negotiation be what condition could mauritius impose give that it will have our negotiator over proverbial barrel how watertight be the first right of refusal will the right hon lady give way will make little more progress what happen if the base be not secure will it need to be decommission how could we prevent an adversary inherit our fix asset what be the role of the united states in all this these be serious matter and the house need serious answer the purpose of the amendment be to secure those answer in this house there be often talk about million of pound for this and billion of pound for that it be difficult sometimes to get in one mind the scale of the money last year the chancellor say that she be go to raise national insurance and low the threshold we know how much damage that have do to the country yet it be say at the time that it would raise billion that would not even pay for this deal that be the amount of money they be go to give away today my hon friend make really valid point by put that into context there be only one thing that will result from the government insist on push this through tax rise reiterate my early point that we still do not know which budget the money be come from fcdo or mod who be go to pay for it new clause will give parliament vote over the agreement on the chagos marine protect area the chagos mpa be one of the jewel in the crown of the blue belt programme magnificent achievement of the last conservative government and globally significant contribution to marine protection it should not be alter without consent at present we apply among the strict criterion to the chagos mpa and it have be very well preserve unlike much of the indian ocean which have suffer terribly in recent year will the right hon lady give way on that point will make little more progress we be not talk about small area the british indian ocean territory span square kilometre of ocean the government treaty with mauritius compel the uk to help mauritius to establish and manage new mpa but we be be ask to fly blind with this bill because no agreement have be reach on what the mpa manage by mauritius will look like the marine protection zone be agree by all party it be sustainable protection zone there have never be any debate or dispute about it mauritius have fully support it all along and guarantee its continuation do not understand why the shadow minister be raise these matter do she believe that mauritius will not look after the area properly it seem to that there be an attitude that be disrespectful of mauritius and its determination to preserve the pristine nature of the ocean around the island have to disagree with the right hon gentleman on many of those matter we have raise question about this issue time and again and we have simply not receive the answer from ministers this issue have be dispute be it not the point that the united nations convention on the law of the sea can not pass judgment on sovereignty because of the ruling that be make between mauritius and the uk on marine protection back in that be under annexe vii which be try and test britain be find want on that because we have not properly talk through what should happen with the mauritians what the mauritians actually want to do be to open it for fishing how can we assure the protection for this area that be why we need to amend the bill my hon friend be absolutely right that be exactly why we have continue and will continue to probe the government on the mpa we have not have answer to our question we have not have the transparency that think this house deserve it be very possible in fact it be very likely that labour have commit britain to help mauritius dismantle an mpa that we ourselves establish there be no assurance that we will not be commit british resource to actively harm our own interest and undo our work mauritius do not have the capability to manage monitor or enforce an mpa it do not have the infrastructure at sea or any such experience it would leave the stock in those water expose to real risk of pillaging include by chinese vessel it be not likely to have the will to do so either as we know the economic potential of the water be of interest to mauritius despite the government ludicrous and insulting claim that those who oppose this deal side with russia and its friend mauritius have be develop close tie with russia on marine matter announce as recently as may that the two country be strengthen their tie on marine innovation include marine research while mauritius close relationship with china strategic partnership no less open up the possibility of chinese fishing trawler in these water it be therefore absolutely right that this house get say over the fate of the mpa and the crag equivalent process set out in our new clause would provide for an appropriate level of scrutiny new clause would require regular reporting on the ecological status of the chagos mpa which be necessary for the same reason as new clause the government have bind we to support mauritius to manage the mpa so there must be scrutiny of what the government be do and the ecological consequence there be widespread concern across the house on the future of the mpa and ministers have so far fail to give any answer or any assurance when ask they have say that they do not know about the future and can not tell we what resource and cost will be incur to meet these obligation give our role in manage the mpa the uk should be able to access the datum require for this report this new clause reaffirm our commitment to the mpa we recognise the sensitive nature of the military arrangement on diego garcia but oversight of the agreement be none the less essential new clause would allow for appropriate parliamentary scrutiny while respect the need to protect critical information the new clause cover the key area of security consideration and will act as catalyst for the government to maintain their own monitoring of each area we believe that that be critical as there be hole in the provision there must for example be agreement on upgrade infrastructure in the buffer zone such as sensor but what if there be no agreement likewise the treaty stipulate that mauritius and britain must jointly decide on the management and use of the electromagnetic spectrum of particular importance in new clause be paragraph and on we must ensure that only vessel that should be in the area be in the area and that russian and potentially even chinese vessel be deter from enter have already mention the close tie and partnership between mauritius and those country which should concern all of we with reference to paragraph the treaty state that the united kingdom agree to expeditiously inform mauritius of any armed attack on third state directly emanate from the base on diego garcia give the huge range of security threat in the indo pacific and the middle east it be far from impossible that in future this mechanism may need to be use it be important that the notification be present to the intelligence and security committee as once again it would force the government to log and monitor the mechanism include any operational impact it might have we know that there be genuine concern that third country potentially even china might try to establish themselves in the archipelago and the arrangement in the treaty must be monitor to ensure that they be sufficiently robust to stop that happen new clause probe the government argument that legally bind ruling under unclos would have an impact on our ability to operate the electromagnetic spectrum and impede air and sea access as well as the ability to patrol the area around the base we take issue with that assertion not least because there be an argument that provision under article of unclos allow for exemption relevant to dispute concern military activity the government have not address this issue when we have probe include on second reading so we have have no choice but to table this new clause to test the government assertion turn finally to new clause the british chagossian community have be treat appallingly by this labour government twice the deal have end up in the court because of the way labour have ride roughshod over their concern this bill sell they short too the resettlement programme for the chagos island under this treaty be entirely in the hand of mauritius country to which should add chagossians feel little affinity indeed we have see many chagossians arrive in the uk from mauritius in recent week hope the minister will respond to that from the dispatch box because it be clearly concern that they have be move to take this action the bill also stop british overseas territory citizenship be award on the basis of descent from person bear on the chagos archipelago sadly we can not amend the treaty through the bill it just be not within the parliamentary rule however new clause would require the government to consult the chagossian community on the implementation of the treaty include on the establishment of the trust fund which we capitalise and mauritius distribute and on area of dispute arise between the uk and mauritian governments prior to their being discuss at the joint committee create by the treaty it also require the foreign secretary to present report to parliament within six month of the act become law and in every subsequent year on how chagossian right be be uphold under this agreement we have national obligation and responsibility to the chagossian community and the conservatives will always stand up for their right to conclude take together our amendment and new clause will hold the government to account let we be clear the conservatives oppose this surrender bill its colossal cost and the adverse impact on our defence and security accept these amendment and new clause will simply strengthen accountability and transparency have set out the security and geopolitical importance of the treaty many time in this place and would therefore have appreciate the opportunity today to engage with detailed scrutiny of the treaty and the defence arrangement it enable sadly that be not the line that the opposition be go down instead we be face with series of wreck amendment that do not attempt to improve the bill in any way they be design to force the government to let our ally down undermine our international credibility and reputation and create great geopolitical risk and legal and security risk to our base on diego garcia if opposition amendment be pass today it would be impossible for we to meet our commitment in timely way by implement the agreement with mauritius that ministers have complete an agreement that the conservative government start and carry through round of negotiation but now want to throw back no matter the damage that it would do to our nation at no point have they make clear the legal basis for start the round of negotiation in the first instance fully understand and sympathise with the motivation behind amendment the creation of the chagos island as separate territory create deep injustice because it be bind up in the dispossession of the chagossians but that historical injustice can not simply be undo we can not turn back the clock however much we might want to do so the question of right to return be not remotely simple because access to diego garcia be inevitably serious question of security people obviously can not return to exactly where their family live because of the highly sensitive military facility that now stand in their place perhaps limited right of return could be negotiate but that would engage security procedure that be secret and involve the uk and the us as well as mauritius as be acknowledge by the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton the amendment imago that if the negotiation be reject by even the narrow of margin the entire treaty would fall apart and would need to be renegotiate afresh significantly increase geopolitical risk to the base and our interest perhaps the minister could invite some assistance on this point from those who conduct the first round of negotiation let we get real there be reason why international treaty be negotiate by the government and subject to democratic scrutiny in this house and through these procedure what the liberal democrats be propose amount to make uk foreign and defence policy dependent on referendum and that include vital defence interest that be share with the us and other ally that referendum would apparently comprise non uk citizen just as much as it would british chagossians frankly would have think that the liberal democrats more than other would have learn from the disastrous experience of brexit that make foreign policy by referendum be not the wise course of action rise there be already barrage of misinformation come from the opposition and be not go to invite any more of it to flow across the floor there be multiplicity of bad actor internationally who would benefit from the collapse of this bill and just imagine how many more there would be if we take the course the opposition urge we to take the hon member just say that foreign policy should not be make by referendum do he disagree then with article of the un charter that the right to self determination be core principle in international relation and that we should therefore have referendum for chagos thank the hon member for his intervention the bill have be before the house already and at the moment we be discuss the amendment that have be table the hon member will soon have the opportunity to discuss the amendment he have table however abdicate this chamber order there be far too much noise and many private conversation which make it very difficult to hear the hon gentleman abdicate this house responsibility to referendum be not something on which we will agree this treaty be vital step to secure uk interest it put the diego garcia base on secure footing for at least year understand that opposition colleague have range of objection to this treaty not all of which be jaw droppingly hypocritical however order will give the hon gentleman the same warning that give the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart he need to be very careful with his language not all the objection be jaw droppingly confused but some colleague will vote against the bill tonight on the basis of they that be no reason to support an amendment that would undermine the government ability to navigate the difficult and chaotic world we live in today and keep our country safe call the liberal democrat spokesperson will speak in support of seven amendment table in my name for too long decision about the chagos island have be make without the consent of chagossians my grave concern be that the treaty to be give effect by the bill fail to rectify that historical and ongoing injustice not only do it fail to provide adequate protection of their right it fail to establish legally bind right to return or bind programme of resettlement of the island for chagossians turn to amendment we recognise and support the importance of abide by international law and believe that the uk be indeed right to open process of negotiation with mauritius especially so give the risk that judgment against the uk in any court could threaten our sovereignty over and security interest in diego garcia and the wide chagos archipelago however the treaty that have emerge not only fall short in address past injustice but introduce new injustice of its own at the very core of the united nations charter document that this country help to shape lie the right of all people to self determination article could not be clear one of the purpose of the united nations be to develop friendly relation among nation base on respect for the principle of equal right and self determination of people yet for the chagossian people that right have be deny for more than half century they be exile from their homeland in the chagos archipelago scatter across the globe and leave without the mean or permission to return it be and remain moral stain on our modern history absolutely agree with the hon gentleman about the lack of morality in how the chagossian people be treat he be correct on that would he accept that there be something fundamentally wrong in in separate diego garcia and the archipelago from mauritius when the whole area have always be administer from mauritius as part of mauritius and that under decolonisation statute they should have be include in the independence of mauritius at that time be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his intervention be aware that he have long history in advocate for this particular cause but be relentlessly surprise by the position he take on this point he would seek to effectively reinscribe the colonial construction that be british mauritius and in do so ignore the right of chagossians as people to self determine their own future do not see the colonial convenience of administration as anything other than overwrite people right to determine their own future on that point in the international court of justice issue an advisory opinion that conclude that the decolonisation of mauritius have not be legally complete and that the united kingdom should end its administration of the chagos island as rapidly as possible the general assembly subsequently endorse that same view but say to this house that the icj opinion however well intentione pose profound problem it propose to hand sovereignty not to the chagossians themselves but to mauritius without consult those who be bear of the island or who be descend from they that be not self determination but the transfer of sovereignty over people without their consent the right to self determination belong to people not to government it be not and should not be device for tidy up the diplomatic ledger of empire but recognition that every community have the right to shape its own future to remove the chagossians once be horrific wrong to barter away their sovereignty now without their voice compound that wrong if we truly honour the un charter and the principle that this country have long champion the chagossians themselves must be place at the centre of any future settlement they must have say over their citizenship over the governance of their island and over the prospect of return the commitment to referendum that sit at the heart of amendment seek to address that long and burn injustice by provide chagossians with the opportunity to exercise their right to determine their own future entirely agree with my hon friend on the importance of have right of referendum have have chagossian constituent contact with their outrage about the compounding of injustice in the new treaty how realistic do my hon friend think it be to find people eligible to vote in potential referendum give the length of time that have pass since they be move from diego garcia be grateful to my hon friend for his question he be right that be referendum able to be secure it would be unusual because of the nature of the displacement of the chagossians but there have be previous international consultation and with the collective will and intelligence of house like this the term of referendum could undoubtedly be negotiate after all chagossians be not backwards in come forwards and make themselves know to all of we for chagossians this be not geopolitical abstraction but deeply human matter one of belong fairness and justice require report to be make to the house would ensure their voice be not lose amid the technical language of treaty and transfer amendment would enable transparency accountability and above all genuine recognition of the right of chagossians to self determination encourage right hon and hon member across the house to think carefully when they vote tonight new clause speak to another vital principle our shared moral duty to protect the natural world the chagos archipelago be among the most biodiverse marine environment on earth its coral reef migratory specie and rich ecosystem be global ecological treasure and testament to what nature can be when leave largely untouched by human exploitation in recent month have speak with scientific adviser who be deeply concerned about the bill lack of provision for establish and govern marine protect area the environment and sustainability institute stress that very large marine protect area be vital for global conservation goal its research show the archipelago exceptional role in protect diverse mobile specie across the indian ocean new clause would require the government to publish an annual report produce with the mauritian government set out the progress make in establish and manage marine protect area and the meeting hold between the two government on the issue such reporting be critical to ensure that environmental protection do not fade into the sotto voce diplomatic arrangement it must remain visible audible and measurable commitment to international conservation standard if the government be to honour their biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction pledge future government must ensure strong marine conservation sustainable stewardship and share responsibility believe that the new clause would achieve that new clause and would build on the principle of accountability by ensure regular oversight of how the bill and its associate treaty arrangement be implement we believe that the secretary of state should within month lie before both houses report detail the expenditure of public fund make under the treaty during the most recent financial year and the progress make by the uk in implement the treaty obligation at time when the cost of living be so high do my hon friend agree that the cost of maintain and operate the diego garcia military base and military operation must be evaluate by the house against the expenditure of public fund make under the treaty each financial year the maximum possible financial transparency around the treaty arrangement be essential not least for securing and establish public trust fear that without those high level of accountability public trust would rapidly dissipate furthermore once every financial year the secretary of state should present to the house an estimate of the expenditure expect to be incur in connection with the treaty include payment or financial commitment to the government of mauritius and the cost of maintain and operate diego garcia if actual payment exceed those estimate supplementary estimate must be lay before the house for approval and parliamentary scrutiny reassure conservative colleague that the liberal democrats will support any amendment to the bill that would increase financial transparency of the treaty however our moral duty extend beyond matter of territory and finance new clause would require comprehensive review of the welfare integration and general need of chagossians live in the uk many chagossians here face significant challenge include housing insecurity barrier to employment and limited access to public service the review would assess what support be need and ensure full debate in this house and the other place on its finding that be how we show genuine care for those displace by the action of our predecessor in the chamber and in whitehall finally new clause would require the government within six month to consult with chagossians reside in the uk and the organisation that represent they on how the act and the treaty affect their community socially economically and legally the hon gentleman be give powerful speech on the chagossians and marine protect area as well as the need for transparency but it be not just about transparency what have not hear from he on behalf of the liberal democrats be any sense of outrage at the very fact that we be to pay out billion for sovereign british territory on which we have arguably the most important base in the whole indian ocean be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his question it be precisely in order to cast the strong possible spotlight on the financial transaction involve that we be ask for financial accountability to be magnify on his geopolitical point nobody can question the significant geopolitical importance of the base it be vital to our national security and to global security it be essential that it be maintain in british hand but that must be achieve with the consent of the chagossians the result report to be lay before parliament within month would allow we to evaluate whether the government legislative intent have translate into justice and inclusion in the life of those who be most directly affect these amendment would address critical shortcoming with the bill they would embed accountability environmental protection and commitment to the right to self determination within its framework for implementation urge ministers to ensure that the chagossians be not treat as diplomatic collateral in any future discussion with mauritius they be not footnote to be manage between state they be people deserve of justice agency and dignity the chagossians have wait more than year to go home the least we can do now be let they decide freely and finally what home mean for themselves and ensure that they have the tool they need to exercise their right the amendment table in my name seek to afford those protection and ensure that those right be respect be delighted to be call so early will speak to the amendment in the name of the official opposition specifically on the report go to the intelligence and security committee especially on security of the buffer zone foreign security force military operation and personnel movement the ceding of diego garcia be monumental strategic error that will diminish the uk stand on the world stage and will gladly set out why believe that be the case if anybody think they can predict what will happen in the next five year they have learn nothing from the last five year when we start extend that to plus year in the current global geopolitical situation that be so hard to look at everybody be play by set of rule and work to past system which be currently change strategic leadership be the ability to shape the environment we be in let we take two strategic leader regardless of our view of they at the moment president trump and xi jinping they both want the world to change from where it be and they want to adjust the shape of what it look like the world be currently see disruption to the world order as we know it the international rule base order be be challenge we be set out deal and treaty base on an old system that we be ask to believe will be honour for the next year but do not believe it will be china russia iran and north korea all have massive interest in and around the indo pacific we talk about russia look at ukraine but only of russia be in that space of russia be in the indo pacific russia be now provide training service to the chinese military in airborne operation north korea be on the battlefield in ukraine at the moment we be see all the crink nation as they be know come together not adhere to the international rule base order and not work as we would expect they to do the indo pacific area be recently there with pacific command at million square mile be vast there be us marines in the indo pacific alone that be phenomenal it be big than our army half the world population sit in this space at pacific command we can see the clock show diego garcia time zone and all the multiple other time zone between there and the us anyone who believe that china will honour its deal as we expect should look at the rare earth metal and critical mineral it be supply because of some of those rare earth metal be process in or by china the average car contain worth of rare earth metal as learn when be on the defence committee and we visit australia to look at this but be more interested in how much be in an it contain about kg give or take of rare earth metal many of which have limited supply all of this give china huge leverage over the country that need they we be see polarisation in the indo pacific the philippines be now look at host permanent us base and the same be true in northern australia thing that would never have be believe four or five year ago be happen now be proud to have serve in the uk armed force and believe the british army be the most professional in the world but it be shadow of its former self believe it be get hard for the uk armed force to stand on the world stage because of the depletion of the military everyone will say that it be be hollow out for year but great book just out the rise and fall of the british army by brigadier ben barry show that the uk armed force have be in decline since when we look at the uk armed force decline and then we start look at cede our sovereign basis that bring we to the table that bring we to foothold without they we would not have the capability to stand in the indo pacific and support our ally report release in the last two week by the nato parliamentary assembly to which contribute talk about the indo pacific and the euro atlantic they be intrinsically link it be not question of go to one space and leave the other for the americans the rise of china and its defence industrial base be phenomenal and the speed at which it be grow be huge there be so many concern and uncertainty at the moment key strategic location include cyprus hawaii svalbard the ascension islands and diego garcia and the chagos island just want to re emphasise the point that my hon friend be make about the growth of the threat be he aware that china today have time the capability to build naval ship that america do one shipyard in china in this last year have build more naval ship than the whole of the united states we talk about the threat to the south china sea it be do my right hon friend make great point speak to one of the submarine commander from the us navy only about six week ago he tell that year ago he would see one chinese ship or submarine per week and now he see week the whole area be full of they when we start look at the security of buffer zone we see that we can not move in this area for chinese submarine the whole space be swamp with they we be do deal that will remove our ability to sit at the table where we use to have such strength our armed force now would have trouble support our ally in any area particularly the indo the minister for defence readiness and industry say that be not true we have hms spey and the carrier strike group but we have no permanent presence in the indo pacific with our current commitment we would need brigade strength or more to enable we to have permanent base to rotate troop through and to have credible offering without burn out the uk armed force give the number who be currently on sick at the moment and the strength of the military want to see large armed force but we do not have the ability to offer the level that we want we believe that the world be play by an international rule base order but not all country will do that an international rule base order be set of rule set out by normally the large country around the world when country such as iraq or kosovo do not adhere to they they expect everyone else to accept it but the rise of china russia iran and north korea be throw everything into the mix believe that this will be huge loss for we strategically reiterate my point that the ceding of diego garcia be monumental strategic error that in the next decade we will come to regret call the father of the house commend my hon friend the member for south shropshire stuart anderson who have speak with great authority about the military threat also commend the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton agree with everything he say he speak with great good sense and moderation wish to speak to my new clause be grateful to my friend who have sign it which state the secretary of state must within six month of this act receive royal assent lie before both houses of parliament proposal for an advisory referendum of chagossians reside in the uk seek their opinion on the treaty sign with the government of mauritius and the provision of this act within month of publish the proposal specify in subsection the secretary of state must make time available in both houses of parliament for debate on substantive motion relate to the proposal an advisory referendum would be moderate and sensible proposal and be not sure why anybody would disagree with it surely we in this house have moral duty to the chagossian people not to bureaucratic convenience or diplomatic horse trading my new clause simply call for the chagossians to be consult on their own future that be not unreasonable it be modest and entirely proper request after decade of exile and neglect it be indefensible to negotiate their homeland fate without even ask they have we ever hand over people to foreign power without even consult they proponent of pay mauritius to take the island cite international law but the entire point of decolonisation be to assert the self determination of people the united nations be found upon the principle that nation and people should be free to determine their own destiny in peaceful way chagossian as we now all agree be wrong by both the british and the mauritian authority by the way be probably the only person sit in this chamber who have actually be to the be sorry pay tribute to my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell go there with the defence committee year ago we kick those people out of their home albeit for perfectly the legitimate reason of promote the stability and security of the free world and mauritius accept money to help look after displace chagossian no one can dispute the fact that chagossian be treat as have second class status in mauritius chagossian who have be live there be flee in increase number to the united kingdom many of they happily assert that they want the sovereignty of the united kingdom to continue over the british indian ocean territory but they also want right to return right the wrong we have commit mean listen to the chagossians directly and that be all be ask for the amendment would give parliament the chance to ensure that justice be finally do for those who suffer most britain should not repeat the sin of dispossession under the guise of decolonisation repeat britain should not repeat the sin of dispossession under the guise of decolonisation to hand the territory to mauritius would not end empire but merely pass the island from one remote capital to another from one imperial power to another the united kingdom must not compound historic injustice by ignore the only people with legitimate moral claim to these island the chagos island be of course linchpin of regional security for britain the united states and our ally in an increasingly contest indo pacific undermine that strategic position would embolden hostile power and weaken our ability to uphold freedom of navigation those who call this colonial relic misunderstand it it be forward defence post not backward look possession as have be say time and again the international court of justice advisory opinion carry no legal bind force and should not dictate british policy allow unelected judge in the hague to override parliament responsibility be an abdication of national sovereignty the government should resist any creep judicial globalism that seek to erode british self government under the cloak of international law will end on this point and believe it be very powerful point consultation with the chagossians through uk referendum be an act of basic democratic respect not legal technicality my new clause would strengthen rather than weaken britain moral standing by show that we act with fairness and consent we should not wash our hand of responsibility for british subject in favour of imagine diplomatic convenience the right course be to combine justice for the chagossians with the preservation of britain strategic obligation not to sacrifice one for the other parliament should back these new clause and amendment as an affirmation that britain remain nation that keep faith with its people and its ally alike before speak to amendment which stand in my name on the amendment paper have quick reminder the international court of justice make an advisory judgment it have no force in law quite why the previous government seek to enter round of negotiation off the back of it be beyond but it be even more extraordinary for government that be full to the rafter with human right lawyer they believe in human right so much that somehow they be seek to follow court that be part of the united nations in total contrast as the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton point out to one of the most basic principle of the united nations namely national self determination we think it matter so much year ago that we send taskforce mile away to defend the right of the people of the falkland islands feel great sympathy for the chagossians they get rotten deal year ago and in many way they be perhaps get an even bad deal now they should be consult the fact they be not be consult be shameful for government who go on endlessly about human right and the international rule of law that be the human cost of this as to the economic cost well lot of sum have be bandy about from billion from the prime minister to billion but it all depend on the rate of inflation if the average rate of inflation over the next year be it will be over billion but that may be as nothing to the opportunity loss here this marine park should have be turn decade ago into the great marine tourism site in the world the hon member will be aware that his friend president trump be in favour of this deal so would he tell we whether he disagree with he certainly will and will come to that in short order the opportunity for marine tourism be massive it be worth billion of pound year and it would provide lot of job for chagossians on top of that perhaps more controversially have little doubt have speak to some geologist who work for the world big mining company that within those water we would find cobalt and many of the mineral need for the very green revolution that this government say that they be in favour of so economically we be not just pay billion or whatever the number be we be lose out on huge future opportunity as be mention by the hon member for south shropshire stuart anderson strategically this be disaster right at the moment the american president be somewhat busy have recently strike remarkable peace deal in the middle east and whichever way people think he be go on it be obsess with end the ukraine war this issue be very low down on his agenda but he and america will wake up and realise that something they think now to be minor and not worth spend their time on actually will imperil the safety of their base india have already negotiate satellite observation deal and china be currently negotiate it do not matter what the minister say about what be in the treaty mauritius will not honour the term of this treaty mauritius be poor it be on the verge of bankruptcy it will be buy by chinese money and china be negotiate lease already if you want further proof of what will upset the american president huawei which of course he rail against get into the uk system be already instal its safe city camera all over mauritius none of this make any sense do wonder what the role of our national security adviser jonathan powell be in all of this be surprised that the hon gentleman have the gall to come here and talk about national security today when the former leader of his party in wales admit to take bribe from russia and when again he have be use talking point that come right from the kremlin in blame nato for russia invasion of ukraine absolutely shameful the mauritian attorney general be interview on mauritian tv today and he say regard the hon gentleman tweet claim that mauritius be negotiate lease on peros banhos that that be gross falsehood and political gimmick the hon gentleman talk about the united states the secretary of war secretary hegseth say diego garcia be vital military base for the united states the uk deal with mauritius secure the operational capability of the base and key us national security interest in the region we be confident the base be protect for many year ahead why be the united states back this deal if anything that the hon gentleman say be true can assure you that america be not back this deal what it be say be what we have be what we hold that be the american attitude at the moment but as say when it wake up to the satellite observation deal do with india already as report in the economic times of india on september this year and once you realise order when the hon gentleman say you he be refer to perhaps he would refer to the minister as the minister when the americans realise that actually mauritius be not trustworthy nation it be bankrupt it need the money it will not honour this treaty we will be in very different place do ask the question about the role of our national security adviser somebody very much in the news in the last few day he be seemingly very happy that trial against two allege chinese spy operate at time within this building have disappear not only be he honour the labour manifesto which be very soft on china but apparently he be very for this chagos deal put it to members that this deal be un british it be against our national interest and there be no upside or gain can assure they that future that future reform government will not honour this treaty end of refer the committee to my interest have observe the mauritian election last year as guest of the mauritius labour party it be hard not to feel little bit sorry for the beleaguered minister at the dispatch box today send to defend something that be so clearly betrayal of this country and its interest out of the grand total of plus labour members of parliament in this house he be back by just one the hon member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey who sit with his face glue to his ipad read the word put there by lord know who and who struggle so much when he finally take an intervention and have to speak off the cuff indeed he have flee now doubtless to lick his wound not one single other of those government mp want to come here and defend this bill the minister be in fact decent man and he will know that this bill have no defence and bring no benefit to this country last week too we have minister send out to answer for the china spy case he have never speak at the dispatch box before it be his very first outing but he be think the good person to defend the prime minister blush by know nothing about the topic in hand and deny thing without lie by dint of ignorance it be indeed triumph of sort armando iannucci and the thick of it cast could not script something as cynical empty and damaging as this government behaviour in so many sphere as we can see in the amendment and new clause before we which will doubtless all be reject by the minister amidst the betrayal of first time buyer farmer small business special need child pensioner young worker order perhaps the right hon gentleman might stay within the scope of the bill thank you madam chair be set the context for the amendment to the bill that we be rightly propose to ensure that the government report back on the money that they plan to spend and to ensure that the mauritius taxpayer be not the only taxpayer to benefit from this as say the amendment and new clause come amidst the betrayal of those first time buyer farmer small business special need child pensioner young worker restaurant and pub and amidst the expense grifting tax dodging scandal and resignation pack into busy month amidst all that this chagos sell out be still stand out disaster for this country and the ministers on the front bench know it that be why not single one of their odd colleague bar one glue to his ipad have be prepare to come to this chamber tonight and speak in favour of the bill that be why there be no provision to allow vote on the billion sorry not billion the billion that have now be set out as the hon member for clacton nigel farage rightly say that be base on rather small conservative estimate of the interest but that be what the government themselves have say it be likely to cost this labour government decide to give away uk sovereign territory and the location of critically important military base to another country and to pay billion for the privilege on the argument about the money which come up throughout all this and which we have in the last debate the government have use dodgy system to calculate it it be call the gdp deflator their own actuarial department have dismiss that completely because of course it be all about forecast of where social issue will go on an island that will never have anything to do with we after all this so we have no idea how to predict it finally clause make this whole debate meaningless because the government can change anything they like whenever they wish to so what the heck be we do debate this even now my right hon friend make an extremely powerful point the henry viii power in the bill be not limit at all hear so many complaint when be minister from the labour party about henry viii power the bill literally give ministers the ability to change any exist piece of legislation in any sphere whatsoever if it be necessary to implement this deal there can never have be henry viii power as powerful as that give to ministers by this legislation which be all to do with the surrender of chagos and the transfer of ten of billion of pound to foreign power foreign power that be in strategic partnership with china and in close working with other country that be not on our side what on earth be the prime minister think as the minister lie in bed last night toss and turn in anticipation of the debate be sure that that be the question that go round and round in his head so many question remain to be answer why do the prime minister say that the payment would be billion when the government own office now show that it will be at least billion be this the most important strategic base in the indian ocean can the minister confirm that diego garcia be effectively us base man by thousand of americans with at most few dozen brit there in liaison if this be in fact united states base and not operationally it be joint base it might be joint base technically but what be it in reality would love an intervention from the defence minister he could tell we how much do we use it operationally because there be thousand of americans there and as understand it unless he correct at most dozen of brits in other word it be united states base on sovereign uk territory that we will pay ten of billion of pound for over the next year to provide it to the americans for free it make no sense and do not see why we have have no answer from ministers as to why that be sensible use of public money rise rise will give way to the minister and then to my right hon friend thank the right hon gentleman for his generous comment he and have always have robust but friendly discussion on many issue however do have to correct he on this point the us pay for the operation and the value to the british taxpayer the us taxpayer and indeed all our ally be priceless in that it protect the people of this country from multiple threat so what he say simply do not make sense the united states play critical role as member of nato and as key ally if not the key ally of our but despite the priceless nature of the service it provide we do not typically pay for it we do not normally pay for its basis we pay for our own will the right hon member give way say would give way to my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis my right hon friend be quite right on the face of it this do not make sense unless we look at it in one particular way if the government have make decision that they wish to have strategic economic partnership with communist china this make sense the closing of the case with the china spy make sense and the willingness for china to have the big embassy of any country in europe make sense even though the government say that that be quasi judicial decision it be interesting that for political reason they put it off till december none of it make sense or all of it make sense as long as the national security adviser want we to suck up to communist totalitarian china my right hon friend make powerful point that be at the heart of it there be so many question but one question be why why would deal like this be do by the government he put forward credible case as to why it might be will the right hon member give way perhaps the hon gentleman who be not brave enough to speak fully but be prepared to intervene can tell we why he would like to vote if only he be give the chance to give billion to mauritius and hand over sovereign british base to someone in strategic partnership with china perhaps the right hon gentleman can enlighten on which of the amendment he be speak to new clause which his party table mention coral fish stock mollusc and ocean acidification in the marine protect area even the cynic in be somewhat flabbergast by the official opposition apparent interest in environmental and climate change all of sudden give their desire to ride roughshod over the climate change act and frack our countryside that be rather desperate give way to the right hon member for east antrim the minister describe this asset as priceless yet he be give it away and not only be he give it away he be pay someone to take it be this the kind of decision people would expect from rational government more importantly if it be priceless in security term why be we compromise it the right hon gentleman be quite right to ask that question that be what we be try to get to the bottom of and we hope to hear answer from the minister this evening so that ordinary citizen of this country can understand how it be in the uk interest to do this of course other point have be touch on include quite rightly the chagossians why be the labour party the party so committed to human right and which very much see itself as champion for the underdog absolutely disregard the chagossians as the hon member for bolton west suggest labour also set itself out as nature and climate champion yet it be hand this asset over to country without the wherewithal do not know about the will but it be certainly without the wherewithal to ensure that the protection of that marine area continue that be the problem and it be why we need answer from the minister the government may be unable to get anyone to speak in favour of the bill but they should think again accept the amendment and new clause and bring some light to bear on this rather murky issue the treaty that the bill will implement be shocking for so many reason the security implication the staggering cost and the voice that it have ignore the voice of british chagossians their view and concern be many and varied have the privilege of meet member of the community when they come to parliament while the former foreign secretary the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy meet british chagossians only once and that be on the very day that the treaty be sign far too late for their voice to have any influence they be rightly frustrated that they have be exclude from negotiation and deny meaningful engagement it be painfully clear that their voice be not consider if they have be the treaty might have place their right at its very centre instead article give mauritius the freedom to resettle chagossians but not the duty to do so after half century of wait for it their right of return be leave entirely at the discretion of foreign government under article despite the billion of pound that the bill will transfer to mauritius only fraction in the form of trust fund be intend for chagossians even then it will be administer solely by mauritius with no guarantee that british chagossians will have any say in how it be spend the treaty say that the uk and mauritius want to recognise the wrong of the past but how can we recognise wrong if we refuse to listen to those who suffer it new clause table by the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel be vital because it would require the government to listen to and consult the chagossian community here in the uk and to report back on how their right be be uphold that would give british chagossians the voice that they have be deny again and again another vital issue be the risk that the bill pose to one of the most precious marine environment on earth the water around the chagos islands form one of the world large and most pristine marine protect area as we have hear it be haven of biodiversity untouched by industrial fishing since yet the treaty place that fragile ecosystem in jeopardy mauritius have promise to establish new marine protect area but it lack the capacity to enforce it it have no navy and its coastguard of nine vessel be already stretch by patrolling water thousand of mile away by contrast the uk have spend over million since on monitor and protect those sea develop world lead expertise in remote enforcement through ship sensor and satellite imagery illegal fishing be already rife across the indian ocean china distant water fleet be the large in the world and the bad global offender for illegal fishing accord to the illegal unreported and unregulated fishing index what confidence can we have that mauritius close ally of china will be able or willing to resist such pressure and protect these fragile water be my hon friend aware that mauritius do not have navy my hon friend make an important point it have no navy and only nine coastguard vessel it be not able to protect those water even if illegal fishing be control the mauritian fisheries minister have already speak of want to issue fishing licence around the chagos islands the agreement provide no guarantee the extent of future protection will be decide only after the bill have pass new clause and be essential to ensure parliamentary oversight of any future agreement and regular reporting on coral health fish stock and biodiversity as it stand the bill would hand billion of pound of uk taxpayer money to mauritius with no guarantee of protection of the marine environment no provision to safeguard the right of british chagossians and no mechanism for britain to monitor whether the safeguard around the strategic military base on diego garcia be effective the conservative amendment offer chance for the government to be transparent publish the legal advice on which they surrender the chagos islands and give the house vote on the payment of billion to mauritius the treaty be damage in so many way but let we not make the damage bad by wave it through unchecked since this house first learn of the disastrous term of the chagos surrender deal there have be significant focus on the spiral cost and on the defence and security implication we have hear many such argument today the government weakness have compromise our national security they be surrender british territory to an ally of china and pay billion or perhaps as much as billion for the privilege their failure to defend the british national interest be shameful equally shameful be the government failure to consider the impact that the deal will have on environmental protection for marine area member from across the house have reflect on that today but it be shame that so few labour members come to stand up for our environmental protection in the indian ocean territories will address the importance of new clause and two sensible amendment table by the shadow foreign secretary to strengthen oversight of the marine protect area the region of the indian ocean that host the unique and remarkable chagos islands be of critical importance to wildlife the archipelago be biodiversity hotspot the sq km marine protect area which have be monitor by the uk for the past year have keep the surround water in near pristine condition the coral reef in the untouched marine protect area be some of the healthy in the world they be sanctuary for marine life include endanger specie such as hawksbill turtle green turtle and reef shark and they be locate along hugely significant migratory route for specie of tuna whale and seabird the remarkable resilience of the reef to coral bleach event also make they highly significant for scientific research to well understand resilience to change climate like the hon member be new member so be puzzle why do he consider that his party start these negotiation if the whole thing be such terrible idea there be difference between talk with other country and do deal know that those on the opposition front bench who form part of the previous government be not go to do this deal they may have be talk but as we have hear there be go to be no agreement thank the hon member for his intervention and reflect that be not part of the previous government but he know full well that this agreement would not have be make under these term if the conservatives be in government now the marine protect area be one of the large untouched marine ecosystem and it be globally significant as such instead of heedlessly drive this hopeless surrender deal through parliament the government should have be ensure that protection for wildlife and the marine environment be watertight when answer question before the foreign affairs committee in june the minister would not give any clear assurance or guarantee on the future of the marine protect area within his obfuscation about separate agreement with mauritius which hope we can share objective and value he admit that we can only take it on trust that there will be marine protected area after sovereignty have be surrender we absolutely do not need to take that on trust the government have fail to secure any meaningful safeguard or guarantee and be instead hop merely hop that memorandum of understanding will somehow protect that pristine ecosystem how on earth can we have any confidence in that at all simple change of government in mauritius or even just change of heart would render the uk powerless to stop chinese trawler turn up and devastate the marine environment give the evidence of china plunder the high sea for example in the south atlantic just outside the falkland islands zone of economic interest it absolutely will do the same in that territory the hon gentleman be make powerful point about the marine environment in the area but do he accept that we do not even need change of heart by mauritius we do not need it to decide that the treaty be not worthwhile it do not have the ability to give the protection even if there be no change of heart there be no ability to give such protection which be why this be bad deal for the environment absolutely agree and note that the right hon gentleman and be the only members in the chamber from the environmental audit committee which think be damn indictment on those member in this house who be here to protect our environment and hold the government to account on environmental protection will the minister now explain what will happen to the mpa in future and say whether the government will commit resource to support the protection of the mpa if so where will those resource come from with the fishery minister of mauritius talk of issue fishing and trawl licence it be more important than ever that we have last confidence in marine protection before british territory be surrender to mauritius when the minister sum up the debate will he say whether he share my concern over new fishing and trawl licence new clause would require that any write instrument on the establishment and management of the marine protect area be subject to the approval of this house to ensure that it be fit for purpose will the minister say what progress have be make with develop the separate instrument reference in article of the treaty will it be in place before mauritius assume sovereignty any agreement on the chagos mpa must be scrutinise like treaty and present to parliament new clause would require the secretary of state regularly to report on the status of the marine protect area report from committees in the lords have raise concern about mauritius track record on environmental protection do the minister agree with those concern and therefore agree that the ecological status of this extraordinary environment must remain on the british government agenda and will he reflect on that in his summing up of the debate will he now accept that as well as cost british taxpayer billion betray british chagossians and undermine our security without well protection secure in the treaty the government chagos surrender deal will harm the marine environment all of this at time when the government argue that the state of public finance require tough choice choice that punish pensioner family farmer and tax education for the very first time the annual cost of the surrender of the chagos island could pay for new teacher new nurse or police officer in the first year the money pay to mauritius could deliver new gp surgery in community community such as wixams and wootton in my constituency of mid bedfordshire which be still wait for improved access to local healthcare this be all choice choice to prioritise ideological surrender over our community over our security and over marine protection it be shameful and encourage hon member across the house to support new clause and speak in support of new clause which would ensure that this house have vote before any money be pay to the government of mauritius under the treaty support the new clause because it demonstrate the important principle of this house assert its rightful role as the guardian of both public money and british sovereignty the privilege of this house have be serially insult in the debate we have have today which want to mention quickly with this new treaty we see the height of what we see early dereliction of the responsibility of this house and the government early in the urgent question on the china spy case we hear that politician should not be consult order the hon gentleman will keep within the scope of this bill and not seek to rehash urgent question hold early understand madam chairman and of course you be quite right the point be make be that there have never be government who be so reluctant to govern as the one we have today we have hear from hon member how baffle the decision be to surrender the chagos island the only rational reason that could account for it be some kind of secret deal with china do not know if that be the case the government obeisance to international law might well trump national sovereignty and in fact there be no rational calculation behind this decision except that of submission to their idea of international law again have to take serious issue with what the hon gentleman be suggest if what he be suggest be true why do the united states our five eyes partner and other key ally support this deal it protect our national security and it secure the base on diego garcia why would they support it there be no secret deal this be absolute nonsense be grateful to the minister suspect there have be private conversation with the american government as well and that in recognition of the fait accompli that this government have yield to mauritius the americans have extend this somewhat limited statement of support for the deal as some kind of favour to the prime minister in exchange for support he have give they on other matter the fact be that this deal be bad for britain and bad for britain sovereignty and behind the scene we know that the americans do not support it want to talk about secret deal because my only addition to the debate very powerful point have be make already be to say that secret deal have be do with respect to the chagos island in the past under the year rule archival evidence have come out recently of secret deal with respect to the base at diego garcia between the british government of the day the thatcher government and the american administration that deal be do in the national interest the renewal of the nuclear deterrent the trident programme be be set up and there be an agreement with the americans whereby they could expand their access and the use of diego garcia in exchange for reduction in the fee essentially that the british government be charge for collaboration on the trident programme we have to pay significantly less than we would have pay otherwise because of the expand access that we be give to the americans in those year it be call the diego trident package in the negotiation and the correspondence between the british and the americans at that time it be keep quiet for understandable reason and we only know about it now worry that there be similar lack of transparency around this deal because as say it can not possibly be deal that be in the national interest we be try to get to the bottom of precisely why the labour government would make this deal the hundred of people who work at the vivergo plant in my constituency be sell out by the prime minister who in personal call with the president of the united states surrender the entire bioethanol market of this country to the united states with nothing in return at the end of an already conclude trade deal negotiation it be thing like that that make we worry what be behind this bill what be the secret deal and exactly who have be sell out the right hon gentleman be absolutely right the key demand that this house be make be for great transparency about what be go on behind the scene with this deal implore the house to insist that before parliament accept any new arrangement for the sovereignty of the chagos island ministers explain what be go on specifically be the minister aware of any effect on our nuclear posture be there any relationship between the deal that be be do today and implication for our deterrent the base be vital to our national interest and would be grateful to understand whether any discussion have be have with reference to the deal that be do many year ago about the relationship with the nuclear deterrent will speak to the amendment start with amendment and and take canter through my position as my constituent will have an interest in that my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness graham stuart ask the important question why amendment and try to address the most important issue context as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis point out our sign this deal do not make sense the government have be weak in present the evidence for why they think we should sign the deal write to the government to ask they to explain and be able to pull their response apart on second reading one step at time explain why their reason do not fit context be really important think that the deal do not make sense but factor in the collapse spy trial the billion pound provide to the steel factory the pende decision on the embassy yes maybe no and the change in the language use around the subject of china we need to get to the heart of what be go on the amendment be an attempt to do that in the name of transparency which be hugely important do my hon friend agree that the government be treat china like it be our friend rather than the threat that it be would be interested to hear an answer to that as we have try several time to get the government to quantify whether china be threat friend an ally or foe amendment try to look at an analysis of the status of uk sovereignty over the british indian ocean territory under international law from talk about this previously we know that unclos which be often use as the example of why we have to secede the territory can not preside over sovereignty as be say in when deal with the marine protect area we have also hear the government stress the importance of the international telecommunications union say that the issue be to do with spectre and spy however we know that there be carve out because we hear about that on second reading that leave we with the international court of justice which be often hold up as the key point on second reading be take by the fact that it be allege that we have an opt out under the commonwealth so go away to have quick look on the icj website as hon member can see the declaration recognise the jurisdiction of the court as compulsory united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be publish on february quote the government of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland accept as compulsory ipso facto and without special convention on condition of reciprocity the jurisdiction of the international court of justice ln conformity with paragraph of article of the statute of the court until such time as notice may be give to terminate the acceptance over all dispute arise after january with regard to situation or fact subsequent to the same date other than these be critical point any dispute which the united kingdom have agree with the other party or parties thereto to settle by some other method of peaceful settlement ii any dispute with the government of any other country which be or have be member of the commonwealth that be there in black and white however the government have yet to mention that in any of debate or letter about their legal position we need amendment and to be able to understand why the government do not see that as strong enough argument to hold up this nonsense about whether or not there be negotiation be answer there too because those declaration say any method of peaceful settlement any good government would try to resolve the dispute in peaceful manner be surprised at that from labour party whose member pride themselves on be trade unionist who make living from negotiate and try to come to solution without the matter go to court that be exactly what they should be do but the conservatives be be chastise for try to have conversation to resolve the situation the fact be that we do not come up with deal because the deal be not good enough the labour opposition move into power and have now put forward this horrendous bill that give away power but at what cost they be not even go to try in court or use some of the simple argument which as doctor have find after spend time research be sure that in this great country we have many legal buff that could put forward that argument but if the government do not feel that it stand they should come to this house and tell we why put it in evidence write it out and tell we all and we will go quietly however we be not hear or see that from this government which be why we need amendment and turn to amendment and as have be rightly point out by my right hon friend the member for beverley and holderness it be clear that the bill give carte blanche to this government or any other to do whatever they want we may as well not even bother have debate about the bill it be not worth the paper it be write on because the henry viii power mean that ministers can do what they will when they will without come to parliament at least these amendment try to ensure some accountability of the executive to this house because this house should be make these decision especially give their magnitude we have hear from the government that it be priceless base and we have hear from the conservative benches about its geopolitical and security importance should the house not be make decision about what that look like new clause talk about the payment on second reading ask the minister whether he could give any example from any part of the world of when we have deal with sovereignty use net present value he say it be in the green book but that be for domestic site and use by the treasury to look at civil development hope the minister have go away and do some research because think he will find that there be not precedent as net present value be not the correct measure and be open to political interference for example we use and america use we can fudge the number to fit the narrative that we would like to set there be one other problem the explanatory note stipulate only year unless have misquote this deal go for year so what happen in the remain year that be why new clause would bring in robust check to ensure that when the finance be pay out we know exactly why we be pay who we be pay and what we be pay for most importantly we would know the mechanism of how the finance be calculate because the government still have not come to this place and set that out exactly let turn to new clause what happen at the end raise that as my final point when speak on second reading we have hear about long term security but in this place we think only on five year cycle this be year cycle my big fear be that my child child child if they be ever elect to this parliament will be have debate in year with the same issue about what happen it be dereliction of duty on our behalf in this house not to think thing through my hon friend be make an excellent speech be surprised that nobody have refer to hong kong when the decision be take and the agreement be reach in for the handover in china agree that it would be one country two system for at least year within less than half that time britain come to the conclusion that all those safeguard be be deliberately violate as ever my learn right hon friend have pip to the punch that be exactly good example of the kind of site we be worried about what have that mean we have take on british national overseas and invite they in to give they security because they fear for political interference and worse still for the safety of themselves and their family we be not do our duty if we be not think about these thing because as we have already see it be hard enough to predict thing in two or three year time let alone year at that point as it be write we will get the good offer but it will be only offer to we we could be outstrip by china russia or bric country in the future we do not know it be year away and there be no mechanism to solve that worse still mauritius could simply say we do not want base here at all and there be nothing in this bill that would stop that the government repeatedly have be ask those question and they can not set that out that be why new clause ask for those impact to be consider and look at new clause would move the marine protect area will return to point make early the fact be that when britain and the united kingdom be take under unclos in by mauritius under annex vii we want to implement protection in the area mauritius feel that that impede on its ability to make its own decision which the court find in favour of and it also want to fish in the area hang on second we be put weakness into this bill when we know that mauritius have set its intent hope it have move on as the debate on climate have but this new clause would be guarantee to ensure that that have be think about let turn to new clause appreciate the minister step up because there have already be debate about the peros banhos island and he have say there be no concern that they will be lease to china let we be real this bill have only just come out the ink be barely dry and we already hear story many journalist have already talk about this issue maybe be wrong but that show the example of what could and will come without pay attention to the security and the geopolitical and strategic advantage that these island have which my hon and gallant friend the member for south shropshire stuart anderson talk about all new clause ask we to do be ensure that that be report on and look at again there be dereliction of duty by not have that report could go on because there be many more amendment but the salient point in this debate have be make all the amendment table in the name of conservatives and to be fair in the name of member of many other opposition party ask for one simple thing transparency and explanation they ask for simple way of see what the legal advice do and where the financial outcome come indicate assent the minister be nod along but there must be something wrong if the public and opposition members can not simply understand the argument for what be be put in place we can not see the wood for the tree it be government duty to show those argument and look forward to the minister do that in his response and put these argument to bed once and for all otherwise the british public will not forgive he will primarily focus on new clause which be in my name and the name of colleague first and foremost this bill be about perfect the decolonisation of the british indian ocean territory that be self evident in clause but it do that in way that ignore primary component of decolonisation we subscribe to united nations resolution that resolution talk about respect not only the integrity of territory but self determination the british indian ocean territory have exist de facto and de jure for over year yet the government approach in justify this completion of decolonisation be to focus solely on territorial integrity by claim that the chagos island be in fact part of mauritius resolution contain number of component its first point be that the subjection of people to alien subjugation domination and exploitation constitute denial of fundamental human right its second point be that all people have the right to self determination the question for this house be surely this be the chagossians people certainly think that they be they be distinct from the mauritians by their ethnic background by their religion and by geography mauritius and the chagos island be over mile apart approximately as far as it be from this house to north africa so after year of the existence of the biot it really be stretch to say that the sole defining issue be that of territorial integrity to say that be to ignore the right to self determination this nation have deal with decolonisation before and we do not approach it on the basis that it be only about territorial integrity take the example of india we decolonise in india but we allow it to be subject to self determination that be why we have india pakistan and bangladesh it be quite clear that this be not situation in which territorial integrity trump everything else it do not trump self determination an experience of decolonisation such as india show that territorial integrity be secondary to self determination yet the right of the people who claim the chagos island as their homeland to any measure of self determination be the one thing that have be utterly ignore in this process we have in our history the shameful episode of their forceful removal from the chagos island and now under this treaty we be go to compound that shame by legitimise that removal say that this be only about territorial integrity be to legitimise their forceful removal from the chagos island that be how we get around the question of self determination that be wrong the people of the chagos island be people they be people with homeland therefore under international law they be people with right to self determination so why do this treaty and this bill trash that right that be the fundamental haunting question when it come to the humanity and international legal requirement of the situation that prevail the government be obviously hold to the line it be only about territorial integrity but they be hoist by their own petard because they have recognise the chagossians as people by set aside some million of pound for they they can not say it be only about territorial integrity and there be no people to whom to give the right to self determination and then say for those people to whom we deny the right to self determination here be some conscience money they can not do that yet that be what the treaty do the biot recognise the separateness of the people of the chagos island and even the much vaunted advisory judgment of the international court of justice give respect and acknowledgment to an extent to the question of self determination at one point the judgment state it follow that any detachment by the administering power of part of non self govern territory unless base on the freely express and genuine will of the people of the territory concern be contrary to the right to self determination even that advisory judgment recognise the exception of the freely express and genuine will of the people but that be what we have not have on this issue this government have go out of their way to deny the free and genuine expression of opinion by the people whose homeland be the chagos island that shameful indictment compound what we do to those people at the end of the the government now totally dehumanise their human right by say you have no right whatever when it come to self determination that be fundamentally wrong if the splitting of that wide colony in be illegitimate because there be no self determination accord to the advisory judgment of the court then equally the chagos island rejoin mauritius without self determination be illegitimate the government can not have it both way but that be what this bill be seek to do the government say that because it be illegitimate to split the chagos island off from mauritius in because there be no self determination the bill be about territorial integrity only but if the basis of rejoin the chagos island to mauritius be without self determination then that equally be illegitimate those be some of the point that this government have not face and if they have face they they have not answer they this house be legitimately ask those question tonight and wait for answer if those answer do not come it will illustrate how this be the tawdry unacceptable and unenforceable bill that it will ultimately be see to be the minister will try his good in few minute to defend this wholly indefensible bill but the public know what it be they see it as an absolute sell out suspect that the government members who be not fill the green benches see it as sell out too that be why every single one of they fail to support the bill in committee save for one brave or perhaps misguided member the public can see that they be weak government without the backbone necessary to stand up for the british public interest they see this bill as the sell out that it be geopolitically with the government blind to the associated security risk the sell out that it be financially with billion go to foreign government and the sell out that it be of the chagossian people with their exclusion from negotiation the public be baffle by the government argument in relation to this agreement as indeed be let we look at the legal rationale for capitulation it have collapse under scrutiny we be tell by the minister at the dispatch box that the primary reason why this deal be need be the imminent threat of bind judgment yet no such tribunal exist originally believe the minister think that it be to be the international court of justice but we now know as the minister should know that the icj do not have bind capacity when the uk be deal with former commonwealth country so it be not the icj we have also hear it say from the dispatch box that perhaps it be the united nations convention on the law of the sea but we also now know that in unclos exclude itself from the ability to have jurisdiction on land base dispute so my goodness do we need amendment which would require the government to publish the legal argument behind their currently baffle decision to go through with this deal we be all wrestle with the question why as my hon friend have say the government position be clear in namely that the icj have no power over deal we make with commonwealth member perhaps this prime minister have without tell we reverse that in some way and the government have decide that this should be subject to the icj in which case the minister would have point but should we not know that we make ourselves subject to the icj when previously we be not what other answer be there my right hon friend be absolutely right to ask those question question that have be ask of the government time and again throughout this legislative process but to which we simply have not have an answer the government seem to be blind to the risk of the craven withdrawal of influence from the indo pacific region this be more jonathan powell he be of course the prime minister envoy and the architect of the negotiation and the deal the more learn of jonathan powell the more realise that he seem to have long term instinct to downplay the threat from china threat in the indian ocean through this negotiate deal let we not forget that this be the same jonathan powell who now wear different hat he be now the national security adviser and that very unusually be political appointment there be the question of his involvement or perhaps it be not his involvement in the collapse of the chinese spying case we be ask to believe that he be not involve in it and that seem baffle as well be my hon friend as surprised as be to find out that the national security adviser do not speak to his deputy interruption order do not think we need this chuntering from the front bench can we ensure that the speech remain within the legislation that we be debate and vote on tonight will endeavour to do so madam chair in fact will more than endeavour will do so the reason this be relevant be that it speak to new clause while the government have their head in the sand in respect of mauritius relation with china this be why it be important madam chair their first argument be that mauritius will not be influence by china and be it not awful of we to suggest that it might be raise this question with the former foreign secretary the right hon member for tottenham mr lammy back in october last year raise concern that mauritius be an ally of china and be open to influence from that country with the disdain for which he be now famous the right hon gentleman pooh poohe that he say that mauritius be not chinese ally because it be not part of the belt and road agreement in africa when we look at the relationship between china and mauritius however we see that they have strong bilateral tie that go back to on economic co operation and diplomatic support china be the large trading partner of mauritius which enter into free trade agreement with china the first such free trade agreement that china have enter into on the african continent perhaps it do not need to belong to the belt and road agreement in addition to its free trade agreement there be influence express through investment loan and grant china build the international airport terminal for mauritius it have invest in the jinfei economic and trade co operation zone flagship belt and road initiative and between and china also fund development project in mauritius through loan and grant so forgive madam chair if do not swallow the argument that mauritius be wholly beyond the influence of china the government say if mauritius be under the influence of china do worry because china do support this deal china will be argue against this deal we be tell by the prime minister that china russia and iran do not support the chagos deal therefore presumably my geopolitical security fear must be wrong well ministers have repeatedly be ask for the evidence that china do not support this deal and none have be provide to date if be wrong on that perhaps the minister will say from the dispatch box where china have express its concern about this deal if you be to listen to the chinese ambassador to mauritius even you madam chair would be forgive for think that china be thoroughly in favour of this deal because he send massive congratulation to mauritius and say that china fully support mauritius attempt to safeguard national security that be the definition of doublespeak if it do not mean that china be wholly in favour of this deal and be celebrate it with mauritius be not convinced and neither be the government be fond of the hon gentleman who speak of doublespeak it be not long ago in my political lifetime that the former member for witney the then prime minister invite his excellency xi jinping for pint in the plough at cadsden in oxfordshire as he depart back to china from the airport in my constituency sit with the prime minister as he fawn over the chinese administration like it be some papal visit what be go on with the conservatives be you divide on what our approach to china should be order mr kane do not use the word you because that refer to be not often compare to the noble lord cameron but it be absolutely right that as the geopolitical environment change so should our policy we on this side of the house be realist as be in government at the time can answer the hon member for wythenshawe and sale east mike kane the golden decade propose by the then chancellor with whom do not get on very well be disaster if anything should have be learn by that his government should have learn that when you sup with the chinese you well have very long spoon because they suck you in we get nothing out of those year and now look at we order mr mayhew and colleague who hope to intervene let we remember the scope of the debate in front of we it be for exactly those reason that we so desperately need new clause which would require an annual security report to the intelligence and security committee that would mean that we be not catch with our head in the sand again we be begin to build picture of slippery government who be not be honest with the british people not be honest about the legal justification for this deal and not be honest about the security risk associate with the deal and who be now be slippery about the financial cost as well again the prime minister himself say that this slippery deal be go to cost the taxpayer million year for year he round that down from billion which my math would have come to to billion through freedom of information request the government actuary department have confirm that the actual cost be billion do the prime minister just get the decimal point in the wrong place or be it something more sinister madam chair you could be forgive for think that the government should no long be trust they be change their story in relation to this agreement and they change their story in relation to the china spy trial collapse we need new clause so that no payment can be make without direct approval from the house of commons at least then the government would have to explain the real figure and be open to transparency and scrutiny the public see through labour deal and they know sell out when they see one the opposition amendment and new clause bring transparency to expose this sell out from weak prime minister without the backbone to stand up for britain no wonder labour member be about to vote against they will be brief but be very pleased to be able to speak in this debate as chair of the all party parliamentary group on the chagos island which last week have its meeting it have be ably support by david snoxell the former british high commissioner to mauritius who have do incredible work with his knowledge of and empathy for the chagossian people there be two former chair of the group in the committee at the moment the hon member for romford andrew rosindell and for wythenshawe and sale east mike the former member for crawley be also chair of the group at one time we found that group long time ago to listen to and take action in support of the chagos islander who be angry that they have be forcibly remove from their home angry at the way they have be treat by successive british government and very angry at the initial decision that be take and the sheer brutality that go with it to give member brief example in year old chagossian woman liseby elysé while carry her unborn child be forcibly remove from the chagos island of peros banhos she lose her unborn child soon after her traumatic upheaval and the journey and she and her husband survive with considerable uncertainty and in very precarious living condition like all other chagossians however year later in she represent her community at the hague when she speak about her life and her loss her story be compelling and memorable like those of so many other chagos islander because of the personal horror trauma and abuse that they suffer they have always demand and fight for their right of return and that be the central core of what the all party parliamentary group on the chagos island have do realise there be now different opinion in the group about the sovereignty or otherwise of the island but there have always be fundamental agreement on the right of return that lead to massive legal action which be bravely fight by the chagos islander with very little support there be few people such as richard gifford their solicitor who be fantastic in their support eventually we gather wide support and we get favourable decision at all level of justice around the world include at the united nations general assembly it be worth recall as many member have do the decision make by harold wilson then prime minister in offer mauritius its independence he come to this extraordinarily complicated deal which essentially involve the united states get base on diego garcia and in return mauritius get its independence somewhere along the line as the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger point out there would either be discount on the next generation of nuclear weapon or free delivery of weapon at some point in the future lot of this be shroud in mystery in the private conversation between wilson and prime minister ramgoolam at the time so there be lot of confusion surround that somewhere at that time the idea be to set up the british indian ocean territory and somewhere at that time the decision be make that the archipelago include peros banhos which be considerable distance from diego garcia would be separate from mauritius as well and that it would have to be depopulate hence the utter brutality of the removal of the entire population from the island so the question that many member have bring up be this should the chagos island be separate from mauritius or part of mauritius interestingly during the discussion mauritius never accept the separation it never accept that the chagos island should be separate either constitutionally or in any other way from mauritius as we know the decision be basically force on the mauritians in return for their independence we now have situation in which we have finally get treaty it have its imperfection of that everyone be agree personally be less than happy about the idea of massive military base on diego garcia and even less happy that it might be there in year time however treaty have be agree that will ensure the right of chagos islander to return to the chagos island but unfortunately only limited right of return to diego garcia itself be look forward to the minister speech and would be grateful if be able to say bit more about the right of access to diego garcia for chagos islander their right to visit the church and the graf of their ancestor and whether there be some possibility of degree of residence on diego garcia there be no other place in the world where military base be surround by an entirely depopulated area in this case an island and would be grateful if the minister be able to say something about that we have fight for the right of return fully understand that chagos islander some resident here some in the seychelles many in mauritius and other in diaspora all around the world in france and many other place probably all have different view and different memory but in the survey that be do when this issue be discuss at great length about year ago they be all in favour of the right of return the issue of sovereignty under mauritius be not really great feature of those discussion although it appear to be now we should listen to the chagos refugees group base in mauritius and lead brilliantly by olivier bancoult who have be through every court case indeed he start the whole process of demand the right of return which have eventually be successfully achieve the statement that the chagos refugees group make last week say the agreement therefore meet the aim of our community to be reunite with our islands it have be conclude after nearly year of negotiation between mauritius and the uk and extensive consultation unless therefore the agreement be approve and implement our exile will continue with no hope of restore our fundamental human right to return it be the creation of biot on june year ago which lead to our exile official report october vol correction we be see another page in the dramatic history of the indian ocean surely we should recognise the human right of the people who be so disgracefully treat by britain and by the united states but principally by britain they at last will see some degree of justice and the ability to return to their island hope when the minister reply that he will be able to give some hope and comfort on the question of access to diego garcia and also explain why it be necessary to have these incredibly long lease for the us to continue its operation on diego garcia it seem to that we should be work towards the indian ocean be an ocean of peace not an ocean of conflict between rival power for no apparent reason and in crowded field the government have choose the chagos island as one of the many hill they wish to die on the surrender of the sovereignty of the chagos island have be puzzle mis step for month with today vote the culmination of it there be clumsy rush to try to force the deal through first before the election in mauritius and then before the us election and there now appear to be an attempt to salvage some dignity have seemingly surrender meekly to mauritian shakedown as my right hon friend the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat have put it while try to upsell the deal to us government that publicly back it give that it will not cost they penny but privately must have concern over the impact of allow chinese encroachment in the region with recent development shift the focus of us foreign policy to the indo pacific the chagos island deal surely take on great significance the base be now more important to us policy not less last december the previous armed forces minister the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard who be in his place announce that the deal secure the future of the uk us base on diego garcia and say that when everyone look at the detail of the deal they will back report december vol indeed the minister for the overseas territories the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty confirm to that there have be no change to the substance of the report february vol that be strange because the new prime minister of mauritius navin ramgoolam describe the deal strike with the previous mauritian government as sell out state that the deal should be index to inflation take exchange rate into account and fully recognise mauritius ownership of the island which could affect the uk unilateral right to renew the lease that be in mid january less than fortnight later the minister confirm to in write answer that the uk would not have the unilateral ability to extend the agreement at the end of the lease what change be make to the original deal during discussion with the government of mauritius and why have the government go on record as say that the deal have not change in direct contradiction with the statement of the prime minister of mauritius surely the minister for the overseas territories be not suggest that prime minister ramgoolam be mistaken in january when ask the prime minister whether he have ever discuss the chagos island with philippe sands kc his answer be brusque no brevity be key when try not to give too much away philippe sands have represent mauritius at the international court of justice in multiple dispute over the chagos island in mr sands publish the last colony tale of exile justice and britain colonial legacy about chagos it be worth highlight that philippe sands and the prime minister have apparently be very good friend for several year they even interview one another at the hay festival early this year the telegraph report that the national security justification for surrender the chagos island use by the prime minister come from philippe sands who write about it in the book the international legal order in the century with mr sands apparently no long represent mauritius follow the change in regime it do make one wonder if that be the reason why there be such rush to conclude the deal before the election after which mr sands service be no long require do the government lose their in would be interested to know how the government think the international telecommunication union would block our use of the electromagnetic spectrum how would it block communication equipment on diego garcia without encroach on our territory what active blocking of electromagnetic frequency be un agency capable of do anyway what step would the itu have take to block the us military use of the electromagnetic spectrum have we not progress this deal the national security argument simply do not stack up new clause would require the secretary of state to report annually to parliament on the impact of unclos on the operation of the treaty the government have previously state that it be itlos that would pose the great threat to the operation of diego garcia it be cite specifically by the defence secretary for the first and only time on may when he say there be range of international legal challenge and ruling against we the most proximate and the most potentially serious be the international tribunal for the law of the sea official report may vol in july the minister for the overseas territories refer to itlos for the first time since he be shadow minister for foreign commonwealth and development affairs when in december he have state that the international tribunal for the law of the sea do not have competence on territorial dispute go on to say it be fact that china have make increase encroachment into the territorial water of its neighbour and vast claim in the south china sea while ignore judgment against itself that have be match by grow assertiveness and even belligerence towards some of our ally and partner in the report december vol he ask for assurance then now nearly three year later with belligerent china flex its naval muscle in the region and adopt robust posture towards we over the delay to the decision on its london embassy and the obvious ongoing spy debacle what assurance can the government give the committee that this opportunity will not be exploit by the chinese communist party as recently as august the mauritian government refer to the strategic role of mauritius as an investment gateway to africa and trusted partner for chinese enterprise seek to expand their footprint therein mauritius be commit to work closely with china far close it would appear than it be to work with we why be the government prepare to embolden chinese ambition in the pacific why be they prepared to embolden chinese spying in parliament why be they prepared to allow the chinese to build an embassy in london without absolute clarity on its structural plan with all that in mind why will the government not include china in the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme the shadow of jonathan powell loom large over this deal as it have over every aspect of the government dealing with the chinese communist party across the globe we be see change in the rule base order we must navigate this well my fear which be share by all on the conservative benches be that this capitulation show no understanding of the change we be face we need to ensure that this great nation stand up for safety freedom and security across an increasingly dangerous world and this opaque and furtive deal put that at unacceptable risk deal of such implication one would have think would have be hotly debate in this house yet as have be point out there have be no attempt to defend it by the government in fact one could hardly call this debate it have all be one sided in debate people usually argue in favour of whatever the proposal happen to be and listen to and rebut the argument from the other side we have have no rebuttal from the other side the government today despite the fact that this be such an important deal for some people outside the house this deal might seem to be an unimportant issue where be the chagos island and why do they matter however even if the attitude take by government members be to say our constituent be not all that interested in the issue around the chagos island there be issue with this deal that have be raise this evening that should concern they all let we look at the issue because they be address by the amendment the first be human right the human right of the people who be displace in the and who be ignore in this deal their right to self determination and to decide where they live be be ignore yet we be not get any response from the government the party that talk about human right all the time they say that we can not leave the european convention on human right because human right be so important but they be ignore the human right of the people who be affect by this deal will the right hon member give way since we be go to have debate will listen to the minister thank the right hon member for give way he say that he want debate and have give number of rebuttal he mention the chagossians whom will come to in my concluding remark respect what he have to say but point he to remark from the chagos refugees group which say in its communiqué to all of we we urge all member of parliament to support the bill at its final stage and deliver long overdue justice to all our people pass this bill will mark turning point and the moment when parliament stand on the right side of history and begin to restore what be unjustly take from we there be range of view within the chagossian community and think it be important that those be put on the record of course there be many who take totally different point of view and whose wish be not reflect in this bill the amendment that have be table to seek to remedy that situation be be ignore and oppose by the government the second issue be the economy on regular basis we hear how difficult the fiscal position be for this country black hole we have to fill by take money off pensioner reduce benefit cut here and cut there and tax people to the hilt yet when amendment be table that simply request transparency and the opportunity to look at the expenditure involve in this treaty we hear no support from the government either we be concerned about the fiscal position of this country or we be not would suggest that billion and rise be significant figure that we should be look at the right hon member be make powerful point be not part of the problem that we do not even know which budget the money be come out of that be the kind of simple question that the man or woman on the street would expect we to be able answer we may not know which budget it be come from but we know whose pocket it be come from the pocket of taxpayer to certain extent it do not really matter because all our constituent will pay for this deal the minister say that the chagos island be priceless yet we be give they away and give away taxpayer money for they and we do not even know how much we will be give in the long run would have think that some government members have concern if not about human right then about the financial implication of the deal especially at this time national security be an important issue for every member of the house yet amendment that seek to ensure that there be scrutiny over what happen to these island who have influence in they and whether the treaty that have be enter into guarantee that our security will not be jeopardise be be refuse the government be not even attack the amendment or explain their opposition do the right hon member share my dismay that despite government majority of over and the fact that there be over government mp on an issue of national security only one government back bencher speak in this debate do he think that be an indication of how the labour party view national security and an overseas territory be give away for nothing do since the hon member have give the opportunity will make the point now be go to make it later on that while no government members have be rush to defend the bill in the committee hundred of they will be rush through the lobby at or half past to vote for it that be the worrying thing defence of it there be none support for it despite the issue we have highlight there will be hear time and again that the government be the green government there have ever be some people will say as they already have well you can hardly talk about green government give your attitude towards man make climate change the fact that do not support the policy of net zero do not mean that do not care about the environment indeed we need to protect many aspect of our environment and some of the green policy actually destroy the environment but will leave that there on the environmental audit committee we recently call for an end to bottom trawling because of the damage it do to the marine environment will the right hon member give way will in minute but let finish this point yet here we have bill that do not give any long term security to one of the pristine marine environment indeed we be hand over responsibility for it to government who could not even get boat to put flag up yet we be suppose to believe that they will be able to protect the marine environment if foreign country attempt to destroy it by do deep sea trawling bottom trawling and so on would have think that the environmentalist on the government benches might at least have ask some question about the treaty or would have support some of the amendment that seek to do that yet we find that be not the case this be bad bill it will have long term implication for our country financially and it will have long term implication for those people who feel that perhaps there be an opportunity for their right to self determination to be grant they have not be of course there be also danger to our long term security will finish with this point have no doubt that the minister will repeat the point he make sure the americans support it as if the americans always make good strategic decision they do not give the time tonight know that you would stop madam chairman if start go through some of the bad strategic decision the americans have make that we and the world have live with and their consequence just because the americans for short term gain or short term interest have support the deal let we not say it be okay it be bad deal amendment be make to try to improve the bill the shame be that those amendment be not debate the bill go contrary to the belief of many member on the government benches unfortunately suspect the bill will go through with huge majority for the final back bench contribution call mr jim shannon if people have contribute they should make their way back to the chamber danny kruger be look at you to whip your colleague indicate assent thank you for allow to speak on this issue once again ms ghani will prefix my comment with this it be always good to see the ministers the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty and the minister for defence readiness and industry the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard in their place they be both honourable man whose friendship value be ever respectful and with great respect to both hon gentleman wish to make some comment that will be very contrary to what they have put forward today it will be no surprise that rise at the last hour and as the last back bench speaker that be often the case but none the less it be always pleasure to make contribution to ask the government again to reconsider their decision and ask the committee to oppose the bill even though know that the number game do not stack up as we all know the treaty provide for mauritius to exercise full sovereignty over the chagos archipelago with the uk exercise right on diego garcia during an initial year period over those year the uk will pay mauritius total of around billion in price and that will probably rise at time when the government be tax farmer tax widow pension and tax the middle class into oblivion hand over billion with benefit that be not tangible be unacceptable our constituent will be bad off in the next financial year indeed typical british family be as much as year poor than they be five year ago accord to recent telegraph money analysis why then have we enter into this agreement which may fluctuate and cost substantially more than the figure that have be predict want to make it clear that believe this treaty should be renegotiate from begin to end but if the bill be to go ahead it be essential that any increase in payment should come through this house and that whatever government be in place at that time should present that therefore support new clause which would give certainty and security that increase would not take place without the approval of this house turn to new clause and have long state that there be now substantial risk to our military basis and that have be reiterate by every person bar one in the committee today be anxious to understand our legal standing on this believe it be right and proper for the committee to understand the nature of how rent from mauritius will give we the safety and security need to ensure that those station on the base or rely on support from the base in that area will not feel vulnerable or expose believe that this deal do expose we and that we need to be very much aware of our standing and take the necessary step that begin with have full knowledge and not simply empty assurance the recent debacle with the chinese spy decision have show that openness transparency and accountability be need even more tonight than they have be in the other statement and urgent question today new clause would enforce that as minimum new clause be similar to new clause table by the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister and my right hon friend the member for east antrim sammy wilson support new clause give its similarity to the new clause bring forward by my northern ireland colleague who be intimately aware of how issue on the ground can be vastly different from those that be report this addition to ensure that report be make on the compliance of the treaty and the act with the un general assembly resolution on decolonisation be vital and believe underline the word of support that have be give to those in the area who be fearful of the removal of british influence and support and fearful of the mauritian ideal which be flag by our american ally in their human right report in as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief know that the two issue of human right and persecution be married together as one because when we highlight the issue of human right we also highlight the issue of persecution of religious belief and vice versa really have to express some concern over human right in this context understand that the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office the hon member for cardiff south and penarth will reply to the debate although believe he understand and believe in these issue as strongly as do still have great concern about human right it be essential that we do not simply hand over control and abandon not just the military base but all in the region who have rely on our support and friendship over the year unfortunately this have be bad treaty from begin to end our chagossian citizen remain unhappy our armed force remain unhappy and the family who be foot the bill be unhappy believe that the government have make the wrong decision on this the recent chinese debacle have heighten the need to continue to have boot on the ground and eye wide open against those who would seek to thwart british interest and the interest of freedom and democracy worldwide we have recently see the result of appeasement when the israeli deputy prime minister highlight the difficulty bring about by this government decision to recognise terrorism and palestinian state with no border no work non terrorist government and no social care system the handing over of chagos and rent it back will prove to be costly and dangerous exercise in capitulation and even at this very late stage urge the government to think again and at the very least accept additional protection for the sake of all our collective security thank all hon and right hon member for their contribution will attempt to respond to the specific of the amendment and new clause in due course but want to come back to some of the fundamental point that have be raise during the debate first and also want to respond to some of the specific question that be raise with the exception of some genuine question in relation to the chagossians the mpa and the environmental protection and the implementation of this treaty it be shame to see the rehash of the same argument that be make on second reading there be some outrageous and nonsensical argument and claim particularly relate to the cost and to other matter which will come to be shock by some of the anti american conspiracy fuel nonsense that we hear at various point during the debate the base be critical to the united kingdom the united states our ally and our national security and the bill and the treaty protect the functioning of that base it do not surrender it it secure it into the future this be government who inherit mess from the former ministers on the opposition benches we be get stuff do we be patriotic government our first duty be to protect the national security of this country and that be why we have get this deal do it be why it be back by the united states it be why it be back by our five eyes partner it be absolutely crucial to protect the british people and our ally we have be very transparent about the reason for it and they be the exact opposite of what have be suggest come back as always have do to the fundamental question if there be not problem and risk to the operation of this crucial base why do the previous government start the negotiation why do they continue they through round of negotiation and why do they continue they right up until the general election those be the fact will the minister give way will happily take intervention but first want to respond to the point that have be make this agreement have be back by our key ally and international partner include the us and our five eyes ally india japan and south korea have also make clear their strong support many question be ask about the robust security provision that we have in place to protect the uk and the base for decade to come the treaty and the bill secure full operational control of diego garcia strict ban on foreign security force across the archipelago and an effective veto on any activity that threaten the base on diego garcia it have be welcome by the international agreements committee and the international relations and development committee in the other place which say that they be assure that the agreement preserve the uk and the us freedom of action the legal rationale have be refer to many time but legally bind provisional measure from the court could have come within week for example affect our ability to patrol the water around diego garcia and even if we do not comply international organisation and other country would we have set out the legal rationale on number of occasion we have be very clear we also publish document around it will the minister give way will respond to some point first hon member have have plenty of time to make their case have also respond to many of their point during the course of the debate and be go to respond to the question china have be raise erroneously on many occasion but we have negotiate robust security provision to protect the uk and the base for decade to come and that include strict ban on any foreign security force include the chinese across the archipelago the question of finance be raise by number of member and indeed number of the amendment refer to it have to be absolutely clear as be on second reading the billion to billion figure quote by some from the opposition be totally inaccurate and wildly misleading it be utterly wrong to ignore the effect of inflation and the change value of money on the real cost of deal that last year we publish the full cost alongside the treaty hon member how much they ask how much have be very clear about that throughout the debate and at the early stage the average cost per year in today money be million and the net present value of payment under the treaty be billion just for comparison the cost compare favourably to other international basing agreement france for example as say recently announce an million year deal with djibouti this base be much large and have much more capability so it compare very favourably conservative members ask about cost the total expect cost of the treaty use that npv methodology which be the same that have be agree by the government actuary department and other be just over one third of the value lose by the department for health and social care under their government on ppe that be waste in the first year of the pandemic if they want to talk about cost and waste money this be clear investment in our national security we will not scrimp on our national security and we will not apologise for keep our base safe could the minister give any example worldwide where npv have be use for sovereignty purpose have be clear throughout we have set and publish the methodology it have be back by the office for budget responsibility the statistic regulator and other and be happy to set that all out again in write for the hon member if that would be helpful be quite surprised to hear some of the unfortunate remark make by some member about the united states and its commitment to this base the united states pay for the operating cost we have crucial national security relationship which keep we the united states and our ally safe this be joint base on diego garcia it be absolutely right that those arrangement be in place as say the value from the capability of the base be priceless this be absolutely the right investment to make be appal by some of the comment be make remind the committee that president trump secretary of war hegseth and secretary rubio have publicly support the treaty as have five eyes partner and other will the minister give way no will not give way to the hon member he be not even here throughout the debate his leader the hon member for clacton nigel farage be miss in action oh he turn up now he come up with so many figure throughout this process but he have finally turn up it be good to see he here question be raise about the chagossians and want to respond to they seriously because recognise as have do the very sincere feeling that be feel among different part of the chagossian community we have hear range of view express today by different member and acknowledge the chagossians who be here in the gallery understand many of they will not support this treaty but other chagossians and chagossian group do support it as we have hear during the debate but repeat again for the record that the government deeply regret the way chagossians be remove from the island we be commit to build relationship that be build on respect and acknowledgment of the wrong of the past the negotiation be between the uk and mauritius with our priority be to secure full operation of the base on diego garcia but we will finance new trust fund for mauritius to use in support of the chagossian community we will work to start new programme of visit include to diego garcia of course mauritius will be able to develop programme of resettlement on the island other than diego garcia we will continue our support to chagossians live in the uk through new and exist project hope the whole committee can unite around this point pay tribute to the chagossians in the united kingdom for the contribution they make to the school in their community and to the catholic church where they live and in my constituency for their work at wythenshawe hospital and manchester airport it be second to none they be welcome here and we value they very much despite our political difference in this chamber completely and wholeheartedly associate myself with those comment from my hon friend know he have be passionate advocate for chagossians in the uk and particularly in his constituency over many year we have speak about this matter many time and know he and other member speak passionately on the matter will the minister reply to the point make by the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton myself and other that not in the last year since the exchange of colony after the first world war have people be transfer from the sovereignty of one empire to another without be properly consult the right hon member know that we regret what happen historically in relation to the chagos islands he will also know that the island be not permanently inhabit that be necessarily negotiation between the united kingdom and mauritius let respond to the many point about the environment on which many amendment be table we be absolutely clear that the united kingdom and mauritius be commit to protect one of the world most important marine environment indeed the mauritian prime minister meet the former secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend the member for streatham and croydon north steve reed in the margin of the third united nations ocean conference in nice on june where he reaffirm his commitment to the creation of that marine protect area around the chagos archipelago that will be support by an enhance partnership with we the treaty have be welcome by lead conservation ngos include the zoological society of london we continue to work with mauritius on the implementation of that measure we be consider seriously the many genuine concern that right hon and hon member include the chair of the foreign affairs committee and member of the environmental audit committee have raise they be serious and important question and assure the committee that we be take they seriously and will try to update the house on they in due course be grateful to the minister for give way he be be very generous in the clear position be that the international court of justice be not in position to adjudicate on the relationship between we and member of the commonwealth have that change and if so when we have be very clear about the legal position and the legal risk the right hon gentleman government know this it be why they start the process do not want to detain the committee by go through all the argument that make on second but he know that we face the comprehensive rejection of our argument at the icj in we lose vote at the un general assembly we have the maritime delineation judgment bind on mauritius and the order will hear the minister thank you madam chairman the opposition ask question and then make so much noise they do not even want to hear the answer have mention the obligation place on the biot administration by un body to cease specific activity have mention the series of procedural complication and blockage at international organisation include the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty there be many example of clear risk have explain before the potential under annex vii of unclos potential the hon gentleman chunter potential but be he willing to gamble with our national security be he willing to gamble on the operational effect interruption oh he be willing to gamble find it absolutely extraordinary that he be willing to gamble with our national security and that of our ally that be exactly why the united states and our five eyes partner back this deal it settle that debate will turn to the amendment the right hon member for witham priti patel table amendment and and new clause on the publication of legal advice she will know from her time in government that it be highly unusual for the government to publish legal advice that they have obtain that advice be privileged and it be important that the government be able to take frank and confidential advice as she well know in some circumstance the government may publish statement of their legal position as we do in the case of the diego garcia treaty on the day it be sign as have repeatedly explain member keep chuntere about it if long term deal be not reach between the uk and mauritius it be highly likely that far wide range litigation would be bring quickly by mauritius against the uk it might include for example further arbitral proceeding against the uk under annex vii of the un convention on the law of the sea judgment would be bind on the uk let turn to amendment and the hon member for clacton who have finally turn up but be not even listen table several amendment that appear to serve no function other than waste government and parliamentary time the public consultation propose in amendment and the impact assessment would be needlessly costly and time consume they would only confirm the conclusion on which he have no answer already reach by our close ally the united states by the international agreements committee and the international relations and defence committee and by our five eyes partner the public already know that the treaty secure the future of the critical base on diego garcia the strategic value have be debate at length and be well understand we be not willing to gamble with our national security even if the member for clacton be willing to quite frankly he have some gall to turn up after his comment on nato and russia find it quite extraordinary in amendment the hon member for clacton offer an ill conceive proposal that would keep diego garcia list as an overseas territory while accept that his majesty the king would no long be sovereign not only be that constitutionally inaccurate but in the context of the british nationality act it would have serious consequence for the nationality right of chagossians bear on different island in the archipelago surely his intention can not be for individual bear on diego garcia to be treat differently from those bear on peros banhos or the salomon islands amendment and table by the right hon member for witham and amendment table by the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton seek to change or remove the statutory power to make an order in council it be of course absolutely right that parliament should be able to scrutinise the use of power which be why the bill provide for the negative procedure to be use the vast majority of change that the government will make use that power will be technical and operational amendment on matter to ensure that our domestic law be consistent with the new status of diego garcia those be matter as varied as police pension copyright law and change to student finance the propose amendment would mean that the house would be oblige to spend valuable parliamentary time on each change to legislation for year member surely can not wish we to spend that amount of time on all those thing and that approach be consistent with power take to amend exist legislation in previously comparable situation new clause and regard the prior approval of payment have set out clearly the cost and the absolutely nonsensical figure that have be put forward by the opposition and the hon member for clacton and we wholly reject the new clause it be entirely usual and proper for payment under international treaty to be make under the royal prerogative and require separate distinct vote before payment can be make would create unacceptable risk for the long term sustainability of the treaty without the certainty that the bill and the treaty provide the uk and us military would not be able to invest in vital capability that would have major operational implication for the base on new clause table by the hon member for surrey heath the house of commons will scrutinise our annual estimate in the usual way and spend under the treaty will be include in that process new clause be not necessary either new clause and be on the marine protect area there be no requirement for the uk to consent to mauritius establish such an area or to its management and that would be inconsistent with the treaty although the uk will be play different role in respect of the future mpa both the uk and mauritius remain committed to protect that vital marine environment that be why under the term of the treaty we will provide technical support and assistance to mauritius in accordance with separate write instrument we will not make any

let we be absolutely clear the conservatives start the negotiation they hold round but they fail to secure deal it be question that not single tory mp want to answer today why do they start these negotiation if it be so bad if it be such threat to national security why be it conservative government who start the negotiation why do they hold round it be labour government who secure the deal it be labour government who be go to secure the future of our military base and that be why commend the bill to the house let begin my remark by once again pay tribute to the heroic chagossian community who have join we once again for this debate and have be here for good four hour in response to the minister last point he may have hear we say this previously on second reading and during opposition day debate no deal be well than terrible deal and the conservative party would never have put this deal forward throughout the process the they can all make as much noise as they want on the government bench none of they be they can point their finger as much as they want none of they be sit here early to defend their government on this terrible deal let come back to the chagossian community because throughout this process they have be silence and ignore by this government and they have face decade of pain and hurt laughter this be not laugh matter at all hon member may want to sneer about this but they should pay some respect to the chagossian people because we praise they and be grateful to they for their dignified campaign there be some member in this house even on the government benches who have chagossians as their own constituent who they have make representation on behalf of as well think we should thank they for the work that they have do also want to thank hon member from across the house for their interest in this bill and their diligent scrutiny say that because the labour government have seek to keep debate on their surrender treaty as short and restrict as possible and we have see that again interruption they have not be here to contribute to those debate what would they know be particularly grateful for the effort of hon member who have challenge and debate the bill include the interest in the foreign affairs committee evidence session opposition members on the environmental audit committee and the science and technology committee spend valuable time in select committees let emphasise that in select committees scrutinise this treaty opposition members have be relentless and thank they for their forensic questioning and for expose the scandalous way in which this government have act these debate have benefit from the legal expertise and knowledge of former ministers and law officers and be thankful to they for their contribution and support also want to pay tribute to the minister for the overseas territories the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty he have be diligent in respond to questioning and he have probably spend more time in the house debate this issue as well as respond to write communication than he originally expect he have become the minister for defend the indefensible although we do disagree robustly on this treaty we thank he and respect he for his contribution let we be clear this be bad bill for britain the opposition will continue to oppose it and our colleague in the other place will give it further scrutiny it leave britain weak and poor it give succour to our enemy and it have show the world that under labour britain be be govern by weak ministers who appease the whim of left wing lawyer and activist rather than stand up for our national interest friend and foe alike will now see britain as soft touch that can be bully by lawfare into wave the white flag of surrender rather than proudly fly the union flag for britain stand in the world for our defence and national security and for our suffer british taxpayer bitterly regret the passage of this bill for month we have be call on labour to step back from the brink and ditch this mind boggle surrender deal but this government have arrogantly blunder on britain comprehensively lose in these negotiation the treaty and the bill that we have consider today as result minister have squirm and roll over at every turn and have be eat for breakfast by the mauritian government let be clear we will oppose this bill every step of the way in this house and in the other place it be worth note that within week of come to power this soft touch government decide that they would end more than year of british sovereignty over this vital territory for our country security and national interest and for no justifiable reason we be not just give up the island of the archipelago more than that the national interest be be squander and so be peace and stability in that area the government be ask british taxpayer whom they have already thrash with vindictive taxis now to shoulder the burden of this scandalous deal and it be simply not on labour government often bang on about the redistribution of wealth but today they take it to new level with the redistribution of wealth from britain to mauritius how much of the money will be plunder from the defence budget hinder our armed force ability to procure new capability at the bad possible time it come as the minister for defence procurement have oversee freeze on procurement as the world get more dangerous and we do know that the world be get more dangerous the much vaunted strategic defence review which labour pledge would see off all the major threat be overdue and underfunded but guess what labour have no plan to pay for it now here we be now the government have find it within themselves to spend billion on this deal this be not just money from down the line in the future it be hundred of million of pound each year within this parliament today the government have sink to new low labour mp have vote against give parliament this house say over send billion of our constituent money to mauritius with no string attach mauritius will now use our money to reduce its debt and cut taxis because of this government labour mp have vote to block the publication of summary of legal advice on which the government rely to make this dodgy deal we might have think that they have learn from the current china debacle that this be not the right way but no they still can not offer sound legal explanation for why they have rush through this deal the government have refuse to adopt our amendment to ensure the monitoring of how the right of chagossians will be safeguard the chagossians to whom we have special responsibility have be neglect and ignore by labour since the election so it come as no surprise and it be now bitter blow for they that there be no cost implication or indeed any good reason as to why we be go down this route the government have also decline to adopt our amendment to keep the intelligence and security committee apprise of the security protection in this treaty again deny hon member the scrutiny to which we be entitle it be astonishing in the light of the national security concern that this terrible deal now bring and it leave our country weak and poor this be deal that this government and our country will come to regret call the liberal democrat spokesperson it give no pleasure to say that this bill fail the chagossian people for decade decision about the chagos islands have be take without the consent of those most affected the treaty continue that injustice offer no guarantee right of return no legally bind resettlement plan and no meaningful protection of chagossian right the liberal democrats support negotiation with mauritius and support respect for international law but never at the expense of chagossian dignity the treaty as it stand lack transparency environmental safeguard and accountability for the substantial public expenditure that it entail that be why we table seven amendment to inscribe parliamentary oversight to protect the marine environment and to uphold chagossian right to self determination that include provision for scrutiny of ministerial decision mandatory environmental reporting and referendum of the chagossian people themselves we also call for full financial transparency and review of the welfare of chagossians live in the uk many of whom continue to face hardship as direct result of their historical displacement this be not merely matter of geopolitical asset or territorial claim it be about justice belong and moral responsibility to those who call the chagos island home thank the minister of state at the foreign commonwealth and development office the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty for the numerous conversation that we have have during the passage of the bill he have be generous with his time be disappointed however that he do not feel able to accept some of my amendment and suggestion during that process will finish with word lift from the un charter document that this country help to shape the purposes of the united nations be to develop friendly relation among nation base on respect for the principle of equal right and self determination of people that right have be deny to the chagossian people for more than year so urge member across the house to think carefully when vote this evening about whether they wish to compound that half century of injustice or embrace the foundational principle of the un interruption if this house wish to do the latter we can not allow the bill to pass without ensure that chagossian themselves be sovereign over their citizenship the governance of their island and the prospect of return hon member how be you vote ask conservative right hon and hon member on my right hand side who have laud the effort of the chagossian people but sit on their hand when they have the opportunity to give chagossian the right to referendum whether they wish to keep chuntere from sedentary position in direct response to the minister who challenge this in committee say that the forced displacement of people do not and can not annul the identity or the right of the chagossians as people to suggest otherwise perpetuate the disgrace of the past and as sentiment that be unworthy of this bill and of this house diane
