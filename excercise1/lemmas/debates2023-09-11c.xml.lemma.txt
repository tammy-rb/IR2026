identity of those allege to be involve engage in speculation about the case or discuss other detail run serious risk of prejudice any further prosecution the comment make in the medium be unhelpful

of state be ask service personnel retirement age and conditions for service what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the retirement age and condition for service personnel the thought and prayer of the whole house will be with the secretary of state and his family during sit shiva it be right that we record here today the anniversary of terrible act that change our world let also say that the uk be stand with the kingdom of morocco we be engage on the ground already and stand by to help in any way that we can defence recognise the need to evolve so that we continue to attract and retain the very good to that end the mod commission the haythornthwaite review into armed force incentivisation which be publish in june will respond formally on behalf of the department in the come month but it be supportive of the recommendation on retirement age have commit to work with official and the single service to review rigid cut off and to consider establish an assessment framework to be use on case by case basis may associate myself with the early remark of the minister whom thank for his answer as he be aware have already take an interest and write in about this issue have constituent who come to recently have spend good number of year in the armed force he be very proud of what he have give to keep our country safe but be concern that the armed force particularly the army be lose institutional memory he feel that the cut off age of for reservist be too young certainly for more administrative role will the mod take that into account in the review and consider allow reservist to stay long in those role be really happy to declare my interest at this point as be in my year and remain reservist be sympathetic to the point that the hon lady make and we will certainly factor they into our review call the shadow secretary of state we know that the defence secretary be with his close family today and we in the opposition extend our deep condolence also offer the secretary of state our warm congratulation over the year and in different role have shadow he and he have shadow and we both know that the first duty of any government be to keep our country safe will always look to work with he on that basis in his new job on personnel level of satisfaction with service life have plunge third over the past year what be the plan to lift those record low level of military morale the right hon gentleman paint an overly gloomy picture of life in the armed force for most people it be rewarding career and they take with they the skill that they need into civilian life and prosper however we be aware of our need to compete in the workplace in the year ahead and to that end we have commission rick haythornthwaite review which we broadly agree with and will respond to very soon welcome the snp spokesperson to his place thank you mr speaker let also associate snp members with the word of the minister for the secretary of state at this sad time we also think of morocco and all those new yorkers who be remember today we know that the cost of living crisis be affect we all equally the minister have say some fine word today but we know that for his party there be often an inverse relationship between rhetoric and action with regard to our personnel will the minister tell the house and member of the armed force what his government will do to remedy the shameful reality of armed force personnel be give the low pay rise among public servant paltry think the hon gentleman may be in error the low pay member of our armed force be award by the armed forces pay review body recommendation that we accept in full senior get and those of two star rank and above get that will give the good pay award to the least well pay in our armed force disagree on the number let we talk about the rhetoric from the right hon gentleman unless his government be willing to deal with pay and housing condition for the armed force properly as the armed force personnel leave the force for well pay job could it not be time to consider the reason that the police be able to secure an almost high pay rise than our other uniformed public servant be it because they have statutory body to represent they in deal with the government and why do his government not support that action the hon gentleman have ignore what have be say he also do not make reference to the freezing of charge for accommodation and food wraparound childcare and whole raft of measure that we have introduce to help with the cost of living crisis raf quick reaction alert stations what recent assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the raf quick reaction alert station royal air force pilot and ground crew be poise on quick reaction alert hour day seven day week all year round ready to scramble within minute my hon friend would point out quickly that it would be remiss of to say that that be solely the endeavour of fast jet pilot equally poise be those in his constituency who crew the tanker that must also deploy rapidly to support qra have be launch on five occasion in with every incident resolve successfully thank the minister for his kind word about my constituent he will no doubt have read the report from the select committee on defence aviation procurement wing it which warn of an unacceptable gap in combat air mass with the retirement of the hercules place even more demand on the air mobility force and the voyagers to which he rightly pay tribute be ask to do more and more each month what confidence do he have that if require to do so those force have enough man woman and machine to defend the uk in peer conflict have complete confidence that quick reaction alert will be resource the high priority of the air force be to defend the homeland also have complete confidence that the combat air force as currently structure be capable of perform very wide range of duty around the world pay tribute to the work of the air and space commander and his team who through work on agile deployment be find that we can deploy typhoon and ever more quickly to ever more austere operating environment that drive the productivity of the force even far there be of course no question over the quality of combat aircrew but there be big question mark over the quantity of aircraft that they can fly want to challenge the minister on the confidence he have just articulate because there be serious concern that our combat aircrew be engage almost universally in transit and air policing and have very little aircraft availability to practise proper combat air what be his assessment of that concern we take very seriously the work that the defence committee do we enjoy read the committee report and as hope member of the committee and of the house recognise often take the finding into policy do push back gently however because in addition to the incredible work of qra and the support the royal air force have give to nato mission over the last month since the start of the war in ukraine they have also be able to support carrier strike deployment deployment on exercise red flag and indeed the deployment of squadron below full strength all the way across to australia that get to exactly what tell my hon friend the member for witney robert courts that this ability to deploy air force with great agility far from home in more austere setting be step change for the royal air force allow it to operate from more austere environment rather than solely from its home basis defence sector uk base job what step he be take to help increase the number of uk base job in the defence sector the late estimate suggest that ministry of defence investment support over job in industry across the uk believe that the good way to keep grow job in defence be to back the british defence industry that be why be delighted to confirm that this week in london we be host the big ever dsei defence and security equipment international showcase the very good of the british defence industry with company large and small we should remember that they provide not only prosperity in every part of our country but the mean to defend ourselves in an increasingly contested world the defence secretary predecessor rightly prioritise british job over buy off the shelf from america but the times recently expose difference of opinion with the prime minister who insist on buy american helicopter can the minister assure the house that the secretary of state will stand up for british job and research and development or be our only hope to replace he with my right hon friend the member for wentworth and dearne john healey debate be ongoing in defence procurement and have be for many year about the difference between buy off the shelf and have our own sovereign capability the fact be that until we bring out the defence and security industrial strategy in arguably the default position of the mod be to go primarily for value for money since dsis we have more flexible and balanced approach see in many specific procurement where we give much great weighting to social value and local content this be illustrate in many procurement because above all we want to support british job and have our own sovereign capability my condolence to the secretary of state babcock be one of the large defence employer in the country but as report in the sunday press its record on refit of surface ship be woeful it take over four year to refit the type frigate hms iron duke its record on submarine be even bad take seven year to refit trident boat accord to the journal navy lookout which say this online so presumably the russians and the chinese could have read it few week ago not single one of our attack submarine be at sea they be all tie up alongside this be deeply embarrassing to the department and to the royal navy whose admiral be tear their hair out it be babcock fault will minister get the senior director of babcock into the department for an interview without coffee and ask they to raise their game for the benefit of the navy and the defence of the realm have the great respect for my right hon friend but he will appreciate that we do not comment on the operational availability of submarine which be particularly sensitive matter however he be absolutely right that we need to focus on the time it be take to bring ship and all aspect of our fleet back into service confirm that regularly engage with babcock and will visit devonport very soon welcome the shadow minister maria eagle to her role thank you very much mr speaker the government have waste billion through the mismanagement of defence procurement while fail to deliver vital equipment and oversee the loss of highly skilled job in the defence and aerospace industry since do the minister accept that prevent another year of tory failure be key to increase the number of uk base job in the defence sector back british industry and british military resilience welcome the right hon lady to her new position as my ministerial shadow we be very proud of our record because in the past year or so we have be face with war on our doorstep in europe and procurement have rise to the occasion defence equipment and support in abbey wood have deliver kit to ukraine in record speed we have see the acquisition of equipment such as the archer on quick basis to fit our requirement absolutely confirm that we be committed to maximise the number of job that come from our procurement while balance that with the need to give our armed force the good possible capability support for veterans what step his department be take to support veteran what recent step veterans uk have take to support veteran and their family the mod deliver range of service to veteran and their family include the administration and payment of armed force pension and compensation and tailor advice and assistance through the veterans welfare service defence transition services and integrate personal commissioning for veteran the independent review of those service be publish in july and we will respond in full to the recommendation later this year last october my constituent disabled veteran who serve with distinction in afghanistan and iraq apply to the war pension and armed force compensation scheme despite his supply all the information require and medical evidence he be still wait for the determination of his case almost month on will my right hon friend look into the case as matter of urgency and carry out review of the waiting time for the scheme to make sure that nobody else have to wait such long time to get their due reward if my hon friend be able to provide further detail of that specific case would be happy to investigate the late armed force compensation scheme quinquennial review be publish on july the review process aim to ensure that the scheme remain fit for purpose and to identify opportunity for improvement of the sort that my hon friend highlight the review recommendation be currently be consider think timeliness be foremost among they and government response will be publish later this year the royal british legion recent report show that only of disabled veteran who apply for employment and support allowance have their service medical record consider in their work capability assessment extend my condolence to the defence secretary but what discussion have he have with the secretary of state for work and pensions about this matter and on disregard all military compensation award for mean test and income base assessment such as for housing benefit such conversation be live in the context of the work previously describe we will take into account the hon lady point which have be make by several people in the defence and veteran community know that people feel strongly about such issue ultimately of course it be matter for the department for work and pensions and the treasury this house as whole provide vociferous support for our veteran of all kind particularly through the mechanism of the all party parliamentary group for the armed force perhaps can take this opportunity to pay tribute to miss amy swash who have now run the appg for for eight year but will sadly leave we shortly for other job thank she for all the work she have do for superb amount of time in particular to raise the plight of veteran my hon friend be absolutely right and add my tribute to his also express my admiration for the armed force parliamentary scheme which do fantastic job in inform and educate colleague in july the government publish review of the treatment of veteran the previous secretary of state response to that win he many plaudit and his reaction be welcome but he do say that he would take his time to ensure we get thing right can the minister give we an update on when we can expect response to the recommendation be grateful to the hon gentleman he be right to raise that at the time say that the community should allow we time but not too much time and be sure they will hold we to that we will respond in full to the large number of recommendation but we be broadly supportive of lord etherton work and there be much in it that we utterly agree with plus some that we would like to add in the way of change for the future call the shadow minister on that theme the loss of livelihood and the long term suffering endure by veteran due to the cruel and unjust ban on homosexuality in the armed force have be enormous the opposition welcome the etherton review into the ban and its recommendation which represent the beginning of long overdue healing process the secretary of state predecessor promise that the government would provide full response to the review recommendation after the summer recess which the house would have an opportunity to debate will the minister confirm when the government will respond to the recommendation and that the house will still be provide with time to debate that response clearly we will be debate this at some length hope the house when it see the government response to lord etherton recommendation will be pleased with it at the moment we be work with the community particularly fight with pride to ensure that what we put in place be right and be acceptable to those who have be do down by the event between to nuclear test medals what step his department be take to deliver nuclear test medal be pleased to say that the nuclear test medal be now in production and we be ensure that as many as possible of the more than veteran and family who have apply for the medal will have it in time for this year remembrance event the minister will know that take an interest in the veteran issue and declare an interest as the president of hinckley royal british legion constituent alfred roy davenport serve in the raf medical team from november to november station on christmas island he be and concerned about the delay there have be in the awarding of these medal so can my right hon friend confirm that all veteran will have these award ready for remembrance sunday so that our servicemen and woman can be congratulate on and recognise for their service as my right hon friend the minister for veterans affair state in the house on september the government be do everything possible to ensure that as many nuclear test veteran as possible receive their medal in time for remembrance sunday appreciate the importance of that presentation event to award the first medal be actively be consider by the office for veterans affairs but it be balance between issue the medal for remembrance sunday and ensure that they be award in an appropriate manner to this cohort in write question to the minister ask whether any file have be remove from the mod health record of nuclear test veteran he assure that the department be not aware of any removal but many nuclear veteran continue to report find large gap when request their medical record can the minister therefore clarify if the file have not be remove how nuclear veteran and their family can gain full access to they they will need to apply for subject access request reiterate what say in my answer to her write question we of course do everything we can to locate record when people request they and assure she that we could find none on this occasion afghan relocations and assistance policy what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme what step he be take to help support afghan national eligible for resettlement under the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme the ministry of defence priority remain the relocation of arap eligible afghans to the safety of third country at good pace his majesty government continue to accommodate and support arap eligible people in third country while they await relocation to the united kingdom be proud to have an afghan interpreter for the british armed force as constituent but be ashamed to learn from he that his brother who work for six year directly for the special air service in helmand province have apply under the arap scheme and be reject without proper explanation he be now in hiding in afghanistan will the minister take up that case as matter of urgency and will he explain to the house why his government be still fail to support those afghans who risk so much to support our armed force the hon lady mention specific role about which it would be inappropriate to speculate on the floor of the house will of course look at the particular case that she mention however it be worth remind right hon and hon colleague that the arap scheme be intend for those who have be in direct support of the uk military interpreter most often and beyond that there be very narrow opportunity for those with special circumstance who have come through under category when colleague write to the ministry of defence to raise case they often do so on behalf of somebody who might have serve in the afghan national security force not necessarily in the direct employ of the uk military that be not to cast any judgment on the case that she raise will look at that specifically and write to she there be deep sense of injustice among former serve officer and other military personnel that we have forget the moral obligation to afghan military personnel and other who serve alongside we will the minister confirm just how many afghan former military personnel be currently present as homeless in the uk and how many be currently in hotel in pakistan it seem that my initial reply might have be quite useful but the hon gentleman may not have hear or understand it arap be not explicitly for those who serve in the afghan armed force alongside the british military it be for those who serve in the employ of the british military in all but very narrow number of case will write to he on his precise question about afghan service personnel who be now homeless in the uk suspect that they be remarkably few but afghan service personnel be not the main target of arap as someone who serve in afghanistan share the sense of many of my former colleague who would have like to have do more but that be simply never what arap be design to do neither be it credible that the hundred of thousand of people who serve in the afghan national force could all be relocate to the uk in hold public meeting shortly after the evacuation from afghanistan it be widely attend by worried and distressed resident who all want help for their relative desperate situation in afghanistan over two year have pass and there be huge problem with arap can the minister say why the government be allow people and their relative to suffer for so long there be know number of people who work in the employ of the british military during our campaign in afghanistan our priority have be to work through and match the list of people we know have work for we with those who be applicant it be my understanding that only about application be outstanding and that decision have be take in the past two month alone overwhelmingly those decision be be afraid to say no to people but we be make good progress and be near the end of track down all those we know have work for we return to the question raise by my hon friend the member for warwick and leamington matt western how many applicant be still be kick out of hotel in the uk and how many be apply from pakistan and in hiding the member for warwick and leamington matt western ask very particular question about afghan service personnel as the record will show answer it but will need to go away and confirm because that be not something that arap be intend to meet and we will need to see if we can find those statistic the hon lady ask how many applicant have be remove from hotel the plan be to remove all arap applicant from hotel because they be not here illegally they have not arrive on boat across the channel they be entitle to be here they have access to full universal credit and housing benefit and much more importantly they have the right to work immediately on arrival our priority unapologetically hope she agree that this be the right approach be to get people out of hotel and into house where they can get on with the life that they so deserve here in the uk as legal citizen it be hardly in the spirit of operation warm welcome that as the second anniversary of the evacuation of kabul pass afghans who support our armed force be still leave crowd into hotel at the taxpayer expense or expect to move hundred of mile from where they have manage to find employment and their child have settle into school when do the minister now expect all afghans in the scheme to be move out of hotel and give suitable offer of accommodation actually agree with the hon lady her question stand in contrast with the previous one because it be about the need to get people out of hotel not suggest that they should somehow be stay in they the minister for veterans affairs have be lead on this task around government few in this house have more emotional energy to drive that mission than he do he see it as of huge importance that people be move out of hotel and allow to get on with their life as quickly as possible will ask his office to write to the hon lady with the exact detail of when he hop to see the job do commend to the defence team and indeed the house the new book by larisa brown the gardener of lashkar gah which outline in great detail the sort of debt we owe to the people who try to help our force my specific question be not about people serve with the afghan force it be about whether we have proper database of all those who serve with the british force and be eligible under the scheme and whether the minister can guarantee that the scheme will not be close while some of those people probably large number of they be still in hiding in afghanistan and thus unable to apply for it it will not surprise my right hon friend to know that the people who work for the british armed force over our extended period in afghanistan appear on many different list and part of the job of work over the past month or so have be to consolidate those into an authoritative list of those whom we know to have work for we however we do have very good record as one would expect the military to have keep that allow we to focus our search on people whom we know to be eligible within the pile of application and of late to make rapid progress in inform those who be ineligible we will of course keep the scheme open for as long as it take to find all of those whom we know work for we thank the minister for his consider remark will he join in thank both colchester city council and essex county council for their work in support many afghan national locally who have be in hotel since last autumn the council have aid those people to get into housing however we still have six family and individual who need to be support in temporary accommodation as such can the minister give assurance to the house about the cross government work that be take place to ensure that those family come out of hotel and become settle and in particular the work that his department be lead on help to get afghans into employment so that they can settle in the united kingdom can absolutely give my right hon friend the assurance she ask for give her previous role in government she know well than anybody that those man and woman who have come here have every legal right to start work and to settle in the uk they deserve their journey here on the back of what they do in support of our armed force so we will support they while they be in hotel and well still once we have get they settle in more permanent accommodation we will support they into employment will make sure that the minister for veterans affair brief my right hon friend on his work on that matter uk obligations to nato what step he be take to ensure the uk meet its obligation to nato our commitment to nato be unwavering we have strengthen our force posture in estonia station light cavalry squadron in poland provide the nato mission in kosovo with personnel surveillance and reconnaissance capability and provide specialist personnel to the nato mission in iraq the national flagship hms queen elizabeth sail over the weekend and will shortly fly the nato flag as the nato flagship while on operation in the euro atlantic we contribute to every nato mission declare our nuclear deterrent to nato and consistently spend at least of gross domestic product on defence we will maintain our lead position in nato over the decade ahead place on record my condolence to the current defence secretary and my thank to the former defence secretary whom we wish well in whatever he undertake to do thank the minister for his full response he will know that nato obligation be to work with partner so can he say what discussion he have have with his counterpart in nato about work with the african union to ensure stability and security in that region colleague have rightly offer their condolence to the new secretary of state and remark on the anniversary of but the thing that have maybe fall through the crack be for we to send our regard to the former secretary of state with whom have the great pleasure of work for three and half year his effort and contribution to defence be quite extraordinary and think he will be remember in history as one of the great secretaries of state he should be very proud of everything he achieve the right hon lady be absolutely right that nato southern flank africa be of enormous importance to europe and the security of the euro atlantic it will not surprise she to know that in the wake of the coup over the summer in both niger and gabon conversation among european defence ministers and nato defence ministers have be regular and urgent as people seek to understand what the response could be it do not look like it be one in which nato would be to the fore but it be clearly in nato interest that european response in africa to these coup be forthcoming send my condolence to the secretary of state as my right hon friend know membership of nato require an expenditure of of gdp this be an arbitrary and paltry figure bear in mind the threat that we all face what discussion be he have with other nato partner many of which be not even spend the to increase their spending on defence steer my hon friend to the communiqué from the vilnius summit which be very clear that nato country that be not yet spend need urgently to increase their spending to do so our prime minister have go far and indicate his willingness to spend on defence once the economic circumstance allow think that that be the right order because we can not have physical security without economic security call the shadow minister after year of tory army cut serious and senior military figure be now question the uk ability to deliver our nato obligation while nato be boost the size of its high readiness force from to follow putin illegal invasion of ukraine uk ministers plan to cut the army far to the small since the napoleonic era the last conservative defence secretary tell this house that the government have hollow out and underfunde our armed force be that still the position of the ministry of defence and will the tory army cut still be force through by this late set of ministers the former secretary of state comment which the shadow minister conveniently quote in limited way be that successive government have fail to invest in the enabler that underpin our war fight capability it be to the credit of this prime minister and the two conservative prime ministers who go before he that commitment have be make to grow our defence budget include under prime minister johnson billion increase to the defence budget and under this prime minister another billion in the last year or so the shadow minister also ignore this when he say that nato be increase its rapid reaction force that do not mean that in nato army be grow it just mean that the army in nato be commit ever more of the force they have to nato high readiness formation the british army be to the fore in that afghan relocations and assistance policy what step his department be take to ensure that the afghan relocation and assistance policy scheme be effective say in may to the house that we aim to process all outstanding initial arap application by the end of august can report that we have just complex case remain from more than principal application that we receive we have issue over decision to applicant in the past three month give they the clarity they deserve and we continue to move at good pace to process the remain application thank my right hon friend and his ministerial colleague for the work do over the summer include with hillingdon and harrow council in my constituency on support for those who have serve in support of our armed force in future as afghan bridge operation come to close can he commit to work with local authority to ensure that those who have put their life on the line support our military operation continue to be support in their new life here in the uk certainly can mr speaker what liaising do the minister do with the home office have an afghan special force interpreter who come here have do valiant work during operation pitting his mother father and sibling leave afghanistan and end up in ukraine of all place and they move to the uk last year the home office give they temporary leave to remain only for they to receive letter in the past couple of month say that they would have to be deport back to either afghanistan ukraine or rwanda in that case intercede and the minister office help but what be go on between his department and the home office from the question can see all sort of way in which that might present quite confusing case to colleague in the home office especially if those in ukraine proceed to the uk under mechanism other than the afghan relocation and assistance policy may look at the detail of the case and come back to the right hon gentleman rather than speculate service accommodation what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of service accommodation for armed force personnel the government continue to invest significant sum to improve the quality of uk service family accommodation with million invest over financial year and combine and million in the forecast for this financial year be million ofsted chief inspector amanda spielman have repeatedly say that she have deep concern about the continue failure to improve service accommodation for armed force recruit over the past seven year will the minister explain why those concern from neutral ofsted inspector amanda spielman have fall on deaf ear and why those improvement be yet to be make this be an extremely important subject and we care immensely about improve our estate such concern do not fall on deaf ear if that be the case we would not have put on the table far million for sfa in the defence command paper refresh precisely because of that additional funding this year our spend will be almost double that of last year the prime minister say he be go to lead by example and that when it come to the military base at catterick he be go to ensure that illegal migrant be house there we now understand that the general have say they do not want bunch of afghans and iraqis next to their squaddie so nothing be happen with regard to illegal migrant be put there although the ministry of defence be so determined that its soldier should not be place near migrant that it be move they out of raf scampton when will illegal migrant be place in catterick as promise by the prime minister want date and want it now visit catterick on friday and discuss precisely that matter with senior member of the armed force base at catterick the characterisation that my right hon friend use be not correct these matter be be consider objectively and carefully but that work be ongoing defence infrastructure organisation service accommodation for injured veterans what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the defence infrastructure organisation in meet the need of injure veteran when adapt service accommodation the defence infrastructure organisation provide additional need and disability adaptation to service family accommodation those provide change to sfa to meet family need as set out by suitably qualified healthcare professional once the scope of any adaptation have be agree with all party work will be deliver as quickly as possible that give service personnel reassurance that their family need can be meet wherever they be assign regardless of the length and number of posting they have within their service career the minister will remember that in june ask about badly injure veteran in my constituency he have write confirmation from the former defence minister in that he would receive extensive adaptation to his home those adaptation have not happen and the situation be so serious that op courage have instigate safeguard proceeding against the ministry of defence to protect my constituent in june the minister request that write to he do so yet again but still have not receive reply will the minister meet finally to sort this out in do so will he reassure the house that conservative minister word be worth the paper it be sign on think that be little harsh have discuss this matter with the hon lady and would of course be more than happy to meet she to discuss her constituent case far she will forgive if do not share the detail with the house topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility be privileged to attend the invictus game this weekend in düsseldorf it be truly humble to meet inspire individual who have triumph in adversity take the opportunity to discuss with my ukrainian counterpart the care and rehabilitation of veteran and the uk unwavere support for her country there be more than former member of the armed force in the south west many of whom reside in my constituency of east devon we must ensure that every veteran can access the service they need when they leave the service can my right hon friend update the house on the progress be make towards deliver id card to all veteran by remembrance day this year my hon friend will be aware that phase of this project be already complete which be to say that as people leave the armed force they be issue with their veteran card those who leave before december should get their card by the end of this year veteran do not require card to prove their status there be several way to verify service and the lack of card should not act as barrier to access support but recognise the importance of this card for many in particular as form of prove their identity and accessing service call the shadow secretary of state as minister know uk unity on ukraine stay strong and the government will continue to have labour full support on military aid ukrainian be now urgently ask for more to help their current counter offensive to succeed and since january the prime minister have repeatedly pledge to accelerate ukraine support when will this happen the right hon gentleman will know full well that the united kingdom be probably the lead nation on many front among our european peer financially in term of kit and in support the people who be conduct the fight against putin aggression we will continue to do that and at the weekend in düsseldorf reiterate that to my ukrainian counterpart do not think anybody could be in any doubt that the united kingdom be lead europe on this front and we will continue to do so but fear uk leadership on ukraine be flag the uk government have commit billion yet germany have now commit billion the uk tank have now be dwarf by from poland and last week decision to proscribe wagner as terrorist group be take by the european union month ago will the minister accept that we must accelerate uk military support and redouble the uk defence diplomacy to maintain western unity and solidarity the uk government prefer action rather than word and point to the ukrainians we be train to storm shadow and to the fact that kit be go out the door right now and be use on the ground rhetoric be one thing action be another

agree that the threat of islamic extremism whether home grow or from abroad remain and that our defence posture should reflect that my right hon friend be absolutely right although the focus of the mod and so many other part of the government have increasingly be on hostile state actor over the last few year today more than any be reminder of the threat of violent extremism pay tribute to the hundred of man and woman around the uk armed force who be deploy on mission counter violence and extremism as speak will the minister update the house on the progress be make to settle the claim of thousand of veteran and their family for what be commonly call gulf war syndrome the hon member be right to raise that the armed force compensation scheme be up and run for they be afraid that there have be delay in some of those application refer to that early on on the science behind it obviously we in defence comply with the good available as assess by the independent medical expert group and we will make policy accordingly understand the point he be make and would be happy to discuss it with he far ukrainian and uk defence company be go up against barrier and bureaucracy when try to set up joint working and joint project could my hon friend update the house on how he be reduce that so that bilateral collaboration can be make easy and quick my hon friend have be an absolute champion

money to be make available to ukraine the prime minister engage with world leader all the time to discuss what be need in ukraine and he have an extraordinarily close relationship with president zelensky both my right hon friend the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss and prime minister johnson deliver on their commitment the prime minister continue to do exactly the same he will be at the dispatch box in about an hour and perhaps ukraine might be mention be sure the minister will agree that our veteran make some of the good role model in society will he applaud my constituent bill cooksey who at the age of complete the great north run this weekend on behalf of nhs charity what can say certainly congratulate bill on complete the great north run at such an extraordinary age admire he hugely and congratulate he the previous secretary of state promise that he would come to david brown santasalo in huddersfield to see the wonderful work that the company do produce the defence equipment that we need will one of the team be able to fulfil that promise it be always pleasure to engage with the hon gentleman if can not visit that specific company intend to hold forum for small and medium sized enterprise around the country the next one be in wales but we will certainly hold they in his part of the world and will let he know the detail while ukraine continue to combat putin aggression on the battlefield there be no let up in russia nefarious campaign of espionage and subversion against western democracy that threat and the so call grey zone span the public private and defence sector aim to continually challenge our critical national infrastructure capability what work be the mod do across government departments and the private and public sector to combat hybrid threat my hon friend be absolutely right it be helpful that the deputy prime minister be sit on the front bench as answer her question because he lead the necessary cross government effort of which defence play an enormous part the national security act have be pass as have the national security investment act and there be billion of investment through the national cyber strategy defence support his majesty government activity apply defence lever to protect uk crucial interest from state threat by deny and defer adversary attack order will get sore throat if we carry on like this one of the great problem that my veteran constituent have be housing accommodation it be as scarce as hen tooth as we would say back home what discussion have the minister have with the housing executive in northern ireland to secure funding and housing for veteran who have just finish service or be retire clearly we want to improve service accommodation all the time however of service accommodation meet or exceed the decent home standard that be admirable compare with the record of many local authority we be invest in accommodation and it be improve all the time very much regret the occasional report of accommodation that fall short of the mark and we seek to rectify it as soon as we can we have hear this afternoon how important the continuity of education allowance be for service family do the minister assess that labour propose attack on private school will make it easy or hard to educate service child it would certainly make it far more expensive it would also threaten small school like warminster school in my constituency which rely very much on service family just reflect on the sacrifice make by all people know who choose to send their child to independent school and in particular member of the defence community who be of course require to make substantial contribution to their child education in the event that they choose to educate they in the independent sector security update with permission mr speaker would like to make statement on claim relate to an ongoing counter terrorism police investigation that be report in the sunday times yesterday sunday september the story allege that two individual include parliamentary researcher have be arrest on charge of conduct espionage on behalf of china these be serious allegation and it be right that they be be thoroughly investigate by the police and relevant agency we must not hamper their work or prejudice any future legal process by what we say today as believe mr speaker you say at the beginning of today proceeding as you would expect to say it would therefore be inappropriate for to comment on any specific aspect of the active investigation itself would however point the house to what the metropolitan police say in their own statement the investigation be be carry out by officer from the met counter terrorism command which have responsibility for investigation relate to allegation of official secrets act and espionage relate offence of course any decision on whether to proceed with prosecution under the official secrets act and related legislation would be matter for the crown prosecution service it remain an absolute priority for the government to take all necessary step to protect the united kingdom from any foreign state activity which seek to undermine our national security prosperity and democratic value the government have be clear that china represent systemic challenge to the united kingdom and to our value that have be evidence in china continue disregard for universal human right and international commitment in xinjiang its erasure of dissent voice and stifle of opposition under its new national security law in hong kong and disturb report of chinese coercion and intimidation in the south china sea we be clear eyed about that challenge and we must be able to look the chinese in the eye and call out unacceptable behaviour directly just as our prime minister be able to do this with premier li at the summit in new delhi this weekend an approach that have also be take consistently by our five eyes ally action speak louder than word and that be why take the decision to instruct department to cease deployment of all surveillance equipment subject to china national intelligence law from sensitive government site in november last year it be one of the reason why ban tiktok from government device the government investigate and call out the so call chinese overseas police service station and as the minister for security my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat set out in statement to this house in june instruct the chinese embassy to close they we significantly reduce chinese involvement in the uk civil nuclear sector include take ownership of china stake in the sizewell nuclear power project and as digital secretary take the decision to ban huawei from our network this afternoon the procurement bill be be debate in the other place the bill will include national security debarment provision that will enable we to act when we see malign influence in our public procurement in take this approach we be align with our five eyes ally and other partner indeed every single partner the uk will deploy again an aircraft carrier to the indo pacific in we have announce aukus new security partnership that will promote free and open indo pacific that be secure and stable and we will work with italy and japan through the global combat air programme to adapt and respond to the security threat of the future through an unprecedented international aerospace coalition these houses of parliament stand as monument to the freedom of expression and belief that underpin our value but just as these institution have provide the paradigm for so many modern democracy there be still those who fear such freedom and who seek to undermine they and to interfere in our society we maintain constant vigilance in our effort to understand and root out that interference and we will always take action to address it whatever its source in the government establish the defend democracy taskforce group that work to co ordinate across government to protect the integrity of our democracy from threat of foreign interference it be engage across government with parliament the uk intelligence community the devolve administrations local authority the private sector and civil society on the full range of threat face our democratic institution those threat include foreign interference in the electoral process disinformation physical and cyber threat to democratic institution and those who represent they foreign interference in public office political party and our university and transnational repression in the united kingdom early this year the government pass the national security act which have overhaul legislation applicable to espionage sabotage and any person act for foreign power against the safety and interest of the united kingdom the measure in the act will enable our law enforcement and intelligence agency to deter detect and disrupt the full range of modern day threat include threat from china new offence in the act will enable the disruption of illegitimate influence conduct for or on behalf of foreign state whether design to advance their interest or to harm the united kingdom the united kingdom government will do whatever it take to protect our national security and this nation democratic institution which have stand for century as beacon of liberty wherever the threat may come from commend this statement to the house call the shadow home secretary thank the deputy prime minister for his statement and for advance sight of it maintain national security in the face of threat to our value and our democracy be the first duty of any government in respect of which labour stand ready always to work on cross party basis to keep our country safe pay tribute to all those in our intelligence and security service and police and those across government and beyond who work to protect our national security on the anniversary of the awful attack of as we remember those lose we be in no doubt about the seriousness of the work that they do we recognise too the seriousness of the allegation involve espionage on behalf of china at the heart of our democracy it be essential that the police the intelligence agency and the justice system be able to do their job and we must support they as they do so however we need to know more about what action the government be take against attempt by other state to interfere in our democracy and undermine our security issue an interference alert about the chinese communist party attempt to influence parliament month ago the security service and other have also raise wide concern the minister refer to the prime minister raise strong concern with china about unacceptable interference do the prime minister do so at the time of those arrest or have he only do so now since they have be make public the government set up the defend democracy taskforce to look at foreign interference but what have it actually do be the minister on it have it produce report for the national security council as be promise have it look at vetting level and delay the government oppose the lords amendment to the national security bill that be put forward to introduce strong check on donation to political party to ensure no foreign influence and they oppose labour proposal to close the loophole on shell company have the taskforce look at those measure why be it not act in that area what be be do about national security prisoner it beggar belief that daniel khalife be charge with national security offence but be able to escape under van can the minister confirm that even though this individual have already evade arrest for three week when the police first try to apprehend he he still end up in category prison can he also confirm report that in another prisoner be able to escape from wandsworth prison also by hide underneath van have the review be complete of all national security prisoner those on remand and those convict to see what level of prison security be in place if not why not want to ask the minister about the wide issue of the risk to our national security from other state he have rightly take action on sensitive surveillance equipment and be glad that minister have accept labour proposal on procurement in his statement he rightly talk of the systemic challenge that china pose include on human right but the statement say nothing about the work of the investment security unit what be it do nor do the statement say anything about the comprehensive approach we need to the risk to our critical national infrastructure even though the head of have give series of warning and the intelligence and security committee be extremely critical in its report in july warn of the lack of proper strategy on china and of short termism we need to engage with china on climate change and global issue but we also need to be robust about defend our national security that be why the shadow foreign secretary have call for full audit of china relationship and why we have support the national security act but also raise concern about iran pursue kidnap and murder threat and russia pursue cyber attack we recognise that after and the appalling terror attack on the country come together the then labour government work on major counter terror strategy the contest strategy involve everyone across government the police the intelligence agency local government and the private sector the contest strategy have endure and have strong cross party support but the government have be warn for year about rise state challenge so where be the contest strategy for state threat we will support the government in produce one and labour government would work cross party to produce one but where be it we need contest strategy on state risk state challenge and state threat to protect our national security national security be too important to ignore warning we need urgent action to defend our national security thank the shadow home secretary for the overall constructive approach with which she have address this issue it be important that we treat issue such as this on cross party basis in defence of our democratic institution and it be timely that this statement should be make on the anniversary of will endeavour to address the point that she have raise and will be happy to write to she on any point that inadvertently miss out the prime minister and the foreign secretary regularly raise with their chinese opposite number chinese interference in democratic institution this be an ongoing approach that have be go on for some time the right hon lady ask about the defend democracy taskforce which be lead by my right hon friend the minister for security it report into the national security council on which sit and we receive regular update on the work that he be do work with departments across government not least the department for levelling up housing and communities which be responsible for large element of electoral integrity the devolve administrations local authority and other matter the purpose of the taskforce be to bring together all those different element to pursue whole of government and whole of society approach when address those threat the principal purpose of the investment security unit be to provide advice to as the quasi judicial decision maker in respect of acquisition that may invoke national security question take advice from the unit on whether the government should intervene and we have issue direction in respect of acquisition in the past year that be to say we be ask company to take action the hard be to block the acquisition but it could be some other remedial action more than half of those direction be in respect of chinese company the right hon lady be entirely right to raise the question of critical national infrastructure on which have work very closely with the head of and other country around the world be look again at their critical national infrastructure particularly in relation to the threat of cyber crime which often have blurred link with hostile state take cyber crime very seriously and chair regular meeting on it we be constantly up the work we do against background in which the external threat continue to rise the government will very shortly respond to the isc report the draft be with ministers and it be about to be sign off hope it will be with the house this week the right hon lady rightly raise point about iran and russia particularly in relation to cyber but also across whole range of issue as part of our overall approach we have do two thing first we have try to give the agency public face with which to interface with business and private citizen in whole of society approach for example gchq now work through the national cyber security centre to advise business and individual on cyber risk equally we have just create the national protective security authority which essentially enable to interface with business and individual on protective security those agency work through the cabinet office and particularly with the home office and the foreign office work across the range of issue that particularly arise in relation to iran and russia although we take this investigation very seriously and it clearly should be conduct independently reassure the right hon lady and the house that the government be take whole of society approach across all these issue to strengthen our defence against rise threat call the chair of the isc without refer to any specific case may gently remind the government that their initial response to the isc substantial and wide range report on the national security threat from china publish just two month ago be to suggest that our finding might be out of date will the deputy prime minister therefore confirm that the full government response when it come we gather it be come very soon will set out specific step to address the threat of chinese interference particularly within our democratic system the short answer be yes have review the response and be content that it do exactly that it will be with my right hon friend shortly call the snp spokesperson it be timely that we be have security update today my thought and the thought of my colleague be with all those impact by on its anniversary be glad the deputy prime minister mention the issue relate to sensitive government site and camera but member on both side of the house have to ask question on hikvision for month before the government take any action will they commit to act more quickly in future and will the procurement bill as he state allow that to happen be glad to hear that the response to the isc report be come will the government also commit to implement the recommendation of the isc report on russian interference in british politic hopefully that response will also come soon to turn to some specific question when do the deputy prime minister himself learn of these allegation and arrest why do mps only learn of this from the times will the government institute as soon as possible review into the decision make process that lead to mps not be tell in order that such critical update be give to mps in future and that this decision make process be never allow to happen again order we have to be very careful here this be major security issue and it would be wrong to expect to break all that in order to brief mp the mp who need to be tell be tell and work very closely on this please be very careful think my early statement address some of the point but if need be we can re address thing thank you mr speaker on the first point that the hon lady raise we take an evidence base approach to action it be right that minister take action not on hunch or an intuition but on the basis of detailed analysis provide to we by the agency and by other that be precisely the approach we take in relation to hikvision and other china base company subject to china national security law on when or other learn about this as mr speaker say in number of the point he make member would not expect to give the house run commentary on intelligence briefing that have receive but the house would expect to be brief on all matter in conclusion will make broad point about parliamentary security we have the parliamentary security department and it work very closely with the agency to support member of parliament include with general advice if member have specific concern they can raise those with the psd that be the correct approach which respect the division between parliament and government and the independence of the house these be extremely worrying report about the level of infiltration of chinese support force into our democracy do my right hon friend agree that we need to recognise that china be the large threat both to the world and to the uk on freedom and democracy do he not agree that the government should designate it as such may begin by pay tribute to my right hon friend for all the work she do in this space particularly when she be foreign secretary she be absolutely right to say that china represent systemic challenge to our interest and value and it be also for example the no state base threat to our economic security the government be absolutely clear eyed about the threat that this nation face and we be robust in take action indeed that be why personally take the decision in respect of ban huawei from our network and in respect of chinese cctv technology and tiktok we will continue to take whatever step be necessary base on appropriate advice to provide that protection for our nation and our democratic institution key part of democracy be the ability to scrutinise the executive as the chair of the intelligence and security committee say no response to our china report be to pooh pooh it and say that it be out of date understand that the government response be due today but have now be put off the defend democracy taskforce have be mention we have ask for an update on that but be meet with radio silence the prime minister have on his desk our report on international partnership he have have it on his desk for nearly month now he usually have day in which to respond so when will we get that sign off may just say to the deputy prime minister that if he be talk about security and democracy in the term he have that have to include proper scrutiny there be long list of example of where this government be try to avoid it proper scrutiny be provide by the intelligence and security committee certainly take the report produce by the isc very be fully aware of the membership of the committee to reassure opposition members it be precisely because we take the recommendation so seriously that the committee will receive comprehensive response address all these point include an update on the defend democracy taskforce it be appal news that we have potential espionage cell operate in and around westminster as sanctioned individual alongside many of my colleague be particularly perturb by the news notwithstanding that this should not perhaps come as surprise as the isc chair by my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis have warn that the government be ill prepared and that the necessary security measure be not available ask the secretary of state specific question when be the foreign secretary tell about the investigation be it before he go to beijing if he go to beijing with this knowledge do he raise it with his counterpart there it be important to know that with respect it be no good come to the dispatch box and tell we that we do not talk about such matter the prime minister do so yesterday and the investigation be not complete what do the foreign secretary do say to the secretary of state that the problem lie in the mess we have get into over whether we define china as threat or not if it be threat why do we not call it that take the action that be necessary to deal with it on that basis and sanction some people my right hon friend who be former cabinet minister and current privy counsellor know full well that the government do not provide running commentary on update and intelligence receive by ministers can assure he that the foreign secretary regularly raise electoral interference and interference with our democratic institution with his chinese opposite number specific case particularly those that be subject to an ongoing police investigation would not as be generally the case be raise on the wide principle we have be robust and clear eyed in address and raise these point with our chinese opposite number on the action we have take set out the step that take in respect of tiktok and huawei and pay tribute to my right hon friend support for the telecommunications security act which we get to very good place there be not just that act but the national security act the national security and investment act and the deployment of the carrier fleet all those thing have happen in the past short number of year they be evidence of the seriousness with which the government take this threat the deputy prime minister say that he hold the intelligence and security committee in very high regard on that basis will he commit to the recommendation that it make in its recent report on china about update the guideline of the advisory committee on business appointments in relation to intelligence and security particularly reference china how will he ensure that they be enforce as say in answer to previous question the full response to the isc will be come shortly an important point have be raise in respect of acoba for which have overall ministerial responsibility in the cabinet office will take that away and discuss it with the chair of that committee sir eric pickles formerly of this house thank the deputy prime minister for his statement and support the action that the government be take on the issue of transparency and accountability will the datum regard the volume of prosecution and conviction under exist legislation and the new national security act be collate and make available to the house so that we can track the scale of hostile state action also have the government decide on any necessary change to the memorandum of understanding with the isc as they be require to at least consider under section of that act do not think have have chance from the dispatch box to pay genuine heartfelt tribute to my immediate predecessor as deputy prime minister have do the job for few month have particular appreciation of all the work that my right hon friend do when he be in that post in respect of the volume of prosecution and conviction we seek to be as transparent as we can be with the house be sure it be something that we can take away and look at with desire to do as my right hon friend ask can not give he firm commitment at the dispatch box but if it be possible shall seek to do so we keep the mou with the isc under review we do not have any current plan to change it but we keep it under review yet again we be watch the horse disappear over the horizon and shut the stable door behind it every time we act to take on china everything the deputy prime minister boast about be always state reactively just for once could we get ahead of the curve and take action in relation to genomic and as and other have be urge for month now designate it as part of our critical national infrastructure so that in few month time we be not again have to explain another failure say gently to the right hon gentleman that he do serve in government and in cabinet for five year from to so he and other member of his party need to bear some responsibility for the decision make although would think that they would take pride in the decision that we take more recently under this majority conservative government we have take huge range of step include pass the national security act and the national security and investment act the right hon gentleman raise legitimate point about genomic and its relevance to critical national infrastructure it be not currently designate as such but in my role in the cabinet office keep the register of critical national infrastructure under review and be explore the matter may thank you personally mr speaker for the care and support you have show to those of we who have be sanction by china we be in the frontline of this threat but have to say that neither before nor after these revelation have any of we be offer briefing by the parliamentary security authority or by the foreign office or home office in fact find out more about this character from my son who happen to be at university with they than from anything have be tell formally do not want to mention the current incident but do want to note that it be now year on from when take the almost unprecedented step of issue security service interference alert about character work within parliament for which there be no consequence it be about year on from the revelation about the activity of the chinese consul general in manchester who think it be his job to attack demonstrator for which there be no expulsion no consequence it be month on from the recent revelation about the activity of the confucius institutes which the government pledge to abolish there have be no consequence no abolition again nothing have happen and it be just couple of week since the foreign secretary promise that he would take up the case of the sanction mps and of jimmy lai with the chinese foreign minister yet he come away with nothing there have be no consequence be not the problem that for all the tough talk there be no consequence and the chinese know that there will be no consequence may ask the deputy prime minister this will china be in the enhance tier of the foreign agent registration scheme may deal with the specific question first and then reflect on the wide point we be currently review the country in the enhance tier think there be strong case to be make but my hon friend would not expect to make that announcement from the dispatch box before we have go through the proper process on my hon friend wide point about the parliamentary security directorate we as government stand ready to provide any further support that mps feel they require if my hon friend feel that he require further briefing be very happy to help to facilitate that with the house may extend my genuine sympathy to the two conservative colleague who appear to have be target by suspect chinese spy who be employ in parliament and pay for out of public fund do know what they be feel the house will be aware order be not sure that be the case think that be quite bit of speculation would stick to general question rather than try to go into the detail of what may have happen thank you mr speaker do say suspect the house will be aware that the subject of the security alert last year christine lee be never arrest have never be charge with spying or indeed any other offence and be say by the previous home secretary to have do nothing criminal however there be court case pende understand that ms lee have take out civil suit against the government will the deputy prime minister update the house on when that case be likely to be hear and what the government hope to learn from it be not quite sure what to say in response to that question in the light of the lee case and other that be precisely why we have take enhanced power through the new national security act although have to hold back from comment on individual case be confident that we have much more robust power under that legislation that will enable we to act in its china report the isc highlight the effort of the chinese communist party to influence co opt or coerce into silence potential critic of its regime in the uk we acknowledge that the government be wake up to this threat and take it more seriously but highlight to the minister the fact that we need more urgency in particular highlight the fact that for year the isc have be say that we need foreign agent registration scheme and one be now on its way do the minister agree that it would have be helpful have it be in operation and on the statute book at the time of the relevant event we be consider today my right hon friend raise some very important point but just observe that this apply to lot of the question we have relationship with china that be very different from the one that we have just few year ago it be important that we be not naive about china that we be clear eyed about protect our national security that we be clear eyed about the threat that it represent and that we be robust in take action my right hon friend rightly highlight the foreign agent registration scheme the secondary legislation under that will come before the house very shortly which will enable we to take the relevant action under that legislation actually the people who have be really clear sight about china have mostly be on the back benches in this house on either side and include the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton and some of they have be sanction have be delighted to work with two successive chair of the foreign affairs committee to whom pay enormous tribute for the outspoken way in which they have push the government towards more sensible policy on china my anxiety be that we still flip flop all over the place this year already we have see several foreign secretaries apart from anything else and we have see they want to suck up to china one moment and the next wanting to have robust word with china it simply do not work why oh why have we still not declare that china be threat to uk national security why oh why have we still not see even the redact version of the china strategy which accord to the government the fcdo develop but which have not even be share with other government ministry have great respect for the hon gentleman as he know but simply do not accept this slightly over the top characterisation of the government approach we have be consistent first we must protect our national interest in relation to china that be why we pass the legislation that have outline why ban huawei from our network and why we ban chinese technology from surveillance equipment and other matter secondly it be important that we align with our ally around the world spend lot of time on this and know that the foreign secretary the minister for security and other work very closely with nation around the world particularly but not confine to the five eyes to make sure that we share our understanding of chinese intent and take co ordinate action to protect we not least through the military it be also the case though that we must engage with the chinese as we do with many other country around the world with which we do not share number of their value it be not realistic position to take to say that we should entirely cut off from engagement with china we should engage with china but be absolutely clear about where we disagree with it and clear eyed in protect our national security which be precisely the approach we be take like my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith can not wait to be able to discuss the merit of this case although understand the situation now want to raise couple of issue with the deputy prime minister the government be move they have do lot of new thing and we be get more coherence but do not understand why they keep think that we either bury our head in the sand or effectively go soft on element of the relationship with china we can debate with and engage with china all we like but we can also do so in an increasingly robust way that answer the threat it present towards we specifically the government keep avoid the argument about the grow economic dependency that all western nation have on china that dependency will mean that in the case of war in the pacific in two or five year time which be what president xi be plan for he have say we be retake taiwan by will not be in position to do anything about it without collapse the global economy effectively in the next few year our hand will have be tie by economic dependency every time raise that issue the government be not even willing to produce an annual statement on it please can we take this issue more seriously it be at the heart of security and no freedom of action mean we have no security have great deal of respect for my hon friend and he and have discuss these issue on many occasion believe we be take precisely that robust approach the question of economic dependency be precisely why we pass the national security and investment act which enable as minister to take decision to intervene where we feel that the acquiring of technology by any state could undermine our resilience and our ability to protect ourselves or could enhance the capability of other state have take the decision to intervene on number of occasion and more than half the order we have issue have be in respect of chinese relate company on the resilience of supply chain that be why the prime minister establish the national secretary council resilience sub committee build on work by my right hon friend the member for esher and walton dominic raab the former deputy prime minister my hon friend be totally right to raise this issue but can assure he that the government take this very seriously and be act will the

when express worry about the takeover by china of global company base in huddersfield be tell to go away and be quiet have also consistently ask for an audit of how much of our british industry and interest be own by the chinese simple audit but we have never have positive reaction or any reaction to that suggestion when will the government do that the hon gentleman be right to highlight that we have changed approach to china because the fact on china have change with its conduct in relation to hong kong and the national security law that it have pass the increase evidence of abuse in xinjiang province and the increase aggression in relation to the south china sea there be no room for any naivety about china we have to be clear eyed and we be be clear eyed that be why we have pass host of legislation it be why to answer his point about what be own by china for the first time we have now take the power to intervene on transaction whether in relation to china or to other country in the interest of national security and why have not hesitate as minister to do so thank the deputy prime minister for his statement do he agree that this late episode show clearly that it be vital that we do all we can to protect our democracy and democratic institution it be right that the government continue with the protect align and engage strategy but action speak louder than word and the chinese communist state need to hear very loudly that we will do all we can to protect our democracy completely agree with my hon friend comment that be precisely what the prime minister do at the summit with premier li at the weekend and why we have introduce wide range of legislation to address threat include among many other piece of legislation the higher education freedom of speech bill in relation to academia the integrated review refresh be announce on march this year at the time it be welcome that funding would be double for build government expertise on china but we have since learn that the doubling be from base of civil servant learn mandarin in the previous year of whom just be to attend language immersion give that the uk host more than chinese student learn the english language and about british culture do that announcement of perhaps training place for british government official not now sound little modest first the integrated review refresh be clear about china be the no state base threat to our economic security the hon gentleman cite the foreign language training that be just one element of the action that we have take to increase our capacity in relation to china clearly he would not expect to comment on what the agency be do in respect of china but can assure he that within the cabinet office and its structure we be constantly increase the amount of resource that we put in as be the foreign office have some sympathy with my right hon friend the deputy prime minister for want to strike the right balance very much welcome his recognition that we have come long way from the ill fat idea of golden age with china which be only eight year ago much of what have happen have be predicable and predict and we continue to predict what will happen as he have hear this afternoon why be the government so squeamish not just about talk about threat from china but about call china threat what be the difference between challenge and threat be grateful to my hon friend for recognise the evolution and strengthening of our approach to china will not add to what have say on that we continue to enhance our capability in relation to china have outline number of the measure that we take we continue to keep all those thing under review want to reassure he and other member on both side of the house that we be absolutely clear about the threat that china represent but at the same time it be right that we engage with china and that be the approach that we be take alongside work closely with our ally think that be sensible and balanced approach that in no way underestimate the scale of the challenge in respect of china as have be set out in numerous document an attack on this place include on members by any hostile government intent on interfere with our democracy and its structure be direct affront to british democracy itself give that several member of this place have be sanction by china can the deputy prime minister give the house assurance that step be in place to support and protect member from hostile government and will he make it clear that there be consequence as the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton outline yes be very happy to give that assurance of course we respect the independence of this house and provide support indirectly to the house through the parliamentary security directorate can assure the hon lady that we provide considerable amount of resource to the house in respect of this threat sympathise with my right hon friend on this chinese matter he will face countervail pressure and argument on the economic side and on the security side in his statement he make great play of the six welcome measure that the government have take to toughen britain stance towards the chinese government can he give the house any evidence that the chinese government have alter their behaviour in any way at all in response to that tough response from the british government it be never the case that the united kingdom government trade off economic security for national security national security always come first in the approach we take and we have see action in response to the measure we have take for example we have block chinese acquisition of company in this country through the national security and investment act so we be bite directly how many request have the government receive from security service chief in the past month for additional resource to combat the chinese security threat and have all those request be meet in full the hon gentleman would not expect to comment specifically on the agency but can give he general assurance that we have provide they with the necessary resource they need to combat all the threat that this nation face this unsavoury episode serve as reminder for all of we in this place of the threat we face not just from state interference but from variety of malign actor can please ask the deputy prime minister whether we be do enough to think about our physical security surveillance and counter surveillance malware and it on our phone and other trojan virus and governance of mps security my hon friend be absolutely right to raise all of those point it be the case not just in respect of china but also of russia particularly in light of the russia ukraine war and indeed iran and other hostile state that the threat landscape be increase and the government have to continually increase their action through the creation of the national cyber security centre and its work with gchq we be able to constantly increase our action in respect of cyber threat malware and the other threat that my hon friend highlight and in respect of physical security we have mirror in the national protective security authority work with in turn the agency also work with the parliamentary security department which deal directly with threat to member of parliament and be support by those agency and other the chinese communist party have show once again that it will stop at nothing to get its way the deputy prime minister have say today that he realise there be serious issue and that this be systemic challenge but he would not come out with statement that it be serious threat and be treat as such the ccp be infiltrate our academia and lot of people right across these benches feel very uneasy action speak louder than word and the government need to back up word with action strong action and give we the impression that they be not be drag by the heel all the time we be constantly have to raise these thing and there be no confidence that we be treat the ccp as an absolutely serious threat which be what it be we be play cricket while the ccp have the machete out please please take some urgent action we have be totally clear eyed about the threat represent by china and have be robust in the action we have take the hon lady talk about high education we have pass legislation in respect of high education the higher education freedom of speech act that act require great transparency about high education institution source of funding include from overseas state and hostile state we be take exactly the kind of action that she request at what be then the department for digital culture media and sport see at first hand the now deputy prime minister oversee an increasingly robust attitude to china in term of economic security and telecom security in particular to some extent wonder if that be why we see this growth in unwelcome attention from china however can the deputy prime minister reassure the house that we will continue to take that increasingly robust approach particularly when it come to emergent technology such as artificial intelligence and some of the other increasingly high tech area where britain excel in the world and where we will continue to attract even more interest from unfriendly state my hon friend have great deal of experience from his time as minister and we work together on these issue telecom security be precisely an example of the approach first we put national security before economic security on purely economic interest basis we should not have remove huawei equipment from our network we put national security first and be transparent with the house about that we also take the power in the telecommunications security act which be the legislation require to provide that protection of our national security that be yet more evidence of how the government be take more robust approach and increase the amount of activity with every pass month and year thank the deputy prime minister for his statement be sensitive to the restriction on both the question and the answer but we know these fact be in the public domain that two individual have be arrest on suspicion of work for hostile power and that they be parliamentary passholder their pass will have be sponsor by individual who be probably in this chamber and they pass the security vet for parliamentary pass do the deputy prime minister agree that in due course not today an important question will have to be answer be they recruit by the hostile power before or after they become passholder order we must be careful what detail we go into and know the deputy prime minister be aware of that the hon gentleman make number of supposition in his question that be subject to an ongoing police investigation when that investigation have conclude and indeed if the crown prosecution service decide to take any action under the official secrets act there will be time for this house to debate the lesson from that and the government will of course with you mr speaker help to facilitate the time for that to happen in the statement the deputy prime minister very helpfully refer to the erasure of dissent voice and the stifling of opposition under the new national security law in hong kong in whatever dialogue now take place with the chinese can ask again that the case of my two trade union colleague lee cheuk yan and carol ng man yee who be leader of the hong kong federation of trade unions be raise again they have be in detention since and be now face lengthy prison sentence purely for stand up for democratic right and trade union right minister raise the general principle of china national security law its application to hong kong and the suppression of liberty in hong kong in very robust term with their chinese opposite number and will raise individual case be happy to pass that on to the foreign secretary if the right hon member have not do so already to make sure that those individual case be raise these allegation be concern but sadly they be not the first of their type we have hear about the sanction against mps and the activity at the manchester consulate have be tick off more than once by the consulate in my own constituency because say thing it do not like and have be film by drone speak at chinese rally in the city in july the intelligence and security committee say there be lack of clear strategy from the government do the deputy prime minister accept that that might be responsible for these repeat attempt and be it not time that the government have that clear strategy first the integrated review refresh be very clear about the approach we take in respect of china we be clear that it represent the no base thread to our economic security it also represent range of other threat and systemic challenge to our interest and our value minister have raise chinese interference with democratic process and any interference with the conduct of member of parliament be totally unacceptable and we will not hesitate in raise it summit mr speaker the whole house will join in send our sympathy to the people of morocco follow

indian origin and my wife and her family be indian citizen with financial interest in india at the summit have three aim first to increase diplomatic pressure on russia and call out its shameful disruption of global food supply in the black sea secondly to show the world that democracie such as the united kingdom not authoritarian regime be lead the fight on global challenge such as development and climate change and thirdly to strengthen tie and forge new partnership to deliver job growth and security for the british people the world face moment of danger volatility and increasingly rapid change but even as most leader come together in delhi in spirit of co operation one do not for two year now putin have lack the courage to face his peer day after day his action cause horrendous suffering in ukraine violate the united nations charter threaten european security and disrupt global energy supply the spill over have drive up price here at home and they be hurt people all around the world russia withdrawal from the black sea grain initiative expose its willingness to spread that suffer far while putin stall make unmeetable demand he be destroy ukraine port

with multiple missile the russian military target civilian cargo ship in the black sea demonstrate just how desperate putin be at the leader unite in call out the human suffering cause by putin war ukraine have the right to export its good through international water and it have the moral right to ship grain that be help to feed the world the uk be work with partner to get grain to those who need it most we will provide million for the world food programme build on early contribution to president zelensky grain from ukraine initiative we be use our intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance capability to monitor russian activity in the black sea so that we can call it out if we see that russia be prepare further attack on civilian shipping or infrastructure and so that we can attribute attack should they happen later this year we be host uk global food security summit to put in place solution for the long term speak to my friend president zelensky just before the summit back by our support ukraine counter offensive be make hard win progress we will continue to stand with ukraine for as long as it take until we see just and durable peace that respect its sovereignty and territorial integrity that be the only possible outcome to putin illegal war and ukraine with our support will prevail on my second aim we show at the that it be the uk and our partner not authoritarian actor that offer the good solution to the global challenge we face we be play our part to stabilise the global economy control inflation and fuel future growth the late figure from the office for national statistics show the uk be lead the way grow fast out of the pandemic than any other major european economy and demolish the false narrative we have hear from the other side of this house we be also lead the way on development assistance instead of load country with debt we be call for fundamental reform of the world bank when meet the world bank president underline the uk desire to see the bank become more efficient and responsible sweat its balance sheet to deliver more support where it be need we be also lead call at the to safely harness new technology to support growth and development and we be lead action to tackle climate change while some in westminster denigrate the uk record on climate issue out there in the world we be rightly see as global leader we have cut emission fast than any other country with low carbon source now provide over half our electricity we be provide billion for the global energy transition include through our pioneer just energy transition partnerships and at the make record commitment of over billion for the green climate fund the single big international climate pledge that the uk have ever make finally my most important aim in delhi be to deliver on the priority of the british people in change world we be use our brexit freedom to build new relationship with economy around the world since become prime minister we have join the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership the most dynamic trading bloc in the world we have launch new partnership with canada australia japan and the us cover trade and economic security we have secure agreement with france albania turkey and other to stop illegal migration at the we go far we sign new strategic partnership with singapore to boost job growth and our security hold warm and productive discussion with prime minister modi on strengthen our relationship in defence and technology and on free trade deal between our nation also meet premier li of china the whole house be rightly appal by report of espionage in this building the sanctity of this place must be protect and the right of member to speak their mind without fear or sanction must be maintain we will defend our democracy and our security so be emphatic with premier li that action that seek to undermine british democracy be completely unacceptable and will never be tolerate also emphasise the uk unyielde commitment to human right and be clear on the importance of maintain stability and international law as the basis for stable relation china be permanent member of the un security council the world second large economy and the world large emitter of carbon dioxide it have grow influence on other notably russia one of my message to premier li be that china should use its influence to call on russia to end its aggression against ukraine the show common purpose on food security and we need to see that in other area this government have act decisively to improve our security include block china involvement in critical area such as civil nuclear power semiconductor and pay tribute to the tireless work of our security service we will shortly set out our response to the intelligence and security committee report on china in november last year the government set up new defend democracy taskforce its mission be to reduce the risk to the uk democratic process institution and society and to ensure they be secure and resilient to threat of foreign interference the importance of that work be clear for all to see crucially in take that approach we be align with each and every single one of our five eyes ally and our partner by speak frankly and directly we will ensure our message be hear clearly and that our interest and value be protect and promote in conclusion at time of rapid change we be bring british value and british leadership to bear on the big global challenge as one of the fast grow major economy the second large contributor to nato and global leader in everything from climate to tech to development be proud of the united kingdom leadership it be through that leadership work with our ally and partner that we will increase our security grow our economy and deliver on the priority of the british people commend this statement to the house call the leader of the opposition may thank the prime minister for an advance copy of his statement join he in send my condolence and those of the whole house to those affect by the devastating earthquake in morocco know that uk search and rescue specialist be work to help moroccan authority find survivor and it be important at this time that all those in morocco know we be think of they and be prepared to give the resource and support that they need the summit in india be real opportunity to see progress on key global issue by condemn russia illegal war in ukraine in no uncertain term and make solid commitment to boost growth and renewable energy capacity around the world be afraid therefore that the joint declaration from the weekend be disappointing as russian drone resume attack on kyiv it be dishearten to see language weak than the condemnation of moscow at last year summit in bali on this issue the house speak with one voice there be no ambiguity we all agree that this be an unjust illegal war against ukraine join the prime minister in say that britain and our nato ally will remain committed in help ukraine defeat putin on the matter raise in the precede statement the news of the arrest of researcher here in parliament on suspicion of spying for china be serious breach of security conduct by the beijing security service give that the arrest happen in march can ask the prime minister whether the foreign secretary know about this incident before he visit china last month if he do do he raise it on that trip listen to the answer give on the precede statement by the deputy prime minister who say that these issue be regularly raise but my question be specific and ask the prime minister to address it directly if as it seem the government be not consider designate china as threat to national security will he give further detail on how they will tackle the infiltration of chinese security service into key british institution incident like this show the constant threat that we face and the show how far we have to go there be some important progress at the this weekend new partnership for global infrastructure and investment be announce between the us the eu india and gulf state it be partnership to counterbalance china belt and road initiative boost economic department secure supply chain and connect the us eu and trust partner in asia much welcome initiative we might think so when look at the signatory to this new partnership be surprised something be miss where be britain will the prime minister explain why the uk have not sign this agreement this seem remarkable new agreement have be reach between major trade bloc to deliver economic security and britain be not involve the prime minister owe the house an explanation have we be leave out or have we just decide not to sign the race towards the future have begin major nation be invest in new technology hop to establish themselves as leader and major global centre for green technology the us have introduce the inflation reduction act the eu in return be relax rule to allow great green subsidy where be britain where be the plan would also like to ask the prime minister about the trade deal between india and the uk the government promise it in their manifesto then they say it would be do by diwali last year now the prime minister say that the deal be not even guarantee what be go on it really sum up their global economic approach no strategy and no direction we can not be slow off the mark the race have start they once promise new era of post brexit global trade but instead of more investment and more trade they have erect unnecessary barrier and make britain more difficult country to do business in we can not be leave on the sideline britain need seat at the table we have the expertise the creativity and the ingenuity but the government be too distracted and too complacent and have no plan to seize the opportunity of the future let rattle through the right hon and learn gentleman question with regard to the matter cover in the precede statement be sure he will appreciate that as there be an ongoing investigation as you also say mr speaker be limited in what can say specifically but have be emphatically clear in our engagement with china that we will not accept any interference in our democracy and parliamentary system that include the sanctioning of mps and malign activity such as the type of activity allege to have take place can absolutely confirm that the foreign secretary raise those issue on his recent visit and reinforce that in my meeting at the the right hon and learn gentleman go on to raise the announcement about the partnership for global infrastructure and investment what he fail to mention in his criticism be that that initiative the pgii be create by the uk under our presidency far from be something that we be not part of we be the one who make sure that we be there at its inception again he be as ever jump on the late bandwagon that he can find the pgii initiative will contain range of different project this particular one be also not sign by canada japan or italy for report september vol each and every country will participate in range of project what do we do to make our contribution as say we make the single large pledge this country have ever make to the green climate fund why because it be important that we play our part in help country make the transition to net zero something that we have lead on previously and because of that commitment we will continue to lead on what else do we do we decide to work with other country to improve global food security something that african nation in particular have call on we to do they have welcome our leadership in host summit later this year which will tackle the cause at its root improve crop yield and the resilience of food supply globally could go on as ever the right hon and learn gentleman try to find something to score cheap political point and completely and utterly misunderstand what this country be do as ever he would prefer to talk this country down than recognise the contribution we be make be happy to address the right hon and learn gentleman comment on the trade deal think they be tell he ask why do we not just sign it why be it not do have flashback to all those conversation when we be leave the eu his approach back then be just to sign any deal that be offer to we we know where that would have lead the right thing to do for the british people be to fight hard for the thing that we need we only need deal that work for the british people and deliver on our priority that be why it be right not to rush these thing as he would do clearly we do not put arbitrary deadline on they take the time to make sure that they be right for the british people our track record be there we be the first european nation to accede to the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership something else the right hon and learn gentleman fail to mention that be the most exciting dynamic trade bloc that exist in the world the asia pacific account for of the world population sixty per cent of good trade pass through that region and it will account for over half of global growth in the come decade now that we have leave the eu we be able to join that trade bloc and it be excited to have we lastly on the right hon and learn gentleman point about brexit again he fail to point out that since we leave the single market we have grow fast than france and germany will end where start as ever when it come to these thing he be determined to talk britain down we be demonstrate that britain be lead on the global stage and deliver for the british people call the chair of the foreign affairs committee let start by put on record my thank to you mr speaker and the parliamentary security and intelligence service for your personal support over the last few month here today we know that across this house real priority for members be the safety of british national arbitrarily detain abroad the foreign affairs committee have recently release report on that matter it can not be right that consular access be withhold on the basis of diplomatic silence be in place know that my right hon friend raise the case of jagtar singh johal with the indian prime minister at the weekend but we be not clear on the outcome of those discussion will the government finally officially call for his release the un have accept that he be arbitrarily detain do the prime minister believe that he have be unfairly treat or even torture while be hold we be committed to see mr johal case resolve as soon as possible we continue to provide consular assistance to he and his family and have raise concern about issue include consular access to mr johal the judicial process and report of mistreatment with the indian government on multiple occasion include myself with prime minister modi just this weekend call the scottish national party spokesperson we have hear lot of pr and spin today and be sure we will hear lot more as ever in this game what the prime minister be not say be almost as important as what he be say the leader of the official opposition raise the case of president biden announcement can the prime minister tell we what part of those project his government be involve in they be worth more than any fta that we could sign and will leave brexit britain on the global sideline yet again if it be not fully involved that be on top of the united states inflation busting and reduction act tackle climate change on the bilateral meeting with the prime minister counterpart we hear of very strong concern relate to your statement early mr speaker raise with chinese premier li can the prime minister advise the house when he be first notify of this issue on the case of my constituent jagtar singh johal which be raise by the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns the chair of the foreign affairs committee the prime minister bring it up in conversation with prime minister modi give the widespread concern in this place and outside about the leaking of this government resolve to jagtar singh johal particularly in relation to get trade deal over the line will the prime minister agree to meet and jagtar singh johal family so he can tell they exactly what he intend to do on their behalf refer the hon gentleman to my previous answer on mr johal most recently the foreign office minister meet mr johal family to discuss the case in detail turn to the hon gentleman other point on our investment partnership the british investment partnership approach with india for example have invest over billion to support different enterprise employ about half million people that be just to give he some sense of the scale of the alternative project we be involve in lastly turn to the hon gentleman point which the leader of the opposition also raise about the us inflation reduction act and the approach of other country neither seem to recognise that the approach we have take be work for the uk not least with the recent announcement of billion investment in the uk by tata which represent the single large investment in our auto industry potentially ever to build gigafactory here that be follow by investment by stellantis and bmw to secure future electric vehicle manufacturing in the uk any which way we look at it our auto manufacturing sector be receive record amount of investment to make the transition to electricity orient vehicle that be because of the tax regulatory and incentive regime we have put in place which be deliver real job and real opportunity for the british people do the chinese representative give any indication of when they might stop their big increase in carbon dioxide and start to reduce they do the prime minister agree with that it make no sense for the uk to rely on chinese import of electric vehicle solar panel and other green product when they be so intensive in their production and deny we the job and add value my right hon friend make good point he will see in the declaration commitment by all member recognise the need to peak emission in the next couple of year to his broad point that be why the government have consult on measure to address carbon leakage it be absolutely right that there be level playing field and that if we take action here it should not come at the cost of british worker if it ultimately make no difference to global emission that be why we have consult on proposal on carbon leakage and very much welcome his thought on that join the house in send our condolence to all those affect by the tragic event in morocco thank the prime minister for his statement he be rightly strongly critical of president putin in his statement but have to say that do not agree with his assessment of the statement on ukraine the joint declaration fail to condemn russia for the invasion our ukrainian ally label it nothing to be proud of while the russians call it step in the right direction ukraine soldier continue to give their life in defence of their country while ukrainian refugee continue to take shelter here in the uk and elsewhere why do the prime minister feel he be justify in sign up to such weak communiqué find it slightly strange that the right hon gentleman be use what russia describe the situation to be as evidence of support with everything we have see over the past year we should not believe word come out of russia mouth so that be very strange approach to take what would say to he on his criticism be that be not entirely sure who he be critical of because every single one of our five eyes partner and ally who be present also sign the statement we fight hard to have statement that we think do in fact as the us itself have say include the president and the treasury secretary contain substantially very strong language regard russia go out to the summit specifically to raise the impact of russia illegal war on food security and food price the language in the summit go far than what we have have before highlight that and call for an end to attack on food and civilian infrastructure and for the restoration of the black sea grain initiative we also agree on the significance of secure comprehensive just and last peace base on the principle of the un charter include territorial integrity that be why all our ally could go through the list of they work hard for that statement and support it the right hon gentleman criticism may well be of but he be also criticise every single one of our close ally welcome the robustness of the prime minister stance on russia but do he agree that there be aspect of other topic discuss at the such as china which he might not be able to discuss in full on the floor of the house but which he could discuss securely with the intelligence and security committee should add however that whereas for the first year of the committee existence it have meeting with the prime minister every single year there have be no such meeting since december although during her short term in office this prime minister immediate predecessor do volunteer to reinstate such meeting may ask he whether he will do the same reinstate the meeting and return to proper comprehensive scrutiny shall be happy to consider my right hon friend request but let say in the meantime that welcome the committee report on china and be grateful for all its effort the government be consider its recommendation and conclusion carefully and we will publish our response in due course and in the usual manner surely one of the thing that should keep the prime minister awake at order unfortunately member behind the hon member for rhondda feel that he should be take first let just say that the hon gentleman be second on the list of member of the foreign affairs committee and be also one of its long serve member as be say mr speaker second out round the one thing that should keep the prime minister or any minister awake at night be the arbitrary detention of british national in foreign country one would hope that ministers include the prime minister himself would summon up every ounce of energy to try to get people release be sorry but think that quite lot of we be very depressed by the prime minister answer to the question from the chair of the foreign affairs committee the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns about jagtar singh johal who have be arbitrarily detain for six year everyone know that he be be torture and mistreat take the prime minister to say that he have not call for his release be that really the truth no as say early we consistently raise our concern about mr johal case with the government of india include concern about allegation of mistreatment and the right to fair trial that be why the foreign office and ministers be give direct support to mr johal family and it be why raise this specific case with mr modi welcome both the statement and the prime minister leadership on ukraine our national security and our economic security be interdependent and there be no well illustration of that than the grain ship that be try to get out of odesa the prime minister mention the global food security summit could he expand on that as he know have be campaign for some time for an international maritime protection force to help to escort those ship out which would assist not only the ukrainian economy but our own economy because food inflation here be also be affect will the prime minister advance that idea to ensure that it be raise at the food security summit my right hon friend have focus on the issue of maritime security in the black sea for some time and he have be correct to do so we be talk and work with partner ally and indeed ukraine in consider all the different way in which we could ensure the safe exit of and access to grain from ukraine and will continue to do so as for the global food summit that we will host in london it will focus on four theme create new approach to end the preventable death of child build climate resilient food system anticipate and prevent famine and food security crisis and use science and technology to boost food security and nutrition we be also work to deliver the food summit in combination with partner include the united states and somalia may first associate myself with the sympathy extend to the people of morocco welcome the language in paragraph of the communiqué about build big world bank the truth be that we need to triple the lending of multilateral development bank if we be to mobilise the climate finance that the world now need and we can not do that simply by build well world bank we need to build big world bank in the united states president biden be ask congress to support capital call and boost the balance sheet of the world bank why be the uk one of the founder of the world bank not lead the same argument we could even use the money we be get back from the european investment bank and the prime minister if he so choose could call it brexit dividend the world lead big world bank now and the uk should be lead the case we be in fact lead the case on the world bank balance sheet and through my right hon friend the development minister we have have extensive conversation with the president of the world bank on precisely that matter it be something discuss with colleague at the include the world bank president himself we be also broadly lead the way on how else we can reform the international financial system include pioneer the use of climate resilient debt clause which have be welcome by country around the world channel our imf special drawing right back for use for develop country and find way to stretch balance sheet to unlock more funding the uk be look to as leader in all these area not least as we be announce conditional capital increase for the international bank for reconstruction and development all these thing together position we as thought leader in change the international financial system it be subject of my intervention at the and as have say the development minister be take forward this work at pace with our ally welcome my right hon friend statement particularly the inclusion in the communiqué of the ai principle would like to press he on what far work he and the united kingdom will be do ahead of the ai summit in november to ensure that work on the safety of ai more than outpace work on capability and that we can move towards meaningful principle base approach to the safe use of this vital

education do not think anyone in this chamber take seriously what the russians may have to say about the but we be listen to what the ukrainians have say and in particular their statement that there be nothing to be proud of in the joint statement the prime minister speak about speak to president zelensky before the summit when he next ring he how will he explain the fact that the statement do not even mention the word russia know president zelensky be incredibly supportive of our effort to highlight russia aggression the impact it be have on food price and food security and the damage it

with ukraine to find alternative mean to export ukrainian grain to the world which be good not only for the ukrainian economy and its sustainability but for million of the world most vulnerable people welcome the prime minister statement he have say that end the war in ukraine and hold russia to account be top priority deal with sanction as foreign office minister and they be key tool for the united kingdom to address putin war machine forty four non align state be not support we with sanction against russia which be delay the war in ukraine and india be one of those country india take russian oil and some now say that it refine that oil and sell the product into europe circumvent those sanction do the prime minister have those conversation with prime minister modi if so will india now change its behaviour our position be of long standing and consistent we urge all country to follow our lead and the lead of other in sanction russia obviously each country will approach that in its own way our job be to continue raise the impact of russia illegal war and to work with our ally to bring that war to an end include by enforce our own sanction that be why announce the economic deterrence initiative in march with million of funding be make available to improve our enforcement of the uk sanction regime we be develop that closely with our partner and think it will help to tighten the vice on russia economy in answer to my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition the prime minister want praise for the inception of the partnership for global infrastructure and investment the agreement that be sign by the us india saudi arabia the united arab emirates france germany italy and the european union be describe as landmark agreement create an economic corridor across europe the middle east and india if the inception of the global partnership be worth claim praise for will he explain he do not answer this question early why britain be not signatory to that memorandum of understanding as have say previously each country will contribute to the effort in its own way we be participate in many different project together with our partner country that help country lessen their dependence on china one thing we have lead on be the development of the common framework to ensure that country can get appropriate debt relief again they be very grateful for our leadership on that with china have put many country in hock to it we have create framework and make sure that china have engage with it it be already provide relief to two country and we be make sure that there be more in the pipeline that have be very welcome but again it be just an example of our leadership make difference on these complicated matter in go to delhi to implement the coalition government decision to end grant development aid to india that policy have not change have it the policy do change and we stop provide traditional development aid to india in most uk funding be now in the form of business investment which not only help india reduce carbon emission and address climate change but deliver job and opportunity for british company here at home with so much at stake the war in ukraine increasingly high number of people suffer from famine and drought and human right issue in place such as iran or the xinjiang part of china be now really the time for the prime minister to empty chair the united nations general assembly have just be over how our leadership on these matter be unquestione we be an active and engaged member at the in just couple of week will be at the european political community summit as well let gently point out something to the hon lady about the un general assembly as far as can tell from look back at the record on the vast majority of occasion under the labour government it be not the labour prime minister who attend either the leader declaration express the optimism about ai that know the prime minister and share it talk about the importance of international governance and international co operation how optimistic be he that all the country at the can sign up to those sort of principle just as they sign up to the joint declaration there be good conversation about ai at the summit be optimistic that most country be approach this in similar way recognise the tremendous opportunity for growth opportunity and transform development in healthcare and education in particular but cognisant of the challenge and risk that ai pose and keen to work together to find way to resolve those obviously it be very early day in term of country have this conversation and everyone learn themselves about the potential of the technology however as say think that on this topic the uk can play leadership role and that be what we will do many of we be very impressed by the close relationship that the prime minister obviously have with prime minister modi when he have private time with prime minister modi do he ask he first why he have not condemn russia for the invasion of ukraine secondly do he ask what modi be do to stop all the persecution of muslims and christians with their mosque and church be burn and with people be kill and persecute the prime minister and discuss range of issue as have say we talk about human right and defend democracy in all our international engagement because those be value that we believe in very dearly of course migration be well deal with by international co operation but it also depend on decisive action at home one thousand five hundred indians enter this country legally every week last year come across illegally in boat and this year there have be in just the first three month the prime minister tell personally that he would lead by example by have illegal migrant base at catterick in his constituency this afternoon the ministry of defence be unable to give any date on when they be go to come meanwhile my council have issue stop notice against the slash and burn tactic of the home office at raf scampton the prime minister be the head of the government will he instruct home office ministers to work proactively with west lindsey district council to ensure that we get compromise do our bit and take illegal migrant to secure location and that we do not rely on decay basis but take action that will work in the future thank my right hon friend for his constructive engagement know that he will continue to represent his community strongly and have engage with home office ministers on the particular issue in his constituency more broadly we continue to strengthen our co operation with international partner to combat illegal migration something discuss with many of my counterpart at the as will continue to do through further engagement this autumn and look to find way to formalise that co operation and improve return agreement as he mention it be important that we have the ability to return illegal migrant who have come here from country that be clearly safe place for they we have do that with albania and be strengthen the return agreement with other country too it be disappointing that the this year statement from the do not name the perpetrator of aggression in ukraine what kind of statement be it where leader feel the need to spin the interpretation of it after the event do the prime minister agree with canada liberal prime minister justin trudeau who say yesterday that if it be up to he the language on the war would have be strong it go without say that because this be not the or indeed the it be not for we just to take the language that we ourselves would like our position on ukraine be crystal clear for all to see but the be collection of large group of country that do not all share the same perspective on global affair or indeed the same value to assume that it can reflect the unanimity that we have in the be simply to misunderstand how foreign affair actually work the hon member ask about what the statement say it agree on the significance of secure comprehensive just and last peace the statement specifically call for an end to attack on food and civilian infrastructure and for russia to rejoin the black sea grain initiative indeed it highlight the suffering that it be cause it be also statement that the united states describe as contain substantively very strong language on the situation this why to have agreement among member even if it be not exactly the language we would have choose be still positive outcome from this summit too associate myself with the prime minister word about morocco and the people of morocco and pay tribute to truro base shelterbox which as ever have team stand ready for deployment at the point that the moroccan government need it will the prime minister tell the house what conversation he have have with his partner about critical mineral extraction not only to boost local production from cornwall lithium obviously but to ensure that we have supply chain that cut out rogue partner my hon friend make an excellent point about the need to improve our economic resilience and security which be why that be an increase feature of the partnership and agreement that we strike around the world indeed it be feature of the partnership agreement that strike with japan when be there and with the us when visit recently speak to president biden and prime minister kishida about those agreement and the work that we be do in both case there be milestone for we to meet with regard to strengthen our co operation on critical mineral in particular welcome my right hon friend statement he rightly highlight the importance of international trade and the progress that he have make include new partnership join will he perhaps give bit more detail on the progress make on secure uk india deal we do make and have make substantial progress but as say there be hard work leave to do and that be why we will we keep at it but it be right that we do not put arbitrary deadline on these trade deal and that we keep go until they work for the british people british company and the british government that be what we will endeavour to do as say we have make lot of progress but we will not sign deal unless it be right for the united kingdom congratulate my right hon friend on his leadership in secure the outcome of the summit far to his response to my hon friend the member for harrogate and knaresborough andrew jones in view of the scale of the population and the speed of growth in india the area of joint expertise and the co operation that have take place to date as well as the deep root tie the uk have with india which spread across the whole of the united kingdom can my right hon friend assure that as he progress the negotiation on the trade deal he will ensure that it contain chapter or element that allow for small business and medium sized enterprise across the uk and beyond to trade effectively with india my right hon friend be absolutely right unquestionably india be if not the most then one of the most significant and consequential country for global affair over the come year and decade it be absolutely right and important that the united kingdom have close relationship with india that span not just economic co operation but area include defence and security and science and technology research collaboration we be aim to enhance our partnership in all those area for the reason he mention this will be to the long term benefit of the uk if we get it right member will know that the next summit will be hold in rio in november note with interest that brazil have already place on the agenda something call reform of the global governance institution do the prime minister agree that reform of the un security council should be consider with the good interest of the uk at heart so that the un security council remain viable framework for global security and that britain must never put britain seat at the table on the table we have speak in the past about support for additional member of the un security council include in india and it be something we continue to do as my hon friend have see at this summit we warmly support and welcome the inclusion of the african union in the because he make good point that international institution need to adapt and change continually to reflect the reality of the current state of global affair be very proud early this month to celebrate ukraine independence day with huddersfield vibrant ukrainian community hear at first hand how proud they be of the uk steadfast support for ukraine with brazil take over the presidency of the will the prime minister continue to work with our international ally and partner to increase and build on our wonderful support for ukraine and to build unity in condemn putin barbaric and illegal invasion of ukraine agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend and pay tribute to he and his constituent for all they be do to support ukraine and ukrainian family uk support for ukraine now amount to over billion and different state have now sign up to the declaration we help to initiate to provide long term security support to ukraine so he can be confident in our steadfast support for ukraine it be not go away we be here to stay which be why we will tell russia that now be the time to lay down arm and come to sensible peaceful resolution thank the prime minister for his statement today and for respond to question for minute point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker during the recent debate on the safety of school building the hon member for twickenham munira wilson refer to school in my constituency wrongly include it in list of school with reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete wait to hear from the government about remediation the original school be indeed build use raac many decade ago however early this year pupil move into their brand new million state of the art school on the site while utilise other college building as the next stage of the million transformation progress furthermore the royal college manchester seashell trust be not reliant on government funding it be non maintain as it be an independent charity will you direct on how can set the record straight and ensure that the positive message regard this excellent school be hear thank the hon lady for her point of order and her forward notice of it let we be fair she have just do it in an amazing way on point of order mr deputy speaker on july this year and more than right hon and hon member from all party write to the prime minister regard the case of my constituent jagtar singh johal question be address directly to the prime minister on whether he would raise the case of my constituent when he meet his indian counterpart narendra modi at last weekend summit and on whether he would ask for his release give the plethora of organisation include the united nations that have deem his detention to be arbitrary do not come to the house today to complain about the tardy ministerial response instead my grievance lie in the fact that it be not the prime minister who reply to but junior minister from the foreign commonwealth and development office who sit in the other house only the prime minister would be in position to answer because only he be in the room with prime minister modi and in position to ask the question about jagtar what recourse do we have as member mr deputy speaker when correspondence with his majesty government include the primus inter pare who be also member of the house be treat with such disrespect be grateful to the hon member for his point of order and his forward notice of it it be not for the chair but for the government to decide which minister reply to particular piece of correspondence but know how assiduously the hon member pursue this matter and be sure that he will continue to find way to ensure that it be on the prime minister agenda ukraine beg to move that this house have consider the situation in ukraine since the most recent statement on ukraine which be give in june by the former secretary of state my right hon friend the member for wyre and preston north mr wallace the armed force of ukraine have launch their land offensive to retake their country therefore think it useful to start with an update on the status of the conflict before outline the strategic consequence and consideration for where we be today the impact of ukraine summer offensive have be widely report in the medium although it be true that the conflict remain hard go for both side ukraine determination remain steadfast the ukrainian armed force have show extraordinary resourcefulness and their determination to win be strong than ever they have adapt necessarily their approach to overcome the russian use of mine artillery and drone result in steady progress with notable success in recent week we have witness the clever prioritisation of their operation and they be husband the battle win equipment provide by their ally and partner to have maximum effect the ukrainian armed force continue to prioritise offensive action in the robotyne area and be currently fight through the first russian main defensive line which be heavily fortified ukraine be carry out operation around bakhmut push the russians back to the edge of the town and ensure no significant territorial change within the past month despite the large number of russian force commit they be not succeed ukraine have make notable success in destroy several russian command and control centre and ammunition storage site it be difficult from the comfort of our position here in the house of commons or watch on television as observer to imagine the ferocity of the fighting and the sacrifice of the ukrainians it have be bloody brutal and painstakingly slow as they have penetrate defensive minefield that be km in depth but they be succeed thank the minister very much for his introduction and for our clear commitment in the united kingdom and through the minister office to help ukraine one thing that be currently prevalent the minister refer to it be the clearance of mine understand that in the past perhaps or month russia have have time to set different level and line of mine what help be we in the united kingdom and indeed all of the free world able to give to the ukrainians to clear the mine there be two part to mine clearance in country first there be the tactical mine clearance of lane through which to launch the ukrainian offensive the tactic to which the ukrainians have resort to preserve combat power have be to clear the minefield very slowly deliberately and methodically with dismounted infantry in way that those of we who serve in afghanistan or iraq will remember as tactic for improvise explosive device there it be quite something that that have be the tactic for clear minefield but it have preserve combat power and therefore have be necessary the other part be that there will obviously need to be demining effort for the country at large after the war and that be concern for all of ukraine donor and mr deputy speaker it seem odd to talk about the progress of the war and the atrocity when other be so busy in their conversation but be sure they mean nothing by it despite the large number of russian force commit they be not succeed ukraine have have notable success destroy several russian command and control centre and ammunition storage site it be difficult from the comfort of our position as observer to imagine the ferocity of the fighting and the sacrifice of the ukrainians russia be suffer heavily on the battlefield and have take some casualty of whom we believe have be kill in addition more than armoured vehicle have be destroy however the value of today debate be not simply to reflect on the tactical situation on the ground in south east ukraine but to zoom out and assess the strategic scorecard my right hon friend make valuable point about demining but demining could be put in place now and it be important now because even area that be retake still have significant number of seeded mine there be not only traditional mine clearance of the kind that he will be familiar with from afghanistan but the use of artificial intelligence and software to predict how mine move and spread that work can be do now we do not have to wait till the end of the war completely agree with my hon friend observation the reality be that as the frontline move it be in ukraine interest to bring the agricultural land back into productive use as quickly as possible and we have see some extraordinarily innovative effort to do that from the most low tech to the most high tech the challenge be that neither the uk nor any other supporter of ukraine would want to put combat engineering capability into the country for fear of any miscalculation that that would cause that effort necessarily sit with the non governmental organisation but there be number work with the ukrainian government some of which be base here in the uk suggest that the house zoom out bit to look at the strategic scorecard as result of putin war the russian people be needlessly suffer the russian economy be falter and we be see ukrainian strike deep into the interior of russia an aborted coup and its aftermath lay bare the nature of putin regime and the strength of feeling of so many russians against his so call special military operation it have become standard line in these update but on day of putin three day operation he still have not achieve any of his strategic objective russia economy be fail the rouble continue to fall and sanction be bite as we have see before russia will resort to terrorise ukraine population whenever its battlefield objective can not be meet just last wednesday russian strike hit crowded market in the ukrainian city of kostiantynivka kill at least people and wound further over the weekend we have see sham election run in donetsk luhansk kherson zaporizhzhia and crimea but as the foreign secretary tweet the problem for putin be that you can hold election in someone else country putin continue to use food as weapon to hold the world to ransom russia be use its black sea fleet to attack ukrainian port with impunity in order to prevent the export of grain and exacerbate global food insecurity have travel extensively across africa and the rest of what be sometimes lazily refer to as the global south whatever putin might think he achieve through the security conference he host in moscow and st petersburg be yet to meet anyone who be not clear that it be his attack on ukrainian port infrastructure that threaten food security across the develop world he be use food as weapon we encourage return to the black sea grain initiative but we be clear eyed about putin action and his likely intent it be self evident that russia behaviour on sovereign ukrainian territory mean that he be interested neither in find path to peace nor in stability in the world beyond make no mistake the fast route to peace in ukraine and to security and stability for the rest of we be through putin withdraw his force and end this illegal and unjustified war the uk have be at the forefront of effort to support ukraine offensive as the house will know well we provide billion in military support to ukraine last year and by be the first to send tank and storm shadow missile we galvanise coalition of like minded nation to follow suit and come to the defence of the broad international rule base system at the nato summit in vilnius in july the prime minister announce new tranche of support for ukraine include thousand of additional round for challenger tank more than combat and logistic vehicle and million support package for equipment repair as well as the establishment of new military rehabilitation centre we be also see increase contribution to the international fund for ukraine so far million have be pledge and contract worth million have be place to assist ukraine in critical area such as intelligence surveillance reconnaissance electronic warfare and air defence the first delivery arrive in ukraine this summer two organisation in putney have raise lot of money and contribution of medical aid for ukraine they have with volunteer take ambulance out to ukraine that be big need that have be communicate back to we can the minister say anything more about the medical aid be supply to those on the frontline in ukraine the hon lady be absolutely right to raise that there be of course the aid that the mod give the ukrainian armed force in combat medical equipment and indeed in medical support but the most amazing thing in the medical aid space be what have be do by small group around the country such as those in her constituency people have band together and pool whatever supply they can lay their hand on very often they then deliver those supply in person exactly as she say her constituent have do which take some bravery as well as real commitment to gather they in the first place in reality those endeavour will always be of enormous value to community across ukraine just as the medical aid that we give more directly to the ukrainian military be to they her constituent and other be to be commend the government will continue to support the military with the medical aid it need and to consider what more we as nation can do to complement the work do by voluntary group charity similar to those the minister describe be which be base in my constituency visit those at the charity and ask they what they would request of the government they say that expire medical equipment from the nhs specifically dressing approach their expiry date would be enormously useful to their charitable endeavour note the hon gentleman comment and pay tribute to the work of the group in his constituency on government to government basis it be important that we be lead by the government of ukraine and what they ask we for they be clear in their communication with we about their priority and those be what we resource however will of course ensure that his point be note in the meantime encourage the group in his constituency to continue do what they can in support we have now train more than ukrainian personnel under operation interflex with contribution and knowledge from international partner as demonstrate by the grow coalition of country now join we in training ukrainians here on uk soil nearly ukrainian marine be return home after be train by the royal marine and army commando during six month uk programme that training see the commando train ukraine force in small boat amphibious operation and in conduct beach raid we have also commence basic fly training for up to ukrainian pilot to support the recent decision by denmark and the netherlands to donate jet that in addition to the ongoing work from the royal navy to train the ukrainian minesweeping crew make the uk the only country on earth that be train soldier sailor aviator and marine something about which we should be very proud my right hon friend be make great speech and apologise for interrupt again and thank he for take the intervention apology if have miss it but when it come to train people be any thought be give to sandhurst package or start to get junior officer through one thing that the royal united services institute have identify it be not necessary to go through year long course to do it but it may help be the lack of junior officer and of people with op experience and of put together basic plan that be one point that have be identify and be wonder whether my right hon friend could answer it my hon friend think deeply about the problem and his observation be absolutely correct it would be inelegant to reflect on the private conversation that we have with ukrainian ministers and defence chief but think ukraine be go through exactly the same as any other country that have be fight war it be very hard to strike the balance between keep its most combat experience and battle harden on the frontline in command of tactical situation and bring those people rearwards and make they part of the planning or training effort that can have an exponential impact but it be very big opportunity cost to accept the uk remain one of the large bilateral humanitarian donor to ukraine at the ukraine recovery conference in london in june co chair by the uk and ukraine we add furth million of humanitarian support to the million we have already provide this week we have proscribe the wagner group as terrorism organisation further measure of the uk commitment to compete with russian influence wherever in the world it manifest itself through our sanction we be frustrating russia attempt to prosecute its war and hinder its effort to resupply the uk alone have sanction over individual and entity since the start of the invasion include bank with global asset worth trillion oligarch with combine net worth of over billion and over billion worth of uk russia trade in june we introduce legislation to reinforce our approach by enable sanction to remain in place until russia pay for the damage it have cause in ukraine russia failure on the battlefield demonstrate that its much vaunted and much fear capability be anything but russia have be prove to be an unreliable partner unable or unwilling to satisfy export order due to outdated and inferior quality material alongside inadequate logistic and equipment care moscow be have to prioritise its own force over its international order book potential russian export customer see clearly the opportunity to diversify their defence supply and seek out the reliable and effective equipment that britain and other in the west manufacture what be true for defence export be increasingly true for all other export too that matter because putin illegal war in ukraine be increasingly costly to he not just in blood and treasure on the battlefield but in influence in the international arena more and more country in russia near abroad be look for other friend because they see that russia can not be trust while country that have be in the russian sphere for decade and depend on it for their defence and security now realise the need to diversify that be not just in nato where finland and sweden have go through huge strategic shift other around the world be do likewise the cost to russia of putin folly will last for decade commend the minister for the full range of strategic initiative be conduct by the british government but it strike that the good way of support ukraine in toto be for all member nation of nato to be contribute the agree per nation as of today seven of those be do so may please ask the minister with the fcdo minister the hon member for aldershot leo docherty in his place as well what we be do to compel or at least coerce or encourage other nato nation to do so at the vilnius summit early in the summer the prime minister and other who be spend of gdp be very clear in their expectation that other quickly move to do likewise moreover they be clear that that can not be just short term capital commitment but long term endure commitment to spend for good as minimum floor because euro atlantic security have not be so threaten for well over generation one day the war in ukraine will cease so we must make sure that ukraine be in the good possible shape to help its economy recover and quickly to bring prosperity back to ukraine the ukraine recovery conference commit furth billion of guarantee to unlock world bank lending million of bilateral assistance and up to million of new capital for the uk development finance institution british international investment to advance ukraine economic recovery critically we be also spend some million on programme to help ukraine rebuild sustainable and resilient energy system and to keep the light on mr deputy speaker be sure those in the kremlin pay particular attention to the commons when you be in the chair so have no doubt that they be watch this afternoon and they need to be clear that we recognise the need will my right hon friend give way will give way one last time be most grateful because think he be reach the end of his remark be but be wait for he to get on to the big strategic picture it be quite clear that mr putin be play this long in the hope that the patience of our ally we can think of who they be will wear thin our attention will wane and by process of attrition he will gain something out of this conflict congratulate the government on refuse to accept that that should be the outcome but what confidence do the minister have that we will carry all our ally to ensure that we sustain the ukrainians effort so that that they achieve total victory not some sell out of half their territory already occupy by the russians well hansard already have the final few paragraph of my speech so will simply agree with my hon friend he be absolutely correct the tactical support that we provide to the ukrainians to win tonight and tomorrow will continue for as long as be need putin can not wait this out and to prove that increasingly over the last few month the uk government focus have be not just on that tactical support for tomorrow but on give putin the certainty that the ukrainian armed force will be help to continue to modernise and grow over the next decade so that they finish this war superior to the russian armed force we will help ukraine to recover more quickly and to grow fast than russia so that the economic cost and difference be clear for all to see the uk have the strategic patience to make sure that this illegal war finish in ukraine favour and that putin or his successor be show that russia will never succeed by throw its might around in its near abroad call the shadow minister it have be day since putin illegal invasion of ukraine war in europe be harsh reminder that to be secure at home we must be strong abroad and that our ally be our great strategic strength in do so our commitment to ukraine must be long lasting fine word do not defeat the tank of an invader only weapon training courage and determination stand up to they the ukrainian war effort in recent week and month have be slow going but effective despite deeply dig in and heavily mine russian defence the ukrainians be steadily get the upper hand on the battlefield in the south of the country by target supply line and outlying area in the western zaporizhzhia oblast and robotyne in its defence the ukraine operation be also diversify the way it be hit its enemy airfield at depth in russia target in crimea and russian ship in the black sea some have criticise the slow pace of ukraine counter offensive yet ukrainian force be make similar rate of progress as british troop do in the day after day and the normandy landing now as then it be brutal conventional trench warfare and want to pay tribute on behalf of all on the opposition side of the house to the extraordinary heroism and resilience of the ukrainian military in the face of russian aggression in contrast vladimir putin be fight war on number of front with military battlefield and political one too he be fight to fix his fail war strategy as russia armed force continue to fight on the back foot in ukraine without the supply they need the leadership they need and the rotation of troop they need putin be fight increase hostility on russian soil with grow number of drone attack and economic headwind face the country because of the grip of sanction he be fight increase scrutiny of his leadership as we see in the aborted coup over the summer as concern about the war continue to grow in russia however more than month on there be no sign that his strategic aim have change nor be there any sign that he be any close to achieve single one of they go back to the hon member comment about day and normandy the americans and brits be bogge down in hedgerow country there and the way they break out and start to make real progress be with overwhelming aerial superiority and bombardment that be exactly what the ukrainians need it be tell that neither ukraine nor russia enjoy air superiority over the contested part of ukraine at the moment nor do either enjoy superiority in the electronic warfare spectrum or in uncrewed aerial vehicle that contest in ew and the airspace make the contest on land even more brutal so the hon gentleman be right about the importance of ensure that we continue to support our friend in ukraine not just with artillery system but with the shell and spare part require to ensure the artillery can keep fire we must also ensure continual supply of aerial combat system not only but the uncrewed drone which ukraine be use with such effect and training this be long term commitment and while there be no air superiority we need to make sure that every single available advantage that ukraine can have from the provision of western support be available to it agree with what the hon gentleman have say putin believe that the west will not stay the course as the minister suggest but putin be wrong those who call for the ukrainians to sue for peace and negotiate be do putin dirty work for he in over year putin have never give up territory he have take by force ceasefire now would cede territory to russia allow putin force to regroup deepen the occupation and pretend there be legitimisation for the regime of torture rape and execution include the theft of ukrainian child and their removal to part of russia the threat we face from putin be long term and our resolve must equally stand the test of time across parliaments across change of ministers and across change of government there may well be change to labour next year but let say clearly that there will be no change in britain resolve to stand with ukraine confront russian aggression and pursue putin for his war crime the defence of the united kingdom start in ukraine the support that have be offer to ukraine by the uk should make we all proud and agree with the minister when he set out clearly the contribution that have be make by uk force through operation interflex with the training of our ukrainian friend and the provision of military system now it be time for ukraine ally to double down on that support because this be long term fight the uk do deserve credit for its support for ukraine and the leadership show among ally to get they to do more but it be vital that we be able to say the same thing in six month time because stockpile be be deplete energy level be lower and there be risk of fatigue we can not afford that fatigue and that be why we must be in this for the long term once ukraine have prevail the rightful place for ukraine be in nato alongside the ally that share common view on democracy freedom and territorial integrity that be the rightful place for ukraine once it have prevail however let also reiterate that the uk government will continue to have labour full support on military aid to ukraine and on reinforce our nato ally labour support for nato be unshakeable and our backing for ukraine be solid and firm ukrainians be now urgently ask for more to help with their current counter offensive and ensure that it succeed since january the prime minister have repeatedly pledge to accelerate uk support for ukraine but one concern on the opposition side of the house be that momentum behind our military help be falter the challenger tank that the uk send to ukraine may be see as top of the range but our effort have now be dwarf by other european ally poland have commit tank the czechs and our friend in the netherlands there be an urgent need to help ukraine ramp up its domestic industrial production of key weapon and equipment such as ammunition and shell bae systems move to set up local entity in ukraine be start but the government could be do far more to help facilitate deal from variety of partner so that ukraine can produce both modern and soviet era system close to the frontline so that they can be use quick minister be also yet to provide accelerated support on new drone technology include counter drone measure such as electronic warfare system and armoured vehicle despite there be clear need to do so finally our friend in ukraine need further support with their de mining capability that be raise early by number of member across the house it be important that such de mining support continue not only on the frontline to ensure breakthrough but in the liberated area to ensure that proper economic activity can return now be the time when the uk should be step up support for the ukrainian offensive will the minister clarify how the new defence secretary will be accelerate uk assistance to ukraine and will he set out the scope of assistance that ukraine can expect from we as part of that acceleration how be he remove some of the bureaucratic hurdle that prevent partnership between uk industry and our friend in ukraine from take place the hon member for filton and bradley stoke jack lopresti raise similar point during defence question and this be about break down the barrier between business and ally rather than simple intergovernmental transfer of support be require box clever here could produce good result to be the lead nation in provide support for ukraine we must be fast in deliver the support that be require on help with rebuild ukraine the european union have already set out plan to shift frozen asset into fund to help rebuild ukraine canada have pass law allow it to do the same and now the us have also draft bill to do so the government say in july that they support use frozen asset to rebuild ukraine so what be cause the delay when can we expect frozen asset to be use for that purpose if minister come forward with workable plan it will enjoy cross party support this parliament will be agree on it so when will that happen and what will it look like the government finally decide last week to proscribe the wagner group as terrorist organisation but on february this year stand at the dispatch box and call for wagner to be designate as terrorist organisation labour colleague have be do that for some time and the european parliament vote for it late last year complacency could be the enemy of success in ukraine so why have it take six month since labour call for it to happen for ministers slowly to grind into action why now only after prigozhin have be kill have wagner be proscribe in that way by the united kingdom that be lengthy delay and it would be useful to understand why we be so out of step with our ally when it come to wagner will the minister provide an assessment of the risk that wagner troop pose to ukraine include the thousand still base in belarus since russia invade ukraine in and labour colleague have respond eight time to debate statement or urgent question concern ukraine time and again in such debate we have reiterate the urgent need for stockpile strategy to sustain support for ukraine and rearm britain time and again the government have fail to provide coherent long term stockpile strategy that be not good enough our generosity to ukraine correct as it be be deplete our current military stockpile and despite the government have know about this problem for over year they continue to act too slowly to replenish they the capability gap that be be create be concern because if we want to be in this for the long term and believe that on cross party basis we do we can not afford capability gap nor can we afford to empty our cupboard to ensure that the front line be well supply while have nothing for our own defence that of our ally or the continue support we need next generation light anti tank weapon have be vital to ukraine and it be day after the invasion before the mod get its act together and sign new contract with the first newly make nlaw not due until what active step be the government take to improve the british magazine depth as the americans would describe it and our stockpile do the minister accept that the uk need stockpile strategy so that we can finally shift part of our defence industry and mod procurement on to urgent operational footing to ensure that that we have the supply of both the armament and the military system that we need to ensure long term support at the moment the government be continue to fall short on that front have be listen to what the hon gentleman be say about nlaw and there be very quick response some credit should be give to thales for its response when the government put the order in almost straight away thales be able to respond manufacture those nlaw and get they out to ukraine some credit must be give to the thales factory and the worker back in belfast for what they be able to do be grateful for that intervention because it give chance to thank not only those in britain military industry who have be support the effort in ukraine but those in plymouth who be supply the part that go into some of the missile system that be make in the factory mention by the hon gentleman this be long term effort and that be why we need stockpile strategy to ensure that investment be go in across the united kingdom especially in missile and missile system that be prove their worth on the battlefield in ukraine but that be develop design and build many decade ago and that we have be use as part of our stockpile ever since the government need to show we that they be learn the lesson from the war in ukraine and part of that be about our homeland defence and how we well protect these shore there be brief mention of that in the defence command paper refresh publish recently but in light of development in missile technology and the weaponisation of drone that have be on display in both ukraine and russia would be grateful if the minister could clarify what the government be do to protect the uk and our own homeland defence from such threat our city be as vulnerable as russian city to those kind of attack and as we begin the autumn and winter month we must learn from the experience of the attack in ukraine last year especially russian target of supply chain and importantly civilian energy installation what be we do in advance to ensure that those energy installation be well defend and that there be an ongoing supply of power realise that there will be thing the minister can not say but be sure there be thing he can say to ensure certainty in this house russia will try to force ukrainians into darkness once again what additional support can the uk provide for increase ukraine air defence which be critical to ensure that ukraine critical national infrastructure survive over the winter ukraine must win this war and russia must lose the former defence secretary understand that well and his successor must now give that his full focus when he can the new defence secretary have take this job at time when political leadership be just as vital as military leadership early this year his predecessor concede in the commons that successive conservative governments have hollow out and underfunde our force since the government have cut full time soldier from the british army remove one in five ship from the royal navy and take more than aircraft out of raf service in the last five year alone as the new defence secretary take his place he should pursue an accelerated uk plan to help support ukraine and defeat putin first he must accelerate military support secondly he must redouble uk defence diplomacy to help maintain western unity and thirdly he must spell out the long term security guarantee announce with partner at the recent nato summit the hon gentleman be give full solidarity and the pledge on behalf of the labour party to continue the government policy in ukraine be extremely welcome and will be hear around the world do that extend to guarantee on funding for defence appreciate that this be loaded question but will the hon gentleman match whatever the government promise to spend on defence the hon gentleman invite to write labour manifesto from the dispatch box and be sure that the shadow chancellor my right hon friend the member for leeds west rachel reeves would not be too keen on do that let say clearly that labour in power have always spend what be require on defence when we leave power we be spend of gdp on defence figure never match by conservative government in year it be important that when it come to defence we not only have reasonable budget for security but that the money be well spend what we have see recently as the hon gentleman will know be huge amount of waste in mod procurement that be not only on waste system but through money go to foreign contractor that in the opposition mind should have go to uk contractor because we believe in build in britain first and foremost as we have see from the recent royal fleet auxiliary solid support ship contract which be send abroad rather than to uk supplier in its first instance we be seep money out of our system when we allow such contract to go abroad we need to make sure that as we build new platform there be an adequate work share for all partner involve there be balance to be strike but take the challenge that the hon gentleman make be afraid he will have to wait for our manifesto for those commitment the final thing will do be to thank all the community up and down the country that have be support our ukrainian friend throughout the day since putin illegal invasion madam deputy speaker know you have be support people in your constituency in doncaster and meet some of they to thank they for their support member from both side of the house have be support their community over the summer recess include in make sure that ukrainians who have come to the united kingdom can remain here in particular pay tribute to some of the ukrainian young people in plymouth who have succeed in achieve gcse and level despite the enormous pressure upon they and their family in many case they be study subject in new language and new country while their friend and family be face bombing and attack in ukraine it be an incredible achievement and put on record our thank and be sure those of the entire house to all those british family who have be make ukrainians welcome here in britain we still have lot more work to do and our commitment need to be long term not only in our military support for ukraine but in our support for ukrainians for whom it be unsafe to go home for as long as it be unsafe we need to make sure there be safe home for they here should there be change of government at the next general election there will be no change in britain support for ukraine we must rise to the same height as our ukrainian friend to ensure that putin lose and ukraine win call the chair of the defence committee the paralysis of the statement reflect the difficulty of the geopolitic we face the absence of communiqué to confirm that it be russia at fault here show what leadership be still require in lean in to what be happen in ukraine this remain the big war since world war two although it be drag on as the minister for armed forces say we be on day we should not be desensitise to what be happen we should be concern that there continue to be economic and security disruption right across the continent this be test of our staying power and our ability to continue our support to dry up our support for ukraine be exactly what putin want we to do since the last time we have debate on this matter dramatic event have take place over the summer they affect what be happen on the ground in ukraine and in russia and they could be game change it be worth remember that putin think he could win this war because he see divided ukraine president zelensky do not enjoy the command and support that he have today if we go back to the maidan in viktor yanukovych be press by putin to lean his country to the east when it be clear that the nation or at least half of it want to face the west putin see the west be risk averse in want to support ukraine in its hour of need he then press far by take on crimea and the donbas again the west do little he then invade in as we know hop to repeat what happen in when the soviets march into czechoslovakia with troop and think around tank it be the courage of ukraine that mean it stand up to the mark and stand up to the third large army in the world this be where we can pay tribute to what the british government have do because there have be commendable engagement even prior to the invasion itself they have provide those important anti tank weapon system training on salisbury plain those main battle tank the challengers as well as storm shadows and brimstones they have be lead in the ramstein group co ordinating effort with other ally to make sure that ukraine have the necessary military assistance we have learn and become less risk averse as time have move forward conscious of the escalatory ladder and know we be deal with nuclear power that have invade another state the west have rekindle its cold war statecraft skill but the fundamental issue be if we want ukraine to win and russia to lose we should not be half hearted in give what ukraine require we need to be fully commit to give ukraine the tool to succeed for victory it have be clear and mention already in the chamber today that the war have not go well for president putin he expect quick win and be now frustrate on the frontline there be little to show for his effort he be use conscript and prisoner and have to replace successive general because command and control be not what it be he have spend the past year coup proofing as it be the kremlin moscow and russia to make sure that he will not be remove because that be the russian way russian leader remain in power because they exhibit strength and be infallible as soon as they show any sign of weakness that be when the oligarch the elite and so forth realise they can no long have their back watch by the leader in charge and they move to replace they that be what we be see today because of the game change event involve the wagner rebellion and yevgeny prigozhin his removal by putin be inevitable for the very reason have just raise when russian leader be attack in any way it be the russian way to crush one enemy to remove they and to eliminate they in one form or another prigozhin do something exceptional not only do he challenge putin and bury the myth that this war be go well but he use his own force to charge up through rostov on don towards moscow that illustrate that no russian force be able to take on the wagner group the private army to prevent coup and mutiny that weakness be now recognise across russia putin time will eventually be up the other dynamic be that of all the fight force in ukraine the most powerful capable potent and well equip be the wagner group it have the good equipment and be the most motivated it have now be remove from the battlefield and that provide an opportunity for ukraine lot of western pressure have be place on ukraine say we have give you all this expensive exceptional ever complex equipment why have the counter offensive not advanced far again it be because this happen in the second world war various phase of operation need to be conduct we have see ukraine probe the frontline across km and we be now see advance take place as it penetrate through complex minefield and anti tank defence particularly in the zaporizhzhia region that be the progress we need to see but we need to exhibit patience this be not go to happen overnight there will not be quick phase of war with this all be over by christmas what putin be now realise be that this could be the beginning of the end of his war in ukraine and it could be the beginning of the end of his existence as leader too do not believe he will be replace overnight but do believe that the weakness exhibit be enough to unrest and unnerve many of the leader in russia who will be look for replacement in the long term we therefore need to be cautious and perhaps stand up to those voice in the west who be say let draw line let start negotiate let get round table and draw close to what be happen in ukraine we need to recognise the big picture and what putin indeed even his successor might be try to do and that be to expand russian influence in the slavic area of eastern europe again that be the russia way let we go back hundred of year the view have be if we be not be attack the good way be to attack otherwise our defence will not be enough to hold the motherland together so let take advantage of the west weakness or risk averseness be pleased to see that we be now start to change that what be next for the west absolutely we must keep up that military support that be the tactical that have be talk about today but would advance two further area where we could do more to support ukrainians first we must recognise that more than billion worth of frozen asset belong to russia we need to develop legal mechanism that would allow each month about billion of that to be slide across the table to ukraine to help in its reconstruction and development that might focus mind in russia in moscow in the kremlin and putin himself that the long the war continue the more russian money it be cost secondly would stress the grain shipment bring they up with the prime minister which be critical for ukraine as well as fundamental for our own economy where food inflation remain in double figure would stress the symbiotic relationship between our economic security and our national security be pleased that the government be organise and participate in global food security summit hope that we will look towards create some form of expeditionary force that can provide the necessary defence and support for maritime taskforce to protect those ship and ensure they can depart from odesa to feed the rest of the world end simply by stress what think many colleague will express because our world be get more dangerous not less our peacetime defence budget of just over of gdp be simply not adequate we have the integrated review which introduce so many cut across all three service because of ukraine we have another ir ir unfortunately none of those cut be reverse hope that the new defence secretary who have the prime minister ear will be able to persuade he on that and recognise that we have do so much in advance our hard power capability but we need to go far because of where this very dangerous world be now head call the snp spokesperson it be pleasure to speak from the front bench for think the third time today on this subject however think there will be much more unanimity and agreement across the house as someone who have be speak about the plight of ukraine essentially since be elect in have always be happy to state my support and that of my party for the ukrainians ongoing struggle to establish control of their homeland across the full extent of their border and as someone who it be fair to say have never be shy in criticise the government when they deserve it think the political will they have show to remain ahead of the curve when it come to the international response be to be commend give that my opinion and those of my party be well understand and an matter of extensive record in the house intend to keep my remark relatively short but needless to say it be important to reflect on where we be at this stage in the war it be fair to say that little too much pressure be put on the ukrainian armed force before their summer offensive not only be it an eternal adage that no plan survive contact with the enemy but russia have significant amount of time to dig in as well as to learn from the mistake it make at the beginning of the conflict and adapt these russian force be riddle with corruption clientelism cronyism racism and poor morale as witness by the attempt coup as be mention early however that do not mean that they be entirely incapable of learn on the battlefield and as satisfying as the initial success of capability such as javelin or himars be there be no doubt that they adapt and change their approach become hard opponent to break down in the process that say recent advance be to be welcome and the sacrifice make by the armed force of ukraine in advance past those initial line in certain area should be recognise while it may be all too soon to talk about whether this be breach breakthrough or anything more it be welcome news at the end of the summer have always be one of those who have feel it important to allow ukraine to lead this strategy hope that we will not be hear anything more of the veiled criticism of that that emerge from some ally quarter it be similarly solid adage that thing always take little long in war than be initially anticipate and we know that it will be perseverance and adaption in response to the battlefield in front of they that will win the war for ukraine our patience and resolve be therefore need at this time along with an ongoing appraisal of what we can do to continue supply matériel to ukraine that could prove decisive in that context the recent conversation about the army tactical missile system be most welcome and it will hopefully provide the opportunity to strike deep behind russian line and far disrupt the morale of those russians prevent ukrainian advance our patience and resolve must extend far will never tire of say here that win the peace in ukraine and provide the funding for the civilian authority there to rebuild after the conflict be over will be as important as win the war that work will probably take decade and believe it be already begin again commend the government for the work they have start on that with this year donor conference hold here in london but we can not take any of this for grant let we not be naive the kremlin strategy be as we have hear to try to wait ukraine and its ally out it be place lot of hope in an amenable result in next year us presidential election while we can not thank our american friend enough for the breadth and depth of their bilateral military and economic aid to ukraine we know that that that have become something of live question in that country political debate we should prepare ourselves for the possibility that that bilateral support may not continue in its current form it be therefore most disheartening to read report in the press of former uk prime ministers state publicly their preference for candidate in that election who have pledge to roll back support for ukraine it would be most disheartening should broad culture war trope that have infect the american debate on ukraine also cross the atlantic therefore hope that we can continue the agreement on the broad strategy of aid ukraine while of course reserve the right occasionally to disagree on how good to do that and show patience and resolve as they go about liberate their homeland be happy to say that have the unwavering support of my party for those sentiment it pass motion on ukraine at last year party conference which state unequivocally as party which have as its found principle the ability of people to self determine conference state unequivocally that crimea donetsk luhansk kherson and zaporizhizhia be all ukraine the people of ukraine be suffer in manner that we in britain be unaccustomed to in recent time and we be horrify by russian force be commit war crime after war crime with no regard for civilian include woman and child while visit the ukrainian town of irpin just north west of kyiv in february see what the local ukrainians refer to as the cemetery of burn car that be what be leave on day when family have pack what they could to escape the russian advance force but they do not make it out because the russians fire upon they kill those attempt to escape it could not even be say that they be kill by stray small arm round look at the number and size of the hole in the back and side of the car it be clear to anyone that those poor people be deliberately target by heavy weapon all that be take place on the continent of europe in sovereign state with parliamentary democracy the people of ukraine be fight for their life and their freedom and democracy our share value in august be able to visit the frontline south of the city of zaporizhzhia speak with some of the troop and it be great to see the very high morale among they many of those brave man be train in the uk especially the gunner train at the royal school of artillery in larkhill be proud to see british kit and equipment use in the fight to eject russians from ukraine see an gun which have come from my son regiment royal horse artillery the ukrainian gunner speak to about how they prefer british ammunition because the charge bag do not fall apart and the gun barrel need less cleaning we see the gun in action with round land on russian target they ask to convey their thank to the prime minister the government and the house of commons for our unwavering ongoing support if ukraine be to win the war the government must continue to provide such equipment weapon training and aid welcome my right hon friend the prime minister announcement of plan for an additional uk lead training programme to include ukrainian fighter jet and marine over the weekend make my third visit so far to ukraine when attend the yalta european strategy conference with other member from across the house we discuss the power importance and profundity of ukraine ideal how help ukraine be good for global peace security and the global economy and how we may bring this illegal bloody terrible war to an end since the war start in with the invasion of crimea and the subsequent expansion of russian aggression in february ukrainians have prove themselves to be strong determined and fiercely patriotic people who be passionate about defend their home of beautiful and diverse landscape as well as preserve their culture and tradition with many refugee from ukraine now live in our constituency in the united kingdom hope members across the house have seek to experience that culture along with many of our constituent the united kingdom come to the aid of ukraine be imperative in defend the freedom of our friend overseas but those work on that noble effort be also contribute much here at home mod defence equipment and support at abbey wood in my constituency employ several thousand mod personnel who be not only run the entire procurement for our armed force but be largely ensure that the ukrainians get all the equipment they need at prime minister question back in june the prime minister join in pay tribute to all their work in addition there be several defence company in my constituency with hard work team work around the clock develop the technology and equipment that will continue to help ukrainians liberate their country as chair of the all party parliamentary group for sovereign defence manufacturing capability follow these issue closely at an event host here in the house of commons by leonardo and bae systems we discuss the incredible support that the british defence manufacturing sector be provide the ukrainian military while in ukraine in august meet the then ukrainian defence minister oleksii reznikov to discuss defence procurement and how our country be work and will continue to work together in this area to that end the appg be currently run an inquiry on the impact of the ukrainian war on the resilience of our defence industrial capacity and capability not only to continue to supply and support ukrainians but to look at our own stock and how we can replenish they have be in discussion with british company who want to co operate with their ukrainian counterpart the need for close co operation between our two country be urgent unfortunately some element of the bureaucratic machinery here seem not to have wake up quite yet to the urgency of the situation the ukrainian defence industry have high level of skill innovation synergy and capacity for manufacture advanced technology as well as basic mechanical component the ukrainians need the materiel they need it now and what be more they want we to produce some of it jointly ukraine be significant trading partner of the uk the eu and our nato partner turkey ukraine export of iron ore semi finished iron seed oil wheat and corn be vital to the rest of the world as have be demonstrate by ukraine recent difficulty in export those good for foreign direct investment to return to ukraine russian force must be out of the country entirely and programme must be in place to ensure peace stability and protection from attack that will provide well security of commercial asset factory office technological system and so forth therefore secure victory for freedom in ukraine as well as the stability of the region be of the utmost importance in help to maintain global trade peace and security only once russian force be expel from the whole of ukraine will russia learn that it can not prey again upon ukraine or ally such as poland and estonia without terrible and catastrophic consequence guarantee security and stability in the region be paramount for the resumption of trade in and out of ukraine as well as for foreign direct investment in the country however for that to be achieve we must be willing to do whatever it take to help defend our friend and defeat the russians on the future for ukraine the united kingdom should be at the centre of promote security guarantee for the country and assist and support its application for nato membership the rebuilding of town city and infrastructure must be priority for the international community such proposal be part of future foreign aid expenditure incentivise fdi by the british private sector and have multilateral asset transfer and other reparation be all worthwhile suggestion for fund the reconstruction to sum up the united kingdom defence sector much of which be base in my constituency have be at the forefront of defend freedom in ukraine as have see at first hand on the frontline his majesty government must continue to lead and to ramp up support for ukraine to ensure victory and last peace and to promote the rebuilding of the country and its economy and prosperity together with the ukrainians and with the help of our ally we will finish the job it be pleasure to follow the hon member for filton and bradley stoke jack lopresti who seem to have be follow recently just this weekend we be at the yalta european strategy conference and before leave for ukraine we be in leeds which will come back to at yalta european strategy we be join by the minister the shadow europe minister my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty my co chair of the all party parliamentary group on ukraine the hon member for isle of wight bob seely and the hon member for gravesham adam holloway who be not here we have strong uk contingent however my journey into ukraine this time start bit early with the hon member for filton and bradley stoke and the leeds ukrainian community centre for ukraine national day will my hon friend join in thank group which be such he be about to mention such those in newport west who have join together to fund medicine equipment money and all sort of vital thing to go to ukraine to support the war effort and the people of ukraine absolutely it be incredible to see group up and down the country do that at the event that attend in leeds at the ukrainian centre be show picture of support vehicle that they have buy and be take to ukraine it have be purchase thank to an auction in morley and outwood which attend with the hon member for morley and outwood dame andrea jenkyns where buy vyshyvanka which wear in ukraine the auction raise enough money to buy that vehicle we have see such activity right across the country exactly two week ago today set out to ukraine from dover with the ukraine freedom company emergency ukraine and macclesfield ukrainian aid take five vehicle of aid that be the second time the appg have do that this year we not only talk about the support we will give but deliver in practical way to the people of ukraine we leave to go through the eurotunnel and have to cross four different set of custom border at each stage there be minor delay and there be quite long delay at one which will come back to the uk government need to do more to ensure that small local voluntary organisation can get through those custom border quickly because they be volunteer and they will not wait three four or five hour at each border the uk government need to speak to their partner to ensure that that do not happen we leave and drive through france belgium germany hungary and romania and arrive at the danube where we cross into ukraine the next day shahed drone attack the very same port where we have cross the danube that reflect other have mention this the importance of the fertile black sea plain which produce most of the world sunflower much of its grain and in kherson the world good watermelon the port be be attack because the black sea grain corridor be now closed we drive through the night from the danube to odesa have never see so many heavy good vehicle in all my life it make the route down to dover look like small car park they be there because the grain can not be take from ukraine by sea it have to be drive to romania or other black sea port and then transport on it be purposeful attack by the russians to try to close the port so that not just we in europe but those in the gulf the horn of africa and right across the global south do not receive this vital food it be an act of ecocide we arrive in odesa and meet the mayor gennadiy trukhanov who highlight the strike on vital infrastructure we visit the headquarters of local mobile telephone company and be show how the russians have strip out telecommunication the uk must do more to support ukraine telecommunications infrastructure because without it it can not progress the war or support the nation from there we travel to mykolaiv and meet the deputy mayor for infrastructure we see the devastation and the need for reconstruction we then go to town this be one of the most horrifying thing have ever see in my life call posad pokrovske in the kherson region where not single building be undamaged nearly every single building have be destroy what have be supply for the people by the international effort be effectively plastic box we go into one and it must have be in there they be horribly hot in the summer and they will be freeze cold in winter we must do more to support civilian infrastructure in particular housing in area that be occupy and destroy by russia but be now liberate brave ukrainians be live in their hometown without decent housing so much more need to be do some of the aid partner we go with be now committed to try to bring housing solution to they hope the uk government can work with they afterwards we visit renewable energy project wind farm there be an irony here in that half the wind farm be complete after the russian invasion just last week we have wind farm auction in the uk where nobody put in bid in ukraine however they can somehow build they in the middle of war it be part of ukraine security strategy and be not just about climate and transition it be easy to take out single power station but much hard to take out distribute network of wind or solar installation again the uk and other partner need to support and invest because this be not just about peace and rebuilding it be about the war effort now we then go on to kharkiv leed be in the process of twin with kharkiv be really proud of our effort and we will put our full support behind raise money and deliver for the people of kharkiv meet the mayor ihor terekhov the north of the city have be assault we visit school that be the same distance from the centre of kharkiv as my child school be from the centre of leeds it have be completely destroy and gutte and the child do not have adequate school facility we go to multiple block of flat which have be destroy in all location this be the case in posad pokrovske too we be tell you can not walk over there or over there because they be heavily mine people be live and child be play in place next to area that be mine at the rate the area be be de mine and at the rate of de mining in previous conflict it will take year or more to de mine ukraine that be just not acceptable in liberated area we need to step up and support the de mining effort because without de mining there will be no reconstruction we meet some troop from the frontline kharkiv be not that far from the frontline there be lot of talk about russian troop not be as good the chair of the defence committee the right hon member for bournemouth east mr ellwood mention wagner and say that russian elite troop be now no long on the frontline we ask the troop what they think of the russian troop they be fight they describe they as worthy adversary they be take nothing for grant they be on the battlefield risk their life we should not think that there be an easy victory here every inch of ground be hard fought and hard won after kharkiv we go to kyiv and as the hon member for filton and bradley stoke say to the yalta european strategy conference will not go into great detail about all the speech and meeting that take place but there be number of takeaway we have be hear more or less from the start of the conflict about the need to close the sky it be still be discuss we be only now in the early day of training pilot why be we not train pilot much early why be we not much far on know the uk do not have but the point stand the ukrainians be very grateful for the storm shadow missile from the uk but the missile they have be the export variant will not go into detail but to be able to prosecute within the territory of ukraine they need the storm shadow that we use because their range be great the minister need to redouble his effort and look again at our stockpile of weapon and what will help ukraine to progress the war quickly warn ministers that in kyiv the view be begin to set in the uk be not at the front of this other country be that whatever be ask for arrive but take too long be too slow and too bureaucratic and that the supply be to keep the war go and to ensure ukraine do not lose but not to ensure the speedy victory that be deep concern of the people in kyiv and the rest of ukraine who be progress the war we need to do everything we can to ensure rapid victory because the ukrainians be not just fight for themselves they be fight for democracy our way of life and our civilisation one of the most interesting speech at the conference be by timothy snyder yale professor who say that in the century bc athens be able to have democratic republic because it be supply with grain by the scythians in the black sea region now southern ukraine and crimea that be the history of the region without ukraine we all fail that be why we need to step up our effort on every front to ensure the war be complete and there be not single russian soldier on ukrainian territory it be real honour to follow the hon member for leeds north west alex sobel thank he and my hon friend the member for isle of wight bob seely for the work they continue to do to lead the all party parliamentary group on ukraine this evening be possibly the last warm and balmy evening of the british summer we be on one line whip and suspect there will be wine glass clink on the terrace it would be very easy to forget about ukraine be therefore very grateful for this opportunity to bring we together and ensure that we do not forget the people of ukraine freedom and democracy matter and it be in ukraine that the war between freedom and oppression be be fight out thank the minister for armed forces my right hon friend the member for wells james heappey for give we such detailed update on the current military situation sometimes it be difficult to think about the human cost of the war be look for some number because be mathematician although kyiv do not release estimate of the number of military kill there be recent estimate that ukraine have lose military personnel the number of those wound be estimate to be between and and more on the russian side as well human rights watch suggest that civilian have be kill of whom odd be child that civilian have be injure of whom be child that child have be steal from their parent and abduct many never to be see again and that woman and girl as young as four and as old as their have be rap and sexually assault when the invasion first start we say that russia must not be allow to win because we know that if that happen ukraine would not be the last that brutality that barbaric behaviour would continue time and again since the invasion russia have blatantly disrupt global supply line of food and fuel drive up inflation hike up food and fuel price and hit the customer and consumer in our own constituency but hit the world poor and most vulnerable hard there be no end to the russian evil so the uk have lead from the front through military support through sanction through humanitarian and military aid and in so many other way be very pleased when we lead the ukraine recovery conference go to reception at lancaster house afterwards and it be uplifting to see many of the ukrainian friend whom have make over the past year and half their face be normally so harrow but there be genuine smile because of what have be achieve during the day at the conference and the hope for the future it be great news that the uk will host conference on food security as well we must stand shoulder to shoulder for as long as it take the human cost as well as the infrastructure cost will take long long time to mend my constituency be home to blesma formerly the british limbless ex servicemen association which have be support male and female veteran who have lose limb since the aftermath of the first world war when servicemen lose their limb in the year of its existence it have support people who have lose limb in war and today it be support member who have lose their limb in british conflict in afghanistan and northern ireland and in handful of case back in the second world war blesma tell that in the period between the start of the war in ukraine and the beginning of the present offensive more than ukrainians have already become limbless in that year and bit in contrast to the who lose limb in our war date back to the president of the commission for the rehabilitation of veteran in ukraine it be long title have estimate that many many more multiple will be affect many multiple more will be injure and between and of veteran will have serious injury include limb loss loss of part of limb post traumatic stress disorder the human cost of support will go on for decade it be sad part of our own history that the uk have particular expertise in care for these veteran and be move to learn that charity such as blesma help for heroes and the royal british legion have already be lean in with support and advice for our friend in ukraine as other have say it be crucial that russia pay for the damage that it have do not just the physical damage but the damage to humanity be very pleased when the prime minister announce early this year that the frozen asset that we have in the uk would not be defrost or take out of that freeze until russia have pay we need to make sure that every pound and every dollar that can be raise for ukraine be be well use therefore gently ask the minister whether in his closing remark he can give we an update on what have happen to the chelsea football club money the million of abramovich fund which believe have still not leave the bank account to help with humanitarian aid think be possibly the first member to call for wagner to be proscribe so be pleased by last week news it have be very long time come over the summer have be more and more concerned about what have be happen in africa and across the sahel the civil war rage on in sudan where ethnic cleansing be continue in darfur and elsewhere that be important because we know that russia control the gold and we do not know where the gold from sudan be go we have see worrying military coup in niger be it coincidence that prigozhin be at the africa conference just before he die stir up malign activity again across that part of the world believe that russia like to cause further instability in part of the world that be already unstable the russians know that instability will lead to further humanitarian disaster and further migration and they know that that migration will put more pressure on western europe and western european ally the fact that the head of wagner may have die in plane crash do not necessarily mean that russian malign influence through evil proxy or the risk of that have go away therefore say to the minister please keep very close eye on that russian malign influence and the malign influence of other in that part of the world every day in ukraine military personnel and civilian face brutality and horror that be unimaginable and they react with bravery and fortitude that be incredible we must leave no stone unturned and we must continue to support they for as long as it take it be privilege to follow the speech of the right hon member for chelmsford vicky ford who give we heartrende reminder of what life must be like in ukraine right now be also pleased to follow the hon member for leeds north west alex sobel and other member who spend the weekend in kyiv at the yalta european strategy conference find it in fact offensive that the republican candidate ramaswamy describe as offensive the fact that we have professional politician make pilgrimage to kyiv say hat off to those people and think that that candidate for the us presidency would do well to make the journey himself on september last year the then prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss commit the uk to spend billion on military assistance for ukraine the expenditure in that year be the same as that in the previous year liberal democrats welcome the announcement at the time and we continue to welcome the fact that per head of population the united kingdom have be as generous in the gifting of materiel to ukraine as the united states have be will return to the subject of british military assistance at the end of my speech would like to talk about two specific thing today that be probably little bit operational in nature drone attack on russian soil and the supply of cluster munition then finally would like to comment on when might be the right time to move the conflict to the negotiating table this be russia war it be ukraine defence and it be not for ukraine ally and partner and not for the uk in particular to tell ukraine how to fight it but we have see couple of development since the house last hold general debate on ukraine in february that would like to comment on it be entirely possible that the drone attack in russia be the work of russian dissident in ukraine the level of dissent be difficult to judge from afar if those drone attack on russia be the work of the ukrainian government they would be legal as an act of self defence in accordance with the un charter but we have see how galvanise the attack on ukrainian city have be we need only think of the devastating effect of the various railway station attack in to imagine that if ukraine be to attack russian city it could have the opposite effect to the one that be intend what of the supply of cluster munition the united states announce in july that it would be supply cluster munition to ukraine we know from the use of cluster bomb in kosovo where serve that unexploded ordnance include cluster bomb kill many innocent in the year after the war include ten of child as the united states close ally it be our responsibility to speak out when we think our friend have make the wrong decision give that some in the us want to supplement the exist provision of cluster round for artillery with cluster munition for rocket system it remain to my mind the responsibility of the british government to speak privately but frankly we need to pledge support for ukraine for the long haul rather than simply offer munition that it be easy or convenient for we to give from our exist inventory on the sum of money that the uk should give next year it be an interesting coincidence that we see billion of frozen asset from the sale of abramovich chelsea and that the uk government be currently give billion to ukraine in military assistance in september last year the then prime minister the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss make an announcement about billion be make available this year that expire in april so now that we be in september once again it would be good to hear from the minister what sum the mod be seek from the prime minister and whether the ukrainians can depend on the same amount of money again may also ask the minister whether nato member be contingency planning for the withdrawal of generous funding from any one of our member so that russia can not wait this out agree wholeheartedly with the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin that russia could potentially be seek to do that we need to give russia absolute certainty that it can not simply wait this out and that the partner and ally of ukraine be in this for the long haul finally the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard dismiss the voice call for an armistice and negotiate settlement base on the current line and the current occupation of territory would go far and suggest that the reason for not accept such settlement be that the vast majority of ukrainians do not want it as someone who believe in liberal democracy as believe we all do believe that it be only for ukrainians to determine when the conflict be fit to be take to the negotiating table apology for my absence early madam deputy speaker and thank you for your understanding like other here spend roughly week in ukraine last week with two and half day in kharkiv kramatorsk and konstiantynivka which be also sadly bomb follow by two day in kyiv along with the co chair of the appg the hon member for leeds north west alex sobel to understand the change on the battlefield to see what be happen in ukrainian society and also to understand the ukrainian way of fighting and how it be evolve some of the russian change and whether there need to be some tweak to the support we provide the training and other thing that we can do want to look first at the ukrainian style of fighting it be always pleasure to listen to my right hon friend the minister for armed forces and he will probably be interested in this because as former serviceman he be use to the intense tactical battle in helmand and sangin and we be see something similar in ukraine if ukrainian way of war be evolve it be be form around creative problem solve and around strongly empower junior officer because they need to make decision there be real mission command culture which be radically different from russia with its intense hierarchy that effectively slow operation down massively there be volunteer culture and an openness about use external support perhaps unlike the british army at time dare say it which make up for the ukrainian army size the most obvious example of that external support and the volunteer experience be in the use of drone which be well document with commercial drone now be engineer for military work as well other example include patriotic businessman raise regiment have have the pleasure of meet few and the original use of commercial comms kit when be in an ops room near kramatorsk they be use gaming software to communicate with the frontline their mortar position and their drone position they have basically take the commercial gaming software use by the share gaming site around the world and be use it in battle there be very much an emphasis on what work there be also focus as be sure the armed forces minister will appreciate on the tactical battle rather than on large scale manoeuvre which can not be carry out because ukraine do not have air superiority and its force be face with kilometre of mine in front of they perhaps most importantly commander be have to fight in very economical style because there be not much kit long range missile be use sparingly even standard shell be fire back at the rate of maybe one for every five or sometimes one for every eight russia be still use between and shell day and we really underestimate the scale of resource need this be also about have to conduct assault while minimise casualty and it be remarkable how many of the military vehicle we drive past be medical vehicle it be quite upsetting at time have to assault while minimise casualty mean that the ukrainian force be not assault with traditional ratio they be have to assault effectively while be mindful that the russians can lose four people for every one the ukrainians lose if putin be give the option of sacrifice another russian life for ukrainian life he would take that because that would effectively shatter ukraine volunteer army so there have to be an economical use of force the russians be change and learn they be do it slowly but we should not delude ourselves that they be not do it would that anyone who want to know what be go on on daily basis and to understand the tactic of the war read the report by jack watling from rusi and the one from the institute for the study of war jack have say it be also important to recognise that russian force be fight more competently and with reasonable tenacity in the defence that be the critical point the hon member for leeds north west and have conversation with soldier who they be say that the russians be fight well enough they be not dismissive of their enemy because the russians be die in place if they be retreat it be control retreat they have depth of defence that they do not have last september this be big argument against tactical or strategic pause or indeed negotiation because every time the ukrainians stop the russians will dig more line see no evidence that collapse like the one that happen last september in kharkiv be go to happen again wish it would but there be no evidence spend about hour with unit call tsunami volunteer unit out of odesa with additional soldier from the luhansk area which be right over in the east of the country they be lovely bunch of people and be incredibly grateful to they for host we be in their op room km or so from the front it be very professional op room with lot of screen and drone screen and we be watch tactical battle as it be take place in bakhmut they be use gaming software as say to connect drone operator with small team on the ground in some place in these village and street where people be die in large number as have be happen over the last few month the soldier be metre apart normally at british shooting range we start at metre and go up to maybe metre on the ukrainian training ground mile or so out from the frontline they be practise trench clearance and do range shoot at metre because metre be probably what they be go to be up against in and around bakhmut and other area of the frontline because those frontline be so close together the command guy in the tsunami unit have lot of communication with the team on the ground to walk their mortar into position their drone and the base be communicate use gaming software there be lot of screen to strike the russian position with mm mortar reduce it to rubble they be watch for the splash every couple of minute adjust their aim until unfortunately well fortunately but sadly they kill the russian invader take no pleasure in say it but huge number of russians be die which be tragedy for they on so many level the russians fight until they be kill the ukrainians also take three prisoner that day one of whom be carry propaganda card explain why they be fight an argument be be put for why they be there during the hour be there with that one unit there be one ukrainian dead and seven injure we sit down with the commander and ask how much land have you take and what be your casualty rate we work out that man be die every metre or so they be fight and take back their country but every metre and certainly every metre on this section of the front man be give up his life for that small piece of ground and that be not include the injure one of the improvement in russian arm be the lancet drone which be now make in russia some of we go to see the head of the national security council on saturday afternoon and it be explain to we that there be bit of kit in that drone of which be still come from the united states and the west sanction leakage be still do damage to the ukrainian war effort and it be kill people these guy be rotate out every hour and we go to see they in the house they have rotate out to when the people we meet the day before go back to the frontline their soft top vehicle be strike by lancet one of they be kill one lose his testicle and two other be injure price be be pay there be no war weariness in ukraine but nor be there the early rush of adrenalin they have when the initial position collapse last september there be grim realism that this will potentially be long war and that ten of thousand more people will die even if we accept quarter of million russian casualty we have to accept that if ukrainian casualty go above it will have phenomenal effect on that society on the military convoy train that we take back from kramatorsk sit opposite lovely guy call volodymyr who be go back to comfort his wife because his brother in law have be kill on the southern front the week before we know that drone be critical and the russians be improve their drone will finish with few point about how we can maximise our positive influence the government be do phenomenal amount on which congratulate they have some mate who be involve in the training and be chat with they the other day they love train these ukrainian soldier so this be not complaint but suggestion for how we can train they little well minister will know from their experience in afghanistan that the optags the operational training and advisory group go out into the theatre and continually tweak our training every time there be change in the taliban tactic it would come back very quickly to the training programme that people attend wonder whether we can speed up our learning from the battlefield in the drill we be put these guy through worry that five week be not enough and know the armed forces minister would say that be what the ukrainians want and that that be how much time they be give we but wonder whether week or two extra with few more significant exercise build into the programme could help to keep more of these fantastic guy and girl alive look at that optag experience be there more we could do to get drone involve in the training exercise this be effectively tactical war of mm mortar and drone and sometimes big fat horrible artillery shell the problem be that we do not have enough drone in the british army and we do not have the commercial drone that could help if the armed forces minister be minded to do so wonder whether we could see how we can speed up our learning from the ukrainian frontline in the same way that we do with optag there be also question about whether we can far vary some of the special purpose course we be do for the special purpose unit will not say where it be at one of the basis that be host the ukrainians there be few little tweak but the head of the national security council also make wide point to about the desire for strategic relationship with the uk have listen to the armed forces minister it be very difficult to argue that we do not have fantastic strategic relationship and be mindful of the fantastic work this government have do indeed pay tribute to boris johnson know he be not popular with some member include on the opposition front bench but he be phenomenally popular in ukraine where people still see he as the man who help to make the difference whether the opposition like it or not the ukrainians love we partly because they be very grateful for what boris do they want that depth of strategic relationship and wonder whether there be more we can do across the board we have do huge amount lot of short term stuff and some medium term stuff but they complain that not enough minister come out they say that tel aviv get bomb more often than lviv people can easily get insurance to go to tel aviv but they can not get insurance to go to lviv be there more we can do on the insurance market know we be do good stuff on the grain convoy but we be not quite there yet the ukrainians be talk about want great strategic relationship they love this country and they see we as their close political and military ally although they know they be get more kit from the us just wonder whether we can formalise that depth of relationship for the benefit of both our nation not only in the short term but in the medium and long term too it be pleasure to speak in this debate thank hon and right hon member for their pertinent and appropriate contribution touch on all the important subject the key point come out of the debate be our strength of purpose as the minister illustrate in stand by ukraine each and every member have mention that thank the armed forces minister not only for his gallant service but for his clear commitment and for set the scene so well today many of we think that he would be call to high office which may still happen but we be very pleased to see he in his place and to hear his contribution the uk government have stand fast by ukraine and they have commit themselves to the military help that be need they have do so much and they have never be find want over the last few week and month have be somewhat concerned about the apparent weakness of the biden administration bear in mind that their overarching interest may be not only in help ukraine but in remind russia that it can not simply do as it please through our conversation and speech today we be encourage our government and the whole of the west to stand firm there must be clear message like other member care about the personal suffering of those man woman and child who be victim of putin they have lose love one lose their home lose year of education lose confidence and lose themselves care for those people who refuse to cower before putin demagoguery and for all the ukrainians who be defend their homeland their way of life and ultimately their freedom their battle for freedom be our battle for freedom too the job we have to do be clear have be read lot of commentary on the current situation in ukraine and be strike by comment in the telegraph outline the scenario if ukraine can not stay strong and bring putin to the negotiating table if anything like this scenario play out humiliate west will need robust damage limitation strategy this would involve build up nato force which still have not yet be seriously approach on either side of the atlantic there be no indication for example that germany be budget to reach the minimum nato defence spend of per cent of gdp despite promise the uk continue to make further cut to its undersized army second prong would be continue economic warfare against weakened russian economy to emphasise the price for wag aggressive war and undermine moscow ability to rearm that be the view of the commentator in the telegraph can not disagree with the fact that more do need to be do and that the country that be not step up need to do so to bring putin to the negotiating table not enough be be do to step it all up the hon member for isle of wight bob seely refer to an incident where one ukrainian be kill and seven be injure the one good thing if anything good come out of war be that because the healthcare and response time have be so significant and helpful many people who be injure do not die now as they have would have perhaps in the past the medical treatment be so significant that they live the medical progress have empower the emotional and post traumatic stress disorder support that be give be proud of our government homes for ukraine scheme and the fact that ukrainians have be able to come over and be safe here in my constituency and in other but also know that many of those have speak to want to have safe place back home some who be here will probably stay many other want to return home they want their child to return and they want to work in ukraine they want to go home and rebuild and they want we in this place to help they to do that so the government and the west have to be thank for their clear commitment to rehouse and to rebuild want to put on record my thank to willowbrook foods and mash direct in my constituency which have offer job and even accommodation to ukrainians and be among the first to make that available the ukrainians have integrate greatly into society in my constituency and be very pleased that the government have make that happen we need to encourage fellow nato country to change what they do to contribute more and to give the full commitment word have never impact putin but action do as nation and as full member of nato we need to increase the military equipment we need to act on behalf of not only the ukrainian people but the ideal of democracy and free world russia be not the only superpower that watch we the statement early today refer to china the chinese be very aware of the step that have be in the news over the weekend it be clear that the message that have be send be not deterrent it could should and must be as chair of the all party group on international freedom of religion or belief wish to comment on the evidential base come out of ukraine that show that the russians have persecute christians and those of the ukrainian church be member of the baptist church and my church and the baptist religious group also support many missionary out in ukraine we be aware early on in the battle for ukraine that some pastor have disappear from the eastern part of ukraine they have never be find but no action have be take to try to find out what happen to they we suspect that they have be murder simply because of their religious belief know that this be not the minister remit but must put on record my concern about those persecute christians and other ethnic group in the east of ukraine where russia have take over and systematically brutally and violently kill and displace many many people we have see attack upon the faith religion and church in ukraine and the theft of historical and church artefact again have great concern over where we be like other hope that the day will come when we can see the retribution and the accountability something in the process that make russia accountable financially physically and emotionally in every way possible so ask the minister to firmly outline how we be go to take even more decisive action that word be not enough and that the action that we take be the strong way of do thing the long term security of the free world will rest on decision take not just by our government but by nato as whole and our ally these decision must be take soon before putin and china decide to press on against what appear in some eye to be weakened west we must stand strong for ukraine and for the freedom liberty and democracy it have because the threat to it today be threat to we tomorrow call the opposition front bench spokesman thank colleague across the house for their consider contribution to today debate it be important that the house have the opportunity soon after the summer recess to debate ukraine and the egregious and illegal war against its people for as for number of member here today this debate be particularly timely like the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs the hon member for aldershot leo docherty have just return from kyiv come back yesterday have meeting there with senior ministers official parliamentarian member of civil society and aid worker and hear from many in the ukrainian military it be clear to that despite profoundly challenging summer of russian bombardment and the ongoing counter offensive the spirit of ukraine continue to burn bright the resilience and courage that we have see endure throughout russia year of aggression which we must remember start in or even before have never be more evident from the individual citizen to the soldier on the frontline during our visit we have the privilege to meet many who have return from the frontline it be pleasure to be opposite the minister who as say be also in kyiv that be illustrative of the unity in this house and in this country and our resolute support for ukraine against russia aggression of course draw attention to my current and future declaration in relation to the visit to the yalta european strategy conference and other event the title of that conference be the future be be decide in ukraine and it be clear that it be this be not just about the future of ukraine or of european security it be fundamentally about the future of the world and whether we want to stand up for democracy the rule of law the international system and the principle that have guide we since or whether we succumb to autocracy and barbarism we have hear some excellent contribution today it be pleasure to hear from my hon friend the member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard at the start who clearly set out the military need of ukraine which we must continue to deliver on with our ally we also hear important speech from the hon member for filton and bradley stoke jack lopresti who be there with as well and who talk about the importance of the uk training and the industrial support we must continue to provide from my hon friend the member for putney fleur anderson who speak about the importance of medical aid from my hon friend the member for newport west ruth jones who talk about the support from uk citizen which of course have be there from my constituent from the right hon member for chelmsford vicky ford who speak about the impact of veteran we meet many veteran in kyiv and the work of blesma which actually support my grandfather who serve at arnhem from the hon member for isle of wight bob seely who always give hugely inform contribution and be pleasure to travel with and from the hon member for tiverton and honiton richard foord and for strangford jim shannon however want to single out my hon friend the member for leeds north west alex sobel not only for the comment he make about the importance of deal with the delay face small organisation provide aid the issue relate to grain export the importance of get those black sea route open and the issue affect child and school but for his bravery and resilience in travel with number of other include people from across the uk who be provide critical aid to community that have be devastate by the russian aggression thank he for all the work he do on that visit take away three major reflection the first be that russia barbarism know no bound hear horrific story about what happen in mariupol story of torture and abuse hear of the horror of what have happen to child not just in the east of ukraine but in crimea hear about the false narrative about crimea and we meet special representative of the president for crimea hear about the attack on civilian which occur in the market while we be there and about the daily impact on the life of ukrainians be able to travel over to the left bank of kyiv with an mp lesia zaburanna who have also visit my constituency to thank uk volunteer support ukraine and meet ukrainian refugee we be able to go into some of the bomb shelter that ukrainians have to spend so much time in under those aerial attack and to see how child be able to carry on their education tragically they be do it in bunker underneath their school and they be have to do that multiple time in week also take away the continued strength and resilience of ukrainians the fighting be grind but there have be significant success in the south and the east work be be do to support internally displace person within ukraine in place such as bakhmut and elsewhere and ukrainians who be already struggle be give support to other who have be displace in ukraine it be whole country effort lastly take away the fact that our support be make critical difference whether we be talk about individual aid convoy government to government support which we in the official opposition fully back or the crucial diplomatic support that we be provide on so many level to maintain the coalition underline labour endure support for the people of ukraine and our unshakeable commitment to they and the wide nato alliance and to all those face the consequence of the war if labour government be elect there would be no change in provide the necessary economic diplomatic and military support to ukraine and in support ukraine reconstruction add labour voice to the condemnation of the sham election that take place on friday in russian occupy ukraine we be in absolute agreement with the council of europe which describe the bogus vote as flagrant violation of international law we also condemn the perverse attempt at continue russification in the occupy territory that must be deal with as must this have be speak about number of time the illegal and utterly barbarous deportation of ukrainian child and young people into russia and the separation from their family want to cover few other issue in the remain moment in the diplomatic sphere the nato vilnius summit rightly underscore the strength of our alliance support for ukraine but there be still much work to be do as the secretary general say last month ukraine rightful place be in nato do the minister agree that once with our support ukraine have prevail in its war against russia invasion there can be no minsk iii and that britain should play lead role in secure ukraine path to join nato we hear the concern that the leader of the opposition raise with the prime minister about the declaration will the minister say more about that and why there be no specific mention of russian aggression which be plain for the world to see will he say what we be do to support president zelensky peace formula and how we be work diplomatically to support those aim secure ukraine future sovereignty and territorial integrity as have be say we do not want false negotiation when frankly this could quite easily be solve by russian troop get off ukraine soil the crucial united nations general assembly meeting be come up in new york what plan do we have there to far support ukraine in our diplomatic effort across the world and through the united nations on sanction and russian state own asset the minister will know that day ago we pass motion in the house relate to the government bring forward bill to seize and repurpose russian state own asset it be support across the house and there be day to go will he give we an update on when the government will introduce legislation to seize not just freeze russian state own asset and use they for ukraine reconstruction we have see the progress be make in the us congress and by other international partner so when will we get on with it significant concern be be raise about the circumvention and enforcement of our sanction regime lot of hard work have go into our regime but unless it actually deliver lot of paper and order pass by the house will be meaningless raise specific concern with the minister colleague the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office the right hon member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan who be responsible for the asia pacific region about grow evidence of the transport of russian origin crude oil be refine in third country and export onwards skirt exist sanction regulation into country that have sanction its direct import be sure that all member would find the possibility of the importation of russian origin oil irrespective of its constitution deeply troubling and recognise that that run counter to our effort to undermine putin war machine will the minister tell the house whether oil originate from russia and be refine elsewhere be reach the uk or our ally if so in what quantity and what will we do to close any such loophole similarly we also need to close any loophole that exist for steel and iron which have be raise regularly with and dual use item which be rightly raise in relation to the component use for drone when be we go to get on and prosecute people for sanction avoidance find it hard to believe give that the office of foreign assets control in the us have manage to clamp down with number of sanction bust measure for individual company that we do not seem to have do any of that in this country we continue to support special tribunal for the crime of aggression will the minister say more on that we be member of the core working group but our support appear to be tentative when be we go to get on and move that forward the ukraine reconstruction conference be an excellent event be pleased to be there many of we

not think many people would bet against they as say want to look back at the history of the game give that the scottish fa be celebrate its anniversary it be of course form in but football have be play in scotland as far back as the century when the public play royalty at that time and for many decade football be prohibit under the football act it be feel that the game interrupt the man marital

debate he be absolutely right that we all celebrate football whether it be scottish football or football all around the world and as northern ireland supporter do as well as an avid rangers fan as the hon gentleman know can only take my hat off to the team that make up tremendous sporting section know that the scottish fa have be in place for year along with other rangers fan and indeed celtic fan back home in the province will have one thing to say in one voice long may the scottish fa continue be very grateful for that intervention football need ball two team and referee an adjournment debate need an intervention from the hon member for strangford jim shannon so be glad we get that know that the hon gentleman sentiment will be well receive by everyone connect to the scottish fa scotland have great tradition of managerial success whether for home nation or club or indeed around the world the name stein shankly and ferguson echo through history and scotland have be hotbed of managerial excellence for generation it be country that have create leader and innovator in the game with some of the world most celebrated coach and manager want to take short time tonight to remember the scotland manager who most recently take the team to qualification in world cup france be the last world cup tournament for which we qualify remember be at school and watch the first match against the holder brazil and craig brown an outstanding manager lead out the team with great pride craig brown sadly die early this year at the age of he be scotland long serve manager be in charge of game from to and qualify not just for that world cup in but for the euros in anyone who be fortunate enough to have play under craig brown or to have meet he at football match or after dinner event at which he speak so well about his career and how he help other remember he extremely fondly look up couple of quote from people who speak immediately after craig brown death aberdeen chairman dave cormack say he be one of those rare individual who be not only effective at what he do but universally love by all who get to know he gentleman who love his family friend and football one of brown great friend and colleague sir alex ferguson describe he as thoroughly wonderful man he continue when be give the honour of manage scotland at the world cup final in mexico there be one man have to take for all his attribute and knowledge and that be craig he have great career as manager of several club but his service for his country stand out in an industry that question man capability craig never waver in that situation he always keep his head and his composure he really be giant of our game and be sadly miss by many people across scottish football want to touch on another area because although understandably as scottish fan want to highlight and praise the current achievement of the man team as in many other part of the country the woman game in football have develop greatly in recent year in the scottish fa officially recognise woman football then in affiliate with the scottish women football association since the scottish fa have be responsible for the scotland woman national team indeed in they have their big ever win nil victory over lithuania the side have have significant success in recent year qualify for the world cup in and the woman euros in we have legend of the female game such as rose reilly truly inspirational footballer both on and off the pitch who have rightly be recognise at home and abroad for her outstanding contribution to the game close to home away from the national team have mention previously in the chamber the success of buckie ladies who win their inaugural trophy the highlands and islands league cup in only five year after have be establish what be so special about that club be that not only do the team perform at that level in the woman game but the club have pathway right down to what be so special about that win last year think it be at nairn county ground be that all the player and those in the age group right up to the full woman team join in and go along to see that cup final success on penalty it be great to see the team go from strength to strength also want to look at disability football or para football in the scottish fa rebrande its work in disability football with the new brand of para football the brand be create to allow great emphasis on the diverse work carry out by the scottish fa in this area of the game as well as to create strong voice for people live with varying condition in the scottish fa launch its new strategy call playability our game be the same which aim to create great opportunity in para football that will allow participant to reach their full potential also want to focus briefly on street soccer scotland which be announce early this year as the official charity partner of the scottish fa be fortunate enough to be at reception in the scottish parliament where we have presentation as part of the anniversary celebration look at street soccer scotland and the incredible work it do at the moment it be run more than project across the country and have register player on top of the player who have be help by street soccer scotland throughout its existence it be great to see male and female get involve in football both at home and abroad in the homeless world cup at which scotland have success back in and in the country that have be represent at both the male and female tournament it be great to see that of people say that the homeless world cup positively impact their life say it improve social relation with family and friend say their involvement in football change their life significantly and continue to play sport today because of their involvement there be many area would like to focus on tonight be grateful that we have little more time because the adjournment debate have come early want to look at the league across scotland we have the different area within the national game male and female disability and other area but the league be important as well the scottish league be establish in league close to home be the scottish highland football league many moray club have have success in that league in the past and be sure will do in the future include forres mechanics lossiemouth rothes keith and buckie thistle the league be establish on august in inverness workman club so as part of the scottish fa anniversary the scottish highland football league be celebrate its the scottish highland football league continue to go from strength to strength it draw big crowd for some of the big match throughout the season and it be renowned for its hospitality and for the welcoming approach that the club take to each other and to spectator of both club that be why it be so highly regard across scottish football and indeed renowne in many part of the world as well if may remind the house of my declaration of interest want to mention the referee who be sometimes forget about in the history of the scottish fa and other fa but not tonight when the debate be lead by referee sadly at one point there be joke what do you call scotsman at major footballe final the answer then be referee because when our national team be not qualify our referee be some of the giant of the game literally be the match official tom tiny wharton be an impose figure on football pitch around scotland and around the world highly regard as fifa match official fifa observer and the chairman of the referee supervisors committee in scotland for many year other name be also well know bob valentine jim mccluskey george smith and many other have make huge contribution to the game in scotland and abroad most recently when we be not qualify for those tournament that lone scotsman at the international tournament be likely to be hugh dallas he be at france four year later at the next world cup in there be no scottish man team but hugh dallas be there not just officiate at the high level in the world but for the duration of the tournament he be the fourth official for the final match germany versus brazil scotsman on the pitch at world cup final it be an incredible achievement not only for hugh dallas and his family but for scottish football in stuart dougal be fourth official at the euros william collum lead team of official include frank connor as one of his assistant referee bobby madden and john beaton at france again scottish referee at the top of the game at home we be extremely well serve in the referee department by referee observer my own association manager bill machray and many people outwith the limelight of the professional game on the tv every week who put so much into association training the development of new referee and mentor new referee referee be an integral part of the scottish fa and so too be our fan it be right that in this debate we recognise the incredible fan of scottish football both at home and abroad they say if there be no scotland there be no party so we certainly hope there will be good party in germany when scotland qualify the fan be the lifeblood of our game domestically and internationally must say that join the fan in be insult and disgust by the ludicrous proposal last week from the senior traffic commissioner for the united kingdom who suggest introduce series of draconian rule that would have impact fan go to and from football match the proposal be rightly condemn by those at the very top of scottish football by people from across the political spectrum and most loudly and passionately by the fan themselves who could see they would be an absolute mess and completely not require in our game those proposal be rightly shelve very quickly which we all welcome they should never have see the light of day in the first place but it be right that they will now not be take forward another area where many fan unite be the screening of scottish national team match on terrestrial television tomorrow night people will be able to watch on channel the match between scotland and england at hampden park but too many can only watch the qualifier on pay per view many scottish fan reluctantly pay their subscription to viaplay which win the right to the uefa bidding contract only for viaplay to say it will not continue with the coverage in the medium to long term it be vital that there be work do between the scottish fa and uefa on that and that the parliaments at westminster and at holyrood do whatever they can when mention this issue at the scottish affairs committee early on today the chair be very keen that highlight that the scottish affairs committee be look at it and seek to work with everyone to try to get resolution that will allow scottish qualifying match to be see on terrestrial television at all time also want to mention how important football be to family football be sport that bring family together and sometimes we forget about that we look at the big price pay by player and the controversial decision take on the pitch but we forget that this be sport that bring people together people take their son and daughter and go with their husband and wife to watch that yard screamer hit the back of the net to complain at decision that go against they or to be frustrate about lose game they never should have lose we see during the pandemic just how important the football community be to many individual and family it be often the thing that make people pick up the phone to their parent to discuss what have happen on the livestream that they be watch because they could not get into the stadium together we should never forget that the wonderful success we have have in football across scotland be down to fan and down to family anyone involve in the game at any level be do that for the spectacle it have become and continue to be it be so important that we recognise that involvement the hon gentleman refer to family and know that when my three boy be small one of the great thing we enjoy do be go over to the rangers match we go on the bus with ballywalter loyal rangers supporters club before christmas and after christmas the boy be small and it be one of those great family occasion that look back at with much joy and fun the boy have an education on rangers football club in the broomloan stand where the rangers supporter all unite and sing those song my boy enjoy it and those be memory for our family that will never forget be grateful again to the hon gentleman those memory last lifetime my own old boy watch officiate at his first match thankfully he do not understand all the abuse direct at and he have just start off his own interest in football at the mini dribblers at elgin city football club great community resource that will speak about in bit it be about be able to share that interest at an early age some family grow apart and people leave their home area but often the one thing that bring they back be the love of team of sport or certainly of success for the scottish team more generally as be the case at the moment another area that deserve recognition be that the family experience can sometimes be over an entire day not just from the kick off at or lot early or later depend on television and in many case involve travel the length and breadth of scotland to go to the match that go back to what the independent traffic commissioner be try to do it be sometimes whole day sometimes whole weekend travel lot to get from my home in moray to match across the country the people who be with for most of those journey be stuart cosgrove and tam cowan of off the ball which be describe as the most petty and ill inform sport programme on radio it be anything but it be entertainment tam be big motherwell supporter and stuart be st johnstone fan and they be both extremely well informed about the scottish game they get incredible guest on every week include kirsty wark lorraine kelly football star and many other they be part of the package next year off the ball will celebrate its anniversary there be no guarantee mr deputy speaker but we might be back here in year time have debate about off the ball mention it because sometimes we think about what happen on the pitch and between club but people be involve in whole process stuart and tam be motivate by try to ensure that the football experience be enjoy by all for certainly and for ten of thousand of football fan across scotland off the ball play an important part in that the last couple of thing will mention relate to grassroots football the lifeblood of the game in scotland and our facility it be fair to say that scotland be face crisis in football facility and for people play grassroots football now more than ever many community face the stark reality either that there be not enough facility to ensure that all level and area of the game be fully service or that in too many case young people be price out of facility many new facility get build by local authority and other but then simply become unaffordable often only the club that have money come in can afford they even if we do nothing else after this debate would like we to look more seriously at the lack of facility and availability in scotland and ensure that they be there for the next generation welcome the announcement by department for culture media and sport of million for facility and infrastructure development but we need to think smart about that grassroots football in scotland generate billion in social return on investment accord to landmark uefa study hope that the people who make decision about sporting facility across the country particularly football facility think ahead and spend to invest go forward that money will be extremely well spend if we have facility for our game available for all age in all community across the whole of scotland finally as be prepare for the debate contact the president of the scottish fa mike mulraney who take on the position recently ask he what he would say if he have the opportunity to speak in this chamber these be his word we be grateful for the opportunity to celebrate the impact and legacy scottish football have have on the game globally across the uk and in community across scotland my role as president be to harness that power of scottish football and to ensure it can inspire our nation football should be vital tool in the national agenda to improve the health and wellbeing of our society in that regard we be at your disposal ready able and willing to help the fight against poverty ill health both physical and mental and inequality in society ask that we pool our resource to ensure that this game be accessible to all with no barrier for that we need urgent investment innovative thinking and collective will football transform life football save life use our national game as valuable team mate in the challenge have outline not political football could not have say it well myself and think it right that the president word be hear in this chamber and record in hansard for the future for those who support club football can at time be challenging and frustrating but it be always always inspire it do not matter whether someone be male player or female player old or young play at home in the united kingdom or watch their team abroad or whether their game be on the local pitch or at an iconic stadium around the globe football inspire at every level for every generation scotland place in that historical and inspirational game have already be secure steve clarke and his man be write the next chapter in the history of scottish football let we ensure not just that we recognise the anniversary by celebrate the past and praise present success but that we prepare for the future to give young people in scotland the ambitious outward look prospect of play at whatever level they wish at whatever ground they wish and for whichever team they wish understand that over the last year and the next year the scottish fa have be and will be there to help and develop they on st andrew day in player from queen park football

experience rapid growth in the previous decade pay tribute to my hon friend the member for moray douglas ross for secure this debate so that the house can also celebrate those significant anniversary as register match official in scottish football he be possibly the only person who have ever endure the what can that come from be both politician and linesman can think of no well colleague to have secure the debate when scotland play that first fixture against england queen park provide not only the player but the dark blue kit which it then donate to the team for future use queen park be scotland old club it be establish in as an amateur outfit and remain so for year the club introduce new concept to the game such as crossbar half time and free kick all of which be later incorporate into the modern game queen park be at the forefront of develop the game so it be no surprise when andrew watson one of the most exciting talent of the join the club bear in guyana watson move to

soil in the early day of the fixture scotland be very successful until we dominate and it be rare that england win these day of course thing be bit different scotland win against the auld enemy our vaguely affectionate term for the english team have become much more seldom indeed we have not manage to pull off win in this century although we have come close in recent year we have not forget that harry kane have to score an injury time equaliser to rescue england at hampden six year ago when the game end in draw more recently be delighted to attend the european championship game between the two side which end in very nervy draw at wembley that be the first european championship for the man team since and the first major international competition since france the atmosphere that night be electric as tough scotland side fight hard against an english team fill with household name who would of course go on to reach the final of that tournament the scotland england match in recent year have be very close as resurgent national team under steve clarke have grow to become one of the most promising scotland team in decade we currently stand top of our european championship group have rack up huge win over spain and norway this year we be start to dream that this golden generation of scottish player can go far than any other in history and make it out of the first round of the euros or even the world cup although have probably just jinx any chance of that happen tomorrow night at hampden in the anniversary game we be hop that this scotland team can replicate the success of the side captain by andrew watson long ago naturally we would not dream of victory these day give the quality in the england team win would be celebrate just as loudly and proudly however the game go we be surely in for great night of football over the year these clash have produce moment of magic on both side we can not forget the european championship when gazza knock the ball over scotland defence and score one of the most memorable goal and do one of the most memorable celebration of the tournament or the famous game at wembley where an england team fill with world cup winner such as bobby charlton geoff hurst and bobby moore lose scottish legend include john greig jim baxter billy bremner denis law and bobby lennox be crown the unofficial world champion that day of course we should also celebrate the great success of our woman team they miss out on qualify for this year world cup but they do make it to the world stage in and qualified for their first major tournament in

chelsea erin cuthbert martha thomas of manchester united and numerous player for rangers glasgow city and celtic as we hear from my hon friend the member for moray the woman team be flourish and we look forward to see the prominence of woman football continue to grow in the year to come as future generation be inspire by the example they see of woman compete at the high level of football on the of this month the woman team will also take on the auld enemy and we will be cheer they on just as enthusiastically there be rich history of scotland england fixture in woman football too of course the first official international woman game in the uk take place year ago when england narrowly defeat scotland the woman game do not receive the support it deserve in those early day but thankfully that have change in recent decade at club level scotland team have also punch well above their weight celtic achievement in become the first british side to win the european cup be make all the more
