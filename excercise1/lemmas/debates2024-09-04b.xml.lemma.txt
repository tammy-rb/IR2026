chelmsford it be bless with beautiful park and flank river that wind their way through the city centre pass the home of the essex eagles at the essex county cricket ground we have thriving high street that attract shopper from mile around investment into the constituency from the public and private sector mean that its future continue to look bright from waterhouse farm in the west to chelmer village in the east and from springfield in the northern reach to the southern boundary of goat hall and everywhere in between be proud to call chelmsford my home and even prouder to be stand here today represent its constituent in this magnificent place chelmsford have one of the busy two platform train station outside of london have now rejoin the rank of the commuter know at first hand the importance of the brand new station be construct just outside of the northern edge of the constituency the new beaulieu park station will have significant positive impact on passenger from chelmsford give they more choice and flexibility and remove the need for many of they to travel into the city centre to commence their rail journey new station must not be see as job do however train travel in this country be expensive and complicated ultimately do not believe that the public care too much about who run the train they care more about how much rail travel cost they whether the train run on time and whether they be comfortable and efficient they be often frustrate by the bewildering array of ticket option whose detailed restriction seem design either to make they miss their train as they try to work out which one to buy or to make they buy the wrong ticket they be not design for the faint of heart or the novice traveller that seem like madness if we want to encourage more people to make use of public transport the whole system need to be simplify and be keen to see the legislation pass yesterday do just that without an economy that can support investment in new rail station or the redevelopment of junction include the major army and navy interchange in the centre of chelmsford we know that such project be in danger of never happen at all be pleased to support the bill before we today to ensure that the terrible wasteful fiscal mistake of previous government be not repeat leave more headroom for investment in our country future the new beaulieu park station be important to my predecessor vicky ford and pay tribute to her dedication to that project it be the culmination of more than decade of partnership work in chelmsford that vicky join after her first election to parliament in knock on door throughout this year campaign many constituent be grateful for her help with issue they have raise with she they also note her visible loyalty to her party as she be rarely see without her trademark blue nail polish to match her little blue car and an outfit that almost invariably include splash of blue thank she for the time she spend serve the chelmsford constituency from the very bottom of my heart thank the constituent of chelmsford who have place their trust in to represent they in this place know they do not do so lightly indeed it have take year of careful consideration for the good people of chelmsford to send to this place anyone other than conservative indeed it have be year since they make the choice to elect liberal to represent they that slow pace of electoral change in chelmsford may lead those not familiar with essex first city to conclude that chelmsfordians have little appetite for innovation but nothing could be far from the truth among other thing chelmsford have rich and distinguished history in the world of science and technology most notably it host the first ever entertainment radio broadcast in the united kingdom in from the marconi new street work right in the centre feature dame nellie melba that lead to regular entertainment broadcast from great baddow in the south of the constituency and eventually to what we now know as the bbc it be hard to spend much time knock on door in chelmsford and speak to chelmsford resident without come across someone who use to work for marconi its modern day successor teledyne locate little more than stone throw away from the site of the original marconi factory have more than take up the mantle of innovation in chelmsford many of my constituent be now employ there think of any space mission of the past few decade and the chance be that its imaging equipment contain component design and build by teledyne in chelmsford from nasa new horizons mission to pluto and the kuiper belt launch in to the plan launch of ariel by the european space agency to observe the atmosphere of thousand of planet beyond our own solar system teledyne and its employee be reach for the star that be what want everyone to have the opportunity to do to reach for the star to feel that sense of opportunity and to know that even the sky be not the limit but they can do that only if we invest and the very good place for that investment be in our child and young people we be lucky in chelmsford to have excellent school thank the teacher and other school staff who work so hard every day to give the child we entrust into their care the good possible start in life but they be increasingly do so with their hand tie behind their back with dwindle resource crumble building and ever great workload be the first in my family to go to university and the first elect to any public office let alone as member of this house have be able to achieve that because have have love and supportive family lot of incredible campaign volunteer and of course sizeable dose of luck but also know that critical part of my success be owe to the amazing state school education that receive the dedicated and inspirational teacher be lucky enough to be teach by throughout my school life and the extracurricular activity in my case largely music base that broaden my horizon and lift my eye to the star worry that that be not the overwhelming experience of those go through our education system today worry that child be go through the day with little or no food in their belly worry that school be have to cut club because they no long have the time or the resource to hold they and worry that the perform art such as music and drama have be see for too long by previous government as expendable and an unimportant luxury without recognition that they provide child with the skill and confidence to stand up on large stage dare say in parliamentary chambers and be hear if you be child with special educational need or disability well good luck with that because the system be utterly tragically devastatingly break but also take hope from the wind of change that blow just couple of month ago we know that there will be difficult choice ahead but my hope be that we recognise that invest early on and give child the good possible start can pay much great dividend in the future when guglielmo marconi bring his fledgling invention and experiment to the united kingdom in he do so because he believe that this be country that can see potential and will invest in that potential for the long term it pay off and whole industry grow from the humble beginning of short radio broadcast in the heart of my constituency whatever choice be make by the government in the loom budget it be my sincere hope that they recognise the importance of give school and teacher the resource they need to allow all child to reach for the star would like to commend the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman for great speech know chelmsford well it be beautiful town and commend her passion for support young people in school and their journey which be very important and something that we need to protect thank you ms ghani for allow today to make my first contribution to the house think it be right to start off by thank my predecessor as mp sir james duddridge for year of dedicated service he become mp in when southend east and rochford be newly redrawn the rural area to the north of southend have be bring back within the constituency for the first time in many year throughout many boundary iteration from southend east and rochford to rochford and southend east and back again you can see the creativity in rename the constituency the area have always be tory hold up until now be particularly proud to speak here today as the seat first ever labour representative the constituency consist of not just the city of southend but the village of great wakering canewdon barling paglesham stambridge and shoeburyness the suburb of southchurch and thorpe bay and rochford itself it be beautiful constituency rich in culture where you should bring your walking boot as well as your swimming costume it be the place where dame helen mirren go to primary school and home to the cliffs pavilion which host oasis in that might be tricky next time round depend on who can get ticket as southender be contractually oblige to mention that southend be the site of the long pier in the world at metre with the option to walk or take purpose build train make the mistake some year ago of walk it with my son he be little bit old now and he be up in the gallery my calf be struggle by the end of it from watch the maiden speech of labour colleague past and present have be strike by the nature of the local industry that be so often name check tin pottery steel textile and coal be among the staple product in historical labour seat those be noble and important good they be labour good but they be not the stock in trade of my own seat southend primary industry and expertise have always be tourism good time escapism and happy memory those be our export southend be city that allow people to meet sea turtle admire vintage car win large teddy bear and even have their palm read often during the course of single day it be place where past generation have go in search of freedom and pleasure and it be hard in today world to think of call more important than that indeed the musician billy bragg immortalise one of the road that take people to southend in his song trunk road to the sea the chorus name check shoeburyness and bragg later say that he hop his song would imbue the know this be bit of reach with the same romance as route in america the road to your dreams which run from chicago to los angeles that be lofty lyrical ambition indeed and it be always go to be hard ask but speak as someone who grow up in the east end of london in that era can confirm that the idea of southend always carry certain magic that be one reason why feel so privileged to represent the area today another reason be the constituency military heritage at the eastern part of my seat we find shoebury garrison an area steep in military history and in the north be southend airport which now serve holidaymaker but in past life be rochford airfield fighter base that help to fend off fascism during the second world war as former soldier be station in the southend area for short while one of my great pleasure when canvass be run into old army friend still live in the seat if they be prepared to open the door to for as someone who leave school with no qualification get into lot of trouble as young boy and need second chance night school and the military provide lifeline quite simply would not be here today in the mother of all parliaments without the opportunity that give and the ethos of service that it instill in to properly understand southend we need to understand its proud military history the city be build on unique blend the discipline and the dignity of the armed force be combine with the creativity and the freedom of the art place for both the soldier and the singer if you like but there be risk of get too misty eyed coastal area such as mine have be on the economic sharp end for or year the root cause of that most notably be budget air travel and that be not go away recent year have bring fresh challenge southend economy be at the sharp end during the covid pandemic the city be still in its recovery phase many of the jewel in southend crown the kursaal venue on the seafront or the freight house in rochford remain unused or underused be determined that these building will come back to life again as part of our future believe that change be afoot there be southend renaissance at work the people of southend be ready to seize the initiative and want more southender be strong independent and unbelievably hard work this weekend we hold city jam an awe inspire international street art festival now in its third year but we can not do this alone that be one of the reason why be so pleased not just to be southend first ever labour mp but to be one of many first time labour mps in seaside seat that we have never win before seat such as southend east and rochford need real and impactful regional policy too little thought have be put into how we build on exist asset and specialism to create sense of place and an economic centre of gravity southend east and rochford future will be find in modern technology modern infrastructure and green energy by identify opportunity in well pay modern job sector we need year round economy not just seasonal one so that young people can move from seasonal work into well pay position simply put southend east and rochford will need to regain its cultural capital this be something have some experience in have be one of the creative pioneer of east london creative industry my wife debbie and my

of the nearby hospital we depend on as woking lack maternity service however frimley park be plague with raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete and its future be far from certain will work with my hon friend the member for surrey heath dr pinkerton to press the government for solution to rebuild frimley park hospital another major issue be the cost of rent and mortgage as someone under just understand these issue deeply they have be raise consistently by local people on the doorstep the increase cost of mortgage and rent in the past two year be further reason why the bill be so important my journey into politic begin because of surrey county council failure to protect vulnerable child at the time it be rat the bad county council in the country because of that failure we can not allow vulnerable child to be fail again the wide theme of why be elect and indeed why so many of my hard work liberal democrat colleague have be elect be that we understand our community local issue have work for year in local government and serve as deputy leader of woking council have see first hand the crippling issue that some council face when look at the face of the liberal democrat mps here see people who have work hard in local government for year what glorious theme for this new parliament cohort of who understand the local issue our community face and force for good in the country and in the chamber when we need it most thank you ms nokes it be such great privilege to speak in this debate and make my maiden speech after the hon member for woking mr forster and for chelmsford marie goldman my hon friend the member for southend east and rochford mr alaba make fantastic speech about the city in his constituency which have have the great privilege of swim in his speech do due justice to that great place my hon friend the member for swindon north will stone make faintly terrifying speech about his brazilian jujitsu skill and he certainly do justice to swindon too it be great honour to speak in the chamber as the member of parliament for rother valley for so many on the labour benches in particular make our maiden speech be the conclusion of long and hard fought campaign in which we be ultimately victorious in the early hour of july which just happen to be my birthday we celebrate the end of year of conservative government and the first labour government of my adult life but we also humbly accept the responsibility that we have be give in the context of an often bitter and heated political campaign and from the thousand of value conversation have in my constituency one can not avoid the fact that we as country face daunt and urgent challenge we can not overlook the deep apathy towards the ability of politic and indeed this place to effect change there have be the rise of online disinformation blame bogeyman who do not exist conspiracy theorist and keyboard warrior purposefully ignore the complexity of the world around we for attention political culture too often thrive on division and controversy not the common good the hyperactive vitriolic politic see so often across the atlantic be seep into our discourse here undermine constructive dialogue there be an epidemic of alienation among our young people with level of self harm and suicide in my constituency increase all the time child be arrive at school still in nappy and too often without breakfast in their belly waiting list for mental health support now stretch to half decade with many young people reach their majority by the time they be see too many people in my constituency feel they have to leave their village or town to get on in life there be disillusionment that their home their community their place be no long offer the security and hope that people deserve there be fear for the future be tell so often during the election campaign what the point of politic this country be break perhaps some of those factor come to the fore over the summer recess when group organise to attend hotel just few mile from my constituency in wath plan to set that building on fire know full well there be innocent people inside the picture on our television be difficult to comprehend speak to young mother who have be make homeless and be be temporarily accommodate there with her child the terror she describe will haunt forever but from the gloom of that violent act come hope the day after the hotel be attack reach out to the muslim community in my constituency and be invite to meeting after evening prayer arrive eager to show solidarity but anxious about the fear and damage that the community would have suffer and yes there be plenty of concern but the first question encounter be not one of anger or retribution but instead comment urge to speak with the perpetrator of the violence in order to well understand the cause and motivation it be moment of great generosity and sensitivity and one that will always stay with indeed that spirit of togetherness care about the bond that unite we be everywhere to be see in the rother valley dinnington boxing club hold an event after the riot with several south yorkshire boxing club to show unity and togetherness determination to portray south yorkshire in different light that spirit run through the club will always recall have pint at the little mester in north anston when young lad from the club arrive to rapturous applause only to explain that he have casually run marathon that morning on his own wholly unorganised to raise money for local child hospice he have hear that it require more fund for toy think of the dementia café in winthrop gardens which provide such an invaluable service or the maltby lions who be out every week rain or shine to raise money for deserve cause think of the community café at the beautiful ulley reservoir the work of the salvation army at the dinnington food bank the community fridge in kiveton park the volunteer gardener in harthill the community energy project in woodsetts or the macmillan coffee morning in anston this spirit ultimately win the day even in the shadow of horror in previous life as pupil barrister sit behind prosecute counsel at the trial of the murderer of jo cox mp learn an awful lot not about legal process or criminal procedure but from jo family who arrive each day at court with smile hold hand and with bag of sweet that they offer to assemble journalist security guard and indeed the lawyer include the defence barrister take inspiration from their strength it be an honour to campaign for my hon friend the member for spen valley kim leadbeater in that vital by election and it be even more so to share these green benches with she today that spirit of generosity the strength of unity in the face of the dark force be what will try to further in my role in this place in that spirit praise alexander stafford my predecessor who be hard work mp and who leave the house as his brother arrive no doubt the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford will follow in his brother footstep in this place alexander will perhaps be well remember for his work promote the independence of somaliland and know from my own social medium that many in hargeisa be very grateful for his adoption of their cause thank he for his service let end by say that will work every day in this place to do my utmost to tackle the force of division and darkness during my time here and to do my bit to bring people together because after all as jo cox tell we we have more in common than that which divide we pay tribute to the hon member for dudley sonia kumar for her excellent maiden speech indeed we have hear more than half dozen excellent maiden speech today several of which touch on the climate crisis and the future of child in our country theme that relate to my amendment be touch to hear the passion with which all the new members speak about their experience and commitment my amendment require the obr to report on the impact of fiscally significant measure announce by the government on the uk statutory net zero target the justification for my amendment be that we simply can not separate the economy and the climate they be interlink to deliver the green economic transformation that we so urgently need as reference by hon member speak early every single policy must be align with the uk net zero target and every government spending decision should be as well it make sense to increase the obr remit on net zero to specifically consider the impact of climate risk on economic stability and how far policy introduce at fiscal event will reduce or increase these risk fiscal event namely budgets and spending review lock in what be happen in our economy for year to come even generation so it beggar belief that they be not properly take account of climate impact whether those policy be spend on new road subsidy and tax break for oil and gas investment in renewable infrastructure or giveaway like freeze on fuel duty they all have direct impact on the uk prospect of meet our net zero target those impact should be make clear and consider explicitly in the policy make paper we need to be think about the impact of today economic policy on the prospect for future generation the cost of fail to take an approach that consider climate impact be eye watering report by the grantham institute find that climate change damage to the uk be project to triple by and more than double again year later so climate prudence and fiscal prudence be one and the same thing give that the obr main duty be to assess the health of the uk economy and the sustainability of its public finance it need to be charge with assess whether fiscal event be reduce or increase climate risk to the economy bring net zero into the obr mandate be consistent with the government five mission indeed in announce its clean energy superpower document labour say that it will add net zero mandate to all relevant regulator that need it would argue that the obr be relevant regulator that need net zero mandate that be why be propose this probe amendment today as other member have mention it would also represent increase transparency around how fiscal policy choice be impact the uk progress towards our net zero target and help ensure that future government also consider that it be also an important step stone towards net zero test which would assess the aggregate climate and nature impact of every fiscal event again this be something that labour commit to in opposition in his wind up remark will the minister comment on whether he be able to ensure that this test be integrate into the legislation that he be propose hope that labour will use this opportunity to commit publicly to introduce net zero test in government and will take step towards do that by back my amendment thank you madam chair before talk about plymouth may celebrate the amazing speech that we have hear this afternoon and pay tribute to the wealth of experience and passion not just on the government benches but across the chamber it be really heartening my hon friend the member for rother valley jake richards speak about
