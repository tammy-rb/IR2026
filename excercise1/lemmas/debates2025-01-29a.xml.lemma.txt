be pleased to see the opposition spokesman give willing eye of encouragement for which be duly grateful start at the beginning clause will make it much simple to determine what law apply to an arbitration agreement currently the rule for identify the governing law be find in the common law and recent supreme court decision that decision show both immense learning and the complexity of the current approach the supreme court be split in its judgment and its approach be different from that of the court of appeal which use an approach different from that at first instance instead to make the law clear and more predictable clause provide that the govern law will align with the legal location that is the seat of the arbitration by default this will ensure that arbitration where seat in england and wales and northern ireland will be fully support by our law which be among the most supportive of arbitration globally clause codify duty for arbitrator to disclose circumstance that may cause doubt as to their impartiality this will codify the common law and align domestic law with international good practice such as the united nations commission on international trade law model law which our expert lawyer have major hand in draft the model law influence can be find in other jurisdiction as far apart as scotland and switzerland it will promote trust in arbitration by promote trust in the integrity and impartiality of arbitrator clause and in the interest of briskness clause will support arbitrator in make impartial and proper decision by extend their immunity against liability when they resign for good reason or be remove for no fault of their own this will support arbitrator to make robust and impartial decision without fear clause clarify the two pathway for party that want to challenge the jurisdiction of the arbitrator that want to question whether the dispute should be arbitrate at all the party can either apply to the court for an early ruling or it can wait until the award be issue and then go to court clause clarifie that it can not do both it be either or clause ensure that where arbitrator agree that they should not be hear dispute after all they can still award the cost incur up to that point against the party that generate those cost clause will allow arbitrator to adopt expedite procedure to dispense with issue that have no real prospect of success this align with summary judgment available in court proceeding and will make arbitration more efficient we move seamlessly to clause which will help emergency arbitrator emergency arbitrator be appoint on temporary basis while full tribunal be be establish that process can sometimes take week they be therefore very important to arbitration they be often task with vital preliminary matter such as preserve evidence or asset and be important to ensure that arbitration can proceed smoothly as the practice of emergency arbitrator post date the act our framework do not make explicit provision for they so look again give we an opportunity to examine their role clause empower emergency arbitrator to handle urgent matter well and ensure compliance with their direction by equip they with final order and court enforcement that will give emergency arbitrator the same pathway to enforce their order as other arbitrator and will enhance their effectiveness clause provide that court order make in support of arbitral proceeding can be make against third party which align with the position in court proceeding for example it would enable party to arbitration to get an order freeze asset hold by third party such as bank clause ensure that when party challenge an arbitral award at court the court have the full range of remedy available regardless of the pathway this clause iron out discrepancy that court and practitioner have otherwise seek to work around clause provide more efficient court challenge to the tribunal jurisdiction through rule of court that would prohibit repeat evidence and argument already debate in front of the tribunal that will avoid such challenge become full re hearing reduce cost and delay can deal with clause pretty quickly you will be pleased to know madam deputy speaker clause ensure that the time limit for challenge award be consistent across the act clause correct rare example of drafting error what the act mean to say be that court order could be appeal but in some case there would be restriction what it actually say be that court order could be appeal only where there be restriction to its credit the judicial committee of the house of lords spot this error and interpret the statute as it be mean to be read we have take this opportunity to correct the drafting to reflect the judicial ruling as useful bit of tidy up clause streamline the requirement for apply to court to obtain preliminary ruling from the court on question of law or on whether the arbitrator have jurisdiction to hear the dispute early ruling such as those from expert judge can save time and cost be get towards the end of go through the clause in fact have come to the last and final clause that wish to comment upon clause as you have probably work out madam deputy speaker because that usually come after clause laughter there be no clause so clause be the final clause clause repeal provision that be never bring into force simply to tidy up the act those provision would have mean slight difference in approach between domestic arbitration and international arbitration in the event they be never use or need never bring into force and there remain no demand for they our arbitration law be first class and apply equally to domestic and international arbitration so remove the provision be helpful way to tidy thing up in sum the bill will greatly approve the arbitral process in our jurisdiction and far cement our position as top global business destination where legal dispute can be resolve fairly and quickly the bill have already go through the other place where it receive considerable examination and support from noble and learn member include many experienced arbitrator there be apparently lot of experienced
