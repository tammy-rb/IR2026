society currently it be not reflective of society or of region like south yorkshire and sheffield do the minister agree that there should not be place in our parliament that be reserve purely for those from certain family as that only preserve the privilege of the aristocracy my hon friend be absolutely right the conservative party seem to stand for few thing currently and it be astonishing

stand up its emergency operation centre when flood forecast or flood incident justifie that this include when flooding may exceed the capacity of local response network to manage the eoc work in

week should know where the responsibility for those lie squarely on the shoulder of the conservative party it fall to we to clean up the mess we have inherit from the conservatives that you will hear more about when the chancellor get to her foot next week over the last few year we have see an increase in attack by foreign government on uk cyber security will the minister please update we on what step his department be take to ensure our public service across the uk be fully protect this be vital work for the government we have combination of legacy system with vulnerability and of course constant investment in new system to ensure our public service can work in the most modern way it be really important that we guard against either foreign state interference or other malign actor who would try to disable institution and disable public service through cyber attack that be an important part of resilience and an important part of protect service for the public good will my right hon friend tell what step he be take to keep scotland at the heart of the union and keep ayrshire economy grow believe that people in scotland have tired of the politic of grievance and division they expect government whatever their political colour to work together to promote economic growth get inward investment in get good job for people and have good public service would that not be refreshing contrast to some of the division we have have in recent year special educational needs and disabilities urgent question to ask the secretary of state for education if she will make statement on support for child and young people with special educational need and disability every child deserve the opportunity to achieve and thrive but at the moment far from every child be be give that chance today report from the national audit office be sadly bang on the money the system have totally lose the confidence of family family and child with special educational need be be fail on every measure and even shadow ministers have admit that they should hang their head in shame at the failure to support they our promise to family be that we be absolutely committed to regain parent confidence in the special educational need and disability system but that will be huge and complex reform there be no magic wand and no quick fix so we continue to ask for patience as we work as quickly as we can to make the change that know family be cry out for there be light at the end of the tunnel today we have publish independently commission insight that suggest that if the system be extensively improve through early intervention and well resource in mainstream school the need of ten of thousand more child and young people could be meet without an education health and care plan and in mainstream setting rather than specialist placement that can pave the way for sustainable system in which school cater for all child and special school cater only for those with the most complex need our plan include strengthen accountability for mainstream setting to be inclusive for instance through ofsted and help the mainstream workforce to have send expertise it be clear that we need to work with the teacher parent child therapist and council who for so long have be try but have be set up to fail by broken system this work form part of the government opportunity mission which will break the unfair link between background and opportunity and will start by give every child include child with special educational need and disability the good start in life thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question today national audit office report confirm what parent carer child and young people across the country have be tell we for year that our system to support those with special educational need

colleague on both side of the house have like be inundate with casework from concerned and often desperate parent who just want to know that their child will receive the support they need without wait for month or year the report make clear the urgent need for whole system reform with join up thinking across local and national government the nhs and school will the minister please give we clear timeline for the full reform call for by the nao will she consider liberal democrat proposal for new national body for send to support child with the most complex need to tackle the postcode lottery what step be she take to incentivise early intervention include training specialist for assessment and reduce the contribution that school have to make before they can apply for an ehcp what be she do to speed up the building of state special school give that local authority be spend staggering billion on independent special school be she press the chancellor for an urgent cash injection in next week budget so that we can start clean up this mess thank the hon lady for raise the issue and bring it to the house she be absolutely right to draw attention to the national audit office report and its damn indictment of system that have lose the confidence of family and be fail child with special educational need and disability she rightly call for the system to be reform that be what this government be absolutely focused on and determine to do one of the first difference that we make on come into office be move the special educational need and disability remit within the school report november vol correction our vision be one of mainstream inclusive education for all child who would benefit from it while have specialist school where we know that child with the most complex need can have those need meet that be not be deliver and for far too many family it be not the reality it be reality that we urgently need to see not only to address the local authority deficit to which the hon lady rightly refer but to create well outcome for child at the moment the system cost the treasury significant amount the hon lady tempt into anticipate next week budget statement or make announcement ahead of it which she know can not but she be right to identify that the system cost an increase amount but be not deliver the outcome that child deserve and family want we be absolutely determined to reform the system we be work at pace all the change that we have make since come into office be to that end we have launch the curriculum and assessment review which will support broad and inclusive education for all child we have make change to ofsted those change be continue at pace to ensure that the system take into account the whole school life and journey that include create an inclusive environment for child with special educational need most of all we be determined to restore parent trust that in our education system if their child have special educational need they will be identify early we know that early identification be key and support we be continue to support early language and speech intervention and to prioritise the roll out of special educational need training for the early year workforce to ensure that child need can be identify at the early point we be expand our childcare system to ensure that more child can get into setting as early as possible so any need can be identify and so we can rebuild the public trust that every child in our state sector will get the opportunity of fantastic education regardless of any additional special educational need or disability call the chair of the select committee on education the national audit office report could not be clear child and young people and their family be be fail by send system that can not meet their need and local authority be be drive to the edge of financial precipice by billion funding gap this government have inherit an appalling legacy the government be clear that their focus be on the early identification of need and the inclusivity of mainstream school but the report note that there be currently no process or funding to support early identification and no specific funding or ofsted measure on send support or inclusivity can the minister say more about how the government will provide the resource and the lever of accountability to address the scale of the crisis order can member please all look to the chair you be speak to not the minister look to the chair so can hear and then can help minister you can be good example for everybody welcome my hon friend to her position as chair of the education committee which know will undertake vital work scrutinise the government approach on this issue and on many other we know that wide change be need which be why we have start to make improvement as quickly as possible the change that outline to the hon member for twickenham munira wilson amount to whole system change to ensure that the inclusive mainstream education that the national audit office have identify will provide the education that many child deserve but be not currently receive however it will take time and we will not be make promise that we can not keep there be some thing that we can move on very quickly but there be other that will take time to show the change that the nao report highlight as be desperately need will take time so we ask for patience while we make these incredibly urgent change call the shadow minister be grateful to the hon member for twickenham munira wilson for secure this urgent question the opposition welcome the nao report every hon member will regularly be deal with constituent send case the grow demand be why we put major increase in funding in place to ensure that child get the support they need the last government work with the sector on comprehensive reform but since the election we have hear very little from this government about their plan for reform we look for more clarity and we certainly support great inclusivity with too much variation in the system and parent often have to battle for support do the government plan to continue with the conservatives national standard and bring forward standardised approach to ehcp more than pupil with special educational need be educate at independent school without ehcp how do the minister think hit those pupil with education tax with more pupil move into the state sector as result will help pressure on school what assessment have she make of the increase in ehcp application that that will generate put further burden on local authority can she confirm that the axe that the education secretary be hold above free school do not apply to free special school finally council budget be under huge pressure so be the minister make the argument to the treasury to extend the statutory override beyond march or not as have say one of the first act of the education secretary be to reorganise the department to make sure that the send team sit within our school team and be not separate from it that speak to the vision that we have for reform vision for our whole education system to create the inclusive mainstream education that we know will provide the good opportunity for the maximum number of child and as far as possible keep child with special educational need and disability within the mainstream system with their friend that be why we have launch the curriculum assessment review we need to look closely at the key challenge to attainment for young people and the barrier hold they back from access the current mainstream education system we be work with ofsted to introduce report card to look at how inclusion can be reflect as part of how school be monitor by ofsted we be also increase training for early year provider we have extend the nuffield early language intervention programme to make sure that no child need be miss out and that every child can find their voice we have be very clear full reform will take time but nothing be off the table to make sure that every child with send can achieve and thrive in mainstream school we have also start legislative change the child wellbee bill will be introduce in the come month the shadow minister make point about private school end tax break on private school will help to raise the revenue to fund our educational priority for next year include recruit new teacher as he know the treasury be consult on plan to enable those change to come into force in january and on how to design those plan to make sure that no child with special educational need on an education health and care plan will be adversely affect on the question of free school the review announce this week relate only to mainstream free school we be start process with local authority and trust with the mainstream school that be in scope with strong focus on assess that need to make sure that school place be in the local area where they should be and that they align with our vision for mainstream inclusive education for every child who need it nearly of child in hackney have an ehcp and that be not account for other who have special educational need with school close we have an opportunity to create alternative provision the other week one poor headteacher tell that more than third of her reception class have special educational need most of which be not identify before the child start school clearly there be need for different vision will my hon friend meet and people from hackney or even visit hackney to see what we can do with spare school space to motor this change forward in hackney fast than be possible nationally thank my hon friend for her question she rightly identify the need to ensure that we have the right school place for child whose need be currently not be meet in the most productive way possible we be open to meet hon member to discuss where in their constituency this can well be achieve would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this far cambridgeshire county council be fail to meet the condition of the dedicated school grant safety valve agreement with only of ehcp be grant within the week timeframe the average in england be family in my constituency face huge challenge in ensure that their child education be not disrupt or negatively impact how do the government plan to address these unacceptable delay the hon member be right to identify those challenge in its analysis publish today the national audit office say that the current system be not work and not serve the need of child and their family in the way that it should we be move at pace to review the system in wholesale way and the change that have outline will support that in addition we will legislate to ensure that local authority can plan properly for place and admission in their area we want every state school regardless of how they be establish to co operate in ensure that place be there for the child who need they have outline whole range of change that will seek to address the problem that he mention be in no doubt that the labour government have terrible inheritance on send provision but child in my constituency of easington who rely on service provide by the tees esk and wear valleys nhs foundation trust face unreasonably long waiting time incredibly they have to wait up to five year for assessment for autism attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other related condition what step be the minister take to reduce those unacceptably long waiting list and support both child and their family during these lengthy wait for assessment thank my hon friend for his question reiterate that the government have inherit terrible legacy not only on special educational need and disability but on our public spending and the state of our public service overall the example he raise be good as it highlight the importance of work across government to resolve issue and help the family who need support whether that be do through the education system which my department be responsible for or through the health service we need to work collaboratively across government to address the huge backlog that far too many people face in get the support that they need can assure he that that be priority for we in the past two week have meet two family whose child be suicidal one of whom be nine year old the other one be commit to secure unit for most of the cause of their suicidal thought be their educational need not be meet by the education system neither of those child have ehcp conservative control west sussex county council be complete only of ehcp within week one block be the lack of educational psychologist do the minister agree that increase the supply of educational psychologist be essential be so sorry to hear about the case the hon lady raise she highlight very well the huge challenge that we face in address need in ensure that we have not only the inclusive mainstream education system that every child should feel they belong in and that provide the education they need but the mental health support that we know be sadly lack the waiting list be too long for far too many child and family we be prioritise investment to ensure mental health support and educational psychologist be available in school because we know how important it be to get the right support in place to help the family and individual affect and to enable school to address these need after today shocking report do the minister agree with that we need to rebuild the send system from the ground up my hon friend be absolutely right this change need to be deliver in conjunction with teacher family council educational psychologist and the health sector we need to work together to ensure support be available at every stage the system need reform and significant change we can not carry on as we be with this lose lose lose system which be let down far too many family be the government surge support to local authority to help they process and complete ehcp within the statutory timeframe my community be see significant increase in application because of the decision to impose vat on independent school have three send government members may shout but that be the reality my council face be ask for urgent support for those council that have to deal with these increase number we have be clear about our manifesto commitment and our approach in government our priority be to ensure that we have the investment in our school that we need in order to ensure that every child have the teaching and the school experience that they deserve we know that council be face significant challenge processing application and deliver for child with special educational need after year of system that have let down family and child and which the former secretary of state for education herself describe as lose lose lose this be the legacy we be deal with and the mess we be clear up but we be determined to do that for family and child who we know deserve well sadly today report confirm what many parent in my constituency of leeds south west and morley have be tell since long before the election the send system in this country be fail as secondary school math teacher know all too well that send provision be not up to scratch have see at first hand that after year of negligence by the conservative party parent and child have lose hope of ever see an improvement in the system follow the send crisis do the minister agree that although there be no silver bullet we must improve the send system and give people hope that it will improve order this urgent question will run until about am so if be to get everyone in we will have to speed up the question and answer want to take as many question as possible as this be very important subject to all of we thank you mr speaker it be understandable that huge number of hon member want to ask question on this subject we have inherit an appalling legacy of failure on this front we have prioritise the issue and we be determined to fix it but that will take time as hon member have recognise but we be move at pace to fix the broken system parent and teacher in north herefordshire tell how concerned they be that special educational need funding have stagnate for the last year while need have increase visit westfield school in my constituency which be in desperate need of capital investment it be allocate funding under the school rebuilding programme but the implementation of that programme have be very slow can the minister assure that she remain committed to the programme that it be on track and that she will amend the way that the funding system work to incentivise mainstream inclusion on the hon lady final question can assure she that we be determined to prioritise mainstream inclusion and to ensure that school be support we will have the framework in place to encourage incentivise and support school to do what we know will create the good outcome for the vast majority of child in this country inclusion in mainstream system where they can thrive give today report and the shocking and devastating impact that the reality have on child young people and their family what message do the minister have for the child and young people with send and their family in portsmouth north we recognise how challenging this situation be for family who be not get the support they need for special education need or disability we know that the system be break the national audit office report lay it out bare we be determined to fix this that be the message that want to send within five month of enter office this government will introduce vat on independent school with all the impact that may have on the state sector how long will we have to wait for an actual plan for send child rather than just political posturing around vat the change that we have set out and be determined to make all aim to improve the situation that we have inherit after year of neglect and decline under the previous government have set out at length all the change that we seek to make through legislation and the change we have already make to our education system to ensure an inclusive mainstream and high and rise standard and opportunity for all today report be damn but not surprising it be an indictment of the former government and their year of failure even today they shamelessly deflect and gaslight the very family whom they have fail independent send provision be grow in southampton itchen and across the country those place be need but council be leave at the mercy of market price and often when it come to residential care venture capitalist that be wrong do the minister agree that as part of whole system reform we must return to basic and that profiteer from send be the wrong approach will she meet and my constituent to hear what they want from this whole system reform my hon friend raise an important challenge that we be determined to address we want mainstream inclusive education in our state school system which every child should have access to and thrive in however we need specialist place for child with complex need when that be the only place where their need can be meet and system that not only well serve the need of child but be sustainable will take away his comment and that will be part of our thinking as we go ahead other member have ask about educational psychologist there be real shortage right now be the government consider enable other professional to undertake some of the assessment to help unblock the waiting list thank the hon lady for the constructive way in which she put her question will take it away and consider how it would fit into our broad plan to ensure that we have an education system that can meet the need of child in term of both their educational requirement and their mental health special educational need and disability requirement within broad health system that can meet those need as well far too many family in my constituency have come to in tear not just at the lack of support for their child with send but at system that seem set up to stop they get that support how many appeal be successful because they should have get through the first time around people feel they be be let down by the system so will the minister please ensure that our reform system will not make family have to fight to get the support that their child so desperately need my hon friend be right the system be let down family and child and create situation where not only be educational outcome impact by the poor response but too many family life be affect by try to deal with the system that be why we be determined to reform it the evidence show very clearly that inclusive mainstream school that meet demand will reduce the need for education health and care plan and the need for family to go through the process in the first place what additional resource will the government provide to worcestershire county council give what will undoubtedly be the profound and devastating impact of the government education tax the change that we be look to make to remove the exemption for private school will be use to fund more teacher in our state sector and create the inclusive mainstream education that we know every child deserve send provision in conservative run norfolk have collapse after year of adversarial mismanagement by the county council welcome the step that my hon friend have take so far will she commit to recognise the value of co production to ensure that send family voice be value and money be spend wisely we be very clear that this reform be journey that we want to go on with all those who support our child and family whether that be teacher school staff more broadly education professional health professional or local authority everybody want this to work well and we need to work together to achieve it datum for autumn and spring show that more than third of child with an ehc plan be persistently absent more than double the rate for pupil without identify send persistent absence be very complex issue and multi faceted approach be need to tackle the problem in the light of this damn report from the national audit office do the minister agree that we can not have parent face prosecution for the failing of the system how will she work across government to ensure that parent of child with send can be sure that their child will get the support that they need to attend school safely and receive the education that they deserve the government have inherit an absence epidemic in this country last year one in five child be persistently absent from school miss day every fortnight or more we know that strong foundation be root in attendance at school child can not receive an outstanding education that unlock opportunity if they be not in school recognise the challenge that the hon lady have set out it be important that we work together to create an inclusive mainstream education system that every child want to attend and feel they belong to so that those opportunity be unlocked for they as they should be for every child in this country thank the minister for her statement on this damn report on send last week the minister and the secretary of state visit my constituency we go to mount pleasant primary shin example of inclusive mainstream send provision in the state sector do the minister agree with and the teacher there that child with physical condition and disability could be refer for an ehcp by their gp much early so that they arrive at school with everything they need in place ready to excel in their education the visit to that school in my hon friend constituency be wonderful the school be one of many example of the provision of inclusive mainstream education we need such provision to be in school in every community and available to every child she rightly recognise the challenge of co ordinating between health service and education provision and the vital importance of those system work together to achieve outcome for child will certainly take away her specific suggestion and share it with my colleague in the department for health and social care parent in my constituency be not interested in what the minister think about the conservative party they may recall that ehcp be introduce under the coalition government they want we to work together to make thing well we all know that problem with ehcp have lead to tripling of cost for county council in the westminster hall debate that the minister take part in with recently she be much more constructive than she be be today and would like to believe that that be the approach that she want to take to these issue do she have timescale for the reform of ehcp appreciate the hon gentleman comment and will always work cross party with colleague to achieve the good for all child in this country but level the blame for the current situation at government only five month old can not be accept the inheritance that we have take on can not be underestimate we will continue to work on put right what have be fail for the past year and the department for education be move at pace on work to that end we will make specific suggestion for legislative change and for any other necessary systemic change in due course many concerned parent write to at the start of term because they have finally be give school place for their child with special educational need but have no transport to get their child to and from school will the minister reassure my constituent that we will take measure to ensure that every child with special educational need have reliable and safe mean of get to and from school transport to school be the responsibility of the local authority and family need to work with their local authority to ensure that they be not disadvantaged in get their child to school by transport appreciate that that be challenge our transport system too be in crisis after year of conservative government but we will continue to work across government to ensure that all our public service meet the need of family in the interim my hon friend constituent should work with the local authority to ensure that they get the transport they require for their child educational need zak be nine year old he be one of dozen of child in my constituency who have be fail by the send system zak be traumatise by his experience in an inappropriate school setting cause his learning to regress and both his parent to stop work oxfordshire county council have an accumulate high need deficit of million because of inadequate funding which have fail family such as zak have the minister press the treasury to increase that funding and maintain the statutory override in next week budget the hon gentleman tempt into commentary on next week budget in which can not indulge he speak both as parent whose child be badly fail in send provision under the last government and as an mp whose surgery have be visit on every single occasion by parent who be struggle not just to get an ehcp but to get from school the flexibility that match their child need say respectfully to opposition members include the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds that until and unless you have walk in my shoe and the shoe of your constituent you should show little humility and decorum in how you respond on this issue in the review will the minister encourage school to be more flexible in their send provision for child who need it order remind member that when they say you they mean and do not want responsibility my hon friend speak with great passion and compassion on behalf of her constituent and agree with everything that she say reiterate that what she outline be the epitome of what we be seek to achieve on inclusive mainstream education so that it can meet the need of the vast majority of child with special educational need and disability in our country child with special educational need in harrow face long journey to get to the school they need in order to deal with their problem something that the previous government recognise the three mps in the area on cross party basis the council and all the headteacher agree that there be the need for new special educational need school in harrow the site have be acquire but since the general election everything have go quiet do not expect the minister to give an update here and now but will she undertake to review the position and come back to the three mp and the council to ensure that we provide that school for the benefit of the child of harrow the hon gentleman be absolutely right to identify the current significant transport requirement to meet the need of child obviously the way that we wish to address that be to ensure that there be inclusive mainstream education available in every community for every child and we be work at pace to achieve that the special school be under review and we will report back as soon as possible what more can the minister do work with her ministerial colleague to ensure that integrate care board such as those in cheshire and warrington meet their part of the statutory obligation of week for ehcp my hon friend be right to highlight the need for the department for education the department of health and social care and all those work to provide the service that child and family rely on to work together to achieve that statutory obligation will take his question away and feed it back to my colleague in the health department would like to raise the issue of child be off roll and put into alternative provision speak as not only an mp but parent who this have happen to and have constituency meeting on saturday where it be the subject be the minister aware that child who be put in alternative provision be entitle only to hour week of education there be absolutely no way they can recover and go on to achieve properly on hour week ask the minister to consider how that fit with the new curriculum plan we be look at the system in the round which include ensure that we have inclusive mainstream education and make sure that school be require to work with local authority on admission and off roll so that there be the provision within community that child rely on where special school or alternative provision be require it be important to ensure there be an opportunity to break down the barrier for young people ideally the vast majority of child can go back into the mainstream system as part of that inclusive provision will take away the hon member specific query it be an issue we be look at as part of the wide system know from speak to family in oldbury oakham and other part of my constituency just what send crisis the last government leave we with even when child finally get their ehcp parent still feel as if they be have to fight for every bit of support that they need we can not fix that overnight but can the minister set out what step she be take to give family in sandwell some hope that thing will change although the urgent question today have come about because of damn report from the national audit office which lay bare the huge challenge we face in this area my main purpose in respond an opportunity be grateful for be to restore hope for family it be priority for this government and we be determined to fix it that should give hope to the constituent whom my hon friend serve on recent visit to school in my constituency it be put to that not all school fully participate in deal with special need child and my casework over the year substantiate that what effort be the minister make to ensure that all school participate fully the hon gentleman be right to identify that all school be part of solve this huge challenge that far too many child and family face that be why we have make change to how ofsted assess school change that be still in progress it be why we be carry out the curriculum and assessment review and look at attendance measure and it be why we be look at local authority co operation with school to make sure that all school within local area can work together to ensure that inclusive mainstream education be available for all mother in my constituency come to see her son have be off roll from mainstream primary school which she would like he to attend and offer only distant special school that be entirely inappropriate for his need she would like to know why durham county council be prepared to spend year on transport for her son to attend school that she do not feel be appropriate for he but will not spend the same amount on classroom assistant who could help he to be in mainstream school that be happen under rule introduce by the previous government will the minister meet to discuss this would be happy to meet my hon friend he have outline just one example of how the system be break and need to be fix parent and child in chichester have lose confidence in the send system with family effectively pit against each other and against conservative lead west sussex county council which this year deliver only of its ehcp within the week statutory framework do the minister agree that be unacceptable and will she meet and other west sussex mps to discuss this specific issue that west sussex county council seem to have the hon lady have outline how the system be break we know it be break we want to fix it and be happy to work with colleague across the house in order to do so so would be happy to meet she as she suggest this damn report will come as no surprise to too many family across oldham and saddleworth give that there be difference of nearly between send child be in education and training and non send child what be we do to ensure that send provision and support be available in foundation apprenticeship my hon friend highlight the fact that not only be the system create stress and fail far too many child and family but it be not create the outcome that we want to see for every child include those with special educational need and disability will raise the important point she have make with my colleague in the department of health who have responsibility for report november vol correction on friday afternoon alongside my right hon friend the members for east hampshire damian hinds and for godalming and ash jeremy hunt arrange meeting with parent governor and teacher at independent school they be unanimous that impose an education tax partway through an academic year will have disastrous impact on the education of every child but especially those with special educational need what assessment have the minister make of the impact of labour education tax on the caseload of ehcp and on the capacity of local authority such as surrey and hampshire to meet they the treasury will produce its impact assessment as part of the normal course of implement new taxation and the hon gentleman can refer to that assessment once it be publish have be work with parent of child with send for number of month now they talk to about their child experience in mainstream school and the fact that the support have not be what it should be even though they be look for an inclusive education for their child can the minister outline what support mainstream school might need in the near future in order to provide that truly inclusive education to so many child who have be let down my hon friend raise an important point it be right that we require school to provide inclusive mainstream education and that we put in place the force the training and all the support that be necessary for that to be deliver that be why one of our priority be to have more teacher within our teaching system to ensure we have the specialist teacher that every child should have we be look at training additional training support for special educational need and disability have already be roll out for the early year and we want to ensure all school have access to high quality training that support they to meet that need demand for ehcp for child in somerset have triple in six year and the county send budget be forecast to be in deficit by million in the next five year previously somerset spend on average per child with an ehcp but now that be so this be not about overspending it be about the increase number of child need help as start could the minister look at the current legislation which lack clear definition of which child should be assess or fund this ambiguity especially post covid have lead to huge and rapid increase in the number of child need support the hon lady raise an important point we will be look at the system as whole and at any legislation that need to be amend or bring in to achieve our vision for an inclusive mainstream education that not only provide education for all child regardless of their special educational need and disability but provide specialist place for those with the most complex need that can not be meet within mainstream education we know the evidence show that where those need be be meet within the inclusive mainstream education system the need for ehcp be significantly reduce last year alone my local authority of north east lincolnshire spend million send child out of area to special educational need setting could the minister reassure constituent across north east lincolnshire and in my constituency of great grimsby and cleethorpes that the action she be take will not only support local authority and reduce these additional cost but provide the kind of education their child need close to home my hon friend set out very well the vision that we be seek to achieve for all child the purpose of all the change we be make in our education system be to ensure that inclusive mainstream education be available to all child and that there be specialist place for child with the most complex need with more and more child require send provision the scale of the challenge be undoubtedly large the previous conservative government do offer beacon of hope for child in buckinghamshire with the previous secretary of state confirm funding for new send school in the county can the minister confirm whether those fund be still secure and whether buckinghamshire will still get that new send school as the hon member be aware we be look at the whole system in the round to ensure that we have the inclusive mainstream provision that the vast majority of child will not only benefit from but do well in and that we have specialist place where they be need we be work at pace to ensure that we have the right place for the child who need they as fast as possible draw the house attention to my register interest as governor of special educational need school the minister have rightly point out the failure of the sen system over many year but it be important that we recognise the herculean effort make by teacher and support staff in school and it be not those individual who have fail young people far to her answer to my hon friend the member for south norfolk ben goldsborough could the minister outline how she will engage with representative body of teacher and support staff in school to ensure that they be include in the rescue plan my hon friend be absolutely right we in government can not deliver any of the change we want to see it will be deliver by the teacher the support staff the education professional and the health professional in our system he be right to draw attention to their valiant effort in system that have be let down they and the child and family they serve we will be legislate to bring in the school support staff negotiate body to ensure that the support staff in our school who be the lifeblood of so much of what be provide to our child have their voice as part of the national conversation somerset have the third high rate of school exclusion and the second high rate of suspension in england for child with send do the minister agree with today national audit office report confirm that the government must develop whole system approach to ensure that the most vulnerable student in glastonbury and somerton get the education they deserve absolutely agree with the national audit office although it be damn report we recognise much of what it say and be determined to fix it and put it right in the way the hon lady suggest send be the single great issue face school in my constituency and have have far too many heartbreaking conversation with family who be not get the support they need do my hon friend agree that supportive early intervention and diagnosis be the single most effective way of reduce this demand and ensure well outcome absolutely agree with my hon friend early diagnosis and early intervention be know to significantly improve the opportunity and outcome for child with special educational need and disability but one of the big challenge in this space be the battle that many family face with system that be let they down and we be determined to change that special need education be underfunde by the previous government affect many family in my constituency know that the government have be leave with billion hole in the country finance but will the minister ensure that there be an increase in funding for send education in the local government settlement at the end of this year recognise the challenge that the hon gentleman raise he tempt into anticipate the budget statement next week but will say that we recognise the challenge that many local authority be face and be alive to those concern the adversarial system have cause such damage and upset can the minister confirm that she will look towards system in which expectation be clear and co produce and will she also look at the funding formula more generally because some place have far less high need and direct funding for student than other even though they have to cover much great distance my hon friend raise number of issue and fear we be run out of time to give they the response they deserve will be happy to respond in more detail in writing because she do raise some important issue that we be determined to address projection show cumulative deficit of over billion on educational balance sheet by and the override mechanism ending which will allocate those deficit to county balance sheet this be pende disaster for local authority and the report suggest that it will push into bankruptcy the report conclusion be that the send system if unreformed be financially unsustainable yet we have not hear meaningful plan for reform will the minister take this opportunity to commit to the national body for send that be include in the liberal democrats manifesto which will end the postcode lottery ensure funding for high need student and address the urgent funding crisis for local government the hon gentleman be right that the nao have identify that the system be currently unsustainable and not only be it financially unsustainable but it be not sustainable for the child and their family that be be let down the government be determined to fix this and be work at pace to do so whole of my constituency casework relate to send provision so recently issue public letter to conservative lead derbyshire county council express my deep concern over the state of its provision as many affected family feel voiceless what step will the government take to ensure that council include derbyshire county council actually fulfil their responsibility to child and family council be at the forefront of seek to meet the need of child with special educational need and disability and their family and they be be let down by system that be break and that the nao show be completely unsustainable so we will work at pace in government work with teacher parent school school support staff the health service and local authority to ensure that child get the opportunity they deserve devon county council project an overspend on special educational need of million that be explain partly by additional travel cost in rural area such as mine in mid and east devon the last conservative government threaten that such an overspend would put at risk the so call safety valve for devon how will the minister help enable good quality send support to be deliver close to home the hon gentleman be right that the solution to many of these challenge be to create inclusive mainstream education in every community so that every child can benefit from it and thrive parent want the good for their child school want to deliver the good for their child and local authority want to provide the good for their child but the system set everybody up to fail it be adversarial instead of be person centre and it actively incentivise bad outcome be pleased to hear the minister say that we need to rebuild the system from the ground up but do she agree that that need to go hand in hand with rebuild child and adolescent mental health service and improve the speed of diagnosis for autism and adhd will she commit to work with my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care to help deliver that my hon friend make the case very well agree that we need to work at pace to improve the mental health support available for young people to improve the availability of educational psychologist and to work across government include with colleague in the department of health and social care to ensure that we be unlock opportunity for all thank the minister very much for her answer to the question and for always try to be helpful movilla high school in my constituency have increase its enrolment from to pupil that be because staff have work hard but also because education authority support have enable the school to extend the special provision for pupil with autism to include and year old it have establish two nurture class in the mainstream do the minister agree that additional funding to create send unit within the mainstream for the pupil who need support be way forward will she consider that suggestion to make life well the hon gentleman be as always characteristically constructive in his contribution and thank he for that be more than happy to take away his suggestion and consider it as part of our wide reform of the system there be more than case in my constituency of child with special educational need and disability who be miss out on care and school placement and be meet the council about they tomorrow thank the minister for speak with this week about the concern of family can we make it priority to help local authority to offer these child the good possible placement wish my hon friend well in her meeting tomorrow we know the challenge in the system and they be lay bare in the national audit office report there be no shortage of will right across the house to get this right and to put the system right as we draw to the end of these question must reiterate that it will take patience because there be no quick fix to the situation we have inherit however we be determined to fix it and we will do so on an ongoing basis and as quickly as possible saxon hill academy in my constituency do amazing work to support young people between the age of two and with physical disability and complex need but for many of the student it be much more than school it be literally home away from home due to its sleepover club which allow pupil to stay at the school overnight one night week the funding for that provision be extend for two year in december last year can the minister assure that as part of the government send review we will look at sustainable funding for such additional provision my hon friend raise an important point we need to move to more sustainable footing in the long term and make sure that council can plan ahead that be something we be look at an entire generation of milton keynes child with send need have be let down by the previous government in addition the cut to local council and school have make the situation much bad particularly in respect of high level teaching assistant who be crucial to ensure early detection of and ongoing support for child with send in mainstream education will the minister ensure that the school support staff who do that important work be include in this essential review to support child in milton keynes absolutely be always very careful to say that we thank and applaud both the teacher in our school and the incredible support staff who not only support teacher in their role but ensure that every school can function and provide the opportunity that we know will enable all child to thrive that complete the urgent question but let say to all those in the chamber that think this be very important issue do not think there be constituency that be not affect by it thank to

than day of general debate so far yesterday we have regulation that would ordinarily be take in committee and business end early on tuesday we expect that at the end of government time in office but it be little early for this government to be run out of steam at this point in the parliament we have have new bills introduce we currently have only third of which have be publish or consult upon previously and those bills that be come forward be be rush the employment rights bill which have its second reading on monday have much of its policy defer into regulation to be debate in committee at some point in the future deny the full house the opportunity to properly debate those important issue when it come to the winter fuel payment regulation which we discuss previously we should have have the report of the social security advisory committee before we debate and vote on that important measure the committee have now finally write its report and it say that it be concerned about the take up of pension credit that the government forecast of fiscal saving have question mark hang over they and that we need full impact assessment which the government do not bother provide the committee

recommend change believe that the prime minister be in samoa attend the commonwealth heads of government summit will the leader of the house confirm that he will make statement upon his return next week understand that one of the topic under discussion be the question of reparation my view be that it be totally wrong to be demand money amount to as much as trillion for sin very serious sin commit hundred of year ago will the leader of the house confirm that it be her view and the government that it be totally wrong to entertain discussion about reparation in relation to thing that happen hundred and hundred of year ago believe that be the government position and believe the prime minister have rule out even enter into discussion on that topic quite rightly will she confirm that that remain the position of his majesty government finally ask the leader of the house to organise debate on foreign interference in election an important topic that concern we all and something that member on both side of the house have criticise understand that more than labour party staffer be enjoy themselves in the united states in the presidential election that be under way minister have claim that this be all spontaneous and have all be organise and pay for by the staffer themselves but that claim appear to put it politely grossly implausible now that it have emerge in now delete social medium post that the whole thing be arrange by the labour party director of operation sofia patel she write in that delete post that there be spot available for campaign in the swing state of north carolina and she say we will sort your housing it look to as though that be be organise by the labour party director of operation do the leader of the house agree that it be damaging to our national interest this be serious point if the govern party the labour party be organise interference or campaign in another country election interruption do she agree that it will make it difficult for his majesty government to deal with the newly elect administration in america if the other side win and that that will undermine our national interest do she accept that by engage in organise campaigning in this way labour be put party interest before national interest and will she organise that debate interruption order please do not need further comment be sure member be try to catch my eye but that be not the good way to do it join the shadow leader of the house in welcome morgan edwards to this place be sure he bring great experience from legoland that can be bring to bear in this chamber send my condolence to the family of geoff capes as child of the remember what legend he be and believe his shot put record be still unbroken take this opportunity once again to point the house to the call for view launch by the modernisation committee last week tomorrow new limitation on mps second job come into force the house will remember that before recess we vote to remove the exemption on pay advocacy role want to give members time to adjust to the new rule hence why they be come into force tomorrow that be manifesto commitment and we be determined to restore trust in politic raise standard and deliver on our manifesto commitment the shadow leader of the house again mention winter fuel payment gently remind he once again that we publish an equality impact assessment which we be not require to do but we be forthcoming with it we bring forward to this house do not think this would have happen under the previous government full vote on the measure and they be clearly pass by this place the shadow leader of the house ask about the prime minister visit to chogm can confirm that there will be statement from the foreign secretary next week about that and other matter and look forward to the right hon gentleman ask some question the issue of reparation be important and be glad that he have raise it we recognise the horrific impact and the understandable and ongoing strength of feeling across the commonwealth and other community about these matter he be right however that our position on reparation have not change at the conference this week we be commit to work with our commonwealth partner on the very pressing issue that we face today and look forward to the future not look to the past the right hon gentleman raise the issue of campaign in the united states and elsewhere note that he want full debate on that while also question why we be offer full general debate on other issue be not sure whether want that general debate or not campaign abroad happen in every election people do that in personal capacity as well he know this be bit rich really come from the conservative party its would be leader have spend week debate and argue over who would or would not vote for donald trump the former prime minister liz truss go to the republican national convention and spend her time there discredit the sit president order just to say those other be not mp by the way feel that it be bit rich it be for the american people to decide who their next president be and this government be commit and determine to work with whoever win that election the right hon gentleman then raise issue of business which will happily come on to today mark our sitting day since we win that landslide general election victory in that time we have introduce bills that be bills in sit day over half of our king speech programme have already be introduce remind he that that be way more than the coalition conservative government manage in the whole of which be the last time we have change of government we have pass our first labour act in year and make statement to parliament more than one day there be still much more to come and be sure the right hon gentleman want to know about it on planning border control education mental health crime and policing great british railways the hillsborough law bus and much much more he and both sit through the last parliament although other here do not we both know that at the end it really be zombie parliament clock off early on seven out of day in its last year the last government have run out of idea and could not agree on what to do and when so they do nothing they dither and delay on their own flagship legislation and we be get on with deliver some of the thing that they fail to do for example this morning there be the football governance bill which they long promise we have reintroduce it strengthen the position of fan and financial sustainability in the game we be deliver where the previous government do not what about the renters right bill which the previous government have long plan but never fulfil we have take it forward perhaps the most disingenuous example of all be martyn law the then prime minister promise to introduce it by the summer on the day before he call general election know full well that he be not go to be able to introduce it at all we have bring it in frankly we have bring more change to this country in our sit day than the previous government do in sorry sorry year if the shadow leader of the house really want to look at effective use of time he might ask what his own party have be do for the last few month it seem to have take three and half month to whittle five candidate down to just two not that anyone have particularly notice however it be fair to say that we have see few sign of life in recent day the conservatives have finally show bit of oomph bit of what it be all about to be the party of opposition they have take really principle stance to stand against the abolition of hereditary peer on monday visit keech hospice which serve many resident in luton north as always it be inspiring to see the care that it offer child and adult at their time of need but it be not without its challenge whether through time for debate or the new government nhs consultation how can we well ensure that funding for hospice care be give the attention it so richly deserve my hon friend raise an important issue that have be raise number of time during business question we want society where every person receive high quality compassionate care at the end of their life it be cry shame that the hospice sector rely so heavily on fundraising and voluntary support we will continue to work closely with the sector to make sure that it can survive and thrive go forward call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome the emphasis that the leader of the house place on the modernisation committee call for view be sure that many member have be sidle up to she and say as they have to would it be good if we could change this particular aspect of the way in which parliament do thing be pleased to be able now to direct they to the modernisation committee website where they can submit their own view and encourage they to do so also thank the leader of the house for present the business programme note that several day have be provide for the budget debate to which be sure we be all look forward although be not totally convinced that the shadow leader of the house and the official opposition be look forward to it if report in the medium be to be believe they have the opportunity to change the timetable for their leadership election so that the new leader might be able to respond to the budget but it appear that they be not too keen on that idea perhaps they be not entirely confident of their own ability to respond to the budget but we shall see what happen many of the question to ministers from member on both side of the house be regularly be answer with rather frustrating wait until the budget however while many of we understand that there be good reason for the fact that detailed response often can not be give ahead of the budget time be tick on and the season do not really seem to care about the government timetable winter be fast approach but our nhs do not have the funding that it need to fully support local health service accord to figure from the house of commons library follow work commission by the liberal democrats hour wait time at have be go up and up throughout the country be extremely worried about what that mean for my constituent and be sure that other member will be concern about theirs the royal college of emergency medicine have previously estimate that long delay lead to about excess death last year which mean that people have be die unnecessarily every week because they be have to wait too long to be see it really be matter of life and death and that be unacceptable yes it be another damn indictment of the last conservative government failure to get grip on healthcare in this country but it be what we do right now that really matter make no mistake it be choice and we can choose to fix this while the liberal democrats be call for wide funding boost for the whole of the nhs we can not keep lurch from winter crisis to winter crisis will the leader of the house call on the chancellor to create new ringfence fund order ringfenced fund that take account of the average emergency winter funding for the nhs order one of we be go to sit down and it certainly be not go to be the hon lady have already take three minute she should not start speak fast and more loudly just to try and stop she must come to an end now and do so very quickly thank you mr speaker will the chancellor set aside money to be spend on build up winter resilience and winter proof the nhs thank the hon lady and echo her comment about the modernisation committee it have capture great deal of interest in this place and encourage member to do as she suggest she be entirely right about the conservative party leadership race it be matter for the conservatives as to why they be not put forward new leader to respond to the budget but over the past few week we seem to have see fair amount of soft ball from the act leader and deputy leader during our exchange perhaps if they be not down in their own rabbit hole of oblivion they would have present someone well to come to the dispatch box next week the hon lady be also right in say that public service be in deep crisis after year of failure and under investment my husband be an doctor so know all too well that crisis face our nhs this winter as it have do every winter in recent year the health secretary have take rapid action to end the doctor strike which be cause so much additional stress to the nhs he have take early step to ensure that there be extra appointment and he be do huge amount of work to bring down waiting list and to foresee some of the winter crisis there be no doubt that the choice that will confront we in the budget will be difficult give our woeful economic inheritance but there be hope ahead we will get the economy grow again we will get that investment into our public service and we will fix the economy for the long term many of my constituent in battersea have write to to express concern about israel ongoing siege in northern gaza the scale of the suffering and loss of life be enormous and they be call on the government to use all their lever to take action include suspend any trade negotiation with israel we need an arm suspension as well as ban on all good that have be produce in settlement can we have government statement on the tangible action that will be take to bring an end to the awful suffering thank my hon friend for her question and she be absolutely right the people of gaza have endure month of this conflict and be suffer from catastrophic humanitarian crisis over hostage be still be hold by hamas in truly awful condition which be why this government be absolutely clear that the fighting must stop now we need an immediate ceasefire and the release of all the hostage we need much more aid and support to get into gaza and we need long term peace and stability the government be work at pace with our international partner to achieve those end and there should be statement on this matter in the come day call the chair of the backbench business committee thank you mr speaker be look forward to the magical word business to be nominate by the backbench business committee in future week think there be one remain member of the backbench business committee to be appoint which prevent we from meet so urge the house to get on with that may suggest to the leader of the house that it would be helpful if she announce the business to be hold in westminster hall at these session that would elevate the status of westminster hall debate today we have see the charity commission publish damn report on mermaids which conclude that the charity poor governance have lead to mismanagement that have serious implication follow the statutory inquiry into not only mermaids but other charity that look after vulnerable child could we have statement from the government about what action they will take to ensure that vulnerable child be protect and that charity do not mismanage the resource they be provide with thank the hon gentleman for his question too look forward to be able to announce business decide by the backbench business committee in future week he might want to have word with the shadow leader of the house about the importance of provide time for general debate and backbench business debate which he seem to think be not of interest to this house the government have provide time for some of those debate in the absence of fully form backbench business committee the hon gentleman make good point there be some really good debate happen in westminster hall next week include on online safety the funding of child hospice and the readiness of the nhs this winter number of issue that get raise in these session regularly hear what he say about the report into mermaids and will make sure that if there be not forthcoming statement he get response from the relevant department civil servant in the department for work and pensions have receive what can only be describe as derisory pay offer indeed individual on the low grade be be discriminate against can we have debate in government time to discuss the value of our civil servant and how we can address their wage term and condition will she urge the relevant ministers to get around the table with the public and commercial services union and try to resolve the dispute in my short time in government have see at first hand the exemplary work that our civil servant do every day much of the time they do it quietly and secretly and do not get the credit so it be great that my hon friend have raise the matter on the floor of the house it be up to individual departments to negotiate with their trade union on pay rise think the average award this year be but my hon friend be right that work together with our partner in the trade union movement we can end industrial action and support people get high wage and well working condition call the father of the house have serve for several year on the programme board for restoration and renewal the existential threat to this building be fire have raise on several occasion as know other have the importance of instal water mist system instal more fire door and make sure that they all shut this be such an important issue do not demand an immediate answer but will the leader of the house try to persuade the authority that rather than have endless debate on whether to decant we need to protect this building with water mist system the modern system be design so that they will not even damage painting but they could save the building all can say to the right hon gentleman be lucky he for sit on the programme board for so long in all seriousness the safety of this building and of the people who work here be paramount for the house authority for and for the speaker you and discuss it regularly mr speaker the right hon gentleman be correct that we must address these issue hope that he will continue to offer his advice and thought through the programme board in the come month be not sure whether his party will nominate he to do so but hope it will in my borough of brent the average private rent have increase by an eye water to month we have the high eviction rate in england and wales be inundate as be sure many member be with email about mould and disrepair the government renters rights bill be very welcome but do the leader of the house agree that we need to talk more about rent control my hon friend raise an important matter for her constituency she be right about the renters rights bill which have finally come forward and have its second reading under this government it be much strong than the previous bill it will end no fault eviction will give renter and tenant more enhance right than they have have in generation and will tackle issue with quality and mould it will be an important bill and be sure that my hon friend will want to get stick into the debate as it make progress through the house north lincolnshire council have just publish proposal for green growth zone which will help to revitalise the local economy provide engineering job and help young people to find route into the renewable energy sector as that appear to fit perfectly with the government growth agenda will the leader of the house arrange statement or preferably debate in government time on green growth zone across the country be pleased that the hon gentleman welcome the green growth zone in his constituency he be right to point out that this government mission to be clean energy superpower by be critical not just to reach climate target but to create the job of the future boost growth and give we the energy security that we so desperately need be sure that the topic he suggest would make for an important debate perhaps it can be arrange through the backbench business committee when it be up and run which will hopefully happen imminently if not will certainly look at his request the uk be right to suspend direct arm export licence to israel the use of which risk breach international humanitarian law yet it continue to deliver component via the global supply chain have ask many time whether the government will negotiate an end use agreement with international partner to end the supply of to israel in write answer be tell the us government manage the global supply chain sadly that do not address the issue can we have statement from the foreign secretary on what discussion he have have with us counterpart on end the supply of to israel from the global supply chain this government have take more action than many in suspend licence for arm export because we be uphold international law and we be follow the legal advice that we have receive that be why we have suspend approximately licence to the israel defence forces for arm that may be use in the current conflict and would be in breach of international law anticipate that the foreign secretary will come to the house hopefully next week with further update on the middle east in righteous echo of st matthew gospel the elimination of vicious violent criminal chris kaba remind we that those who live by weapon die by the same far to yesterday statement there be real doubt about the fitness for purpose of the crown prosecution service and the independent office for police conduct can we have debate on whether those organisation have become so infected by kind of bourgeois liberal doubt fuel virtue signal that they have lose the will to defend the law abide majority from criminal wicked minority the right hon gentleman will be aware that the home secretary come to the house yesterday and announce new step that we will take to protect our armed police officer it be welcome that we have party support for those measure some of which will be include in forthcoming home department legislation be sure that we will have ample time to debate they far then kinship care be vital where kid can not be with their parent keep they with family and friend where possible be often for the good in portsmouth there be estimate to be kinship carer like carol whom meet recently in paulsgrove however kinship carer receive less money per week than foster carer will the leader of the house allocate time for debate on pay parity between foster carer and kinship carer my hon friend raise an issue of great significance to many member of this house the role that kinship carer play in our society be often underestimate and undervalue we should all want to put that right our manifesto make it clear that every child should have love and secure home that be why we be determined to include kinship carer and other in the work that we be do to make sure that every child have supportive home among local farmer report abound that the government intend to cut the farming budget by more than million that be compound by the reality that the full farming recovery and internal drainage board fund have not be distribute despite the fact that farmer have face appallingly wet weather over the past few month will the leader of the house consider commit one day of the budget debate to food security and support our farmer we recently have debate in opposition time on farming and the important issue that the hon lady describe get raise here regularly this government support our farmer support our food security and recognise the difficult period that farmer have face especially with climate change that be why we want to support our resilience and ensure we tackle issue around climate change there will be ample time for these matter to be raise in the budget debate so encourage the hon lady to put in to speak the late ons statistic on drug relate death make horrifying reading the rate of drug poisoning death in be double the rate just under half of all drug poisoning death register in be confirm to have involve an opiate while death involve cocaine that be over more than the previous year and it represent the consecutive annual rise how can the leader of the house facilitate our come together as parliament with the relevant departments to produce grow up evidence base drug policy framework that be root in harm reduction which be long overdue my hon friend be right to point out the very serious and harmful effect of drug addiction and the number of death that it cause many of we will have be affect by such tragedy for our constituent or for our own love one the next health question be in november but the topic might also be suitable for consideration by the backbench business committee or as the subject of an adjournment debate right hon and hon member across the house agree that it be right that the house consider the issue of assist dying however many of we be deeply tear on the issue and want to look in depth at the practical moral ethical and legal consideration we do not feel that private member bill with only five hour of debate before we have to vote on second reading be the right vehicle the prime minister commit to government time on the issue so urge the leader of the house to introduce legislation in due course in government time and with proper pre legislative scrutiny and impact analysis so that if we be to take such grave decision we will have all the resource for do so at our disposal recognise the difficult issue that the hon lady raise and which many hon member be struggle with and consider such matter as assist die be matter of conscience that have traditionally always be address through private member bills because the government do not have view there will be free vote for government members there will be no government time but the second reading will get the same time for debate as that of other bills and there will be lot of other opportunity for these matter to be debate the hon lady could apply for other debate to take forward other issue but it will be matter for the house to decide and we will take it forward on the basis of what the house decide may add my voice to that of my hon friend the member for warrington north charlotte nichols in respect of the ons report release yesterday which show that death relate to drug poisoning have be register in england and wales once again the area of great deprivation have be disproportionately affect the north east region include my constituency be the hard hit every one of those preventable tragedy have an impact on family friend and colleague as chair of the drug alcohol and justice all party parliamentary group may draw the house attention to this public health crisis on which have table early day motion that this house note with alarm datum release by the office for national statistics on october show that record death relate to drug poisoning be register in england and wales in further note that the high death rate be again in area suffer great deprivation recognise that the influx of highly potent synthetic opioid such as nitazenes risk rapid rise in drug death and call on the government to tackle the crisis by commit to long term sustainable funding for drug treatment in the autumn budget and future spring spending review continue to implement the recommendation of dame carol black independent review of drug and accelerate the availability of naloxone the lifesaving antidote to opioid overdose will the leader of the house urge ministers to meet officer of the appg and treatment provider can we have debate in government time on this very important issue my hon friend be absolutely right to say that health inequality be inextricably link with all other inequality the trend be clear to see yesterday report on drug relate death should serve as wake up call it be absolutely devastating for any family for their love one to die in this way as the subject have already be raise twice at business question today be sure that there would be lot of interest if my hon friend apply for debate will the leader of the house join in wish the very good of luck to my hamble constituent jack jarvis an army veteran and his team david bruce and nutty edwards both from the royal marines and adam radcliffe as they train in my constituency for world record rowing attempt from new york to southampton in aid of the veteran charity head up can we have statement from the

fair also to commend the hon member for brent east dawn butler for initiate it do the minister agree that the celebration of culture and heritage as well as their accomplishment be something that benefit everyone in our community the strength of this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland have its foundation on our ability to be british and yet to be so much more completely

these be the shoulder on which many of we stand alongside bernie grant and my fellow ghanaian and great friend lord paul boateng they light the path for so many of we to walk down do not want the house to think be only go to mention those of ghanaian descent even though we make the good jollof rice do not let my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi tell you any different but there be one more ghanaian person must mention as always do in this month akyaaba addai sebo the co ordinator of special project for the greater london council who organise the first

member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott lord boateng and the late and very great bernie grant thank my hon friend for raise that and be glad she take the cautious path by not say that ghanaian jollof rice be not the good she know it be echo her point and will be pay tribute to those mp later in my speech the story we will hear this afternoon be our story we have come long way since the when we first celebrate black history month we celebrate the blazer today have mention the first black mother of the house the first black minister and cabinet minister paul boateng and baroness lawrence must also mention baroness amos in the other place who become the first black woman to serve in cabinet she be from my area the borough of bexley and inspire every day of course no one political party have monopoly on trailblazer know that opposition members will want to mention the black trailblazer from their own party and political tradition since the general election in july we can celebrate the most diverse parliament in our history make this house look and sound far close to the diverse community we represent such representation matter if the nation child look at our parliament and do not see woman and man who look and sound like they then they will assume that parliament be not of they or for they they will assume that the ruler be one thing and the rule something else do not need to tell the house how damaging that be to democracy or how populist thrive and democracy die it be not about tick box it be about ballot box say we have come long way and we have but the path of progress do not run straight and true progress can be reverse and set back social medium provide new platform for old hatred the scourge of racism be give new life through social medium each one of we face it every day online in our community too racism be real and the struggle against it be real it be not just overt racism it be also the damaging effect of racism in our institution it be the routine micro aggression that black mps and black staff face every day and the hateful language in part of our medium it be when the successful black business executive be mistaken for the clean when the qualified jobseeker be block because of their surname or when the political candidate be tell this seat be not for the like of you that be why this government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity as part of our mission lead government and why we strive for opportunity for all in education work public life and in every community and part of the uk believe that the government wide range legislative programme will start to address many of the injustice that scar our society the bill on equality in race and disability will introduce mandatory ethnicity and disability pay gap reporting for employer with over employee we will reform the mental health act currently black people be time more likely than white people to be detain under that act and over seven time more likely to be subject to community treatment order we must urgently address this issue we will also tackle the abhorrent maternal health gap in england the risk of maternal death be nearly three time as high for black woman and twice as high for asian woman as it be for white woman it be grave injustice that there be such stark inequality in maternal outcome and this government be commit to close the maternal mortality gap in so many other area the government be make change that will improve life early in my speech mention the windrush generation we have be call for justice

by black woman be testament to the arc of change that we have see that be no doubt in part due to the trailblazing of the right hon member for hackney north and stoke newington and indeed she would be our fourth female leader although there be another one available laughter you know what mean other member of the black or mixed race heritage community have join our benches and there be some we dearly miss bim afolami in particular make an important contribution in this place for our party as the minister say look at the chamber today and at prime minister question we can see the breadth of representation think it be fair to say despite where we be as party that there be more to do and we be all keen to inspire that work and to work together on it turn to the contribution in the field of sport people can just watch any football match to see black britons make their mark whether it be sterling saka or rashford these be household name in the english team although will show my age by admit that my favourite be ian wright as the hon lady be talk about sport and football it be only right that pay tribute to my brother who be premier league footballer bobby reid de cordova he be do an incredible job and be incredibly proud of he because of what he demonstrate not just on the pitch but in the community within which he have serve thank the hon lady for that contribution have brother myself of whom be extremely proud so get that there be something slightly less competitive in that relationship sometimes pay tribute to he and his work and above all his skill if we be talk about footballer can we remember people such as alex scott who be trailblazer for the woman game as well as those from the man game will be come on to that in my remark as former sports minister be absolutely focused on highlight the woman game and above all make sure that sport be not niche when it come to report on woman and their achievement that it be literally fair and level playing field so agree with the hon gentleman of course it be with note of sadness that we need to remember one pioneer of black sport alford gardner who die early this month prior to his death he be one of only two survive windrush passenger and he be recognise at the pride of britain award for his work establish the first caribbean cricket club in the uk as sports minister be keen to encourage representation and further opportunity particularly for football manager and to work with the beautiful game on those thing if you can not see it can you believe that you can get there still think there be more to do we rightly herald the voyage of the empire windrush as the start of the story when it come to truly understand black history in the uk thank the minister for her update to the house on what be be do to support the community there be one cohort that it would be nice to hear mention by the front benchers the black warrior who come to this country to fight in two world war and particularly to fight the nazis in the second world war commend to people on both side of the house with an interest in this subject the book the eighth passenger by the late miles tripp which prominently feature flight sergeant harry mccalla he be the rear gunner in his lancaster and fly dozen of perilous mission he survive and member can read about what happen after the war we need to salute in both sens of the word those people who come to fight the nazis hear hear little far on in my speech will mention some of that but have certainly learn even more from my right hon friend the hon lady mention the importance of the windrush generation and the windrush story to the start of the story of black history month my constituency be one of the most diverse in the country and long have be in the we have the big black population in london but our black history prior to the second world war be often forget do she agree that we need to do more to celebrate and to remind people and teach they about that long history thank the hon gentleman and think that point make the importance of today debate apparent we on the opposition benches and all mps in this house be so keen to champion our constituent and what we know of they and he have give we another great example to turn to our nhs of people employ in the nhs be black people indeed when face with acute staff shortage the government call on caribbean woman to fill those gap be work on hospital ward within year and by the two third of student nurse and midwife originate from the caribbean the minister rightly talk about health disparity and the massive focus we must have on they whether in maternal health that be raise at the birth trauma event just this week the menopause or in understand intersectionality professor laura serrant use she very moving poem you call and we come to point out what we owe to the generation of black people who come from overseas and have give and continue to give the good of their life and indeed their food and culture to this country as well as have really add to our labour market we know that the experience of black people in this country have be long and at time complex and difficult but we know that the more we learn and the more we work together the more that be change in fact the first black mp be believe to have be elect back in many will know the story of mary seacole and her remarkable role in the crimean war which we now understand and celebrate much more such an awareness as have be raise already in the chamber today be key as my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis say in our dark hour we have turn to our friend to support we and it be estimate that caribbean man step up and fight for britain during the second world war while half million africans serve in both combative and non combative role during the same conflict one long overdue narrative we must talk about be that million people from the commonwealth stand together against the great evil of racism that have ever be know and the minister allude to that in her speech as we know contemporary attitude have sometimes airbrush many black british story out of our history and our understanding so challenging and understand such narrative continue sadly to be very important while we accept and celebrate the progress it be very important that we continue to challenge any complacency and while we reflect on the change we have see we need to do more in fact appal racism and abuse be display in the euro final not that long ago and applaud and thank the charity and group that continue to stand up against this abhorrent abuse there be an opportunity with the online safety act to continue to work with social medium company to crack down on racist abuse and make it clear that it have no place in this country to conclude as minister in the government equalities office the department for work and pensions and the department for culture media and sport focus on young people and social mobility argue that their postcode what they look like their background and their network should never hold they back we should all continue to work incredibly hard to tackle racist abuse and make sure that we fix the long stand racial disparity so the minister have my support and my party support on this be particularly proud that when we leave office we have deliver of the action in the british action plan on racial disparity however as the minister say there be more to do look forward to the contribution of member in this important debate as we celebrate black history month in this house and importantly look to the future it be pleasure and privilege to take part in this debate on the floor of the house in government time for the first time ever thank the shadow minister the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies for her excellent speech it be pleasure to co chair the all party parliamentary group on woman in parliament talk about footballer raheem sterling be from brent proud brent boy as be rachel yankey and they do amazing thing in the community thank the minister for her move and excellent speech be sure the nigerians would disagree about jollof rice but will try not to get too involved in that as she say she be the first woman of ghanaian decent at the dispatch box remember that when stand at that dispatch box in and be the first black woman ever to stand there as government minister it be so moving and almost feel as though have the weight of history on my shoulder congratulate she on that and also on the windrush announcement that be phenomenal announcement and lot of people today will be very grateful for it would like to thank wendy williams jacqueline mckenzie martin forde and patrick vernon for all the work they have do on windrush reclaim narrative be important for this black history month because it be not about explain black history but about reclaim some of the narrative out there change some of the assumption always remember teacher say to at school do assume because when you assume you make an ass out of and when meet pam whose family own cotton farm in mississippi for over year be expect all these story about uprising and everything and she just tell about the entrepreneurship the sustainability and the fair pay be so enthralled by her story that purchase the shirt be wear today and thank my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen for help iron it the thing about business be that it be easy for someone to make huge profit if they do not have to pay people if they do not have to provide accommodation if they do not have to treat they fairly and if they can treat they as if they be nobody no one with conscience or any compassion would say that be good business model but six year ago in receive message as do everybody else in the country to inform that we have finish pay the reparation owe the message say the amount of money borrow for the slavery abolition act be so large that it be pay off until which mean that live british citizen help pay to end the slave trade be absolutely shocked when receive that message think will consent to my taxpayer money pay slave owner compensation the british government pay million which be of gdp at the time and that be now the equivalent of about billion this money be pay to compensate slave owner for lost capital associate with free of the uk budget so there be precedent for pay reparation for slavery it have just be pay to the wrong people congratulate my hon friend on her speech and must say her shirt be lovely she be make vital point about reparation and do she agree that while it be important that we look to the future we must also have that discussion about reparation because both she and be descendant of those who be enslave thank my hon friend understand that the prime minister have say we have to look to the future and that he be deal with year of corruption and mismanagement by the conservative government but we do have to consider reparation because it be the right thing to do this question make wonder whether it would ever be conceivable that this decision would be make today would we pay trafficker for their loss of trade would we pay pimp for their loss of trade it be ridiculous assertion so think to myself who make this decision and how be it make obviously it be make in parliament back then there be no woman no black people no people of colour it be just white man and they make that decision and we only finish pay nine year ago so it be still very current while the british government have not disclose complete list of the recipient individual and firm of bond relate to compensation for slave researcher at university college london have compile list of over current individual and group who have receive government payout relate to the abolition of slavery many powerful british family include current business and political elite in the united kingdom be among the recipient uncover by the ucl team so when we hear the argument that to make our money to make our million we just have to work hard and pull ourselves up by our boot strap that be not quite the full story that be why the narrative need to be reset and structure create in order to uphold white supremacist view need to be revisit and restructure thank my hon friend for her fantastic speech as she will know number of people be call for reparation include member of this house there be an all party parliamentary group for afrikan reparation of which she be member do she agree there should be discussion about the different way in which people want reparation to be pay people have hear about large sum of money and have get scared but they have not think about all the different way such as through environmental or educational reparation that we could go about repair the sheer imbalance of equality that we as country create by take part in the enslavement and trafficking and colonialisation of other country there be many different way in which we could support those we so seriously disadvantage and do my hon friend agree that everybody should come along to the appg conference this sunday october if they would like to hear more thank my hon friend for her excellent plug for the conference on sunday and will be there the thing about reset the narrative be that we have to learn we have to educate ourselves and there be nothing wrong in that there be also nothing wrong in change our mind there be nothing wrong in have one position and then learn something new and understanding for instance that reparation be not just about money and then change our mind slavery destroy the african economy it strip africa of its people and also strip africa of its rich there be narrative that africa be poor because of corruption and we must help these poor african child would like to change that narrative and say that africa be rich africa be rich in natural resource range from arable land water oil and natural gas to mineral forest and wildlife the continent hold huge proportion of the world natural resource both renewable and non renewable africa be home to some of the world mineral reserve of the world natural gas of the world natural oil reserve of the world gold and up to of its chromium and platinum it have the large reserve of cobalt diamond platinum and uranium and of the planet internal renewable fresh water source so want everybody to consider the narrative that africa be rich and it have have its wealth steal africa be also net creditor to the rest of the world as my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy say there be lot of big number be mention such as that trillion need to pay in reparation most recently dr michael banner dean of trinity college cambridge claim britain owe billion in reparation patrick robinson lead judge at the international court of justice declare that the uk should pay trillion for its involvement in slavery there be lot of figure and that be lot of money but at the end of the day some thing will be easy to compensate it be not just about money we could give back artefact and the body of freedom fighter and steal jewel and precious metal wherever they may be we could make good the land and sea ruin by oil spill correct the education of history compensate land and home owner and cancel the debt there be lot of thing that can be do to make sure we have reparation realise that it be complicated to calculate what be owe but we must not forget that in order for slavery to continue people put number on other people life people be sell for money if it could be do then it can be do now the first homo sapiens on earth modern human be think to have evolve in africa around year ago and it be fascinating reading about the different continent and about africa and the middle stone age and how they develop different tool and painting and where they come from it lead to write poem about be of the first one that seem to have upset quite few racist and say to they that they should not scroll through my social medium feed unless they want to get upset this be my poem so you want to see broken head bow and tear in my eye more fool you you do realise my strength be power by your lie you be the wrong one the violent one the weird one whereas be the choose one of the first one you see this skin be in this beautiful mahogany brown this skin you do like believe so why try so hard to achieve by burn yourself by the sun for there be no need because be the choose one be of the first one know be black and beautiful an african freedom fighter my skin be my protection and you my friend do matter because be the choose one as be of the first one so you want to see broken head bow and tear in my eye more fool you you have realise my strength be despite your lie no one should shy away from the truth even if it hurt and be painful slavery have always be wrong and that be why we have modern slavery bill which have start in the other place we should remind ourselves that know the truth be not the same as hate this be not hate speech this be love speech this be the way we right the wrong of the past and look forward to the future call liberal democrats spokesperson josh babarinde thank

breakfast in the tea room wish to pay tribute to godfrey and margaret secondly there be no doubt that anybody watch the debate will see so many trailblazer and people make history and it be fantastic

babarinde we have talk about historical trailblazer but we be all privileged to serve alongside trailblazer like he want to talk about another trailblazer it be such joy to see the parliamentary secretary cabinet office my hon friend the member for erith and thamesmead ms oppong asare take her place and her space at the government dispatch box congratulate she on make such an awesome speech we be long overdue see woman of ghanaian descent at that dispatch box think we can all agree what woman hon member hear hear we be surround by inspiration it be real honour to be able to listen to and learn from my hon friend the member for brent east dawn butler yes black fashion should be show at its good and in all its glory which be why be happy to offer my very limited skill with an iron today it have be privilege to hear the powerful contribution of colleague so far black history month be always time when know will learn something new hear something from different perspective and share fire and renew commitment to right far too many wrong yes black history month be celebration of course it be but black history have be scar by injustice sadly that injustice be not confine to the history book it be the live experience of many of our colleague and the people we represent if we do not act it will be the experience of future generation as well not only be these disparity not confine to the history book but they be not confine to one area of life from work to pay from education to health all area of society need to improve to ensure that we stop history repeat itself and ensure that equality be consistently aim for and one day hopefully in our lifetime actually deliver we know of many brilliant black campaigner who have devote their life to campaign for equality in this country from the bristol bus boycott campaigner paul stephenson and roy hackett to baroness lawrence but we also know that far too many have die wait to see the change that they need and deserve at least people who be victim of the windrush scandal have die wait for compensation for the injustice that see the home office wrongfully deny british citizen mostly from the caribbean access to work healthcare and benefit in the bad case people be threaten with deportation despite not only have the right to live in the uk but as have be mention play an integral part in rebuild our country after the war as the minister say our history and black history be intertwine the windrush generation should have be cause for gratitude not scandal and hostility commitment to re establish the home office windrush unit and appoint windrush commissioner be incredibly welcome but we also need assurance that lesson have genuinely be learn and that any future change to immigration law will ensure that we never see another iteration of the windrush scandal would welcome further detail on how the home office be work with victim to speed up the delivery of compensation to those who be still wait as my hon friend the member for brent east excellently outlined black people face inequality throughout their life in healthcare employment access to service and opportunity to name just few example that have be focus of the women and equalities committee and hope it will continue to be in the committee report on black maternal health inequality follow the release of datum show that black woman be more likely than white woman to die in childbirth worryingly the committee find that black woman be more likely to experience treatment that fall below acceptable level and lack dignity and respect and that the need of the patient be often ignore have be lucky to meet inspirational campaigner such as tinuke and clo from five more they continue to work with black family and healthcare provider to secure improvement but change be too slow in his recent review lord darzi find that inequality in maternity care persist note that black woman be still almost three time as likely as white woman to die in childbirth that be not to mention the racism that many black healthcare worker have report face in their job and institution it sadly come as no surprise to anyone that in any workplace if you be black you have to work much hard to progress and face additional burden and discrimination fear of discrimination can prevent black woman from seek support from their employer during time such as the menopause make it difficult for woman to access appropriate support or have their symptom take seriously there be double whammy of be an old woman and black woman and the committee find that as result of that intersectionality the difficulty face by woman undergo the menopause be compound for black woman in september participate in panel event organise by the labour african network discuss healthcare inequality in the uk be strike by many of the contribution but particularly by those of davina brown race ambassador in the gmb union declare an interest as member and leader in the area of empower black woman in the workplace she note that black woman face more criticism and insecurity in work than their white colleague in the nhs the large employer of woman in the public sector depend on the nhs trust black woman can be up to four time more likely to be involve in disciplinary proceeding healthcare be not the only industry where the intersectionality of gender and race mean that woman sadly face additional barrier to protection support and progress as have be mention black woman be woefully under represent in popular olympic sport such as swimming diving and cycling as be black man lead to vicious circle where child grow up find it hard to envisage themselves compete in those area as we hear from the minister if we do not see ourselves in other in position of power or success how can we envisage that for ourselves we must have strong pathway that specifically encourage black girl and young woman to realise their potential and follow their ambition in sport in football we see much more diverse picture many of the current england man team be from black or mixed heritage background however the way they be treat by the press and the public notable example be the player who miss penalty in the man euros final show the huge risk pose to those who play at the high and most visible level in woman football the diversity in english player leave much more to be desire be grateful for the football association investment in reach girl from diverse background include through its discover my talent programme however with black and mixed race player hold to much high standard of behaviour than their white counterpart and at great risk of online hate many of we worry how their future talent will be receive the music industry be another area where equality be desperately lacking in its report misogyny in music last year the women and equalities committee hear evidence that black woman be often overlook for promotion and have their qualification question how many time have brilliant black mp in this chamber have to justify why they be here be tell that they be in the wrong lift be confuse with other mp or even be hand handbag to carry would have hop that thing would be different in area such as sport and the art that be so much more diverse and so much young than politic but even there progress be far too slow datum from black life in music show that black woman in the music industry be on average pay the least and that they be pay less than white woman that be shocking but wait for the next one and less than white man nearly half of the black woman the group correspond with say that their mental wellbeing have significantly worsen in the music industry and fifth seek counselling because of racial abuse as result of the inquiry the committee call for section of the equality act which provide protection from discrimination on the basis of combination of two relevant protect characteristic to be bring into force as well as for the introduction of ethnicity pay gap reporting it be very welcome that the new labour government have commit to introduce both measure we look forward to scrutinise progress in the year ahead but any update the minister have on those two vital commitment ethnicity pay gap reporting and intersectionality protection would always be welcome that be where want to end on hope on the hope that thing will not always stay the same and that we can move forward together as charisse beaumont chief executive of black life in music tell the committee unless we break or tackle racial discrimination we can not really tackle everything else call ben obese jecty thank you madam deputy speaker be grateful for someone recognise the difference between and my friend the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde do not like talk about race do not like talk about the colour of someone skin with the innuendo that often accompany it not because it be awkward and not for any lack of pride or identity but simply because it be so rare for the context to be positive as well as because of the inevitable abuse from those on the left that follow any contribution from conservative members sometimes the distance between the two side of this chamber be far great than just two sword length my father meet my mother in when they be teenager he the son of the stool chief of apirede akuapem nana oboni ayim nyarko iii she white girl from west sussex who work in the local bank neither of they be toolmaker or work for the nhs but doubt that anyone will be surprised to learn that be not the cultural epoch of inter racial relationship it be hard much hard than anything that have ever have to go through they face prejudice that could never imagine but as one might expect they have the strength to persevere and be hugely proud of they because they be still together this christmas eve it will be year since they meet and they be still go strong they blaze trail that and thousand like have be able to follow they never ask for any recognition or be sure expect to receive any but they absolutely grizze it out and would not be stand here today if they have not last the course reclaim the narrative start with their story and other like theirs too often we talk about life as black briton through the filter of injustice we obsess over slavery and reparation over grievance and micro aggression over systemic and institutional racism we unintentionally drip feed an invective of nihilistic victimhood and exculpable underachievement and then we wonder why some find it so easy to look down on the black population and why some within it be so unwilling to do their share of the heavy lifting we risk reinforce they and we narrative that tell black britons that they be second class citizen we lazily accept media landscape that revel in promote the very bad aspect of black culture repeatedly valorise criminality and violent gang and exploit negative stereotype for commercial gain without ever really hold to account the company that happily do so it be one of the contribute factor to the milieu that feed concern around stop and search on the one hand and child carry knife on the other it be for all of we in this house to reclaim that narrative recognise that it be not the historic narrative that we be saddle with but current one to which we be voluntarily yoke we have responsibility in this house whether we like it or not to be role model for those who follow we we who have the confidence the talent or the simple good fortune to find ourselves in this place have show that race need no long be barrier to success we must recognise that reclaim the narrative start with those of we who be privileged enough to be visible representation of what be possible not through all black shortlist or well mean but clumsily implement push to increase diversity that inevitably come at someone else expense but because we earn it would never want to think that my success be in any way manufacture because somebody take pity on because be not white nor would want that for anybody else be black do not stop anyone from be select in rural conservative seat be the london mayoral candidate or run for the leadership of historically the most successful political party in the world be hugely proud to be british to have serve in the british army and to be here now on the green benches hope that other can feel that this country be one that they be proud to serve too generously will leave the last word to the labour party and in particular to the first black cabinet minister lord boateng on his promotion to chief secretary to the treasury my colour be part of but do not choose to be define by my colour for as somebody who do not like to talk about their race that be one sentiment that make the gap between the two side of the house little less than two sword length we now come to maiden speech from liam conlon congratulate the parliamentary secretary cabinet

her time and attention this afternoon have first meet at the ballot box in bethnal green and bow in it be great to meet here again at the dispatch box it mean lot to to raise this issue today on behalf of my constituent kelly and her family kelly be proud mum of three wife to devon and fighter after be serve with section notice by her landlord kelly and her family be force to leave their home she be determined to find new home in the private rented sector but face so many barrier one be that many landlord require she to find guarantor whose salary bracket be not one share by folk in her network another be that many landlord demand six month rent in advance for someone like kelly who receive universal credit have six month worth of eastbourne private sector rent in the bank to pay so much up front rent would disqualify she from universal credit in heartbeat despite pull out all the stop to find new home have be displace from their previous one kelly her three child and their stepdad devon have be back into the corner of homelessness into temporary accommodation until long term home can be find via the council or the private rent sector this accommodation be too small to cater to their aspiration and their need especially those of kelly awesome teenage son joseph this be combination that by its very nature be temporary and not secure accommodation that force family to exist not live and that could not feel far from home that be not fair have take up kelly case and my team and be work hard to support she but what find so extraordinary about kelly be that in the midst of unspeakable hardship she be so often zoom out and reflect on just how broken the whole system be and she have be tireless advocate for reform it week or so ago she say josh take to parliament and we speak about it up there day later secure this adjournment debate which enable we to do exactly that thank the hon member for secure the debate it be an important issue and agree that it be admirable for someone in such circumstance to pull out and see the big picture to add to that big picture in the borough of hackney half of which represent the forecast cost of temporary accommodation be million this year and there be eight primary school worth of child equivalent to of our population live in temporary accommodation be sure that the hon member would agree that the position be unsustainable and congratulate he again on bring it to the attention of the house could not agree more and will come to the cost of temporary accommodation later the hon lady know as well as do that the national audit office describe the situation as unsustainable it need resolution which be why today debate be so important on secure the debate call kelly share the news and she say in reply what need to be say be go to be say in the place it need to be say to the person it need to be say to you be the right person to say it josh it be therefore so humble to welcome kelly and her son joseph to the public gallery hope that be the right person that say what need to be say and that do not let kelly and family like her down with her blessing have share some of kelly story today she be just one of the family who be in temporary accommodation in this country right now that be rise compare with last year heartbreakingly more than child be live in temporary accommodation which be enough to fill classroom want to mention the plight of child miss from school there be massive problem with child go into temporary accommodation and simultaneously lose their school place because they have move out of the area or alternatively try to retain their school place in the hope of be able to move back to the area and then miss school for sustained period want to draw attention to that particular difficulty as far as be aware at the moment we do not measure educational outcome for child who have be in temporary accommodation would the hon member encourage we to start do that absolutely would encourage that there need to be more co ordination between local authority educational setting and health and care setting many have advocate for notification system in order to aid the knowledge of those situation so that they can be address the circumstance be devastating and we hear from hon member who have make intervention that that be the case in their patch too shelter estimate that more than two third of people in temporary accommodation have inadequate access to basic facility to cook for example many food bank include mine in eastbourne supply kettle pack because many family in temporary accommodation be unable to cook or heat the food that they get from food bank in any other way isolation be also consequence especially for those who be place in temporary accommodation mile away from their support network or where the rule of their accommodation ban visitor most shockingly accord to the shared health foundation analysis of the national childhood mortality database temporary accommodation have be contribute factor in the death of infant since we can not go on like this not only be that unacceptable on human level but as say early the national audit office have be clear that the situation be unsustainable for local authority especially mine in eastbourne in my hometown the number of family in temporary accommodation have double since that combine with our food bank become the busy trussell trust food bank in the country it distribute more food parcel per head than any other in the uk lead to my campaign to declare cost of live emergency in eastbourne it be the first place in the uk to do so and that unlocked emergency support for those struggle most the surge in temporary accommodation lead to the financial cost to the council jump from million in to the million project for this year thank the hon gentleman for his indulgence in give way again he be right to cite the national audit office excellent work to shine light on the issue do he agree that if we turn those many million spend on temporary accommodation into money spend on good quality affordable social housing we would go long way towards solve this problem the hon lady have crystal ball because she have again pre empte something will say later absolutely agree and commend her work in her former role as chair of the public accounts committee which know take deep interest in this matter cost in eastbourne have skyrocket in fact the council have say that of every that the council collect in its share of council tax be currently spend on temporary accommodation as result eastbourne borough council have be force to consult on incredibly tough saving decision to avoid issue section notice and the picture be similar in other council do the hon gentleman agree that the decision by the last conservative government to freeze local housing allowance for temporary accommodation claimant at rate be cause increase pressure on local authority such as mine in ashford there be lot of clairvoyance and telepathy go on here because will also refer to that matter later we absolutely need to consider what be go on with lha rate which have be freeze at the same level since different era the local government association say that local authority in england have spend billion on temporary accommodation increase on the previous year and since and one in four council say that they be likely to need emergency government support to avoid section notice so what be the solution first and foremost we must urgently improve condition for family in temporary accommodation such as kelly they should be entitle to essential facility and every effort must be make to prevent they from be displace from their community support network and the advice they need and deserve council need emergency support to help they to avert imminent financial crisis eastbourne borough council leader stephen holt who be also in the public gallery lead an emergency summit last year after which other cross party council leader write to the previous chancellor with proposal for emergency support those proposal fall on deaf ear so draw the minister attention to that letter now it include proposal to uprate lha rate with view to update they from their outdated level we also need to address the appalling practice of people opportunistically rent private rent sector home for the sole purpose of immediately sub let they to council at an inflated rate so they can be use as temporary accommodation that be contribute to the inflation beyond that the government must urgently publish strategy to end homelessness in all its form as soon as possible that must involve build more home especially social housing my hon friend mention that child be grow up in temporary accommodation do he agree that the health and educational outcome of those child be adversely affect by their be in temporary accommodation but the risk of move reduce their chance to have settle community and build up lifelong friendship by develop more social home with social rent we would be able to give people secure tenure and by remove hope value in development land parcel we could develop more and cheap social housing reduce the economic pressure on the government my hon friend be absolutely right which be why be proud that the liberal democrats have be campaign for britain to build social home year that be in our manifesto have grow up in social housing be especially proud of that commitment to conclude say to kelly that hope have say what need to be say in the place that it need to be say in and to the person it need to be say to on behalf of all family in temporary accommodation and all those who would otherwise find themselves there in the future make plea to the government honour their experience with reform and dignify their humanity with action please do not let we and our council down this government be our last hope thank the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde for give the opportunity to contribute to his debate congratulate he on secure debate on this extremely important topic agree with much of what he have say and how he have highlight the problem that we face my local authority of newham face an absolute crisis in temporary accommodation the situation be one of the bad in the country to give the house some indication of where we be there be household in temporary accommodation in newham which be more than in any other local authority that number be grow by around household month one in home in newham be now temporary accommodation the cost of temporary accommodation for next year will be million add million to the council budget overspend homeless application this year be up by which add to the borough waiting list there be now people wait for housing while chelmsford city council figure can not match those give by the hon member they be still stark it be terrible to see how much they have change over recent year do he agree that many council around the country face this issue in my constituency the percentage of the council core spending that go on temporary accommodation go up from in to in september the number of case in be but we be now look at case it be massive increase that be very difficult for council to cope with the hon lady make valuable point the figure be hard to believe sometimes have to check that have not misread they or add zero as she highlight the issue affect council across the country and seriously add to their financial problem this be clearly unaffordable and unsustainable even in the short term we desperately need support so that we can deal with the impact on council budget they face huge pressure already as the hon member for eastbourne point out through the example of kelly his constituent who be in the public gallery the issue be the impact on family since the cost of living crisis begin when the supply of temporary accommodation slump and demand soar in my borough my advice surgery have see massive increase in casework people have come to see we who have be live for month in hotel room perfectly decent hotel room for someone stay three or four day but not for family of four or five people for month on end they be live in single room without cooking facility the impact on the parent mental health and the child physical health and educational opportunity be really quite serious it be difficult to deal with the sheer number thank my hon friend and neighbour for give way be old enough to remember when bed and breakfast be commonly use for household who could not get permanent accommodation that be rightly deal with because it be scourge on modern society do my hon friend agree that we be now slip massively backwards because of the number he outline and that we need to find quick solution in order to support our constituent my hon friend be exactly right we have go back from people in temporary accommodation live in flat to hotel be the only option my council be desperately seek alternative solution but the sheer scale of the problem make that very difficult as fellow east london mp the minister will understand the problem and the issue that we face ask the government to look urgently at financial support in the short term so that we can try to deal with the immediate crisis but we also need long term solution financial solution to help council through these difficulty and long term solution way to build social housing my council be one of those pioneer the building of new social housing but in the grand scheme of thing we be effectively talk penny packet give the scale of the issue that we need to deal with appreciate that we inherit this crisis it have be exacerbate by the cost of living crisis and seriously exacerbate by the difficulty that council have face as result of the funding settlement that they have have over the past year they be juggle year of austerity and the cost of these problem however it be crisis that we have to deal with be confident that we can but it be clearly something that we have to tackle as matter of urgency not just for the sake of our council budget but to help the people who most need help welcome the hon member for eastbourne josh babarinde to the house and congratulate he on secure this important debate on funding for temporary accommodation as we have hear from he and other hon member this be such serious issue know from my experience as an mp for an east london constituency that the impact that it have on child family and the wide community be absolutely devastating sadly it can be matter of life and death because as the hon member for eastbourne say the issue be the quality of housing as well as its supply this government be absolutely committed to address the current high level of homelessness and rough sleeping and of course the barrier face by those who be in temporary accommodation and need safe secure home to live in recognise the financial pressure that hon member have highlight the soar cost of temporary accommodation be place huge strain on council look very closely at the correspondence between the previous government and the leader of eastbourne council that be share with and be grateful for the work that council up and down the country have do in one of my local authority st albans we be at crisis point and often it be family with child who lose out the average waiting time be week but the average time for family with child be week because of problem with supply and financial pressure we be also in an area where the cost of housing include private housing be very high do the minister agree that where housing cost be high the impact on local authority be very difficult to deal with as they often subsidise the high cost of private rent to try to support those family on the waiting list we have to take that into account the hon member have highlight some really important issue affect the private housing sector cost and supply and the impact that they have in different area will come on to the action we have already start take to make headway on those issue as we have hear homelessness and rough sleeping have dramatically increase in england homelessness be now at record level in march this year more than household include over child be live in temporary accommodation in the hon member for eastbourne constituency on march household and child be live in temporary accommodation it be shocking that child and family in this country in the century be without permanent place to call home and have to live in horrific condition where temporary accommodation be not of decent standard we all know of case where that be deeply problematic be very pleased that my hon friend be in this post because she understand the real issue we have this ridiculous situation where family in my constituency in east london be be send to other part of the country put pressure on the housing market and cause issue there this vicious circle be cost the taxpayer and household our school and our community dear be sure that she be move on to what solution may be available and she have our support in find those be incredibly grateful and my correspondence box be pile up with the mix of issue that my hon friend point to we need to work collectively to tackle these issue because unless we deal with they in the round one area issue will be transfer to another which know be not the answer we need to address those issue but it will take some time for we to gather the evidence and work with member to tackle barrier the minister have speak about the importance of work collectively council leader such as stephen who be in the gallery be very keen to do that the minister say that she have see the correspondence from he and other council leader would she be willing to meet delegation of council leader include stephen to talk about the idea and proposal in that correspondence if she be not go to address they but maybe she will later in her speech it will be really important to hear from stephen directly about eastbourne situation and to go from there will come on to what we hope we can do in the come week and month all temporary accommodation must be safe and suitable for the household affect intervention in place at the moment include our homelessness advice and support team who be draw from local authority and the homelessness sector to help local authority address the placement of family in bed and breakfast accommodation for more than six week however be clear that to turn this around we have to tackle the root cause of homelessness and rough sleeping we need to put in place last solution rather than quick fix for too long we have see the lack of strategic approach the hon member have use his debate to highlight the devastating effect on his constituent the story he share be powerful one that we can all relate to one all our constituent have face hon member have rightly raise the subject of the pressure on council finance this government be absolutely committed to reset the relationship between local and central government and work in partnership in the interest of those live in temporary accommodation and who face homelessness we want to work closely with the different nation learn from each other about what work as well as with regional and local government the government will get council back on their foot by provide multi year funding settlement end the competitive bidding for pot of money and reform the local audit system we have hear from numerous council that annual allocation be deeply problematic the competitive nature of funding be really not helpful and we need much more collaboration we recognise that council know their community good and with great stability they will be in well position to enhance local service and facility have see many great example of innovation and really effective work at local level and we need to support those effort and ensure that they be scalable local and national government can learn from each other about the good model and good practice how local government be fund be crucial in enable council to deliver the local service resident need and it be also of course crucial in deliver on our mission that be why we be committed to improve the local government finance landscape in this parliament the hon member for eastbourne and other have raise concern regard the different kind of financing mechanism and benefit subsidy payment for temporary accommodation we appreciate that these be difficult time and understand the funding pressure local authority be experience the department for work and pensions continue to keep rate for temporary accommodation subsidy under review and any future decision on the level of subsidy will be take in the context of the government mission the goal on housing and the fiscal context spend plan for the period will be set at the budget on october as hon member know follow the budget future funding allocation for homelessness and rough sleeping service will be confirm later this year we understand this be very challenging for the sector and we be work closely with local authority and want to continue to extend that work to ensure that we do all we can to relieve pressure and continue to support they with the benefit cliff edge do the minister agree that those in temporary accommodation should be give long to be able to progress on to pay or have their benefit stop so that they can build up bit of nest egg that way when they move out of temporary accommodation they be be set up for chance to succeed in the tenancy by be able to furnish their home right from the very outset rather than have to start from scratch each time and not have any fund to call upon the hon member raise the important barrier to employment that know be exercise my ministerial colleague in the department for work and pensions not least as they look at tackle the child poverty challenge another dimension to the housing crisis he make an important point and hope we can continue to get those input from colleague as we make progress on the work which will come on to that we will do in relation to the inter ministerial taskforce on homelessness on the housing funding point we recognise the challenge with the cost of temporary accommodation and early this year the government confirm allocation for round of the billion local authority housing fund which be expect to provide around home by eastbourne be due to receive around million and this fund aim to ease local homelessness pressure reduce spending on unsuitable bed and breakfast accommodation and provide safe and sustainable housing for those flee persecution recognise that as other have point out there be more to do but this be an important part of the funding settlement that be currently available and be necessary in deal with the supply issue although of course we have wide agenda on housing supply we will deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in generation we will build million home over the next five year we be also commit to abolish section no fault eviction prevent private renter from be exploit and discriminate against the hon member for eastbourne raise that and give powerful example from his constituency in his opening remark the renters rights bill will give renter much great security and stability so they can stay in their home for long the issue around safety and the decent home standard will be address through extend awaab law so that it cover private landlord this will significantly reduce the number of poor quality privately rent home and empower tenant to raise concern issue around quality of housing be not address and we need to make sure that that be tackle we very much hope that the combination of provision we have already start will allow we to begin to make progress quickly it be just over three and half month just more than day that we have be in power but we be determined to tackle these issue know that some of the other issue that have be raise such as the out of area placement of our constituent be deeply damaging family be move away from their network from school from health provider and from other support system we be clear that if local authority place household into accommodation in another local area they be require by law to notify the local authority of that placement we have to build home in the area where they be need so that we can reduce the need for out of area placement that be why we will keep our focus on the house building agenda unless we tackle the supply of housing affordable and social housing along with other kind of housing we will be stick in this cycle and nobody want that it be important and powerful to hear the minister reaffirm the legal obligation on local authority to notify another local authority if they be place folk in accommodation there brighton and hove city council have for some year be go ahead with placement in eastbourne but notification have not always take place that have mean that eastbourne borough council have not be in position to understand the general support need landscape and how good to support those people will the minister share some word that might reassure eastbourne council and remind brighton council of its obligation hope the hon member be reassure by the point have make already but go forward we need to look at how we can enable much more collaboration between council and among regional government the interconnectedness of these challenge mean they have to be address collectively that be why from the national government perspective we will soon initiate the inter ministerial group chair by the deputy prime minister it will be work with ministers across government to take action on homelessness look at temporary accommodation rough sleeping and the wide agenda we will be work with the other relevant departments to look at such issue as health and the benefit system those departments have an important role to play if we be to bring an end to homelessness once and for all in that context we be commit to ensure that local government and regional government play their part work with we along with the charitable sector and the community sector have hear powerful story of the work that faith organisation do to support those who face challenge around housing and homelessness their insight and their contribution need to be include as we develop solution to tackle this problem the minister list wide variety of departments but the department for education be not among they will she assure that that be one of the departments that she intend to co ordinate with be sure that it be absolutely be give example not an exhaustive list have already meet with colleague as have the deputy prime minister we work very closely with the department for education there be great deal of interest and enthusiasm at ministerial level at official level and we know at local authority level and among colleague across the house in work with we to develop cross departmental cross societal strategy that focus on get result of course we need to deal with the immediate challenge but we need term strategy too want to reiterate that we be absolutely committed to tackle the root cause hope that we can all take hope and heart from the extraordinary work that many organisation do in community and constituency up and down the country we have see the work do in local area by local authority and other agency with multi agency approach in healthcare and education for example and of course the work that many colleague have do here in parliament to campaign and raise awareness of the plight of those who face homelessness we have real opportunity to get this agenda right and in that spirit welcome this debate really appreciate the turnout and the interest adjournment debate be normally attend by only couple of people it be crucial that we build alliance and use the insight of members of parliament who as have find throughout my political career be at the sharp end try to support their constituent hope that colleague can see that there be real openness in this government to work together to tackle this challenge once and for all question put and agree to house adjourn
