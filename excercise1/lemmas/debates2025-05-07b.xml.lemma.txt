double the early year pupil premium we be also roll out new primary base nursery in school across the country call the chair of the women and equalities committee we all want to break down barrier to opportunity however it seem that one sizable part of our workforce be be ignore and that be woman woman miss work due to endometriosis ovarian cyst and other complication cost the economy billion year fix this would save more than double the amount that be to be spend on the unpalatable propose welfare cut for disabled people do the minister agree that improve woman health will break down huge barrier to work and if so how be she work with other departments to fix this agree with my hon friend the chair of the select committee and pay tribute to she for all her campaign work in the important area of woman health the government recognise the terrible impact that these condition can have on woman ability to work and live their life as they should that be why we be commit to

care we have evidence that council staff councillor social worker and possibly the police have be complicit or have at least turn blind eye to the issue so local inquiry will not be good enough will the minister call for national judge lead inquiry in which witness be require to give evidence under oath so that those who turn blind eye can be bring to justice to answer the hon gentleman final point to be clear national statutory inquiry do not send anyone to prison he rightly mention baroness casey and her work in rotherham and other work in rochdale the reason why we know about some of the terrible behaviour be because of the brilliant local inquiry undertake in those town louise casey be undertake national audit that will report shortly call the shadow minister despite what the prime minister say speak out for rape victim be not jump on far right bandwagon yesterday it be report that no interim spokesperson say it be obviously disappointing to see people weaponise rape gang

ask be this government simply more interested in protect their own than stay true to their manifesto pledge that pledge say we will use every tool to target perpetrator yet labour be turn its back on that once again you can hear it the leader of the house call this dog whistle politic on national radio why will the minister and her front bench colleague not commit to deliver proper national statutory public inquiry and finally put victim first will absolutely protect my own in this my own be the woman in our country who for the last year have see no effort make people say terrible thing and the leader of the house be right to apologise wonder how many of those on the opposition front bench ask the former prime minister to apologise for say that look into the life of the girl we be

happen venture capital will make that happen to ensure that lady and woman have the same opportunity as man just because they be different sex do not mean that they be any less able to do the job will the minister ensure that venture capital will be available in northern ireland for lady and woman in strangford and in northern ireland the funding will be available to woman lead business in the hon

britain be one of the great meritocracy in the world where at least in our party people can rise to the very top irrespective of race religion or gender the government consultation on reform equality law be litany of activist demand and bureaucratic burden with no proof that any of the measure would reduce inequality why be the government so determine to put people into box on the basis of race instead of promote equality of opportunity for all this labour government be determined to break the link between background and success so that where someone be from do not determine what they can go on to achieve and so everyone have the chance to get as far as their hard work and talent will take they it be important that we tackle the unacceptable gap we see around access to employment and pay for people from minority ethnic community and disabled people too that be why we be consult on this work with business and we want to get this right the tories shamefully leave the gender pay gap

opposition can echo the prime minister comment it be an honour to meet veteran at the ve day parade on monday and to commemorate the sacrifice of that generation look forward to mark ve day at westminster abbey tomorrow do the prime minister now admit that he be wrong to remove the winter fuel payment from million of pensioner the no job of this government be to put our finance back in order after the last government lose control and to deal with the billion black hole that they leave because of our action we have stabilise the economy invest record amount in the nhs make payment out to the million lowest pay and of course we be commit to the triple lock which improve pension by last year because of the work that we have do we be country that country such as india want to do deal with because of the message and the work that we have do the only black hole be the one the prime minister be dig this issue affect some of the poor and most vulnerable pensioner his mayor in doncaster say it be wrong his first minister in wales say it be wrong even his own mps be say it be wrong he have refuse to listen to on this so will he at least listen to his own party and change course let spell this out all the opposition party would take this country back to where it be few year ago break public finance interest rate through the roof and nhs waiting list at an all time high no other party in this house be prepared to say how they would put the finance straight no other party be say how they would invest in our nhs and public service no other party be focus on the long term prosperity of britain no one on the labour benches be deny how big be the challenge that we face but no one on the opposition benches be even prepared to take those challenge on we would not balance it on the back of pensioner pensioner be poor and cold because of his decision all the while energy have get more expensive for everyone why have the prime minister break his promise to cut energy bill by the way to bring energy bill down for good be to deliver cheap clean home grow energy in the meantime we have extend the warm home discount to million household one in five family and that be off their bill next winter what will not bring energy bill down be the leader of the opposition policy leave we hooked on fossil fuel and at the mercy of dictator like putin will tell you what else will not bring bill down the conservatives block every piece of infrastructure that be need in their own backyard they balance the book and crash the economy on the back of million of work people in this country that be why those people deliver the verdict that they do at the last general election the prime minister talk about clean energy we have the second high amount of renewable on the grid in europe and yet we still have the high energy bill this be not about clean energy the prime minister have break another promise he will not admit it but be the truth not that he can not cut energy bill because of his net zero policy energy bill base on fossil fuel have fluctuate massively in the last three year because we be expose to the international market the only way to get bill down be to go to renewable energy which be something that the leader of the opposition use to believe in in the word of the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon sir mel stride the shift to net zero must now happen as matter of urgency it be no long simply an environmental issue energy independence should be view as part of our national security he must have our line mr speaker what about the leader of the opposition herself this be what she say we believe that green trade and investment will be the future proof force that will help we create well tomorrow she go on to say it long term investment in nuclear and renewable that will reduce our dependence on fossil fuel and keep down consumer cost she have reputation apparently for straight talk she be right then be she this approach to net zero be irrational it be doom to fail those be my word they be tony blair if the prime minister want to throw word about he should speak to he the truth be that the prime minister be on another planet his net zero plan mean ever more expensive energy across this country job be disappear last week ceramics factory in stoke close because of energy cost this morning more job loss have be announce in the north sea and yet the amount of gas the uk be import be double so why be he shut down the north sea rather than get our oil and gas out of the ground and make energy cheap as have say many time oil and gas will be part of the mix for many decade to come but net zero be an opportunity to be seize we have have over billion invest in clean energy since july of last year which be good for the economy for business for job for apprentice and for growth the global race be on for the job of the future and believe britain can win that race do not think that the leader of the opposition be yet climate denier but she be climate defeatist she do not believe in britain ability to win the race for our economy business and job they have never back britain and there be nothing patriotic about that the prime minister have get no answer he could not even bring himself to say something to the people who find out this morning that they have lose their job the fact be that pensioner be poor and people be be lay off from winter fuel to net zero his energy policy be disaster and everyone know it we know it the public know it the union know it his mp know it and even tony blair know it the prime minister only answer be to go far and fast in the wrong direction why should we all suffer because he will not admit he have get this wrong of course nobody want to see job loss but the leader of the opposition should address her comment to the ten of thousand of man and woman in this country who be work on renewable for the future of our country and tell they that she do not want they that be anti growth anti job and anti work people every week she come along to talk the country down and carp from the sideline she can not even bring herself to celebrate the deal we have do with india the conservatives spend eight year fiddle around and get absolutely nothing we have deliver the good deal since we leave the eu the most ambitious deal for india which will be measure in billion of pound into our economy and thousand of job in this country the leader of the opposition should be welcome that the uk automotive sector face major challenge and trump tariff be the late crisis to hit the industry investment and job be now on the line from mini to mclaren aston martin jaguar land rover and many other will the prime minister continue to make those company case in his talk with the us regime and remain champion for this vital sector unlike the hon member for clacton nigel farage who believe that jaguar deserve to go bust my hon friend make very good point we be back british car company such as jlr and our india trade deal will see tariff slash for car sale which be good for british job the criticism of the double taxation be incoherent nonsense it be benefit to work people it be in the agreement that we already have with other country if the hon member for clacton nigel farage or the leader of the opposition be seriously suggest that they be go to tear up agreement with other country create massive hole in our economy they should get up and say so call the leader of the liberal democrats as we celebrate year since britain lead our ally to victory over fascism pay tribute on behalf of the liberal democrats to all those who struggle and sacrifice so much for our freedom today associate myself with the prime minister remark about the conflict in kashmir and with he urge restraint and de escalation on both side among the message that voter send to ministers last week one stand out bring back the winter fuel payment for million of struggle pensioner people will therefore be disappoint that the prime minister fail to do so today he say that he want to go far and fast to clean up the mess leave by the conservatives but on social care which be so crucial for our nhs he be go slow and slow not only will the casey commission take three year we learn on friday that the government plan to take an extra seven year to implement it it will not be implement until will the prime minister rip up that timetable make sure that he do not repeat the mess make by the conservatives and get on with fix social care this year as the right hon gentleman know we be take this in two stage we be already take measure to increase support for social care quite right too while do the long work to reform it and make sure we put system in place however say to the right hon gentleman once again that he come to the chamber every week say that we should spend more money while at the same time say that he do not want to pay for any of the measure to raise that money that be nonsense be disappoint by that answer and will keep come back to hold the prime minister to account people also want government who will stand up for our country against donald trump first he come for our steelworker and our car maker with his outrageous tariff now donald trump be come for our world lead british film industry will the prime minister work with our ally in europe and the commonwealth and make it clear to president trump that if he pick fight with james bond bridget jones and paddington bear he will lose the right hon gentleman really should listen to the sector that he think he be champion they do not want we to abandon the work we be do to try to get an agreement with america they want that agreement to reduce tariff that be the sensible pragmatic way to protect our national interest it be not sensible or pragmatic to choose between the us and the eu to abandon the work we be do on trade with the us and to leave the tariff exactly where they be that be the most damaging thing that could possibly be do refer the house to my declaration in the register of members financial interests for young people in ipswich there be no shortage of ambition just need for great opportunity that be why last autumn be proud to sign an agreement with sizewell to guarantee job for people in my town alongside additional investment for suffolk new college course on welding engineering and fabrication so that kid in my town can access the well pay secure skilled job on offer may therefore urge the prime minister to support final investment decision for sizewell not just for our country energy security but for the once in generation opportunity for young people in ipswich and suffolk it be good to see local labour mp fighting for job in his constituency and achieve excellent result we will make our final investment decision at the spending review it be something that the conservatives fail to deliver in year we be unashamedly pro nuclear pro growth and pro job that be why we be make it easy to build small modular reactor and scrap absurd rule that leave vital project tangle up in needless paperwork we be do the work that they fail to do in year prior to the election the prime minister promise that energy bill would come down they continue to rise he promise that he would save the refinery at grangemouth it be shut he promise that he would unleash generation of secure energy job in my city of aberdeen today harbour energy the large independent player in the north sea have announce that it be about to shed of its workforce that be job in my constituency go in the blink of his eye do you know who they blame mr speaker they blame the policy of thelabour party may ask the prime minister in fact may invite he to come to aberdeen and explain to my constituent why he be willing to move heaven and earth to save job in scunthorpe while destroy job in scotland nobody want to see job loss but remind the right hon member that before we come into office month ago the scottish national party government in holyrood alongside the conservative government do absolutely nothing for project such as grangemouth we have commit million to secure the future of the site we have deliver million deal and we be help with the training guarantee that be need like his first minister the right hon gentleman will raise anything to distract from the snp disastrous record with almost one in six scot stick on an nhs waiting list poor standard and violence in scottish school and more than billion cut from local government we give the scottish government the big settlement since devolution they have be in power for nearly two decade they have absolutely nowhere to hide their appalling record thank the prime minister for recently visit the now royal port of barrow in my constituency to lay the keel for the new dreadnought class submarine he will have see how proud we be to build our nuclear

rail heritage with crewe station boasting unrivalle connectivity to all four corner of our country when the conservative government take the decision to cancel the second leg of it be great betrayal of my constituent take sledgehammer to our town prospect for regeneration and prosperity will the prime minister look kindly upon proposal to extend high speed rail north of birmingham which would utilise crewe unique strategic value to the rail network and bring opportunity and prosperity to the north of england my hon friend be right to highlight the importance of strong and more reliable rail connection in improve journey and drive economic growth the conservative party utterly fail to grip delivery on cost go through the roof and timeline be shred there be false promise and total failure we be review the position that we inherit and we be commit to improve rail connectivity across the north we have already announce million extra for the key trans pennine route upgrade which will slash journey time and deliver growth and more reliable modern service for passenger this week the israeli government approve plan to officially conquer gaza just yesterday minister smotrich vow that gaza will be entirely destroy and that the palestinians will have to leave in great number to third country this follow the extermination of over palestinian man woman and child and the simultaneous expansion of illegal settlement in the west bank something witness with my own eye last week will the prime minister now finally acknowledge that ethnic cleansing be under way and end all uk military co operation with israel especially the illegal provision of fighter jet part or will he risk make britain complicit in war crime and be the prime minister to see britain answer at the hague for its role in this atrocity most of what the hon gentleman say be simply not right but want to address the position in gaza and the west bank because it be increasingly intolerable be deeply concerned particularly with the lack of aid get in and the impact that that be have on hundred of thousand of individual that concern be something recently reaffirm to the prime minister of the palestinian authority where assert again that two state solution be the only viable approach for peace our focus be on deliver peace for palestinians and israelis return to the ceasefire get the hostage out and get in the humanitarian aid that be desperately need in great number and more quickly as result of relationship breakdown my constituent martin and his three child end up homeless they have go from live in hotel to temporary accommodation martin feel abandon because glasgow city council have not be in contact for month the month of uncertainty have disrupt all their life but martin be especially worried about the impact on his child education like any father he want stability for his family but the lack of social housing mean they be stick in complete limbo do the prime minister agree with that every child no matter where they live deserve safe home and access to good education and that in every part of the uk we need to build more social housing in order to end homelessness be deeply sorry to hear about martin case and absolutely agree with my hon friend comment about every family deserve safe and secure home in england that be why we be invest an additional billion to help deliver the big increase in social and affordable house building in generation but in scotland it be frankly disgraceful that over child have no fixed home to call their own after nearly year of an snp government that be the high level ever and show why scotland desperately need new direction last week be talk to jason pub landlord and he tell that he have hear rumour about the prime minister ooh not that one not that one he have hear that there be reason why the prime minister hat britain pub landlord such as jason be be batter by labour job tax and the slashing of small business rate relief mean that as many as half of britain pub could be close by why do he hate britain pub and if he do not why be he tax they into extinction nobody like pub well than and we support they this be the same old nonsense the opposition say they do not want the rise in national insurance contribution but they do not have the courage to say they would reverse it because they know that if they do say that they would be unable to say where the money be come from that be how we get into the problem in the first place few thing be more harrowing than parent desperate and repeat attempt to access the mental health support their child need organisation such as smile counselling service support young people in my constituency be step into the breach while young people languish on waiting list without the help they need over the past decade smile have be lifeline for thousand will the prime minister join in wish declan and the team at smile very happy birthday and thank they for their invaluable work in support our young people and family join my hon friend and commend all the staff at smile for their vital work far too many young people be leave without the support they need and that be why we be recruit an additional mental health worker provide access to specialist mental health professional in every school and funding talk therapy across the country to bring down waiting time and get people the care they need with the so call eu uk reset summit less than two week away will the prime minister reassure the house that he will not hand over any british sovereign power particularly the hard win control over our uk fishing water in backroom deal with brussels as the hon member know we have commit to reset the relationship with the eu we think there be well deal that can be have be not go to provide running commentary what can say be this we will act only as we always do in the national interest we have secure very good deal with india we be talk to the us and we be go for reset with the eu to boost our economy as you know mr speaker be alarm by news that the press association which assiduously cover our exchange here may cut back its dawn to dusk coverage through redundancy hansard faithfully record our word but it be reporter in the press gallery who bear witness to the human drama here and no amount of ai will replace the human eye in the press gallery will the prime minister join and my hon friend the member for rochdale paul waugh in call on the newspaper and medium outlet that fund the press association to hold the front page and reconsider these rash move my hon friend raise really important point we enjoy free press and independent journalism in this country across the world journalist risk their life and lose their life do what they do good independently pursue the truth on many occasion have be at award ceremony usually on yearly basis where the name of those journalist who have lose either their life or their freedom be read out and it be always humbling reminder of the really important work that they do as you know mr speaker parliament have ban the charging of electric vehicle in its underground car park because of safety concern yet local authority around the country often feel powerless to stop the construction of battery energy storage system near people home and near our river and canal despite three fire already this year will the prime minister look again at his planning and infrastructure bill to make it easy rather than hard for local community to have meaningful say be really proud that on planning and infrastructure we be take the action that have not be take for year to drive our economy and remind the hon gentleman that that be signal by the office for budget responsibility as the single big driver of growth over the come year united states film tariff pm urgent question to ask the minister if he will make statement on the potential implication for the uk film industry of the united states propose tariff on foreign produce film as the house will be aware president trump announce on sunday that he have authorise the department of commerce to initiate tariff on all movie produce in foreign land he have make other comment since this be very fluid situation and we will continue to take calm and steady approach spend most of monday talk to uk and us film maker and the general secretary of bectu among other and can tell the house that we be already in active discussion with the top of the us administration on this subject we be work hard to establish what might be propose if anything and to make sure our world beat creative industry be protect we be absolutely committed to ensure that the film industry can continue to thrive and create good job right across the uk uk film and high end television generate production spend of billion in and we want to work with our domestic industry and international partner to continue to build on that success we be absolutely clear that the deep tie between the us and uk film industry provide mutual benefit to both country production be by their very nature international partnership which be often develop and create across different country and location indeed us movie be often multinational precisely because us movie earn far more overseas than they do domestically in the united states the uk and the us both benefit when the like of star wars and mission impossible be film in the uk just as we both benefit from the close work relationship between our producer talent and crew our country have long history of work together to drive the growth and creative success of our film and television sector from cary grant to hugh grant and from alfred hitchcock to christopher nolan british talent have often be at the forefront of the us sector and be absolutely sure this will continue in the year ahead be once tell by film producer never judge film by the first minute think we can say the same of this thank the minister for his answer as he rightly say we learn over the weekend that the president administration intend to impose tariff on all film produce outside the us it be understand that he have direct the us government to begin implement the policy immediately welcome the fact that the minister recognise the film industry in this country as jewel in our crown of world lead creative industry also point out that the sector alone be worth billion here and support job up and down the country it show off our great british culture and value the talent we have and some of the most amazing setting for so many film of different genre be glad that the government be work to ensure that all be do to give confidence to our director actor screenwriter and producer that they be think about they because for both independent film maker and major studio this action could result in cancel project lose investment and significant decline in uk film export which be especially hard give that they be still recover from the covid pandemic but have to say that it be disappoint the government fail to start the negotiation with president trump team for five month after the election and fire britain top trade negotiator it be difficult not to wonder whether different approach could have lead to different outcome none the less the priority be to protect our film industry so what assessment have the minister make of the potential impact on the uk film sector what immediate step be the government take to engage with the us and ensure that the investment in uk facility by many us business which would be affect be highlight what contingency plan have he prepare in the event that no exemption can be secure finally what assessment have the government make of the potential drastic cut in bbc studios profit from sale to the us market and what impact could that have on the licence fee first may on co operative note say that one reason we have very strong film and high end television sector in the uk be the joint policy adopt across several year by both conservative and labour administrations to ensure we have very competitive tax credit pay tribute to the work do by the previous government which we be able to enhance when we bring in two new tariff mean two new tax credit in the budget just before christmas no we be not in favour of bring in tariff think be right in say that in the labour government do bring in tariff on us film because we think too many us film be be show in british cinema that strategy do not go very well the americans simply ban the export of us film and we end up watch ben hur repeatedly in every cinema as well as film call hellzapoppin which do not think anybody have watch since however the successful bit of what we do in and be that we invest in the british film production system which lead to film such as hamlet and kind hearts and coronets that be the pattern we still want to adopt let be absolutely clear we believe that there be mutual benefit to both of we if we continue on the path we have select be not sure precisely what be intend do not know what tariff on service would look like and do not know whether the intention be for it to be on movie theatre the danger be that the us already have two major problem with its film industry one be distribution cost so if the us go down that route it could lead to heavy problem for the industry and the other be the very high cost of make movie in the us most film these day be an international collaboration of some kind and we want to maintain that even the british production of be look at the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson only because suspect he be about to mention it and he have just give paddington hard stare be make by studiocanal which be of course part of it have spanish actor as well as british actor this be just fact of modern film they be multinational and that be one of their strength incidentally do not think that paddington ever go to peru do not think they film any of it in peru be also tell by my peruvian friend that there be any bear in peru welcome the minister measured and thoughtful response to president trump late announcement and his full throate support for the british film industry he will be aware that my constituency be very much film venue for both film and television in his discussion with the united states will he ensure that he be also champion high end television as think he briefly mention which be often film produce and make in hackney also make plea for all the creative industry in my constituency that feed into the film industry can the minister ensure there be good communication from the government on these negotiation this be create great deal of uncertainty know hackney very well as my hon friend know use to be councillor there it be not just london that be phenomenal place to make movie but the whole united kingdom we have some of the good scenery and some of the good building it be not only bath which get use endlessly in lot of film when be there couple of week ago hear about long list of they my hon friend be also right about television what be the difference between make bridgerton and make movie in fact the pattern be very similar international collaboration be important because it deliver international audience and we want to maintain that call the liberal democrat spokesperson british film really be the marmalade sandwich in the lunchbox of our creative industry it have give we bond paddington harry potter and monty python donald trump clearly think he be god like figure but on the lib dem benches we be clear that he be not the messiah he very naughty boy if he have his way we would be watch harry potter and the prisoner of alcatraz or perhaps harry potter and the executive order of the phoenix will the minister confirm that all option will be on the table to protect our film industry include work with ally such as canada and australia which have show strength in recent week by vote anti trump will he commit to immediately meet film industry leader in the uk to co ordinate response in this area and will the government back our world lead creative by do the right thing on ai and copyright could have predict half the hon gentleman question because know paddington would get in there on serious note be meet industry representative tomorrow afternoon and look forward to understand their precise concern in addition to the obvious concern that we all share want to caution slightly against word that have be use three time now think with member say that president trump have announce something clear policy have not be announce think we need to be careful about that as say early it be difficult to see how tariff would be impose on service or on film in this way want to be careful and precise in the way we move forward on this have be ask what we be do we have already have people in washington dc talk with people in the trump administration at the high level and we will progress that of course we want to do everything we can to preserve the strength of the industry declare an interest as one of my little sister work in the uk film and tv industry be immensely proud of she urge the minister to look at how we bolster home make film and tv as part of the soon to be publish creative industry sector plan particularly in northumbria where we have some of the most wonderful landscape couple of year ago we sadly lose sycamore gap which provide memorable backdrop but we also have hadrian wall we also have fantastic workforce but too often see young people have to leave the north east to get creative opportunity elsewhere in the uk that be an extremely well make point and would add to it something say when appear before the select committee from whom suppose we might hear in moment which be that be very keen on have mixed economy in the british film industry sometimes we will be make film for other market sometimes we will be make film that tell predominantly british story about the way we be in this country and sell they around the world but where the intellectual property remain with british production company that be the mix that we need to achieve the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson refer to our relationship with the us should also say that the secretary of state be in india last week both she and want to ensure that we also have much strong relationship with india which be one of the fast grow economy in the world we think we can do great deal more in that film production space as well call the chair of the culture media and sport committee there be no doubt that this speculation will cause huge worry to those work in british film production but as the minister say it highlight once again the importance of bolster the british screen sector we recommend step to deliver that in recent select committee report yet within day of publish it his department have already ask for an extension to the time in which it would respond this weekend we hear rumour that the whole department be up for the chop under his government be not sure if that be before or after he have sacrifice our creative industry on the altar of ai the minister be brilliant communicator and know that deep in his heart he care passionately about this issue but when will he show some grit and action on behalf of our world lead creative industry in particular our screen sector hope the hon lady accept that there be area where have take very deliberate action on the back of recommendation from her committee not least in relation to levy on gig and arena ticket to fund support for small music venue but take her point be not aware that we have ask for an extension we will get on with provide response to she as fast as possible it be an excellent report have read it it contain lot of good thing that want to take forward but we probably will not be able to do everything in it it be really important that we focus on skill in the uk screen industry that have be raise repeatedly with want every kid in the country to have chance to work in the creative industry include in film and high end television many would not even think that that be possibility so we need to transform the whole pathway into those industry skill know that that be one of the thing that the hon lady committee have raise whether it be because of the fantastic state of the art shinfield studio just up the road access to fantastic filming location such as swinley forest on the crown estate or our incredible transport link bracknell forest be increasingly become go to location for the film industry as the minister have already touch on we need to see more emphasis place on home grow skill so that young people in bracknell can access the fantastic opportunity that the film sector offer will he say bit more about what this government will do to break down the barrier to opportunity in the film industry we have already invest significant amount of money in the skill sector and more come as result of the budget my hon friend be quite right that his patch be go to area for film production one reason that us company and for that matter company from many place around the world come to the uk to make film be for our skill we have some of the good cinematographer technical expert and designer as well as the act talent which mean that it be possible to make very convincing film in the uk more effectively and cheaply than in many other place we be determined to ensure that the uk remain the good place in the world to make movie film studio be really important part of our economy in hertfordshire and give opportunity job apprenticeship and work experience to people in my constituency as the minister have recognise it be not remotely clear yet how the tariff will operate and many have say that they be unworkable but if america go ahead and we have to take action in this country to ensure that our film industry be competitive urge he to look at the business rate regime with the treasury sky studios elstree near my constituency have see its business rate go up by more than now account for of its operating cost encourage the minister to look at tackle that regime as one measure to ensure that we protect our creative industry and the film sector here in the uk the hon lady make good point which have be raise with by several other member we make special provision in the budget to ensure that the business rate for studio be protect until and think that be good measure know that some of the very large studio be find it more difficult and be happy to continue look at the issue let read some statistic that may be helpful accord to report publish in january by the motion picture association of the united states of america in the us earn billion in film and television export and its service trade surplus be billion or of the total us trade surplus in service it be mutually beneficial for the us and the uk to remain with the system we have without tariff as you will be aware mr speaker harlow be the birthplace of rupert grint jo joyner and rik mayall have to mention leila khan too because use to teach she and she be an up and come star harlow have also recently double as paris in an episode of the crown do the minister agree that harlow as well as the rest of the uk have huge amount of talent and that far from rely on us film import we produce some fantastic film in this country and our film industry be grow what can this government do to support it to continue to grow and thrive my hon friend be quite right about harlow would argue that many different part of the uk that have never yet manage to get into film need to up their game local authority can play role in ensure that their area be consider as potential place to make film it be often about whether other facility be available in the local area that can contribute to that he make fair point on behalf of harlow and if there be film he will be star in it may be able to help the minister paddington bear actually live in borehamwood because the movie paddington be produce in my constituency at elstree studios which sit alongside sky studios elstree as jewel in the crown of the british industry it be no surprise that donald trump be jealous because by many account more film and television content be produce in hertfordshire than in hollywood as the minister rightly say the current situation be of mutual benefit to our two nation there be one thing that he could do right now though and for once agree with the minister sorry mean to say the hon member for st albans daisy cooper will get my fact right in moment the key point be that business rate be prove to be crippling for many of our studio include elstree so urge the minister to have another go at the treasury remember similar situation with the culture recovery fund the treasury be resistant to begin with but if he keep go he will get some further movement that would be huge fillip to the industry and would help it to withstand whatever shock it may face be very confused about who be and be not minister these day accept the point it be clearly an issue remember that when we be in opposition be regularly knock on the door of the now shadow secretary of state the right hon member for daventry stuart andrew try to get he to do something to persuade the treasury to do something about business rate be fully on board and understand the problem look forward to the right hon member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden assist in more endeavour in the future hugh bonneville tell that he be slightly upset when he sign up to paddington in peru because he think that he would be film in peru but he only get as far as borehamwood the economy be set to benefit from billion boost from the universal theme park in bedfordshire which will star paddington bear all member will welcome that do the minister agree that star like paddington bear have an enormous amount of soft power we have hear that in the chamber today what can the minister do to reassure that he will ensure that we protect and support the next generation of great british storyteller my hon friend make very good point be delighted that the theme park will happen it will be transformational for the british tourism industry apart from anything else and it will be the large theme park across the whole of europe be very grateful to my colleague in the treasury who certainly deliver when it be necessary in relation to that emphasise how important not just our film industry but our high end television and for that matter the very existence of the bbc and stuff produce by itv and many other be as part of our soft power although think paddington probably count as hard power shinfield studios in wokingham borough have bring hundred of job to my constituent and to many across berkshire it be very important part of our local economy and symbol of the uk creative strength we must not forget that berkshire be the hollywood of britain and it must be protect from donald trump reckless tariff will the minister condemn these harmful tariff and work with the film industry to ensure that the uk remain the world premier destination for film investment the hon gentleman be absolutely right we want to maintain the uk as the premier destination for international investment from not just the united states of america but india which have already reference and nigeria would like to see lot more co production between the uk and nigeria it be worth bear in mind that of our movie export go to the european union so this be genuinely open market and my belief be that free trade be well than tariff the minister will know that the uk have world lead film and tv workforce that fly the flag for collaboration british talent and economic growth around the world but he will also know that much of our film workforce be freelance and that they will be watch this news with anxiety particularly as many of they be still recover from the impact of the recent us industrial action thank the minister for his hard work be pleased that he have speak to phillipa childs the head of bectu the union bectu be fearless champion for our industry in the uk will he join in reassure bectu member and our film workforce that we be on their side and that whatever happen we will help protect film talent in the uk shall make two point in reply to that question first there have be difficulty over the past couple of year in the uk film and high end television industry because of what happen in the united states of america that make the point about the mutuality between the us and the uk film industry all the strong the truth be that would like the us movie industry to be strong because if it be strong our industry will be strong as well there be net benefit for both of we and there be win win situation the second point be about freelance work have often worry that so much of the creative industry rely on freelance worker in many case that be great because people want that kind of career but they also need some degree of security if they be to be able to take out mortgage and plan their economic future that be definitely one of the thing that we will look at in relation to the industrial strategy which we hope to be publish soon the film industry be enormously important to the buckinghamshire economy pinewood studios be in the constituency of my hon friend the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey but many of my constituent be support in job not just at the studio themselves but in the many supply chain business that feed into they pinewood go over and above most other business know in provide opportunity for young people through its futures festival which showcase every single career that can be have in the film industry much of that success be actually achieve on american money because company such as disney and amazon use pinewood out of choice therefore on top of what the minister have say about work with the trump administration to try to avoid these tariff can he assure we that he be work with company such as disney and amazon to ensure that those american brand be speak up to say why they be choose pinewood and other uk studio think the first text message that receive early on monday morning be from pinewood so yes be on that case as well but it be not just about amazon and disney it be also about the streamer and whole series of other such organisation make their product here in the united kingdom of course pinewood be the home of bond which also make the point because historically the distribution right for bond be think with an american company but the production right be with barbara broccoli and her relative all of that be now with the us but let put it this way be very hopeful that bond will still always be british be glad that the minister mention the phrase win win because in international trade in the film industry and the creative industry it have to be about win win rather than zero sum when discuss this industry with fabien riggall the founder of secret cinema it become absolutely clear that we have such incredible innovator in our creative industry and in the film sector specifically for they to flourish we need to retain that sense that it be win win situation internationally and for the uk not zero sum my hon friend make an extremely good point will if might just leap off the word cinema to make the point that film be not just about production but about find audience one of my concern in the uk be about how we make sure that cinema or movie theatre as they be know in the us can flourish as well they can be really important part of dignity in town town that have cinema be likely to be place that have respect for itself and would like to ensure that that continue into the future scotland be now one of the most seek after film destination in the world and us film company regularly base their operation in scotland we have feature in everything from batman to indiana jones to world war all of that as well as develop the film sector in scotland will be put at risk if there be any concept of tariff at all will the minister work closely with the scottish government in his response to the us will he state quite clearly that such move would be mutually self destructive and that all party be set to lose if the us proceed with anything approach tariff have already make the point that we think there be win win situation strong us movie industry will benefit strong uk movie industry believe in fair trade and free trade in fact over recent year it have be worry that more and more country have want to put up protectionist measure around whole series of industry it have tend not to happen in service and to be more about good which be one of the other issue the hon member be right about scotland be very keen on work with all the devolve administration to make sure that we remain the good place in which to make film and high end television do not know whether anybody have watch sorry be not refer to the conservative party return to my point havoc be all film in wales but it look as if it be an american dystopian city warner brothers studios leavesden be in my constituency and genuinely world class film and tv production centre it provide thousand of job generate significant wealth for the uk economy and earn south west hertfordshire the reputation of hollywood in hertfordshire major international blockbuster include barbie mission impossible paddington and the harry potter franchise have be film there and the recently confirm hbo harry potter tv series be set to be film there this summer leave aside the decision that the chancellor have make and the impact that they have have on the economy can the minister reassure we that he will continue to update the house and the industry more widely about how the government will mitigate these tariff if they come to fruition we be work on make sure that we have proper trade deal that would not just mitigate the tariff but mean that we would not end up in the situation that the hon gentleman have just describe know leavesden well and for that matter warner be in touch very quickly actually think be in touch with it very quickly on monday morning be very hopeful that it will be part of our discussion when gather the industry together tomorrow afternoon but the hon gentleman make good point none the less unlike many other in the house can not say that my area totnes have film studio or that major movie have be make in my constituency but we do have lot of creative live in our community from writer to musician and producer we also have costume maker who happen to be my daughter be very proud of she and she be enter this industry an industry that we should all be proud of if these tariff materialise they will deal another blow to the uk film industry follow the strike that we have already see will the minister assure we that he be ready to protect and insulate the uk film industry and all the job that it sustain particularly freelance job by push for either tax credit or business rate adjustment find it difficult to believe that there have not ever be film make in devon but if that be the case one of my major aim must be to make sure that in the next few year film be make in devon perhaps we will be able to get the hon member bit part will if may just refer back to cheltenham one of the film make in cheltenham many many year ago be if which be wonderful and be direct by lindsay anderson the word if be very important one at the moment because we be talk about if these tariff be to be impose on sunday the president of the united states say we want movie make in america again do the minister agree that the key to make great movie be to ensure artistic freedom and expression and to grow the necessary skill with that in mind would he visit tech trowbridge in my constituency which be do good job in upskille young people in multimedia yes as one time producer of british make film be proud that north norfolk have be the backdrop for many great film include alan partridge alpha papa it be no wonder that president trump would want to dissuade such film from come to america as steve coogan himself have say that the only person on earth who more alan partridge than alan partridge be donald trump can the minister assure the blossom creative sector in north norfolk that he value its contribution to our economy and can he give reassurance that the government will do everything they can to protect the sector from another trump trade tantrum the hon member refer to some thing have already speak about but why do he not make his film in devon he have obviously not get the message from his party colleague there be lot of great british film that will be watch in american cinema over the week to come and be certain that no president would want to say do watch british film one of the film enjoy most over the last few month be conclave which be phenomenal success and remarkably timely the film industry be important in northern ireland the executive have pour considerable amount of money into northern ireland screen and the internationally successful game of thrones be film in northern ireland much of it in my constituency we can see the benefit of that as ten of million of pound have be pour in for building set for costume and for catering and even now thousand of tourist come every year to see where the filming be so there be long legacy welcome the way in which the minister be deal with this situation tariff be speculation at the moment but before they become policy it be important that we get the message over to the administration will he ensure that in construct his argument he consult with the northern ireland executive to ensure that northern ireland voice be hear in these discussion rather lawrence of arabia question the right hon gentleman make good point have already have discussion on other matter relate to the creative industry with member of the executive in northern ireland and think have another call next week so will of course make sure they be consult he make very good point about tourism an awful lot of tourist who come to the uk want to see the place where some of their favourite movie and television series be make that be one of the thing that visitbritain be capitalise on at the moment with its star great britain campaign very much enjoy discuss the british film industry because member across the house stand up and say that they have the hollywood of hertfordshire or bedfordshire and everywhere else be bless in spelthorne to have europe big film studio and the second big in the world in shepperton interestingly it be second not to hollywood but to china there be certain amount of nervousness in spelthorne as result of the posting on truth social that the minister have come here to talk about agree with he that it be incredibly difficult logistically and technically to unpick the us uk intellectual property in film and think it will prove to be so therefore commend he for his consider run at this think it be the right thing to do couple of week ago visit cineco one of our many british film support company which make set and prop one point it make on skill be that the apprenticeship model do not work terribly well for industry that have so many freelancer and such lumpy work schedule as sidebar to the minister meeting with industry leader tomorrow would he please raise and discuss that with industry leader another lawrence of arabia question interestingly be at the bad wolf studio in cardiff last week and one thing jane tranter raise with be how important the security of know that they have number of project in their studio have be to take on apprentice in the company they have be make not just doctor who but his dark materials and industry be be film there at the moment there be whole series of different project and that enable the studio to take people on not just on daily basis we need to change the apprenticeship levy in the uk so that it work well for the film industry and so that the industry can make long term commitment to people future career appreciate the minister comment this afternoon be member of the culture media and sport committee and we have hear over and over again how important uk film tax credit be to the industry and about the tangible difference they make to film maker across the uk can the minister say whether the government be consider increase or adjust they in any way to maintain competitiveness with us and other international market give the context we be now work within have always say that support film tax credit labour first introduce they under gordon brown they be continue by the conservative government and then we introduce two new one incidentally think that the independent million movie tax credit will make significant difference to the uk particularly at this point note that some document produce around the semi announcement in the united states of america have praise the way that we have do thing in the uk and other part of the world want to mirror it will take praise wherever can get it the uncertainty of president trump comment put an unsettledness in the industry especially in northern ireland where we have the titanic studios and northern ireland screen work away titanic studios be already work on knight of the seven kingdoms which be prequel to game of thrones so there be lot of activity go on in the industry will the minister consider include northern ireland screen in his meeting tomorrow with the industry rather than leave it another week to engage with it that be very fair point be happy to do that be deeply proud that st margarets in my constituency have be home to twickenham film studios for over year the studio have be involve in production and post production work for big name film include the italian job and ghandi and most recently they do the oscar win sound production for top gun maverick however they have be beset by financial challenge from the us writer strike to the sky rocket business rate mention by my hon friend the member for st albans daisy cooper the tariff could deal fatal blow to studio such as twickenham can urge the minister as other have to work with the treasury and the valuation office agency on bring down the rateable value of film studio can also invite he to follow in the footstep of tom cruise and come to st margarets to visit twickenham film studios the thing be tom cruise do all his own stunt do he be little bit nervous about be dangle off the back of helicopter or dump in vat of do know interruption the shadow minister say he will happily arrange it well then invite he to see the rhondda tunnel we can dangle he down hole as well the hon lady be make point that have be make several time tom cruise be one of the big investor in the uk because of all the movie that have be make here and we be very grateful to he the british film institute will be honour he next week and think that be really good as say we be the good place in the world to make movie and we want to continue that feel very left out not have studio in my constituency but we have produce some of the good actor in the world include sir stanley baker think one of his good film you will know this mr speaker be sodom and gomorrah be think of different film what film be you hang on we be not mean to do this be we order order as be say be also very proud of the young actor callum scott howells who be do phenomenally well for the final episode call jim shannon never the final episode still wee bit to go yet thank the minister very much for his answer and for the energy he display on behalf of the sector in question in the chamber yesterday to the minister for trade policy and economic security highlight the million income for the film industry in northern ireland since the importance of usa film to that can not be overstate they include epic such as blade runner to say nothing of game of thrones and star wars so many film use our highly skilled studio and work due to the cost effectiveness of this option the trump tariff will negate much of this benefit be quite confident of the minister response but how can he emphasise the need to give consideration to our film sector which be an integral part of this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland think the credit be already roll and then up come the hon gentleman it may be just that be an optimistic person by nature but feel very optimistic about where all these negotiation will end up be hopeful that we will end up with some kind of deal also passionately believe that wherever that deal end up the uk film industry will succeed because we have always be great

ethnic cleansing kashmiris for over year modi record on human right from an individual who once be bar from come to this country be not forget kashmir have history that span over year it have never be

people be also deliver so that this issue can be resolve once and for all my hon friend be right to focus on de escalation that be my focus this afternoon from the dispatch box our position on kashmir remain unchanged but the focus for now must be on ensure that there be no further threat to regional stability the minister have rightly underline the fact that we face an incredibly dangerous moment but that britain have uniquely deep historical and influential relationship with both these great country which we must now deploy with great energy and skill do he agree that the government of pakistan must take more action against the terrorist organisation that operate from their soil do he also understand the outrage that indian people include the diaspora in royal sutton coldfield feel at these dreadful event recognise the right hon gentleman long stand attention to these issue as secretary of state for the department for international development he send young dfid official to

between india and pakistan and calm head prevail rise order member need to temper their language and not use statement such as mislead the house twenty six people lose their life in the pahalgam terrorist attack and now people lose their life in yesterday attack the truth remain that no evidence have be present to anybody any national or international partner to say that pakistan be indeed responsible for the attack on pahalgam thank the minister for come so soon to the house and for all his effort in try to de escalate but to actually get de escalation and if india be so certain do he agree that india should share that evidence with the world to justify this barbaric attack kill people and attack mosque in the middle of the night as say in the previous answer there be clearly considerable amount of debate about the fact of what have happen just in the last few hour do not wish to focus and it would indeed be inappropriate for the uk to speculate on those exact fact we need to focus from this house on de escalate the risk to regional stability that we see today there be enormous distrust between both nation which stem from the dispute over kashmir immediately after those terrorist event in india last month india be quick off the mark to blame pakistan in response pakistan make it plain that it have nothing to do with it pakistan position be how can armed terrorist travel km over devastating terrain by foot assassinate people and then return by foot into pakistan in an area that be the most militarise zone on this planet it be somewhat incredulous that blame be put on pakistan virtually within an hour of this atrocity will the minister commit to leverage our diplomatic influence to encourage an environment that be conducive to open dialogue do he agree that there be an ever grow imperative to normalise relation and address underlying issue from territorial dispute to act of violence to have peaceful negotiation and mutual understanding the hon member be

minister hate to embarrass members but they will get two bout of today will start with the government amendment and then once have hear the argument from member advance other amendment will speak to those later in the debate if do not cover subject in this initial speech will get back to they later rise the right hon gentleman be entice hope he will be nice to than the chair of the culture media and sport committee the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage be early be sure that the chair of the committee and will always be nice to minister be only go to say that have experience the slight schizophrenia he have refer to in hold role in the department for science innovation and technology and in dcms at the same time although he be appear as dsit minister this afternoon can he assure the house that he will not forget his responsibility as dcms minister for the creative industry model myself in all thing on the right hon gentleman apart from the fact that leave the tory party many year ago and it be about time that he come over to the labour benches it be not too late no the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale could come over here be not go back over there the point be go to make be that be fully cognisant of my duty think the right hon gentleman be refer to the artificial intelligence copyright issue that we will be address fairly shortly like the fact that be in both departments because it mean can bring the knowledge of both sector to bear on each other if we be lucky and if we work hard at it hope that will be able to persuade he that we can come to win win solution as he know this be not easy when have my first meeting with he after be appoint in the post he say this be not an easy area to resolve hope be not break confidence but he be smile have large number of topic to cover and be conscious that many member will think this be the datum bill when we will actually be deal with an awful lot of subject this afternoon that do not feel as if they have anything to do with the measure in the original version bring forward by the right hon gentleman and previously hope that member will bear with intend to address the government amendment as follow first ai and copyright secondly deepfake thirdly the national underground asset register and then smart datum and other minor and technical amendment will start with ai and intellectual property as member know it be never the government intention to legislate on that issue at all in this bill it be complex and important issue which be why we have consult on package of measure that consultation have more than response which we be still consider several hon member have say to will you remove the opt out clause in the bill need to make it absolutely clear that no such opt out clause be in the bill we never lay one in the bill so there be not an opt out clause to remove as member will also know the lords insert set of amendment on ai and copyright which we remove in committee they reappear on the amendment paper today as new clause to table by the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins similar measure have be table as new clause by my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel we oppose all these new clause for several reason first they pre empt the result of the consultation it must surely be well to legislate on this complex subject in the round rather than piecemeal the amendment be also unworkable new clause for instance would make the information commissioner the regulator of transparency requirement but the information commissioner office have neither the skill nor the resource to perform that function obviously transparency requirement without an effective enforcement mechanism be bad than useless which mean the other clause on transparency be also unworkable in this context the new clause also fail to address some of the most important question in this area they effectively legislate piecemeal rather than in the round whenever parliament have do that in the past it have rue the day and think the same be true today do the minister not understand the urgency generative ai be ingest our whole creative catalogue as we speak we need something in place now we can not wait year for report or three year for legislation we need action now do he not understand that something need to be bring forward here today these amendment offer that do not think the amendment do offer that because do not think they work we need to legislate in the round as say and not piecemeal point out to the hon member that there be something of two edge sword here have be repeatedly tell and understand the point that there be no legal uncertainty as to the copyright status of work that be be scrap at the same time people be say they want legislative change those two thing can not be true at the same time be determined to get we to well place on this as will perhaps explain in couple of moment think there be an intention to push new clause to vote later which urge hon member not to do although do not always get my way new clause basically say that people should comply with the law mean it be simple fact people should comply with the law we can not legislate to tell people that they should comply with the law the law be the law if none of these amendment be pass today the law will remain as it be today and copyright law in the uk will be robust and clear for the absolute avoidance of doubt some people have talk to about text and datum mining exception which as member will know exist for instance in the european union there be text and datum mining exception already in uk law it be introduce in via statutory instrument which add section to the copyright designs and patents act however it be an exception for the sole purpose of non commercial research think that that be absolutely clear in law and do not think it need any clarifying understand the point that the minister be make about exist copyright law but as he have say the government open consultation that have for many of our constituent who work in the creative industry prefigure substantial change in copyright when it come to ai do he see the merit that many of we see in make it clear that the principle behind copyright from which our creative constituent should be able to benefit and which should protect their own work be what be at stake here have say that the exist law stand will he at least make commitment that that be what the government want as well think he can understand why people be concern and the source of the concern that have merit these amendment completely understand and in large measure share those concern we want to ensure in this fast change world that the creative industry in the united kingdom could be remunerate for the work they have produce we be not in the business of give away other people work to third party for nothing that would be to sell our birthright for mess of pottage to use term from an old translation of the bible and we be determined not to do it as my hon friend and several other members will have hear say many time before we would only proceed with the package of measure include in the consultation if we believe that we be advance the cause of the creative industry in the uk rather than put they in danger or legal peril think that some of the thing will say in moment will be of assistance we want to reach point at which it be easy for the creative industry whether they be large business with deep pocket and able to use lawyer or very small individual photographer or painter to assert and protect their right and to say if they wish no you can not scrape my material for the purpose of large language model learning unless you remunerate that remuneration might happen via collective licensing scheme or it might happen individually either way we want to get to more licensing rather than less as again have say several time at this dispatch box we have look at what have happen in the european union and what be happen in the united states of america and we believe that although the eu say that its package be design to deliver more licensing it have not lead to more licensing or to more remuneration of the creative industry and we want to avoid that pitfall as have say take the concern of the creative industry seriously both as dsit minister and as dcms minister of course do agree we the government agree that transparency be key we want to see more licensing of content we believe that the uk be creative content superpower and we want uk ai company to flourish on the basis of high quality datum have speak to fair number of publishing company in particular uk company such as taylor francis largely academic publisher as member will know the uk be the large exporter of book in the world those company be deliberately try to get all their material license to ai company for two reason first they want to be remunerate for the work that they have provide and secondly just as importantly they want ai to come up with good answer if you put dirty water into pipe dirty water will come out at the other end and if you put good datum into ai good answer will come out of ai that be an important part of why we want to ensure that we have strong ai base on high quality datum and much of that be premium content from our creative industry we also agree that the government must keep an open mind and must take full account of the economic evidence that be why we have table new clause and which set out bind commitment to assess the impact of any and all proposal and to consider and report on the key area raise in debate that include any and all of the option that be involve in the consultation that we publish after the amendment be table in the house of lords as the government take forward the commitment make by these amendment they will consider all potential policy option must emphasise that the government have not prejudge the outcome of the consultation and take the need to consider and reflect on the good approach for all party very seriously member will be sure have read new clause it require the government to report on four matter first there be the issue of technical solution that would enable copyright owner to control whether their copyright work could be use to develop ai will the minister give way will the hon lady just let finish this paragraph because it might read well in hansard actually have now add that bit so it be ruin and might as well give way to she the question of technical solution be very important but my challenge be this have speak to representative of some of the big tech company who be push for that and who be say that it be hard for they to do it at scale but creative can do it why can the tech company not be lead on an opt in system for creative let hand that back to the minister should point out that the hon lady as the spokesperson for the liberal democrat party will be speak very shortly know but she be wonderful so we will let she or you will let she madam deputy speaker this be really important point surely it can not be impossible for we to find technical solution people who can develop ai and they be now develop ai on their laptop especially follow deepseek they do not need massive computer should be able to develop very simple system as have say before whereby all creative who be copyright owner be able to assert their right very simply across all platform without any great exertion that be what want to achieve the hon lady be quite right to raise that question so what be we go to do next we say in new clause that we will report in month time if we be to report in month time that we have do absolutely nothing think that everyone would rightly rant and rave at we it be our intention that the secretary of state for science innovation and technology and the secretary of state for culture media and sport will together co ordinate special taskforce specifically to consider how we can facilitate incentivise and enable the development of these technical solution suspect that if we can get there opt out will look remarkably like opt in the second matter on which new clause require we to report be access to datum for ai developer to train ai system in the uk the third be transparency and the fourth relate to measure to facilitate the licensing of copyright work for ai training the publication will be require within month of royal assent and will of course be lay before parliament new clause supplement these report with full economic impact assessment that will go far than previous assessment and will present an analysis of the economic impact of range of policy option available in this context support by the additional evidence that the government have receive in response to their consultation the reporting requirement be important they mean that we will have to engage with each of these issue apace and in depth and we will do that we be determined to find and incentivise technical solution that support our objective and believe that if we do that we can be world leader as say early the two secretaries of state will convene work group to tackle each of these issue have hear people say that we be legislate to water down copyright but that be simply not true if member support the government position today the uk copyright law will remain precisely as robust tomorrow as it be today for activity in the uk people will in law only be able to use copyright material if they be permit and license to do so or if copyright exception allow it such as the exist copyright exception for education public library and non commercial work will the minister give way think that that might engender something it be pleasure to serve on the bill committee may take up the point about timeline in the new clause the minister have say that the report must be make before the end of period of month but as other member have say there be great deal of concern about what may happen do he expect this to take year or might it possible to work fast so that more reassurance can be give accept that there will need to be further consultation and examination of the response obviously series of different thing will happen we will have to respond to the consultation at some point and guess that the culture media and sport committee will want to respond as well in the meantime we will be run working group be very happy to keep the house update on how that work progress but do not want to commit to produce something within month without be absolutely certain that can do so if new clause be carry today it will be requirement by law that we produce response within month fully get the point about urgency as the right hon member for maldon know well this issue have be hang around for considerable period of time we in the uk have perhaps be little slow but want to make sure that we get it right rather than legislate piecemeal apologise if have miss this but have the minister outline when the government will respond to the consultation no have not my hon friend have not miss anything obviously we want to respond as soon as possible but we have consultation response to consider some issue have hardly be refer to in the public debate on this matter one issue that equity be understandably pursue and that we refer to in the consultation be about personality right which exist in some state in the united states of america that be quite complicated to legislate for which be one of the reason we have consult on it we have also consult on the question again nobody have refer to this in the public debate of whether work that be generate by ai have any copyright attach to it if so who own that copyright it be slightly moot in british law one could argue that british copyright law have always presume that copyright apply only where work be the expression of an individual so it do not apply to ai generate material but there be other element section of the copyright designs and patent act say that machine generate material can have copyright attach to it which be one of the other issue that we want to address as say early one of the issue to which nobody have yet come up with an answer be how we will provide proper enforcement of whatever transparency requirement we propose be conscious that in discussion have have with our european counterpart include my spanish counterpart and member of the european commission there have be some concern about precisely what they will do by virtue of transparency this issue be make more complicated by the advent of deepseek for whole series of different reason which be happy to explain at some other point but we need to end up with transparency system that be both effective and proportionate simply dump list of million and million of url that have be visit on the internet be neither effective nor proportionate so we will have to come up with something do the minister envisage that any model of enforcement around transparency will be compulsory and not voluntary system by its nature enforcement would have to be compulsory but we be run ahead of ourselves because nobody have actually come up with system that have an enforcement mechanism who would do it what body would do it how would that body be resource that be one of the thing that we need to look into and it be one of the element of the consultation will move on to another subject the issue of purport intimate image government amendment deal with the creation of intimate image or deepfake early in the bill passage my colleague lord ponsonby add new offence of create purport intimate image without consent or reasonable belief in consent and be sure all hon member agree that this be really important addition in committee we introduce the offence of request the creation of purport image without consent or reasonable belief in consent as hon member who be on the public bill committee with will know it seem axiomatic that the court should have the power to deprive offender of the image and anything contain it that relate or be connect to the offence this be already the case for the create offence which be introduce in the house of lords government amendment amend the sentencing code to achieve that for the request offence it ensure that the exist regime of court power to deprive offender of property also apply to image and device contain the image that relate to the request offence we have table series of amendment to clause to to reflect our discussion with the devolved government on the national underground asset register the amendment will require that the secretary of state to obtain the consent of welsh ministers and the department for infrastructure in northern ireland rather than merely consult they before make regulation in relation to the provision co operation with the devolve government have be consistent and constructive throughout the bill passage we have secure legislative consent from scotland and the senedd in wales vote in favour of grant the bill legislative consent only yesterday we regret that for procedural reason the process with northern ireland have not yet reach the stage of legislative consent we be however work constructively with the department of finance to ensure that we can make progress as quickly as possible we continue to work closely with the northern ireland executive to secure legislative consent and to ensure that citizen and business of northern ireland feel the full benefit of the bill before finish turn to our amendment to help ensure that smart data scheme can function optimally and that part of the bill be as clear as possible amendment to fee charging under clause and follow extensive stakeholder engagement and will maximise the commercial viability of smart datum system by enable regulation to make tailor provision on fee charging within each smart datum scheme for example amendment to enable the fee charge to exceed expense where appropriate this be necessary to fulfil the commitment in the national payment vision to establish long term regulatory framework for open banking outside smart datum government amendment add reference to investigate crime to exist reference in the data protection act to detect or prevent crime which will bring these reference into line with other part of the legislation call the shadow minister it be privilege to respond to this debate on behalf of his majesty official opposition and to speak to the new clause and amendment this be an ambitious piece of legislation which will enable we to harness datum the currency of our digital age and use it in way that drive the economy and enhance the delivery of public service since its original inception under the conservatives in the last parliament the bill have also become the platform for tackle some of the most pressing social and technological issue of our time many of these be reflect in the amendment to the bill which be the subject of debate today start with new clause how do we regulate the interaction of ai model with creative work pay tribute to the work of many member on both side of this house and member of the other place who have passionately raise creative concern and the risk pose to their livelihood by ai model conservative members be clear that this be not zero sum game our fantastic creative and tech industry have the potential to turbocharge economic growth and the last government rightly support they the creative and technology sector need and deserve certainty which provide the foundation for investment and growth new clause would achieve certainty by require the government to publish series of plan on the transparency of ai model use of copyright work remove market barrier for small ai market entrant and digital watermarking and most important of all clear restatement of the application of copyright law to ai modelling activity can not help but have sense of déjà vu in relation to government new clause we be glad that the government have act on several of the action we call for in committee but once again they have choose pr over effective policy amid all the spin the government have in effect announce plan to respond to their own consultation how innovative what be starkly miss from the government new clause be commitment to make it clear that copyright law apply to the use of creative content by ai model which be the primary concern raise with by industry representative the government have create uncertainty about the application of copyright law to ai modelling through their ham fiste consultation so offer the minister another opportunity will he formally confirm the application of copyright law to protect the use of creative work by ai and will he provide legal certainty and send strong signal to our creative industry that they will not be ask to pay the price for ai growth yes thank the minister for make that statement at the dispatch box as he know we need to have that formally in writing as statement from the government to make it absolutely clear give that the consultation have muddy the water be sorry but say that in my speech and have say it several time in several debate previously would therefore be grateful if the minister say why there remain uncertainty among creative about the application of copyright in this area be that not why we need to move this forward now turn to government amendment and other congratulate my noble friend baroness owen on the tremendous work she have do in ensure that clause criminalise the creation of and request for sexually explicit deepfake image have make it into the bill also thank the government for the constructive approach they be now take in this area should have say early that as the shadow minister know in committee we change the clause on solicit to one on request such an image because in certain circumstance solicit may require the exchange of money that be why we now have the request offence thank the minister for his clarification and reiteration of that point and again for his work with colleague to take forward the issue on which think we be in unison across the house new clause be on direction to public authority on recording of sex datum one do not need to be doctor to know that data accuracy be critical particularly when it come to health research or the provision of tailor service base on protect characteristic such as sex or age the accuracy of datum must be at the heart of this bill and nowhere have this be more high profile or important than in the debate over the collection and use of sex and gender datum thank the charity sex matters and the noble lords arbuthnot and lucas for the work they have do to highlight the need for accurate datum and its relevance for the digital verification system propose in the bill the recent decision by the supreme court that sex in the equality act refer to biological sex at birth regardless of whether someone hold gender recognition certificate or identifie as of different gender have already leave many tran people feel hurt and unseen do the shadow minister agree with that any id and digital verification service must consider trans people not risk make they more likely to feel that their country be forget who they be thank the hon member for her intervention and will shortly come on to the impact on all people of the decision of the supreme court our new clause focus and scope be simple the supreme court ruling make it clear that public body must collect datum on biological sex to comply with their duty under the equality act the new clause ensure that this data be record and use correctly in accordance with the law this be about datum accuracy not ideology new clause be base in part on the work of professor alice sullivan who conduct very important review with deeply concern finding on inaccurate data collection and the conflation of gender identity with biological sex datum she find people miss off health screening risk to research integrity inaccurate policing record and management through the criminal justice system and many other concern these concern present risk to everyone irrespective of biological sex gender identity or acquire gender trans people like everyone else need health screening base on their biological sex trans people need protect from sexual predator too and they have the right to dignity and respect the sullivan report show beyond doubt that the concern of the last government and the current leader of the opposition be entirely justify the government have have professor sullivan report since september last year but the department for science innovation and technology have still not make formal statement about it or address the concern raise which be even more surprising give its relevance to this bill the correction of public authority datum on sex be necessary and urgent but it be make even more critical by the implementation of the digital verification service in the bill appreciate that the shadow minister be make an important point on the sullivan review and the supreme court judgment but there be conversation in government and with labour member to ensure that the supreme court judgment and the sullivan review be implement properly across all departments and hope to work with the government on that thank the hon member for her intervention and for all the work that she and colleague on both side of the house be do in this area hope that the finding of the sullivan report be implement as soon as possible and part of that implementation would be make possible if member across the house support our new clause for the digital verification service to be bring in it be important that the datum use to inform they be accurate and correct digital verification could be use to access single sex service so it need to be correct and if sex and gender datum be conflate as we know they be in many dataset failure to act will bring in self id by the back door to be clear that have never be the legal position in the uk and it would conflict with the ruling of the supreme court our new clause be simple and straightforward it be about the accurate collection and use of sex datum and rule to ensure that datum be of the right standard when use in digital verification service so that single sex service be not undermine new clause be on the secretary of state duty to review the age of consent for datum processing under the uk gdpr what can or should child be permit to consent to when use or sign up to online platform and social medium how do we ensure child be protect and how do we prevent harm from the use of inappropriate social medium itself separate from the content provide how do we help our child in world where social medium can import the school the playground the change room the influencer the stranger the groomer the radical and the hostile state actor all into the family home our child be the first generation grow up in the digital world and they be expose to information and weaponise algorithm on scale that simply do not exist for their parent in government we take measure to improve protection and regulate harmful content online and be delighted to see those measure now come into force however there be increase evidence that exposure to inappropriate social medium platform be cause harm and child as young as may not be able to regulate and process this exposure to such site in safe and proportionate way be sure every member across the house will have be contact by parent concern about the impact of social medium on their child and we recognise that this be challenging area to regulate how do we define and target risky and inappropriate social medium platform and ensure that education and health tech or indeed close direct messaging service do not fall within scope how effective be our provision already and can age verification be make to work for what id be available to use what will the impact of the online safety act be now that it be come into force what be the lesson from its implementation and where do it need strengthen finally how do we support parent and teacher in educate and guide child so they be prepared to enter the digital world at whatever age they choose and be able to do so the government must take action to ensure appropriate safeguard be in place for our child not through outright ban or blanket restriction but with an evidence base approach that take into account the recent legal change and need for effective enforcement include age verification for too often in this place we focus on make more thing illegal rather than on the reason for lack of enforcement in the first place there be no point in immediate restriction if they can not be implement agree with all the point the shadow minister be make about keep our child safe online so why do new clause only commit to review of the digital age of datum consent and raise the age from to for when parental consent be no long require why do he not support the liberal democrats new clause that would start to implement this change we can still through implementation do all the thing the hon gentleman propose to do so why the delay there be few issue with new clause one be the scope in term of the definition of network service and ensure platform such as whatsapp be not capture within it look at new clause there be challenge to implement in this area there be no point in click our finger and say let change the age of digital consent without understand the barrier to implementation and without understand whether age verification can work in this context we do not want to create system and have people just get around it quite simply we need the government to do the work in term of set it up so that we can move towards position of raise the age from to the press have obviously be brief by conservative that the conservatives be push for ban on social medium for but it seem that what be actually be suggest be review of the digital age of consent with view to perhaps increase it to the two position be very different and wonder whether the tough talk in the press match what be actually be propose by the opposition today have be very clear on this and it be important in such complex area to look at the detail and nuance of the challenge well it be very easy to create new clause where we click our finger and say let make this more illegal let bring in or restriction as responsible opposition we be look at the detail and complexity around implement something like this interruption have be ask few question and the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson might want to listen to the rationale of our approach one question be how to define social medium direct messaging service such as whatsapp and platform such as youtube fall in the scope of social medium there be obviously social media platform that think all of we be particularly concerned about include snapchat and tiktok but by change the age of digital consent we do not want to end up capture low risk social medium platform that we recognise be clearly necessary or beneficial such as education technology or health technology platform and that be before we start look at whether age verification can work particularly in the age group sorry be get bit lost do the minister think and do the conservative party think that the digital age of consent should rise from to or not rise order point out to mr bryant that dr ben spencer be the shadow minister think that be wishful thinking by the minister in this debate our new clause say that we need to look at the desirability of raise the digital age of consent for datum processing from to in term of its impact particularly on issue such as the social and educational development of child but also the viability of do so in term of the fallout and the shake out of the online safety act and with regard to age verification service should there then be no evidence to demonstrate that it be unnecessary we would then raise the digital age of consent to to it might be the case that over the next six month the shake out of the online safety act demonstrate that this intervention be not necessary perhaps concern around particular high risk social medium platform will change as technology evolve we be say that the government should do the work with view to raise the age in month unless there be evidence to prove the contrary interruption have make this crystal clear and if the minister would choose to look at the new clause rather than chuckle away in the corner he might see the strategy we be propose thank the shadow minister for give way as ever he be extremely polite in his presentation and in his dealing with intervention but be not sure that he deal with my intervention which be basically ask whether the conservative party position be as it have brief to the press that it wish to ban social medium for or that it wish to have review on raise the age of datum consent it can not be both say again that the position be that follow careful look at the evidence regard the desirability and validity of do so take into account finding regard the impact and implementation of the online safety act and age verification and how one define social medium particularly high risk platform unless there be direct evidence to show that raise the age from to be unnecessary which there may be then we should raise it from to if that have not provide clarity the hon gentleman be very welcome to intervene on again and will try and explain it third time but think member have get grasp now this new clause will also tackle some of the concern at the heart of the campaign for jools law and pay tribute to ellen roome for her work in this area be very sympathetic to the tragic circumstance lead to this campaign and welcome the additional power grant to coroner in the bill but know that they do not fully address ellen roome concern the government need to explain how they can be sure that datum will be retain in the context of these tragedy so that coroner will be able to make sure even if there be delay that it can be access if the minister could provide an answer to that in his wind up speech and detail any further work in the area that would be welcome on parental access to child datum more broadly there be difficult challenge in term of article right on privacy and transparency especially for child age to as they approach adulthood our new clause address some of these concern and would also put in place the groundwork to de facto raise the digital age of consent for inappropriate social medium to within month render the request for parental access to young teenage account obsolete urge colleague across the house to support all our amendment today as balanced proportionate and effective response to generational challenge the bill and the vote today be an opportunity for our parliament often refer to as the conscience of our country to make clear our position on some of the most pressing social and technological issue of our time call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee would like to thank colleague in the other place and in this house who have work so hard to improve the bill by modernise data infrastructure and governance this bill seek to unlock the secure efficient use of datum while promote innovation across sector as tech evangelist as well as the chair of the science innovation and technology committee welcome it and be pleased to see colleague from the select committee my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south dr gardner and the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse here for this debate have spend many unhappy hour when work for ofcom try to find out where british telecom duct be actually bury offer very personal welcome to the national underground asset register and thank the minister for his work on this bill as well as for his opening comment agree with the minister that there be much to welcome in this bill but much of the second reading debate be consume by discussion on ai and copyright know many member intend to speak on that today so will just briefly set out my view the problem with the government proposal on ai and copyright be that they give all the power to the tech platform who let we be frank have great deal of power already as well as trillion of dollar in stock market capitalisation and determination to return value to their shareholder what they do not have be an incentive to design appropriate technology for transparency and right reservation if they believe that in its absence they will have free access to our fantastic creator ingenuity it be essential that the minister convince they that if they do not deliver this technology agree with he that it be highly possible to do so then he will impose it perhaps the minister could announce an open competition with supplier contract as the prize for whichever innovative company design something the science innovation and technology committee sit with the culture media and sport committee hear from small company that can do just that the tech giant might not like it but often say that the opposite of regulation be not no regulation it be bad regulation if the tech platform do not lead they will be oblige to follow because the house will not allow the copyright of our fantastic creator to be put at risk the minister know that think he extremely charismatic and always have do but do not believe that chris from dsit can prevail against the combine force of björn from abba and paul from the beatles the prospect for human advancement open by use datum for scientific research be immense as world lead science powerhouse the uk must take advantage of they that be why despite be strong advocate of personal data right welcome the bill proposal to allow the reuse of datum without consent for the purpose of scientific research be concern however that the exemption be too broad and that it will be take advantage of by datum hungry tech company use the exemption even if they be not truly advance the cause of scientific progress but simply as with copyright train their ai model huge amount of datum be already collect by platform such as direct message on instagram or via web scraping of any website that contain an individual personal datum such as publish record or people public linkedin page we know it can be misuse because it have be most recently with meta controversial decision to use instagram user datum to train ai model trigger an information commissioner office response because of the difficulty user encounter in object to it then there be the risk of datum collect via track cooky or the profiling of browse behaviour which company such as meta use to fingerprint people device and track their browsing habit could the datum use to create ad also be freely reusable under this exemption the us tech firm palantir have the contract for the nhs federate data platform amnesty international have already raise concern about the potential for patient datum be mishandle do the bill mean that our health datum could be reuse by palantir for what it call research purpose before the hon lady move on from palantir think the house should know that it be an organisation with its origin in the american security state the national security agency and the central intelligence agency and can not understand for the life of why we be willing to commit the datum of our citizen to an organisation like that thank the right hon member for that intervention will leave it to the minister to address his point the concern that be probably of most interest to my constituent be reflect in the recent report by the sunday times that chelsea football club claim research and development tax credit will the minister confirm that if chelsea be to collect datum on newcastle united fan attend an away match at stamford bridge it could be reuse for whatever research it be undertake as consequence of the exemption my amendment and would incorporate into the bill two clarification to help reduce the potential misuse of the scientific research exemption thank the ada lovelace institute for its help in draft the amendment amendment propose place in the bill basic definition of scientific research base on the frascati manual use by the ico enable the reasonably describe test to be assess against an objective standard amendment be requirement that such research be conduct in line with relevant framework and standard base on the uk research and innovation code of practice for research ensure transparency for the use of scientific research exemption researcher would have to publish for example on their website short statement with detail of what they be reuse and send it to the ico this be minimal proportionate amount of information that researcher should already have to hand mean that over time we get picture of how much people datum be be reuse and for what kind of research so that there be some transparency here when the minister respond could he please engage with the example have give his letter to of april which be perhaps draft by his official seem to say that the exemption be okay because we can trust company to understand our undefined understanding of scientific research and that the ico would act if that be not the case one problem with that suggestion be that we will not know how the data be be use for scientific research because there be no transparency requirement on algorithm in general and on this exemption in particular science in this country be respect it be more respected than politician and big tech we must not allow that respect to be contaminate by us that be not truly scientific have real fear that if we allow this exemption to be abuse we will undermine public trust in datum sharing and in science will briefly speak to other part of the bill and amendment on new clause hope the government will set out how definition of sex and gender will be consistent and appropriate to the need for which the data be be collect and verify under the digital verification provision thank my hon friend for give way and for the speech she be make we all know the importance of datum do she agree that it be right that when we be record sex it be base on what the equality act determine as sex be biological sex thank my hon friend for that intervention the minister refer to that briefly describe it in relation to ai as pipeline where bad datum in would mean bad datum out my hon friend know that the definition of sex and gender have be controversial and contested the supreme court bring some clarity and it be important that data collection reflect consistency and clarity if we have bad data definition we will undoubtedly have bad consequence as say it be important that we have consistency and definition when it come to the collection of datum for these purpose and look forward to hear how that will be achieve also want to speak briefly in support of clause which introduce rule allow researcher to access datum from online service for online safety research the science innovation and technology committee inquiry into social medium algorithm in misinformation hear considerable evidence on the role of algorithm in push misinformation generally and particularly to child very much welcome this clause which will increase transparency but could the minister clarify that it will fully cover the recommender algorithm use by social medium platform which drive new content to user my constituent often feel that advance in technology be do to they rather than with they and for their benefit critically our constituent need to feel that they have agency over the way data impact their life rather than feel empower by digital innovation too many feel the opposite disempowere undermined dehumanise track and even attack deliver the improvement promise by the bill must therefore go hand in hand with respect the right of citizen to control and manage their datum and drive innovation and scientific research benefit to they call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you for call madam deputy speaker and for your patience regard my early intervention be very passionate about all element of the bill on second reading say data be the new report february vol gold that could be harness to have profound impact on people daily life and stand by that with exponential advance in innovation almost daily this have never be truer so we must get this right rise today to speak to the amendment and new clause table in my name specifically and to address two urgent challenge protect child in our digital world and safeguard the right of our creative industry in the age of artificial intelligence the bill before we represent rare opportunity to shape how technology serve people which firmly believe be good for both society and business however stand here with mixed emotion pride in the cross party work we have accomplish include with the other place hope for the progress we can still achieve but also disappointment that we must fight so hard for protection that should be self evident new clause seek to raise the age of consent for social medium datum processing from to year old we liberal democrats be very clear where we stand on this young mind be not design to withstand the psychological assault of today social medium algorithm by raise the age at which child can consent to have their datum process by social medium service we can take an important first step towards tackle those algorithm at source this be common sense measure bring we in line with many of our european neighbour the evidence before we be compelling and demand our attention when recently carry out safe screen tour of school across harpenden and berkhamste to hear exactly what young people think about the issue hear that they be trap in cycle of harmful content that they never seek out student speak of brain rot and describe algorithm that push they towards extreme content despite their effort to block it the evidence be not just anecdotal it be overwhelming child mental health referral have increase by in just eight year with nearly half of teenager with problematic smartphone use report anxiety one in four child age to have receive unwanted sexual image we know that of parent support government intervention in this area while liberal democrat poll show that seven in people say the government be not do enough to protect child online welcome new clause table by my hon friend do she agree that raise the age of consent for process personal datum from to will help reduce the use of smartphone in school by reduce their addictiveness thereby also improve concentration and educational performance in school that be exactly what be at the heart of this matter the datum that drive that addictiveness and commercialise our child attention be not the way forward many amazing organisation have gather evidence in this area and it be abundantly clear that the overuse of child datum increase their risk of harm it power toxic algorithm that trap child in cycle of harmful content recommender system that connect they with predator and discriminatory ai system that be use to make decision about they that carry lifelong consequence health professionals for safer screens coalition of child psychiatrist paediatrician and gps be plead for immediate legislative action this be not partisan issue so many of we adult can relate to the feeling of be draw into endless scrolling on our device will not look around the chamber too much imagine how much more difficult it be for develop mind this be cross party problem and it should not be political but we need action now let be absolutely clear this change be not about restrict young people digital access or oppose technology and innovation it be about require platform to design their service with child safety as the default not as an afterthought for year we have watch as our child wellbeing have be compromise by big tech company and their profit our call for action be support by the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children healthcare professionals for safer screens girlguiding mumsnet and the online safety act network this be our chance to protect our child the time to act be not month down the line as the conservatives suggest but now urge member to support new clause and take the crucial step towards create digital world where child can truly thrive to protect our child have also table amendment to clause which seek to ensure that automate decision make system can not be use to make impactful decision about child without robust safeguard the bill must place child good interest at the heart of any such system especially where education or healthcare be concerned we must protect the foundational right of our creator in this new technological landscape which be why have table new clause the uk creative industry contribute billion annually to our economy and employ more than million people they be vital to our economy and our cultural identity these be the artist musician writer and creator who inspire we define we and proudly carry british creativity on to the global stage yet today creative professional across the uk watch with mount alarm as ai model train on their life work generate imitation without permission payment or even acknowledgment new clause would ensure that operator of web crawler and ai model comply with exist uk copyright law regardless of where they be base this be not about stifle innovation it be about ensure that innovation respect establish right and be good for everyone currently ai company be scrap creative work at an industrial scale single ai model may be train on thousand of copyright work without permission or compensation the uk company polaron be fantastic example create ai technology to help engineer to characterise material quantify microstructural variation and optimise microstructural design fast than ever before why do bring up polaron it be train an ai model build from scratch without use copyright material be emphatically on the hon lady side in her intent to protect british creativity but how do she respond to the implicit threat from artificial intelligence provider to this and other element of the bill to effectively deny ai to the uk if they find the regulation too difficult to deal with we have thriving innovation sector in the uk so those company be not go anywhere they want to work with the uk we actually have system now that have fantastic creative industry and we have innovation and business come in there be many way to incentivise that talk lot about money skill and infrastructure that be what these innovative company be look for we can make sure the guardrail be right so that it work for everyone by ensure that operator of web crawler and ai model comply with exist uk copyright law we be simply uphold establish right in new technological context the uk lead the world in establish trustworthy financial and legal service create one of the large economy by take long term view and we can do the same with technology by support new clause we could establish the uk as base for trustworthy technology while protect our creative industry finally will touch on new clause which would address the critical gap in our approach to ai regulation the lack of transparency regard training datum right now creator have no way of know if their work have be use to train ai model transparency be the foundation of trust without it we risk not only exploit creator but undermine public confidence in these powerful new technology the principle be simple if an ai system be train use someone creative work they deserve to know about it and to have say in how it be use that be not just fair to creator but essential for build an ai ecosystem that the public trust by support new clause we would ensure that the development of ai happen in the open allow for proper compensation attribution and accountability that be how we will build responsible ai that serve everyone not just the tech company on the point of transparency will touch briefly on couple of other amendment we must go far in algorithmic decision making that be why have table amendment which would ensure that individual receive personalised explanation in plain language when an automated decision system affect they we can not allow generic justification to stand in for accountability will support the hon lady new clause tonight if she push it to vote and encourage she also to push new clause to vote this be most important issue we must ensure that transparency be available to all artist and creator do she agree that there be no good technological barrier to have transparency in place right now that have be my challenge to the tech company which absolutely support in innovate and drive this but if they be say that it would be easy for creative to do this why be it not easy for big tech company with power and resource to lead the way amendment to would ensure that the decision make about people whether through datum profiling automate system or algorithm be fair they would clarify that meaningful human involvement in automate decision making must be real competent and capable of change the outcome not just box tick exercise the amendment before we offer clear choice to protect our child and creator or to continue to delay while harm grow the choice to build future in which technology either build trust or destroy it we have the evidence and the solution and the time for action be now let we choose future in which technology empower rather than exploit one that be good for society and for business urge all member to support our amendment which would put people and the wellbeing of future generation first be pleased to speak in this debate in support of new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel to which have add my name the clause would give our medium and creative sector urgently need transparency over the use of copyright work by ai model be sure that my speech will come as no surprise to the minister care about this issue because of not in spite of my belief in the power of ai and its potential to transform our society and our economy for the well care because the adoption of novel technology by business and consumer require trust in the practice of firm produce the tech care about this issue because as the creative rights in ai coalition have say the uk have the potential to be the global destination for generative firm seek to license the high quality creative content but to unlock that immense value we must act now to stimulate dynamic licensing market the government must use this legislation to introduce meaningful transparency provision although be sure that the government amendment be well mean they set we on timeline for change to the copyright framework that would take we right to the tail end of this parliament many in this house include myself do not believe that an effective opt out mechanism will ever develop know it be not in the bill right now but it be propose in the ai and copyright consultation even if the government insist on pursue this route it would be dereliction of duty to fail to enforce our exist law in the intervene period big tech firm claim that transparency be not feasible but that be red herring these company be absolutely capable of let right holder know whether their individual work have be use as openai have be order to do in the authors guild openai copyright case require transparency without the need for court order will avoid waste court time and swiftly establish legal precedent make the legal risk of copyright infringement too great for ai firm to continue with the mass theft that have take place that be why big tech object to transparency just as it object to any transparency requirement whether they be focus on online safety digital competition or copyright it would make it accountable to the individual and business that it extract value from the ai company far argue that provide transparency would compromise their trade secret but that be another red herring nobody be ask for specific recipe of how the model be train they be ask only to be able to query the ingredient that have go into it generative ai model be make up of billion of datum point and it be the weighting of datum that be model secret sauce the government can do myriad thing around skill access to finance procurement practice and energy cost to support ai firm build and deploy model in the uk they insist that they do not see the ai copyright debate as zero sum game but trade away the property right of million uk of whom live outside london to secure tech investment would be just that there be no insurmountable technical barrier to transparency in the same way that there be no opt out the key barrier to transparency be the desire of tech firm to obscure their illegal behaviour it have be show that meta employee proactively seek in their own word to remove datum that be clearly mark as pirate steal from the datum that they use from the pirate shadow library libgen if they have technical mean to identify copyright content to cover their own back surely they have the technical mean to be honest with creator about the use of their valuable work say to the minister who know truly care about the future of creative and tech business in the uk that be absolutely not in question that if he can not accept new clause as table he should take the opportunity as the bill go back to the lords to bring forward clause that would allow he to implement granular transparency mechanism in the next six to month and many on the labour benches as well as the entire creative industry and other who do not want what be theirs simply to be take from they stand ready to support the development of workable solution at pace it can never be too soon to protect the livelihood of uk citizen nor to build trust between creator and the technology that would not exist without their hard work call the chair of the culture media and sport committee rise to support new clause to in the name of the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins to pay tribute to baroness kidron who have drive forward these amendment in the other place and to speak in favour of new clause in the name of the official opposition be begin to sound bit like broken record on this matter but our creative industry be such phenomenal uk success story they be our economic superpower and be worth more than automotive aerospace and life science add together comprise almost of uk register business and create nearly million job more than that our creative industry have so much intrinsic value they underpin our culture and our sense of community intellectual property showcase our nation around the world and support our tourism sector as form of soft power there be simply nothing like it yet these social and economic benefit be all be put at risk by the suggest wholesale transfer of copyright to ai company the choice present to we always seem wittingly or unwittingly to pit our innovative ai sector against our world class creative industry and indeed our medium sector it be worth note that news media be often overlook in these debate but newspaper magazine and news website license print and content online in turn that help to support high quality and independent journalism which be so vital to underpin our democratic life that be essential consider recent news that the global average press freedom score have fall to an all time low want to push back against the false choice that we always seem to be present with that somehow our creative industry be luddites and be not in favour of ai have see time and again how our creator have be characterise by big tech and its lobbyist as somehow resistant to technological progress which be of course nonsensical want to knock on the head the idea that any government minister think that the creative industry be luddites as say in the debate in westminster hall know that the hon lady be not able to be there many creative industry use all sort of technical innovation every single day of the week they be not luddites at all they be the great innovator in the country thank the minister for that reassurance do take part in westminster hall debate on this matter couple of week ago but one of his colleague be respond make the same point then quite often in the medium or more generally ai seem to be pit against our creative industry which should not be the case because we know that our creative industry embrace technology virtually more than any other sector they want to use ai responsibly they do not want to be replace by it the question before we be how lawmaker can ensure that ai be use ethically without this large scale theft of ip we be today discuss amendment that go somewhere towards provide an answer to that question on this issue of luddites surely one of the problem for english language creator be that what they create be of more value because of the reach of the english language over other therefore they be more likely to have their product scrap and have more damage do to they my right hon friend make very good observation but the fact be that so much content have already be scrap crawler be all over the intellectual property of so many of our creator writer and publisher so much so that we be almost in position where we be shut the gate after the horse have bolt nevertheless we need to do what we can legislatively to get to well place on this issue new clause would simply require anyone operate web crawler for training and develop ai model to comply with copyright law it be self evident and incontrovertible that ai developer look to deploy their system in the uk should comply with uk law but they often claim that copyright be not very clear would argue that it be perfectly clear it be just that sometimes they do not like it it be failure to abide by the law that be create lawsuit around the world the new clause would require all those market their ai model in the uk to abide by our gold standard copyright regime which be the basis that underpin our thrive creative industry new clause would require web crawler operation and ai developer to disclose the who what why and when crawler be be use it also require they to use different crawler for different purpose and to ensure that right holder be not punish for block they joint hearing of the culture media and sport committee and the science innovation and technology committee hear how publisher be be target by thousand of web crawler with the intention of scrap content to sell to ai developer we hear that many if not most web crawler be not abide by current opt out for example to put it another way some developer of large language model be buy datum scrap by third party tech company in contravention of protocol to evade accusation of foul play all this do be undermine exist licensing and divert revenue that should be return to our creative industry and news medium sector new clause would provide transparency over who be scrap copyright work and give creator the ability to assert and enforce their right new clause would require ai developer to be transparent about what datum be go into their ai model transparency be fundamental to this debate it be what we should all be focus on we be already behind the drag curve on this california have introduce transparency requirement and no one can say that the developer be flee silicon valley just yet new clause table by the official opposition also address transparency it would protect the ai sector from legal action by enable both side to come to the table and get fair deal core part of this new clause be the requirement on the secretary of state to commit to plan to help support creator where their copyright have be use in ai by require degree of transparency new clause would provide the mean by which we could enforce the rule it would give the information commissioner the power to investigate assess and sanction bad actor it would also entitle right holder to recover damage for any loss suffer and to injunctive relief part of the reason why right holder be so concerned be that the vast majority of creator do not have deep enough pocket to take on ai developer how can they take on billion dollar big tech company when those company have the good lawyer that money can buy who can bog case down in legislation and red tape right holder need way of enforce their right that be accessible practical and fair the government ai and copyright consultation say that it want to ensure clear legal basis for ai training with copyright material that be what the new clause that have speak to would deliver together they refute the tech sector claim of legal uncertainty while provide transparency and enforcement capability for creator ultimately transparency be the main barrier to great collaboration between ai developer and creator notwithstanding some of the unambitious government amendment the opposition amendment would provide the long overdue redress to protect our creative industry by require transparency and widening of the scope of those who be subject to copyright law the amendment would protect our professional creator and journalist preserve the pipeline of young people look to make career in these sector themselves and cement the uk as genuine creative industry superpower maintain our advantage in the field of monetise intellectual property one day we may make commercial advantage out of the fact that we be the place where company can set up ethical ai company we could be the envy of the world rise to support the bill and speak to new clause and table in my name the measure in the bill will unlock the power of datum to grow the economy to improve public service and make people live easy by modernise the way in which consumer and business can safely share datum the bill will boost the economy by an estimate billion over the next decade the bill will also make our public service more efficient and effective save our frontline worker from million of hour of bureaucracy every year which they can use to focus on keep we safe and healthy welcome the minister mission to update government for the modern digital age any responsible government must use datum to build an accurate picture of who they be serve it be because recognise the incredible power of datum that table my probe new clause on the need to record ethnicity datum for sikhs and jews if some community be invisible to public body how can we expect they to be serve equally table these new clause to put right wrong the ethnicity datum that public body collect be often patchy and incomplete and for sikhs and jews specifically datum be not collect at all jews and sikhs have be legally recognise as ethnic group for over year since the mandla dowell lee case in that be reaffirm in the equality act where they be consider as both religious and ethnic group as those be protect characteristic we would expect public body to be instruct to collect information on jews and sikhs routinely especially when public body use ethnic category only to deliver public service but they be not that be why this really matter jews and sikhs therefore face discrimination which be far evidence by the race disparity audit that find no datum on sikhs in the dataset assess across government in recent year jews and sikhs have be record only in religion datum however that datum be rarely collect to good standard if at all it exclude secular and non practise jews and sikhs and be not use by public body to monitor and reduce inequality or provide public service how be we mean to tackle discrimination and inequality if jews and sikhs be invisible to policymaker new clause in my name would therefore make it statutory requirement for public body to collect ethnicity datum and ensure that within that they collect datum on jews and sikhs who be currently exclude new clause be on more specific but no less important point the health inequality that persist as result of inadequate datum it would specifically target the provision in the bill about the register of birth and death in order for that datum to be meaningful surely the minister will agree that jewish and sikh death matter if they be not include what message be that send to both those group the pandemic reveal the tragic consequence of fail to recognise health inequality among different ethnic group many expert in public health now accept that we be too slow to recognise that some ethnic group be die at far high rate than other the office for national statistics belatedly start analyse covid relate death datum by religious group short term exercise that have since be discontinue and find that sikhs die disproportionately from covid even after adjust for other factor not only that it show that sikhs be affect at different rate from other predominantly south asian group demonstrate the inadequacy of the exist ethnic category the same go for jews who be often miss from datum that the nhs collect as acknowledge in report from the nhs race and health observatory publish in december british jews also die from covid at almost twice the rate of the rest of the population and certain genetic condition also have high prevalence among jewish people such as breast cancer in ashkenazi jewish woman the new clause would take forward one of the race and health observatory key recommendation to mandate the inclusion of jewish as an option for ethnicity allow we to collect essential datum for track health outcome it be of course right that we do the same for the sikh community will the minister commit to accept these new clause give the significance of the argument in their favour england and wales be behind other country on this issue the united states department of health and human services have record ethnicity on death certificate record for decade and scotland have record ethnicity as part of the death registration process since in october during the pandemic the previous government announce plan to adopt the measure in england too but despite warm word from the then minister for equalities the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch now the leader of the opposition no action be take be pleased that the government be take forward important change to ethnicity data collection within the death registration process but as it stand the process would pretty much replicate the in build bias against jews and sikhs who do not have their own specific category in ons design ethnicity questionnaire they simply rely on exist record information for ethnicity my new clause would change that make it mandatory for public body to collect ethnicity datum for jews and sikhs after all it be not religious difference that make ashkenazi woman more susceptible to breast cancer the distinction between record ethnicity versus religion be the difference between jewish and sikh community be count and not good quality datum save life that be why introduce ten minute rule bill on the issue in the house last year and my campaign have wide support from both the jewish and sikh community do not intend to press my new clause to vote but hope the government will bring forward change that mandate the inclusion of jewish and sikh ethnicity category for the purpose of public service delivery fully support the bill mission to unlock the power of datum to transform life that datum must be fair sikhs and jews must no long be invisible to policymaker rise to speak in support of amendment table by the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel in my name and that of other congratulate he on the amendment as it be worth talk about the amendment be quite simple in way as its key point be that it prevent the transfer of uk user datum to jurisdiction where data right can not be enforce and there be no credible right of redress the core principle of datum protection law be accountability yet current uk law allow uk company to transfer user datum to their international partner in jurisdiction where there be no credible appeal process and no predictable rule of law that basically put power in the hand of those who have sign contract contain standard datum protection clause those contract create the illusion of protection but in reality the data transfer be unsafe either because the prospect of state interference be real or because the condition for protection of datum transfer simply be not present we rely too much on the idea that somehow contract law in the uk will protect the datum be transfer across to other country but this be about country where such rule do not apply transfer datum to regime such as china for example be not just threat to uk citizen privacy but national security risk british citizen personal information health record financial detail biometric genomic or location datum could be access under china national intelligence law which compel organisation to co operate with state intelligence work in secret that be not speculation it be the well know and establish law in china this be not only about china but use that country as good example because it be regular abuser of datum we have be unbelievably stupid across the board in company and so on in assume straightaway that the rule would apply to chinese company and they would enforce they they can not because under the national intelligence law they be tell you will provide datum as and when we require it from whatever source you have access to the situation right now in ireland be interesting the irish data protection commission recently fin tiktok the not inconsiderable sum of million and find that the company have illegally transfer datum from user in the european economic area to china the commission determine that chinese law offer no essential equivalent to protection on gdpr due to state surveillance law and the lack of judicial oversight that be not lone example have write on number of occasion about the stupidity of the contract law cover thing such as pregnancy test and covid test which be dominate by chinese company call bgi it be the big genomic company in the world and it be allow to hold about of the datum gather for test for use back in china we now know that china be use that datum work with ai company to develop test and to reference weakness in certain ethnic group we see what be already go on in xinjiang where troublesome ethnic group be be deliberately target through genocide to get rid of it but it be also look at area and weakness in europe that may well in turn be usable we have allow it under this contract to have that datum presume that it would be protect it be not protect at all it have simply be transfer and be now be use for military purpose those be just two example but it be interesting that ireland have already take action let we not forget the shanghai police database leak in in which the personal datum of over billion chinese citizen include criminal record and biometric detail be leave openly accessible online for over year without any enforcement action or government accountability congratulate the hon gentleman on table the amendment because it go to the heart of what it mean to be democracy that value the rule of law privacy and the dignity of the individual it rightly state that no third country can be consider adequate if it lack credible mean for judicial protection administrative redress or statutory legal remedy it align closely with the high threshold set by the schrems ii judgment and it ensure that the standard do not fall below those we uphold and be uphold among our friend in the european union my right hon friend make formidably important point the amendment highlight one of the extraordinary weakness of the bill which be that it in effect reverse gdpr on large number of citizen protection to reiterate the point he gently make that enormous fine will not stop tiktok because it operate under legal compulsion even though it pay million it will continue to commit the criminal offence for which it have just be convict agree with my right hon friend that be the peculiarity the minister know only too well about the nature of what go on in country such as china chinese company be frankly scared stiff of cut across what their government tell they they have to do because what happen be quite brutal we have to figure out how we protect datum from ill use by bad regime use china as an example because it be simply the most powerful of those bad regime but many other do not observe data protection in the way that we would assume under contract law for example bgi harnessing of the datum it have glean from covid test and its dominance in the pregnancy test market be staggering it have be officially allow to take of the datum but it have take considerably more and that be just one area genomics be huge and vital area right now because it will dominate everything in our life and it populate ai with an ability to describe and recreate the whole essence of individual so this be not casual or small matter we talk about ai be use in the creative industry have vested interest because my son be in the creative industry and would support what have be say by many other about protect they but this area go whole quantum leap in advance of that we may not even know in the future from the nature of who they be who we be talk to and what their vital statistic be this amendment be not about one country it be about provide yardstick against which all third country should be measure if we be to maintain the uk standing as nation that uphold privacy the rule of law democracy and accountability we must not allow datum to be transfer to regime that fundamentally do not share those value it be high time that we do this and be glad to see the minister nod hope therefore that he might look again at the amendment out of old involvement in an organisation that he know be still part of he might think to himself that maybe this be worth do or find some way through do not resile from my view just because have become minister just as the right hon member do not when he become minister he make an important set of point do think however that they be already meet by the change in the schedule to article which be not an exhaustive list of thing that the secretary of state may consider the point he refer to be certainly thing that the secretary of state could and should would argue consider be grateful to the minister and hope that that might find its way on to the face of the bill with little more description but understand that and acknowledge that he do as well although we will not press this to vote hope that the government realise that we sometimes have no comprehension of how big and important the power we be up against be or of how they dominate their own produce company in every international market we must wake up to that and understand the real threat not just to the ability to create but to the ability to exist as who we be at that point we may come to term with this have listen to the minister we have work together on many issue to do with both russia and china hope the government will think again and come up with slightly tight version in line with the amendment table by the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel have table new clause which be about health and institute new public interest test there be an exist test but it be not very accessible or useful nowadays will explain why probably the large or the most sensitive database in the united kingdom be the one hold by the nhs almost every human being in our country be on file somewhere hopefully for beneficial and clinical reason in the nhs have have series of medical issue in the last few month and be astonish by how much datum be hold about that will be the same for all of we guess that database be fill with the most vital private and intimate detail about all our life and if it be go to be sustain it be important that it retain the confidence of patient and of citizen as whole the truth be that the information commissioner be not convince that the bill go far enough in protect we and the nhs datum and if the minister have time at the end hope he will be able to comment on whether he be persuade by the information commissioner that we should move far this datum which be intimate and private as have just say can also be the basis of major advance in human welfare we can imagine all sort of way that our interest as human being be be advance by the use of that datum every day be think for example of the search for covid vaccine which be lead by british scientist and partly base on the datum that be available from the nhs we should be celebrate that that scientific research be essential but there be threat to this database as well and in my view it come from two separate source first there be hostile or even friendly state actor secondly there be private interest who want to use the datum not for human welfare though that might be fig leaf that they use but for private profit that can not be right give what that datum have be create for the hon gentleman make an important point datum can be susceptible and its breach be breach of privacy do he agree that one danger in new clause about the datum on individual sex at birth be that it risk breach someone privacy if they have keep that fact private and that datum become public knowledge through the mean be discuss thank the hon member for make that important point and of course she be right go back to this question of the threat to the database which be not simply the product of my imagination they be real first all datum can be monetise but this database be so large that huge commercial interest be now try to get access to that health datum do not want to cause offence to any hon member all of whom know follow the rule but it be interesting that nearly million from the private health sector be make available to over different member of parliament do not suggest that any member have do anything inappropriate that would be wrong of but one wonder how almost million be find by private sector that have no commercial interest in pursue those investment secondly on commercial interest will the minister confirm that at no stage will any datum or any other aspect of the nhs be up for sale as part of negotiation with the united states on trade deal will the government provide some guidance on that if the house reflect on private sector interest which be not necessarily in the good interest of humanity and how they make money there be an interesting thought about health insurance party represent in the house be lead by an individual who have suggest that we should end the way that we fund the nhs and replace it with an insurance system if the insurance industry get access to the datum hold on all of we by the nhs they would be able to see the genome of each person or of group of people and provide differential rate of insurance accord to people genetic make up that be serious threat do not think the party that have recently enter the house have think that through but company provide insurance could commercialise that datum that be one reason we must never follow the track towards national insurance system to replace the nhs yesterday the secretary of state for health and social care tell the house that we will not be privatise the nhs and welcome that statement reference have already be make to palantir the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis mention it early and the contract that we inherit from the previous government it be extraordinary that palantir company that have deep root in the united states defence establishment should be handle the datum of million of people when its chair have say that he be completely opposed to the central principle of the nhs and that he effectively want private health system in the uk how could million contract to handle our personal datum have be hand over to such company lead by person whose purpose seem to be to destroy the principle of our nhs how our datum be handle should be our decision in the united kingdom the information commissioner say that it be important that this precious and vital datum which be personal to each of we should be protect against any possibility of cyber attack however there have already be cyber attack qilin the way be pronounce it make it sound as if someone be try to commit murder but there may be another way of say it be russian cyber criminal group that obtain access to gb of private information hold by company deal with pathology testing that be an enormous amount of datum qilin attempt to extort from the company that hold the datum financial interest do not know whether enough provision be make in the bill for the protection of our datum so suggest that there should be new public interest test with report to parliament within six month which we can all debate and then examine whether the legislation have go far enough finally the information commissioner say three thing first the database must retain public confidence medium discussion and opinion polling show that people be lose confidence that their personal datum be secure and understand why that should be the case secondly datum should be properly protect and build from the beginning with proper safeguard against cyber attack thirdly and perhaps most importantly the bill refer to an effective exemption for scientific research as my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah say private company and perhaps us company might use the idea of promote scientific research as fig leaf to hide their search for profit from the precious commodity datum that we have because we create our nhs that be very dangerous thought and the information commissioner say he be not convince that the definition of scientific research in the bill be sufficiently strong to protect we from predatory activity by other state actor or private company the hon gentleman be make an excellent speech and some very perceptive point remind he that previous attempt by the nhs to create single datum standard have all fail because the gps do not believe that the security level be sufficient it be not just the information commissioner the gps refuse to co operate which highlight the powerful point that the hon gentleman be make be grateful to the right hon gentleman for make that very serious point when the clinician whose duty be to protect their patient say they be not convinced about the safety of datum be hand over to central database we have to listen to their reaction do not intend to press my new clause to the vote but it be important that we continue to debate this matter because this enormous database which can contribute to the general welfare of all humanity must be protect in such way that it retain confidence and ensure the security of the whole system with that leave the discussion to continue on other matter call pete wishart thank you ever so much madam deputy speaker other matter we shall attend to speak in support of new clause to and new clause which enthusiastically support believe that those new clause represent our very last chance to guarantee at least bit of security for our creative industry in the face of what can only be describe as the almost existential threat pose by generative ai this be critical listen to the minister very carefully but this lackadaisical approach and the progress he be intend do not properly reflect the scale of the threat and challenge that our creative industry be currently confront with accept that we have come long way in this debate and accept the positive tone the minister try to take when deal with these issue believe that he be sincere about try to find solution he want to get to place where both the ai company and the creative industry be satisfied be not entirely sure that we will get to that place but wish he all the good in those effort we have certainly come long way since the first statement we have in this house be sure that hon member will remember the belligerent way in which the secretary of state present that first statement be surprised that he be not here today he be almost say to the creative industry that they have to take it on the chin in order to satisfy this government attempt to find some economic growth which they have so far find elusive in the shape of unfettered artificial intelligence and that we should just get on with that agenda yesterday speak to local author in mid sussex chris bradford he have write number of brilliant child book include the young samurai series which my own child enjoy few year ago go back to the point make by the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage chris tell that he be not against ai he can see that it have us but that what we be see be blatant theft do the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart agree that the creative industry be part of the answer to grow our economy agree with the hon lady and will give she personal example should have declare my interest as set out in the register throughout at least the past five decade artist have work with the technology that be available it be the first thing they turn to when go to the studio to make new recording the first thing they do in the film industry be to look for all sort of innovation it be absurd to suggest that somehow people who work in the creative sector will not embrace this new technology and use it for all its worth so fully accept what she say want to refer to the public campaign because be sure be not alone in have an inbox full of correspondence from concerned constituent our constituent be right with our artist in the creative sector when it come to this issue member will know that have be evangelise on the value of copyright and intellectual property right for at least two decade and always feel be have quite job in get through and reach our constituent but by god have they get it now they understand and appreciate that our gold standard copyright regime underpin our success in the creative sector right around the world it be our ip right and copyright that ensure that the artist our constituent love and on whose behalf they write be properly reward for the work they produce and recognise for the wonderful thing they bring forward be it not ironic that just at the point when our constituent be start to get it and see the value of copyright we have government who be move away from the central principle of that copyright regime and be maybe at the point of water it down when it have give we sustained success over all these year want to thank the campaign and the artist for do this because it have move the government on significantly we have now see they abandon their preferred opt out mechanism when it come to their consultation and we welcome that instead of resolve the debate it seem that the government be kick it into the long grass to this no man land of economic assessment report and consult with the sector that might take year and we have not get year we have artificial intelligence in the form of the bot and training machine hoover up all our cultural heritage at this very moment the matter be press and we need solution now the government have introduce new clause and and do not think anybody have any problem with they it be good to see that they have finally put brake on some of their ambition with the opt out what we need be real action let we hear more about the dynamic licensing and right enforcement system that the minister continually go on about if we have to have legislation it have to be do quickly we have not get year leave to do all this it could take up to month just to get the report that the government mention in their amendment beyond that legislation have to be design present to parliament and debate here and then it have to be implement we have not get the year to do that every day that we delay more of our cultural heritage be scrap reuse and monetise by tech giant we can not afford to sit back and wait for year our creator deserve protection now not after irreversible harm have be do the amendment that we have before we today offer that protection that be what the creative sector want and hope that the government will take the amendment seriously our creator simply ask to be treat fairly and compensate for all the work that they do and they want to have the right to control how their work be use transparency be where we now hoist our flag and it be the hill we fight on it be the most practical solution and there be no technical reason why we can not have full transparency there be no reason why artist creator and inventor should not know that their work be be scrap by generative ai bot there be no reason why we can not make sure that we deal with this and make sure that all our musician have the right to assert their right the only thing stop that be fear of anger the tech lobbyist but we must take seriously the property right of million creative who contribute billion to the uk economy every year the right hon gentleman have rightly refer to creative throughout the debate as have say in early debate be the secretary of the parliamentary group of the national union of journalists and we have express our concern about journalist and photographer whom we also represent the union position be very straightforward espouse adherence to copyright but also to openness and transparency and regulation of the mechanism that will be use in future for scrap in particular this be now have an impact on the quality of journalism on which our democracy rest the right hon gentleman be right to remind we about journalism what have be notable along with the clumsy way in which the government have approach these issue be the unity that exist throughout the creative sector take on board what be happen in journalism we have see some fantastic coalition of interest emerge from all this that be another positive development and just hope that the government be satisfied when they see the outcome ai and creativity can work together give an example of that to the hon member for mid sussex alison bennett we have all be encourage to think that there be divergence between the position of those in the creative sector such as artist and the position of those who be involve in the tech sector and in particular ai there should be an approach that work for everyone involve the ai company know that our content be immensely valuable they refuse to pay for anything at present not because they do not understand the value but because they have spot an opportunity to hoodwink government around the world into believe that they should not have to pay for an essential resource one of my colleague have conversation with representative of the ai sector she be very enthusiastic about the idea that there would be an enormous amount of growth in this country if they be able to adopt what they want so she ask what would you like they reply we want the bbc archive for free in circumstance of this kind we need to think not only about transparency but about the second stage which be license without the opportunity for small creator to have the power to permit and therefore to be pay all this will be for nothing the hon lady be spot on the minister continue to go on about licensing arrangement and think that be the territory we want to move this on to we need to hear more about the government ambition right now and about what they be plan to do the hon lady should have look at the submission to the consultation from the big tech company such as openai it be horror show an opt out be even too far for they have enjoy work with labour colleague during these debate they have say all the right thing and think that as usual they recognise some of the difficulty in the sector but appeal to they now to support in particular new clause if it go to vote it be no good just say all the right thing this be about vote in the right direction there be no other chance because this be the only opportunity we must offer some protection to our creative sector over the next few year because nothing else will appear during that time we will all become involved in the consultation and we will all be take part in the legislation when it come here but that be year away this be the only thing that we can do to offer some support to the creative sector and urge everyone to support the new clause welcome the opportunity to speak in support of the bill and to address some of the amendment propose particularly government new clause and new clause be entitle report on the use of copyright work in the development of ai system be pleased to note in subsection that the report will the effect of copyright on access to and use of datum by developer of ai system for example on text and datum mining also note that developer be specifically break down into individual micro business small business or medium sized business it be right to provide for that level of granularity similarly note that the report will consider and make proposal in relation to the disclosure of information by developer of ai system about their use of copyright datum to develop ai system and how they access that copyright datum for example by mean of web crawler be pleased to see discussion of licensing include in the report and an exploration again in granular detail of the impact of licensing system on all level of developer however would have like to see an equal level of granularity for copyright owner to understand the effect of proposal outline in subsection subsection state that in prepare the report the secretary of state must consider the likely effect of proposal in the united kingdom on copyright owner as well as developer and user of ai system although note that new subsection refer to individual microbusinesse and so on feel that there be little vagueness as to whether this level of granularity be afford to copyright owner as well that be not intentional it be exactly the same level of granularity that we will go into in our reporting well will just throw the rest of my speech away then shall persevere will the report explore the effect of the propose solution and the result protection on individual creator yes micro creative business yes and small publisher yes right so can push it far no there seem to be an awful lot of david attenborough tiktok video but it be not he wonder whether this measure will apply to personality right and about the definition of small right owner will just squeeze that in personally be in favour of do something about personality right but it be one of the thing that be in the consultation to which will we respond it be one of the thing for which we will need to legislate in the round perfect ask the secretary of state what reassurance can be give that small creative include microbusinesse and small creative business will be consider in the report so that they can have confidence that the system finally apply will work for they particularly when we consider an individual early career think of ed sheeran strum away in his bedroom in his pre fame day and how they can protect their copyright work against the global tech giant new clause address the economic impact on both copyright owner and ai developer and want to switch from talk about copyright owner to try to defend the ai industry if we do not get the control right we risk the mid and long term success of the ai industry if we do not get fair solution for the creative and ai industry we risk reduction in the quantity and potentially in the quality of human create datum and an increase in ai generate creative datum will briefly segue because we be develop lot of ai create content that might be subject to copyright report recently point out that of spotify content be now ai generate people might remember the big hoo ha when an ai generate image win photographic competition which cause lot of disturbance but lot of creative skill be involve in how the photographer develop and produce that image no it be not photograph but it be in category of its own feel that be also creative content and copyright datum so there be grey area if we start to generate more and more ai create datum and less and less high quality human generate datum because of the challenge to the creative industry there be danger that ai model will start scrap and training on ai generate datum potentially lead to reductive spiral into mediocrity with some even suggest that this could result in model collapse on new clause and encourage the house to consider the impact of not employ proposal such as licensing and protect the generation of new human create content give the risk pose to ai model and developer in the long term will briefly comment on amendment and table by my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah she ably outline the reason for the amendment so will not go into lot of detail but want to point out that get the definition correct will prevent loophole whereby ai company can misuse personal datum by claim that their commercial development be scientific research the amendment would provide transparency on the use of datum by researcher in order to maintain confidence in this country ethical legal and professional high standard in academic research hope the minister will give careful consideration to the point have raise be now go to give my whip my hon friend the member for cardiff north anna mcmorrin heart attack because be go to refer to amendment to to clause on article of the uk gdpr which be close to my heart she be not to worry though read those amendment with great interest and understand the back up they would provide but although be newbie mp as read they in my understanding give the little work do in my previous job with regulator feel that they be more like secondary legislation they could be consider for the future particularly amendment which include some very welcome addition however when it come to primary legislation feel that the bill work well as it stand want to go off piste little bit more to support my hon friend the member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill in try to make sure that we have accurate datum and fill in the gap that exist in database it be important that we address that issue and her new clause and be worthy of consideration equally approach new clause with an open mind because it be vital that we collect biological sex datum to protect woman and tran people but as read it have develop sense of unease because how do the determination of accuracy of datum impact on the individual and if we start look at those two protect characteristic what about the other feel it be little bit of slippery slope wonder if would have to go around with my baptism certificate to prove my religion and how would prove my sexuality be afraid develop grow unease about that new clause but support the idea of accurate data collection for both gender identity and biological sex which be very important will not bore the house with information about where the alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme sit in male and female body but there be reason why man do not get drunk or rather why woman get drunk more easily oh be go to tell everyone because have start to do so will make it relevant adh in man be locate and primarily active in the stomach while in woman it tend to be in the liver so in man alcohol get break down before it even get into the bloodstream it have nothing to do with body mass ratio understand biology in that way highlight the importance of get accurate datum for health and scientific research and with that extra knowledge about alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme will leave it there rise order from the next speaker there will be five minute time limit as many member will be aware my constituent ellen roome know only too well the tragedy that can take place as result of social medium be pleased that ellen join we in the gallery to hear this debate in her pursuit of jools law in ellen come home to find her son jools not breathe he have tragically lose his life age just in the follow month ellen battle the social medium giant and she be still battle they to try to access his social media datum as she seek answer about what have happen lead up to his death be grateful to the shadow minister the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer for raise this in his speech in her search for answer ellen find herself block by social medium giant that place process ahead of compassion the police have no reason to suspect crime so they do not see any reason to undertake full investigation into jools social medium the inquest do not require thorough analysis of jools online account none of the social medium company would grant ellen access to jools browse datum and court order be need to access the digital datum which require eye water legal fee the legal system be unequipped to tackle the complexity of social medium in the past when love one die their family would be able to find such thing in their possession perhaps in child diary in school book or in cupboard however now that so much of our life be spend online personal datum be keep by the social medium giant new clause in my name would change that although understand that there be technical and legal difficulty the minister and the secretary of state meet ellen and this morning along with the hon member for darlington lola mcevoy and we be grateful for the time they give we my new clause will not go to vote today but we will keep push because ellen and other parent like she should not have to go through this to search for answer when child have die understand that there be provision in the bill that will be step forward but we will keep push and we will hold the government and all future government foot to the fire until we get result it be great to meet this morning although be sorry it be so late and so close to report stage wish it have be early we be serious in the meeting this morning we will do everything we possibly can to make sure that coroner understand both their power and their duty in this regard and how they should be operate with family and the prosecute authority as well if necessary we will also do everything we can to ensure that the technical company embrace the point that they need to look after the family of those who have lose love one when they be young thank the minister for his intervention he be absolutely right there be clear issue of process here there be differential approach across the country different coroner take different approach and different police force take different approach the word of ministers have weight and hope that coroner and police force be take note of what need to happen in the future so that there be proper investigation into the death of child who may have suffer misadventure as result of social medium on related matter new clause would gain the support of parent like ellen up and down this country we need to move far and fast on this issue of social medium and online safety as this government promise on various other thing and be pleased that my party have very clear position on it will now turn to the issue of copyright protection hold roundtable with creative in cheltenham which be home to many tech business and ai company the creative industry in my town be also extremely strong and hear lot of concern about the need to protect copyright for our creator the industry be worth billion or more every year remain concerned about the government approach the effect of these issue on our culture should not be understate we would be far poor both culturally and financially if our creative be unable to make living from their artistic talent believe there be still risk of the creative industry be undermine if the government remove protection to the benefit of ai developer trust that minister be listen and know that they have be listen over the many debate we have have on this issue if they be to remove those protection they would tip the scale in favour of ai company at the cost of the creative industry when we ask ai company and people in tech where the job be go to come from the answer be just not there the amendment table by my hon friend the member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins would reinstate copyright protection at all level of ai development and reinforce the law as it currently stand it be only fair that when creative work be use for ai development the creator be properly compensate the government have make positive noise on this issue in multiple debate over the last few month that be positive sign and think that in all part of this house we have develop consensus on where thing need to move but creative remain uneasy about the implication for their work and be await firm action minister may wish to tackle this issue with future action and understand that it might not be deal with today but our amendment would enable that to happen they also have an opportunity today nothing would send strong signal than government support and support from member from across the house for my hon friend amendment and implore all member to back they rise to speak to new clause and but first let say that this be very ambitious and weighty piece of legislation most of we can agree on section or huge chunk of it but there be anxiety in the creative industry and in the medium particularly the local medium which have have very torrid time over the last few year through brexit and the pandemic thank uk music the news media association and directors uk for engage with on this issue and the minister for his generosity in afford time to back benchers to discuss it ai offer massive opportunity to make public service and business more effective and efficient and this will improve people life however there be fundamental difference between use ai to manage stock in retail or distribution or for make scientific breakthrough that will improve people health and the generative ai that be use to produce literature image or music the latter affect the creative industry which have consistently see fast and more substantial growth than the overall economy the creative industry gross value add grow by over in real term compare with the overall uk economy which grow by around fifth between and that be why the government be right to have identify the creative industry as central plank of their industrial strategy and it be right to deliver an economic assessment within month as outline in government new clause and welcome all that know it be not the government intention to deal with copyright and licensing as part of the bill but because of the anxiety in the sector the issue have become conflate scrap be already happen without transparency permission or remuneration in the absence of current adequate framework the pace of change in the sector and the risk of tariff from across the pond mean it be imperative that we deal with the threat pose to the creative industry as soon as possible we be now face tariff on uk film go to the usa which increase that imperative welcome the government commitment to engage with the creative industry and to implement programme to protect they follow consultation would welcome an overview from the minister in his summing up about progress in that regard the more we delay the bad the impact could be on our creative sector be also concerned that in the government correct mission to deliver economic growth they may inadvertently compromise the uk robust copyright law instead we should seek to introduce change so that creative work can not be scrap by big ai firm without provide transparency or remunerate the creative behind it failure to protect copyright be not just bad for the sector as whole or the livelihood of author photographer musician and other it be bad for our self expression for how robust the sector can be and for how it can bring community together and invite we to ask the big question about the human condition allow creator to be uncredited and undercut with their work strip of attribution and their livelihood dilute in wave of synthetic imitation will disrupt the creative market enormously we be not talk about that enough it be tempting to lure the big us ai firm into the uk give the economy sugar rush and attract billion of pound worth of data centre yet in the same breath we risk significantly drain economic value from our creative industry which be one of the uk most storied pillar of our soft power none of this be easy the eu have grapple with create framework to deal with this issue for year without find an equitable solution do not envy what the government must navigate however ask the minister about the report that emerge over the weekend and whether the government be move away from an opt out system for licensing which creative say will not work will that now be the government position harness the benefit of ai economic social and innovative be not diametrically oppose to ensure that the right of creative be protect we must ensure transparency in ai as cover in new clause so that tech company some of which be in cahoot with some of the more troubling aspect of the us administration do not end up with the power to curate an understanding of the world that reflect their own peculiar priority big ai say transparency will effectively reveal its trade secret but that need not necessarily be the case as my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett say simple mechanism to alert creator when their content be use be well within the ability of these sophisticated company they just need the government to prod they to do it the government be work hard know that they care passionately about the sector and the economic and social value it bring look forward to hear how they will now move at pace to address the concern have outline even if they can not do so through the bill the minister refer in his opening remark to the fact that the bill have be long time in its gestation it be very nearly two year since the first meeting of the bill committee which attend to take through what be pretty much an identical bill at that time it be uncontroversial and the opposition support it indeed support it today there be lot of measure we have not discuss because they be universally accept such as the national underground asset register smart data provision and the relief on some of the burden of gdpr congratulate baroness kidron who very successfully attach to the bill amendment to address different but vital issue protection of the creative industry with respect to copyright therefore support new clause to which be essentially baroness kidron amendment that be pass in the house of lords the minister say that it be not the intention to legislate at this time that the government want to wait and be consult and that they have table two amendment however one of the measure be to conduct an economic impact assessment which the government would always have have to do anyway and the other be to commission report into such thing as technical standard and transparency as the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart have point out that will simply delay thing even long and this be an issue that must be address now because generative ai model be currently scrap and use material in our view the law be clear the minister ask why we need new clause if all it say be that people should obey the law and if we also believe the law be clear one of the reason it be so important be that we can enforce the law only if we know that it be be break that be why transparency be absolutely vital it be only with transparency that right owner can discover the extent to which their content be be use by generative ai and then know how to take action against it absolutely agree that it be not that the creative industry be against artificial intelligence indeed lot of creative be use it lot of they be develop licensing model however for some it be an existential question on the point about transparency the law be the law it already exist however the law can be enforce and people can be punish only if action that break our current law come to light do the right hon gentleman agree that this be another reason that new clause be essential completely agree the hon gentleman have state the case in order to enforce the law we have to know who be break it there be all sort of legal action already under way but this issue be about the extent to which scraping be go on agree with the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell on the importance of newspaper and the press the press face the particular problem of retrieval augment generation phrase do not think would necessarily be introduce which be the use of live datum rather than historic datum if historic datum be use it often produce the wrong result the big tech company therefore rely on retrieval augment generation which mean use current live datum that which be the livelihood of the press it be absolutely essential for publisher that they should know when their material be be use and that they should have the ability to license it or not as they choose the issue the right hon gentleman be address be the immediacy of the threat within the journalistic sector at the moment miss the opening remark by both front benchers because be in the debate on the personal independence payment but be sure my hon friend the minister be as eloquent as ever in advocate for the government amendment he be very persuasive fellow however those amendment be merely about publish report in month time that be all there will be part of the journalistic sector that will no long exist in month time as result of this legislation completely agree do not doubt the minister sincerity in want proper close examination but this matter be urgent new clause and the associate measure simply state the law as it currently stand and give right owner the essential ability to know when their material be be use so that they can choose whether they wish to license it and if they do not to take action against its use there be only one other point want to raise today as number of speech have be make in this debate that have very eloquently set out the case for each of the new clause include by the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins and indeed by the chair of the culture media and sport committee my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage for the other concern that want to raise the minister will need to put his other hat back on for moment early in the day he be speak as the minister for creative industries arts and tourism about the threat from the possibility of tariff on the film industry obviously we be concerned about the general question of us tariff and there be talk about try to achieve trade deal in the president word beautiful trade would mean that the uk be protect however we be tell that one of the price that could be attach to such deal could be relieve the burden of regulation on tech company be afraid that we know how the tech company define burdensome regulation in their view copyright be burdensome regulation not legal obligation or moral right of rightsholder hope the minister will make it clear that we will not sacrifice the right of creative industry and copyright owner in order to obtain trade agreement and that at the same time we will not dilute other very important digital legislation such as the digital markets competition and consumers act which understand be also potentially on the table will not speak any long because the case have already be make will say only to the minister that although it be clear that new clause to command quite lot of support on both side of the house have no doubt that the government will defeat they if they choose to do so tonight however he will be aware that they be originally make in the house of lords and he may find it hard if that house choose to push the amendment through would not like to be back here next year once again try to put through data bill because this one have fail rise to support the government amendment and new clause particularly new clause which address the relationship between artificial intelligence and copyright and which strongly welcome by slightly broaden the scope of the bill the amendment demonstrate ministers attention to this press detail and reflect some of the comment by colleague and the creative sector the exist legal framework with regard to copyright be not fit for purpose in the face of new and develop ai technology colleague who have much great expertise and knowledge than have contribute to this debate but want to offer reflection and draw attention to the experience of an individual one of my constituent as believe it highlight the real human impact that big tech company can have in run rampant over copyright law my constituent susan be an author she have have of her book and she calculate more than million publish word use by meta without her consent the pirating of material have serious human impact on those in the creative industry susan life work and source of income be downgrade and devalue almost instantaneously her intellectual property be access without her permission and use to inform an ai system design to mimic her work susan describe that to and say that she feel violate as if someone have come into her house and steal her thing and she be not alone have be contact by other professional in the creative industry in my constituency who have also have publish material use without their consent by ai local author have have their work harness through an online library of pirated book and local illustrator say that her work be scrap to train an ai model with image and video take from website and social medium without her permission that practice be widespread and plainly wrong even to lay observer who be not verse in technical expertise yet rightsholder be often impotent against big tech company and their sizeable financial and legal asset observe that there be an issue of territoriality here we have actually manage to get carve out and protect this country from deepfake for example if something be make abroad it can not be use in this country do my hon friend agree that we should be able to have similar carve out for creative such as her constituent and my constituent so that if ai generate material be make elsewhere it can not be deploy in this country in order to preserve proper legislative framework to protect the right of our creative my hon friend highlight very strong issue agree that our current copyright law be basically be infringe on and people who be rightsholder be unable to seek the recourse that they fully deserve under the law there should be carve out so that if there be illegal content in this country people should have recourse to the law and be able to protect their own copyright material be pleased to see the government commit to action on this complex issue hope that time will be allow in the house for we to scrutinise this issue and to investigate properly the impact of policy option which will be consider as part of the consultation understand the complexity of legislate in this area but those in the creative industry want to see action now which be understandable we must create system that can feasibly and effectively enforce exist copyright law bring transparency in the use of material by ai system and remunerate right holder support the government plan to do this through primary legislation with proper scrutiny of the measure rather than through an addendum to broad piece of legislation however appreciate that there be balance to be strike where growth be support in both the creative and tech industry but creative must never be expect to forfeit their right to serve that purpose as my constituent be at pain to point out real people and real livelihood be already be impact by unregulated ai it be crucial that we get this right and provide much need legal certainty to protect intellectual property in the creative industry this must happen soon because while infringement of copyright law go unaddresse it be those in our vital creative industry who be lose out rise order many people wish to speak in this debate so before call the next speaker ask members please to be mindful when take intervention will now impose four minute time limit we live in rapidly change world like everyone else be sure that be guilty of hand my datum to organisation every hour of every day oblivious to the impact on my privacy be also guilty of absorb and use content assume that it be trustworthy and that it have be obtain fairly on the other hand my generation have be fortunate to have see the introduction of social medium and the online world and to have experience the time before it which perhaps provide we with level of scepticism about what we see and an ability to switch it off and distance ourselves from the onslaught to our sens that digital content can provide like other intervention of the past we be now at crossroad where we must pause and not simply plough on the bill give we the opportunity to make it clear to the tech giant that we be not give they everything that we have create that they can not own our child and that we value our datum as part of our identity some of the amendment give we great opportunity to improve the bill to make the most of this moment in time and to make sure that we do not leave people behind we know that child brain continue to develop until they be in their early we know that young people development lead they to be risk taker in their adolescence and teenage year and as adult we sometimes have to take decision to curtail their fun to protect they my own child have enjoy social medium from the age of but as the sector develop and our understanding of its addictive nature improve it be critical that we reflect that in law lift the age of consent for social medium data collection as in new clause will help to protect our child at the time they need it it be unimaginable to lose child and to do so in the circumstance where the reason behind their death be unclear which be why sign new clause table my hon friend the member for cheltenham max wilkinson which would allow bereaved parent access to their child social medium content this should not be necessary give that gdpr and privacy right do not apply to those who have die the fact that we even need such legislation call into question the motivation of tech giant and tell we where their interest lie urge the government to support this and welcome the assurance today that more work will be do trust be at an all time low not only in the government but in other authority such as the nhs as ai change how we interact with the state commerce and each other the public should have right to know how and when ai be involve in the decision make transparency matter which be why be support the new clause propose by my hon friend the member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins we know that if we use each other content we must pay for it or at least credit it if we be not profit from it we know that if we do not we infringe that copyright so why should tech giant probably base in some far flung place have right to scrape that content without knowledge or payment the idea that they even need to train their system off the back of people who have use their talent and time and make their living through creativity be obscene really must speak strongly against new clause have be overwhelm by the scale of distress bring about by this awful proposal it be cruel and it completely undermine the privacy of people who be transgend at time when they be already feel victimise those who have transition socially medically or surgically be protect in law and we be tell that the supreme court decision last month do not change that but new clause do if it be pass sex at birth would be record on drive licence or passport out every trans person whenever they buy an age restrict product change their job travel abroad or even come to parliament to visit their mp not only be this fundamental breach of privacy but it be potentially dangerous they would be prevent from travel to country with poor record on right and they would be at high risk of suicide and self harm than they already be constituent say this be direct attempt to erase from the public record please reject this new clause in the short time available to want to speak to four amendment on two of they would like to urge the minister to think again on one be in total agreement with the minister that we should oppose it the other be one that want to draw to the house attention first join the chair of the culture media and sport committee the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage the chair of the science innovation and technology committee my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah my hon friend the member for south derbyshire samantha niblett and the indomitable baroness kidron who join we today from the gallery in encourage the minister to look again at amendment on ai and copyright we know that this problem will come back and that we need to move at pace represent walthamstow the home of william morris the creator and maker and creative abound at least william morris could protect his wallpaper pattern with the ai technology we see now move so quickly unless we stand up for british copyright technology we will be in very different place the minister say that if we do not pass new clause we will still have copyright law tomorrow and he be right but we will not have the tool to deal with the technology we be deal with now this issue be about not just the elton johns the ed sheerans the richard osmans or the jilly coopers but the thousand of creator in our country it be their bread and butter nobody be oppose technology but they be say that we need to act more quickly hope to hear from the minister what he will do in this area new clause which have not be select be about the question of transparency and will help creative exercise their right briefly want to support what the hon member for mid dorset and north poole vikki slade say about new clause have always support the appropriate collection of datum but this be not an appropriate collection of datum it be targeting of the trans community which be deeply regressive praise the government for what they be do with schedule and wager that nobody else in this chamber have look at it the victims and prisoners act receive royal assent in may section of the act provide mechanism to delete datum that have be create as part of malicious campaign of harassment schedule be technical amendment to gdpr law that will make that act which get cross party support possible to enact for parent and carer the thought that someone who disagree with they might use the auspex of social service to try to remove their child because of that disagreement be impossible to comprehend it be nightmare that have live through myself thank to my local authority be still live through it because the record create by the person who do this to remain on the statute book along with the allegation that be risk to my child because of the view that hold the primary intent of the man who make this complaint be to trigger an investigation into my private life the judge who convict he of harassment say that it be one of the bad example of malicious abuse in public life that he have see the judge demand that the file be stricken as do when it first come to light and when the man be subsequently convict of harassment however waltham forest council continue to argue that they have to retain that datum to protect my own child from this be an example not of how datum be use to safeguard but how datum can be use to harm by its existence it be not benign matter to have such record associate with one name anyone who have ever be to know that the question be your child know to social service be not neutral inquiry not have way of remove datum design to harass will perpetuate the harassment my local authority have not label the father who be mps in my borough in the same way but it argue that it must retain this datum about under section of the children act regard child who might reasonably be consider at risk of harm from an individual to add insult to injury the council have not offer to delete this datum but tell that can add to it note to dispute the claim by the person who have be convict of harass about my fitness to be parent and then the council might consider include the note add more datum to file therefore rather than remove it that will keep the link between my family these allegation and the gentleman who harass in the first place have never receive any form of apology or acknowledgement there have always be strong ground and legal process to remove malicious record it be also right that we set high bar as the act do this consequential amendment in the bill should now mean that the government can use the affirmative resolution to make that law reality we can not delete the misogyny at the heart of waltham forest council response but we could finally delete the record and those of other like they and move on with our life order call steff aquarone my new clause would ensure that alongside the creation of digital verification framework there would be right to use non digital id digital exclusion be major challenge for many community around the country include in north norfolk part of the answer be to improve digital education and bring those number down but as age uk rightly say it will never be possible to get everyone online the progress we make in the digital age must ensure provision for those who will not be support by it or that they be not leave behind or exclude old people be not the only one who struggle with digital exclusion poverty be also significant driver study in show that more than half those who be offline earn less than year the government tell the lords that if it turn out that people be be exclude they could consider legislate but how many people earn less than year will be take business through the court perhaps as far as the supreme court to secure their right why be we wait for it to go wrong place the onus on vulnerable people to generate test case and legal precedent when we could put this matter to bed once and for all with this simple addition to the bill will also speak in support of new clause it have become abundantly clear to we all that we can not trust the social medium giant to keep our child safe in fact would go as far as to say that they have very little interest in keep child safe the algorithm that drive these platform which be design to keep user scroll for as long as possible to maximise ad revenue can be deeply damaging to child and young people it be important to emphasise just how pervasive the content stream can be not every hon member may have experience it but pervasive target content be not the same as child see something distress on the news once see if only fleetingly there be the potential for they to be expose to unsubstantiated misleading or even traumatic content or version of that content over and over again every few swipe as the algorithm realise it can suck they in keep they scroll and make profit for its social medium giant that be not what social network set out to do but it be what they have become whatever the social medium giant tell the government or the opposition whether it be too complex it would cost too much or the flux capacitor be not big enough that be just rubbish if we simply remove the right to process personal datum for under we would remove the algorithm ability to target they with content base on what they say and do if the social network care about child wellbee they would have do that already hope that today we will finally take the action necessary to protect the next generation overall my view on the bill remain broadly similar to the frustration express month ago on second reading there be important commendable and sensible stuff in the bill and welcome that but what be not in the bill be more frustrating as it could have put it in much well position to harness the power of datum we could have address the litany of failure in public sector datum use that the government own review outline just month ago we could be equip our civil service and public sector with the talent culture and leadership to make we global trailblazer in data drive government it be really frustrating that the bill do not contain any of the step necessary to make those improvement if we use datum well we do government well be sure that the whole house and all our constituent be keen to see that as all hon member in the chamber know datum be the dna of our modern life it drive our economy our nhs and our public service often silently but ultimately powerfully for too long outdated datum infrastructure across the british state have hold we back cost we billion and drain frontline resource this ambitious bill set out to change that so it should be welcome for our nhs the bill will mean fast and safe care more transferable and accurate patient datum could save hour of staff time annually reduce duplicate lab test prevent up to death each year from medication error and improve overall patient safety and outcome that be real impact it will also free up million hour of police time let officer spend more time on our street not behind desk the national underground asset register as have be mention could bring billion to our economy by prevent costly infrastructure delay and accident the bill will seek not just to cut red tape but boost research protect personal datum and allow scientist and online safety expert to well access information to keep we all safe welcome that on government amendment on artificial intelligence and the creative industry we have all see the potential of ai but that promise must not come at the expense of those who create in that regard thank the dozen of constituent who have contact about their concern welcome the government recognition of the complex intersection between ai and copyright and the need to get this right it be clear that we must tread carefully and base any change on robust evidence be therefore pleased that the government be commit to publish full economic impact assessment and report to parliament on key concern such as how ai developer access copyright material the transparency of their method and licensing will also continue to support equity with its work on the principle of personality right new clause propose mandatory recording of sex at birth across all public authority the new clause would require all public authority whether the nhs which could potentially understand or the driver and vehicle licensing agency which certainly could not to record and retain people sex at birth even when someone have gender recognition certificate the new clause would seemingly require that regardless of context purpose or relevance that feel neither proportionate nor respectful of exist legal framework or the trans community at this difficult time it be important that we acknowledge that transgender non binary and intersex people already face considerable barrier in public life and many of my constituent have share with in recent week just how much fear and uncertainty they be experience rush amendment and change without dialogue with those impact be not in any way welcome and could have very negative consequence finally on the theme of privacy proportionality and protect vulnerable people will the minister say whether any step will be take by his department to end the collection and sharing of sensitive personal datum when people use police public university or other website to report crime or abuse and the subsequent sharing of that datum with third party through track pixel the use of such tool mean people inadvertently share information with advertiser hope the government will look into that and take it seriously be glad to add my name to new clause to table by my hon friend the member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins speak to new clause on the age of datum consent currently in the uk the minimum age of digital consent the age at which child can consent to have their datum process be the new clause would raise the minimum age for social medium datum processing to mean social medium company would not be able to process the datum of child for their algorithm hope that that would allow child to enjoy many of the educational benefit and relevant service that social medium can offer as well as continue to enjoy the freedom of engage with friend but without the risk of addictive algorithmic content the mental health issue associate with social medium use in young people particularly child should be treat as public health crisis the government be miss vital opportunity with this legislation to reform how social medium be use by not include provision around child online safety the bill offer an important opportunity to start the process of remove harmful social medium mechanism and as such urge the minister to support the new clause new clause to would ensure transparency in how ai system be train and give right holder more control over the use of their work concern about the impact of ai on the creative industry have be raise hundred of time by my constituent and have be raise those concern in parliament for year in my westminster hall debate back in february on artificial intelligence and intellectual property right raise my concern about the bypassing of copyright law in relation to ai and intellectual property with the former conservative government however the former minister blame the lack of the former government action to introduce regulation for creative associate with the rise of ai on the political turmoil in the tory leadership at that time and their neglectful attitude towards leadership be mirror in their attitude towards introduce protection for creative in this space their conclusion from my westminster hall debate be not to legislate in period of political report february vol and the need for more deep consultation which do not materialise think we can all be glad that the chaos of that government be in the past however we be yet to see the introduction of thorough and robust copyright law relate to artificial intelligence which be fundamental to the success of the uk world lead creative industry hope this government will act upon that today by accept the new clause wish to reiterate the importance of these new clause in ensure that ai model be bind by exist copyright law increase datum and identity transparency for crawler and model and empower creator to take legal action against developer who fail to comply the creative industry like all sector will have to adapt to accommodate ai but the industry be capable of and already make progress with that creative have largely accept that ai generate content will have its place in the market and they be already use ai to enhance their work by drive efficiency and extend their reach to new market however solid regulatory framework which could be create with the addition of these amendment be essential to protect their right and ensure that they can take part in value creation and retain control over their work my colleague and believe that exist copyright law should be enforce to protect the uk creative industry which be world lead british export it be recently reveal that nearly youtube video include material create by globally recognise british musician news channel and artist have be scrap into dataset use to train ai model content from over creative have be find in that dataset yet consent be not seek from single impact creator to use their copyright work this be not unique case ask creative about their experience with ai and copyright hear repeatedly of negative experience include one individual who have image take to train ai model without their knowledge it be clear that ai offer fantastic opportunity for our economy however it must supplement and grow industry rather than replace they wholesale be delighted to be call to speak on report of the data use and access bill draw member attention to my membership of the writers guild of great britain before enter this place work as freelance screenwriter create drama for adult and child might add that child be the hard audience to please it use to be that we have five minute to hook they but now it be more like five second speed be the subject of my contribution today warmly welcome the minister engagement on how good to protect our peerless creative industry in that spirit be pleased to see new clause and and the commitment to address the fundamental issue of transparency at the moment ai company do not have to tell anyone what they be steal from the internet from whom they be steal and why they be steal it although appreciate the government position that they want more time worry that in the gap between this bill become law and new bill that address transparency and copyright come forward everything that can be scrap will be scrap twelve month be long time and plenty of time for ai company to continue crawl over original copyright material without care in the world for some part of the creative industry month will be month too long necessity be the mother of invention and without legal instruction for ai company to reveal what they be use free of charge there be surely no incentive for the ai industry to come up with the solution to make it simple for original creator and collect society to assert their right new clause to include call for the operator of web crawler and ai model to legally disclose what they be do right now although understand why the government may not support the new clause will the minister at least commit to place clear power to regulate in the bill the creative industry be nervous spook by the previously state preference for an opt out model and such move would calm nerve and indicate that the government understand the pace at which the situation be develop and recognise the need for action recently here in westminster björn from abba speak in favour of clear transparency perhaps the sad abba song be the winner take it all inspire by break up in the band between the as and the bs we must ensure that this be not divorce of two industry that lead to the creative partner be leave with the equivalent of the coffee table and the dog the tech industry need we more than we need it so it should be honest tell we what it be do behind our back and pay up when all be say and do this government need to send message now that we have the back of our creative industry and that legal protection be our absolute priority rise to speak to new clause but also want to associate myself with the many right hon and hon member who have speak up for our creative industry our most talented and creative mind have not be get fair representation from the government up to now and this have be very interesting well informed and hopefully influential debate today new clause be about privacy safety and provide dedicated complaint procedure for individual include victim of modern slavery domestic abuse gender base violence and for other at risk of serious harm if their personal datum be mishandle this be not theoretical question last november the independent report on lola domestic abuse victim whose home address be leak to her ex partner by company that obtain restrain order she say that she be leave fear for her life as the open rights group have lay out in its briefing the information commissioner office be not function as it should be in case such as this have many example include how charnwood district council send detail of the new address of an abused woman directly to her abuser at her former address so that her abuser know where she live yet people place at risk in this way currently have no mean of challenge the information commissioner office if it fail to take the right action which happen too often new clause simply propose dedicated procedure to support vulnerable people make complaint and right to appeal to the information tribunal route currently available to large tech firm but not to the people harm by their practice hope that ministers will take these proposal up on other amendment fully back the liberal democrats on new clause to which be sign up to personally will abstain from vote on the liberal democrats new clause and on the conservatives new clause this be because although be minded to increase the age of digital consent from give the wide implication of harmful content and datum that can be collect and use to do harm my discussion locally with parent and young people in brighton pavilion have lead to want to properly include both group in any decision on what that new age should be give that it would cut people off from social medium we must have rapid and real process of deliberation on this issue as soon as possible that be not just consultative but collaborative finally new clause be of serious concern to my constituent and agree with they and transactual that it would constitute gross violation of privacy right by create mass outing of trans people subsection of this new clause even go so far as to seek to revert historical change make to someone gender marker urge the government to reject this and to act far to protect trans right more broadly rise to speak to my new clause and amendment furthermore would like to make note of my steadfast opposition to new clause which do not simply change data collection it propose to mark and track individual base on sex at birth regardless of their live reality legal recognition or consent no one not government not public authority not politician have the right to define who another person be only the individual can do that this be fundamental principle of dignity and respect that transcend political view and legal debate we must reject new clause move on to my new clause it be widely accept that ai have already ingest everything on the internet whether it be music film or book yet there be no legal requirement on these company to disclose what they have use make it difficult for musician and author to enforce their right and crucially to be pay for their work so urge the minister to give commitment to legislate for transparency to protect the creative industry note the government new clause and as starting point but we both know that we want to see thriving licensing market between content creator and ai developer transparency commitment today would enable that license market as creator would be in position to enforce their right and demand fair pay there would be certainty for ai developer remove the risk of mitigation in the future without transparency there be no incentive for ai firm to reach agreement with creator and billionaire own tech firm will continue to rip off musician filmmaker and author do my hon friend agree that new technology should be tool to improve life not just mechanism for funnel more wealth and power into the hand of already super rich corporation do he agree that the bill would benefit from go even far in provide great transparency my new clause would do that so hope the government be take note this debate be not just about economic right last week learn about the holocaust survivor renee salt whose book mother promise be rip by ai with similarly name book appear online day after the original be release there can be no starker contrast than renee share her most traumatic experience for the benefit of other and computer algorithm steal from holocaust survivor to profit from her suffering we must stand up for the human creativity that help we to process the world we live in or the world will become much dark place table amendment which relate to safe data transfer in order to confront glaring weakness in our current data protection regime through the continue transfer of uk user datum to jurisdiction that can not and do not provide basic legal protection or enforceable right the need for the amendment be not theoretical under current rule company often rely on set of contract international data transfer agreement as proof that data transfer will be adequately protect however that assumption be increasingly prove to be false the irish data protection commission fin tiktok million after an in depth inquiry into its transfer of european economic area user datum to china the irish authority find that tiktok have fail to adequately assess whether chinese law provide level of protection essentially equivalent to that guarantee under gdpr the general data protection regulation the ruling be possible because there be no credible legal remedy in china law such as the national intelligence law the cyber security law and the anti terrorism law compel organisation to provide access to datum without judicial oversight or meaningful recourse for individual china be unable to provide level of protection essentially equivalent to that guarantee in the data protection act and in this bill contract alone do not protect user when the legal system of the receive country be incompatible with fundamental right this amendment introduce clear rule where there be no meaningful enforcement of datum right no independent judiciary no administrative remedy or no legal path to challenge unlawful access such country will be deem unsafe for uk datum transfer the bill must address this critical blind spot contract alone can not ensure user right in jurisdiction that offer no legal safeguard this amendment provide principled legally sound and urgently need response to real world threat hope that the minister give his background will take these issue seriously and meet to look far at how we can close this loophole our nominal minimum age for social medium usage in this country come from well mean piece of american legislation originally pass in the age do not have to be back in it be go to be but it be change to with the birth of gdpr the age do not have to be the default be various country include germany the netherlands and ireland select but we select that mean that at the age of people can sign up to social medium have their behaviour track for the purpose of target content and ad start their own channel have multiple id and make decision about what detail of their private life they share many people believe that because of brain development be too young to make some of those decision reliably and that there be real downside risk and danger from the combination of social medium and the ready availability of handheld electronic device for child there be addictive feature an effect on sleep an ease of make unwanted content rabbit hole to fall down and corrosive content that play on the insecurity of adolescence objection to raise the age to be normally centre around worry that pro social application will be hit and that there will be unintended consequence such as child not be able to seek help if they in an abusive family or to find information about contraception or whatever else they may need to know indeed those be some of the reason why back in the age of become and those reason come up again here in the debate over gdpr as such word new clause to demonstrate how we could do it without lose anything by have very broad category of exemption however even with those exemption the government would still be able to say be sure they will and will say some of the same thing about new clause shortly that new clause be technically inadequate word badly and contain the wrong exemption and that there would be unintended consequence new clause though which be table by the official opposition be almost impossible to argue against because it contain the default position that these exemption will change under its provision those change would be subject to review which would ensure that all those consideration be take into account want to speak briefly to amendment which will not move but which deal with age check whatever the nominal age might be it be irrelevant if nobody actually enforce it the online safety act say that social medium company should enforce their own age limit but that be often do through very simple method of self declaration that be easy to circumvent there be question about how we interpret the wording of that act which say that age check must be do consistently do the right hon gentleman agree that self regulation just do not work in many industry we can look at sewage report in the water industry or at the ai and tech company which will use our datum and not tell the regulator that they be do so there be real need to strengthen the regulation the hon gentleman tempt to broaden the debate which do not think you would encourage to do at this late stage madam deputy speaker however he make very important point about self regulation in this sector the public parent and indeed child look to we to make sure we have their good interest at heart the online safety act may only say that age minima should be enforce consistently rather than well but do not think the will of this parliament be that it would be okay to enforce minimum age limit consistently badly what we mean be that if the law say right now that the age minimum be or if it be in the future or whatever other age it might be company should take reasonable step to enforce it there be more checking than there use to be but it be still very limited the recent report on instagram teen account say that all its avatar be able to get into social medium with only self report birth date and no additional check that mean that many thousand of child under the nominal age of be on social medium and that there be many more thousand who be just over but who the platform think be or or perhaps or that of course affect the content that be serve to they either ofcom or the ico could tighten up the rule on the minimum age but amendment would require that to happen in order for company to be compliant with the ico regulation the technology do exist although it be hard to implement at the age than at of course the recent ofcom change be all about those under the age of but it be possible and that technology will develop far ultimately this be about back parent who have balance to strike they want to make sure that their child be fully part of their friendship group and can access all those opportunity but also want to protect they from harm parent have reasonable expectation that their child will be protect from wholly inappropriate content rise to speak to new clause and and briefly to new clause the liberal democrats believe that the government have miss trick by not include in this bill strong provision on child online safety it be time for we to start treat the mental health issue arise from social medium use and phone addiction as public health crisis and to act accordingly we know that child as young as nine and be watch hardcore violent pornography by the time they be in their teen it have become so normalise that they think violent sexual act such as choke be normal it certainly be not when we be teenager girl be starve themselves to achieve an unrealistic body image because their reality be warp by airbrush image and kid who be struggle socially be suck in by content promote self harm and even suicide one constituent tell set up tiktok account as year old to test the horror and half day later have self harm content dominate on the feed do not search for it it find what kind of hell be this it be time we give our child back their childhood new clause would help to address the addictive nature of endless content that reel child in and keep they hooked it would raise the minimum age for social medium datum processing from to right now mean that social medium company would not be able to process child datum for algorithmic purpose they would still be able to access social medium to connect with friend and access relevant service which be important but the new clause would retain exception for health and educational purpose so that child who be seek help could still find it we know that there be correlation between great social medium use among young people since and worsen mental health outcome teacher tell regularly that child be struggle to concentrate and stay awake because of lack of sleep some be literally addicted to their phone with of year old girl in the uk display problematic social medium use the evidence be before we it be time to act now not in month and not in couple of year the addictive nature of the algorithm be pernicious and as legislator we can do something about it by agree to this new clause it be time to go far this bill do not do it but it be time that we devise legislation to save the next generation of teenager from the horror of online harm ofcom new child code provide hope that someone tick box to say they be an adult will no long be enough to allow access to adult site that be good place to start let we hope it work if it do not we need to take quick and robust action to move far with legislation give the nature of the harm that exist online also support new clause and strongly urge the government to support it no parent should have to go through the agony experience by ellen roome lose child be horrific enough but be refuse access to her son social medium datum to find out why he die be second unacceptable agony that must be change and all isp should be compel to comply new clause would make that happen hear what the minister say about coroner but strongly believe that legislation be need with requirement to release datum or provide access to their child account for any parent or guardian of someone under who have die there be as far as can see no reason not to support this new clause briefly echo call from across the house to support new clause in support of our creative creativity be uniquely human endeavour like other have be contact by many creator who do not want their output steal by ai company without consent or permission it be vital that ai company comply with copyright legislation which clearly have to be update to meet the requirement of the brave new world of tech that we now live in rise to confirm my agreement with new clause and and associate myself with the speech of the hon member for south devon caroline voaden have have several email on the protection of copyright information and revenue stream for artist include from yvonne who contact recently it be essential that the creative art and intellectual property be protect and that artist be properly compensate if their output be use in ai on new clause and the case for raise the age of consent for datum processing from to have be well make across the house so will not repeat the point make but will say that it be essential that we give our child their childhood back they need to be protect from the toxic content to which they be be expose by social medium and online new clause to and new clause would place transparency requirement on ai company to report on what information and datum they have use from where and with what permission that be essential to hold the ai company to account and to ensure that content holder and datum owner be inform and have adequate channel of redress for misuse of their information be sure that new clause be speak about while be out of the chamber but let say now that the right for our citizen to use non digital verification be key my mother who be in her late bless she would not have clue what to do if she do not have family to help she with her benefit claim doctor prescription appointment and so on we can not exclude million of our citizen who may choose not to have smartphone and not to be expose to toxic content online or who be simply not tech literate urge the government to ensure that we do not exclude million of our citizen also strongly support new clause but will defer to early speaker in that regard as for new clause many constituent have write to or speak to express concern about share their nhs and other private datum with third party such as palantir it be essential for this new government to adopt posture of support ethical transparent business practice for all supplier who provide service in our country we have already hear about the background of palantir do not know how true this be but some of my constituent believe or have read that during the prime minister first visit to the us after meet donald trump he visit palantir headquarters or one of its office urge the government to protect order the hon gentleman time be up rise to speak in strong support of new clause and new clause seek to raise the age of consent for social medium datum processing from to as the father of two young boy be deeply concerned about the way in which tech platform engineer addiction manipulate attention and shape childhood in way that parent and even government can not easily counter this be not hypothetical it be the reality that our child be live every day child aged to be especially vulnerable those social media algorithm do not just show content they shape belief reinforce insecurity and amplify harm whether it be body image filter content promote self harm or endless scrolling these platform be design for engagement not wellbee the new clause would not ban young people from use social medium it simply say that their datum should not be exploit for commercial gain without genuine inform consent by raise the age to for these specific practice we align with international good practice and the united nations convention on the right of the child with clear exemption for education and health platform this be targeted and proportionate reform that prioritise child mental health new clause deal with copyright compliance and ai as we all know the ai revolution be here but just as we would not let factory operate by steal its raw material from other we should not let ai model train on copyright work such as book music or journalism without permission or payment the new clause make one clear demand if an ai system operate in the uk it must respect uk copyright law regardless of where the server be base we be stand up for our creator for the author musician film maker and developer whose work give ai its power in wales alone the creative industry turn over billion in employ more than people let we not wait for lawsuit or damage to our industry the new clause provide legal clarity defend creator and affirm that parliament not silicon valley write the rule these liberal democrat new clause be principle practical and long overdue and urge all member to support they call the shadow minister it have be pleasure to hear the speech of members from across the house pay tribute to my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage and my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale who speak with passion about the protection of copyright in ai suspect that my right hon friend be look forward to see the back of the bill and hop that it do not return in future iteration my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith speak of the importance of ensure that datum do not fall victim to hostile state and hostile state actor my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds speak with knowledge and authority about this important issue and the challenge and practicality involve in ensure that we get it right for our child will return to the three theme that we have put forward the minister have repeatedly give assurance on the application of copyright with regard to ai training but the secretary of state create uncertainty by say in the ai copyright consultation at present the application of uk copyright law to the training of ai model be dispute when we create that level of uncertainty we need at least an equal level of clarity to make amend and that be partly what our new clause call for among other thing formal statement from the intellectual property office or otherwise do not see why it be challenge for the government to put that forward and deliver our new clause focus on the use of inappropriate social medium service by and on protection for child for those watch online will summarise the three position that have hear it seem that the government position be we do want to think about it so let leave thing as they be the lib dem position be we do want to think about it but let bring in blanket ban our position be very much think about it get it into workable and effective position and then improve the protection for our child would just like to clarify that we have think long and hard about this bill along with many organisation and charity to get it right that be good to hear will try third time because we try early the conservatives have clearly brief the press that they be angle for ban on social medium for it have be report in multiple place can the shadow minister confirm whether that be the conservatives position or not for the fourth time and as have say new clause would effectively create de facto position whereby there be restriction on the use of inappropriate social medium service by child it seek to tackle the challenge of implementation age verification and the scope of social medium it say that there need to be work to make sure that we can actually do so and that when we can we should move in that direction unless there be overwhelming evidence that it be not need such as with the shake out of the online safety act finally return to new clause sadly it have be widely misrepresent the law in this area be clear the equality act put in place obligation in relation to protect characteristic the supreme court say that sex mean biological sex and that public authority must collect datum on protect characteristic to meet their duty under the equality act the new clause would put that clear legal obligation into effect and build in datum minimisation principle to preserve privacy there would be no outing of tran people through the new clause but where public authority collect and use sex datum it would need to be biological sex datum as ever it be good to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker thank all right hon and hon member who have take part in the debate if do not manage to get to any of the individual issue that have be raise and to which people want answer be afraid that be because of shortness of time and will seek to write to they thank the official who help to put the bill together particularly simon weakley not least because he not only do this bill but all the previous version in the previous parliament he deserve long service medal if not something more important will start with the issue around new clause and and amendment the government completely share the concern about the vulnerability of young people online which lot of member have refer to however the age of be set in the data protection act remember because be member at the time it reflect what be consider at the time to be the right balance between enable young people to participate online and ensure that their datum be protect some change to protect child online be already in train as of last month ofcom finalise the child safety code key pillar of the online safety act guidance publish at the same time start three month period during which all in scope service likely to be access by child will be require to assess the risk of harm their service pose to they from july the act will require platform to implement measure to protect child from harm and this be the point at which we expect child user to see tangible positive difference to their online experience wish it have be possible for all this to happen early wish the act have be in different year but it be the act it be the new provision include highly effective age check to prevent child encounter the most harmful content and adjust algorithm to reduce the exposure to harmful content service will face tough enforcement from ofcom if they fail to comply the act very much set the foundation for protect child online the government continue to consider further option in pursuit of protect child online which be why the department for science innovation and technology commission feasibility study to understand how good to investigate the impact of smartphone and social medium on child wellbee this will form an important part of our evidence base will the minister give way be go to come to the right hon member amendment in moment the study be be lead by dr amy orben of cambridge university and it be support by scientist from nine of the uk premier university all with establish expertise in this field the study will report to the government this month on the exist evidence base ongoing research and recommendation for future research that will establish any causal link between smartphone social medium and child wellbee the government will publish the report along with the plan next step to improve the evidence base in this area to support policy making consider the extra work we be do hope members will not press their amendment will the minister give way be afraid that will not give way on new clause table by the hon member for harpenden and berkhamsted victoria collins we share the concern that child datum in education must be safeguard we have already commit to instruct the information commissioner office to produce statutory code of practice on the use of child datum by edtech service once the finding of their audits have be publish we believe that define the scope of the code in legislation now or impose six month deadline for its publication risk undermine that evidence lead process amendment table by the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds seek to ensure that platform adopt strong age assurance mechanism when design their service under the new child high protection matter duty in clause of course we subscribe to that policy aim but the clause already strengthen uk gdpr by require provider of information society service to take account of how child can well be protect and support when they be design their processing activity the ico age appropriate design code will be update to provide clear and robust guidance on how service can meet these obligation include through proportionate risk base age assurance where appropriate will take the right hon member intervention if he want he ask first but be afraid have to be very careful because have lot of question to answer very quickly want the minister to confirm that the ofcom child code to which he have refer be all about the age threshold they be very welcome move to filter out wholly inappropriate content that be design for and other very harmful content but they do not do anything for the initial threshold the age minimum at age the right hon member make fair point will the minister give way be terribly sorry but do need to crack on because have very little time have not yet mention new clause and amendment and let start by say that the government accept the supreme court ruling but it be paramount that we work through this judgment carefully with sensitivity and in line with the law we can not simply flick switch we must work through the impact of this judgment properly recognise that this be broad than datum use by digital verification service reflect the comment make early by the shadow minister the hon member for runnymede and weybridge dr spencer when he say that data accuracy be important thank my hon friend for give way trans people and tran lead group have be very concerned by new clause table by the opposition they have rightly describe it as an attack on trans people right and their privacy can the minister offer some reassurance that as well as oppose this amendment today the government will not seek to introduce similar legislation via other mean in the future we be oppose the amendment and be not intend to introduce similar legislation as say datum accuracy be important that be equally true for any datum use in digital verification service that be why the government be already engage in an appropriate and balanced range of work on data standard and datum accuracy we be already develop datum standard on the monitoring of diversity information include sex via the data standards authority follow review the office for statistics regulation publish update guidance on collect and report datum and statistic about sex and gender identity last year and all government departments be now consider how good to address the recommendation of the sullivan review which we publish that be the first reason why we will not be support this new clause or the amendment today simply we believe the concern regard the way in which public authority process sex and gender datum should be consider holistically take into account the effect of the supreme court ruling and the specific and particular requirement of public authority by contrast the new clause and the amendment would undermine the work the government be already do give the secretary of state new regulatory rule would undermine the exist process that ensure compliance with the uk data protection secondly the new clause be misplace because the bill do not alter the evidence which can be rely upon to prove sex or gender indeed it do not seek to alter any of the content of datum use by digital verification service instead the bill enable people to do digitally what they can presently do physically and it be for organisation to consider what specific information they need to verify in their particular circumstance any inconsistency between what they can do digitally and what they can do physically would obviously sow further division thirdly the new clause be unnecessary because it be very unlikely that digital verification service would be use in many if not all of the case specifically raise by or with hon member such as within the nhs to gain access to single sex ward or for screening or to enter other female only space we expect digital verification service to be use primarily to prove thing such as one right to work or one age address or professional or educational qualification which be not matter where sex or gender be relevant at all fourthly the new clause go significantly far than the finding of the supreme court finally the proposal have the potential to interfere with the right to respect for private and family life under the human rights act by require public authority to record sex as biological sex in all case regardless of whether it be justify or proportionate in that give circumstance in addition the amendment do not take account of the fact that the gender recognition act give those with gender recognition certificate level of privacy and control over who have access to information about their gender history as for amendment it will create further uncertainty as it appear to prevent use of clause in all case involve sex as have set out while understand the reason for table these amendment fear they would create legal confusion uncertainty and inconsistency also note that they be not part of the previous government version of this bill in which in nearly all respect this part of the bill be identical to ours give the narrow scope of digital verification service measure the need to consider this area holistically to ensure alignment with exist legislation and upcoming ehrc guidance and the breadth of work already be carry out hope the new clause and amendment will be withdraw there be one other amendment refer to digital verification service the liberal democrats new clause completely share their concern about digital inclusion which be also mention by the hon member for dewsbury and batley iqbal mohamed we have publish our own digital inclusion action plan but such obligation could be particularly challenging for business currently operate solely in the digital sphere for example online bank take blanket approach in the way propose would not be proportionate so urge that the amendment be withdraw on scientific research my hon friend the member for newcastle upon tyne central and west chi onwurah table amendment and amendment add further condition to the definition of scientific research understand her concern and we want to prevent misuse however the bill do not expand the meaning of scientific research and already contain safeguard such as in clause moreover the amendment replicate word from two external document include the frascati document neither of which be intend to be legally bind or to define scientific research be very happy to continue have these conversation with my hon friend but urge she not to press she the amendment on access to nhs datum which my hon friend the member for normanton and hemsworth jon trickett raise let just answer his direct question about the sale of nhs datum the secretary of state for health have say categorically that the nhs be not for sale and that patient datum be not for sale end of story hope we can put that one to bed on ethnicity datum my hon friend the member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill make valid point that we intend to pursue public body usually collect ethnicity datum in line with the office for national statistics harmonised standard the ons be currently review that and be sure she will want to feed into that process be afraid that have not have time to refer again to ai and copyright but this country be debate interrupt programme order february the deputy speaker put forthwith the question already propose from the chair standing order no that the clause be read second time question agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill the deputy speaker then put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that time standing order no new clause report on the use of copyright work in the development of ai system the secretary of state must before the end of the period of month begin with the day on which this

and have add to the confusion remove romford from our rightful place under the lord lieutenancy of essex it seem that change like this happen every few decade when new government take office and we be see that again today say to the minister let we do this properly and get thing right in havering we have much in common with brentwood our neighbouring town but not really with brentford in west london epping be on our doorstep but ealing be long way from our neck of the wood we visit southend but never go to southall what work for hampstead be not always what be require in havering and it be unlikely that my constituent could tell you where colliers wood be but collier row be cherished part of romford essex and have many rural part that feel like one be deep in the english countryside be not suggest that the people of havering do not value the important connection that we enjoy with the city of london and what be know as the east end of london because we do so many family include mine have move from the east side of london to essex over the past century and our link to london be vital to we for business work travel tourism and of course family connection not to mention go to the theatre in the west end come from borough that orbit the capital can tell the minister that the people of havering be not oppose to co operate with borough town and community to the east when it make sense to do so but greater london as region with an overarch mayor be too big and too remote to meet the need of borough such as havering which consider itself to be part of essex it be also very costly for we to be part of greater london as we pay ten of million of pound per year to the greater london authority that equate to vast sum for the gla precept per household an exorbitant amount of money that my constituent simply can not afford london wide policy be impose on we such as planning decision and of course the ultra low emission zone but we do not get the service that we be mean to receive they be completely inadequate with police be the bad example the hon member make important point about ulez in my constituency there have be huge concern about the creep of ulez though deny understand that there have be conversation between local council about thurrock join london do he agree that thurrock like his own constituency be essex through and through and should remain that way the hon gentleman be completely right havering and thurrock be neighbouring borough and we be essex through and through he be very lucky because his constituency do not have london wide policy impose on it so it avoid ulez and planning interference from the mayor of london it be free to make its own decision in fact as unitary authority commend the hon gentleman for what he say and we be certainly on the same page on this issue we barely see policeman in romford they be mostly second into inner london area and this be compound by the tri borough arrangement that merge havering barking and dagenham and redbridge we now get even few police on the street of havering may commend the hon gentleman in all the time have know he he have always be british to the core there be absolutely no doubt about that although be supporter of devolution many matter be devolve in northern ireland understand the complexity do the hon gentleman agree that devolution be only as useful as the people in place to carry out the job effective people be the key do he far agree that devolution must have community support and that regardless of whether it be in essex or strangford the general public must always have the final say the hon gentleman be completely right any type of devolution have to have the consent of the people have to say to you madam deputy speaker that do not believe that the current greater london devolution arrangement really have the consent of people in havering think that if there be to be referendum tomorrow they would overwhelmingly vote to leave greater london and be unitary authority but maybe there be other option that be why this debate about havering borough and essex devolution be so pertinent today and look forward to the minister response to my argument to return to what be say about the police all but one of our police station have be close and my constituent be deeply unhappy with the lack of police cover we receive despite the huge amount we contribute financially to the greater london authority this be no fault of the dedicated officer who form the day to day rank and file backbone of our local police operation the local force be dedicate and determined to respond to and prevent instance of criminality that blight the locality but they be undermine by lack of the resource that we in havering pay for but simply do not receive indeed if you speak to my constituent they will tell you that they believe havering resident be in effect subsidise inner london area and through the greater london authority fund what believe have become london wide bureaucracy in city hall and associate london wide quango it be hard to see how the people of havering benefit from that and more often than not it have no relevance to local people in my borough whatsoever the reason for my adjournment debate be to ask the minister to please allow we to look at alternative now be the time to consider havering future with devolution for what be term greater essex now be implement this must surely be the right moment to examine change that would give the people of romford hornchurch upminster and rainham hope that we could be part of something that well suit our local need and go with the grain of our historical identity if the government truly believe in genuine devolution hope the minister will agree that local people should determine what be good for they and borough such as havering must surely have the freedom to consider all option for our future request that the government open up meaningful conversation with the people of havering about devolution for essex that could include havering so that we can look sensibly and in detail at idea for change let make one thing crystal clear the freedom travel pass for pensioner be often cite as one of the benefit of be part of greater london as if the mayor of london provide it to we for free which be not the case my borough pay million to buy in to this scheme it have always do so and will always continue to do so we pay million of pound for the privilege but will always defend and support the freedom pass as our old folk deserve the benefit it give they commend my hon friend on an excellent speech do he agree that borough such as mine bromley face many of the frustration that his constituent in havering face and that we be also contribute huge amount of money to the mayor of london absolutely my hon friend be completely right the people of romford feel the same as the people of bromley ruislip and other part of outer greater london who be disenchant with the current settlement on the freedom pass have long argue that the scheme should be extend to all council area where transport for london operate indeed the elizabeth line run to shenfield and the central line run to epping other tfl service operate in local authority area that go way beyond the supremely outdated boundary of greater london to the west side of london in particular so any travel scheme like the freedom pass must surely be offer equally to all the local authority that tfl serve the freedom pass for old people and other should not be use as reason never to change the structure of local government in what call the capital region of the uk which now stretch far beyond the greater london boundary of the may also make it clear that do not agree with the creation of super unitary authority believe they will prove to be very remote from town village and neighbourhood and from real people who want local democracy to be truly local with councillor who genuinely know their ward and understand the area they represent if the government be however set on go down this path as they be now do in essex believe it be inevitable that borough in greater london will go in the same direction at some stage with amalgamation of council take place already there be much discussion about this prospect with varying proposal be put forward and openly speak of by think tank among local government official and in london elite circle of course let say here and now that if havering be destine for eventual merger with east london borough in some new super council configuration that be not something my constituent or would support we in havering be town and country borough with an essex heritage and special character that local people cherish and will fight to retain so base on the principle the government be already pursue with the creation of expand unitary authority ask the minister to please consider havering for collaboration with for example our neighbour essex local authority such as brentwood or epping forest both of which be also serve by transport for london and have much in common with romford and havering it have be evident for long time that havering be at crossroad and it be now become abundantly clear to anyone who dare to look that either we continue on path of future london integration or we take new path in line with our heritage which fully realise our essex root culturally economically and politically alongside the people of havering strongly argue that this second path be the one we should and indeed must walk it could just be much to the surprise of many of my constituent that the new labour government plan for devolution and local government reorganisation provide the opportunity we need to finally take control of our own affair and have our future restore to become part of essex local government structure once again it would be great plus for the people of romford if it be labour government that actually deliver what they have be ask for for so long this be what have be fight for over the course of my entire political life not as personal preoccupation but because it be what everyone in my constituency believe from local family and business owner to pensioner and market trader and indeed young people they all tell that be what they want they want their identity restore to be part of essex and have our local control away from central london and city hall it be high time that their voice be listen to and this opportunity be seize to shape havering and essex for the well believe that today we have once in almost century chance to look afresh at the old boundary of greater london that be construct six decade ago the entire region around our great united kingdom capital of london have change dramatically since those day and we should therefore seize this moment to be bold and look at option for change that local people would be happy to see thus give my constituent in romford hornchurch and across the borough of havering hope for much well structure of local government rightly determine and support by the people it be establish to serve be grateful to the hon member for romford andrew rosindell for secure this important debate and raise the question of havering borough place in relation to devolution in essex pay tribute to the hon member for champion his area and for the very clear passion that he have for the place he represent one thing that be special about parliament be that connection and the pride with which member speak about the place they live in and represent and absolutely hear that in every canter through the historic county of essex and just how rooted it be in that kind of county ceremonial historic identity accept that completely although our reorganisation in greater manchester be bit later in many of we still feel that we be lancashire to our heart even though we be part of the greater manchester combine authority and think it be possible to be proud of both we be proud in the way that we look to manchester and the success of that city region but proud too of our historical root in lancashire so think the two be possible the hon gentleman might find it useful to know that one of the first thing that we do upon come into government be change the way the county flag be fly for very long time the department that represent hold all the historic county flag for england in the department and whenever the historic county day come up through the course of the year that flag would be fly from marsham street at what would say be very average office block do not think that that quite give status to the historic county and it do not give the opportunity for member of parliament and visitor to see the county flag they have be transfer to parliament to the speaker office in addition to counties week to july when all the county flag of england be in parliament square the county flag will be fly in new palace yard on the day of each county think that be the appropriate place and hope member will search out their flag on that day identity and belong be really important as hon member will be aware the government have make it clear mission to extend devolution to all corner of england while fix the foundation of local government our work with council across greater essex demonstrate the strength of that ambition as we endeavour to establish new county combine authority for the area while deliver local government reorganisation the government recently conduct public consultation on our proposal to establish mayoral combine county authority across essex county council thurrock council and southend on sea city council as part of the devolution priority programme response to the consultation be currently be assess and will shortly make decision on whether to proceed with the necessary legislation subject to further consent from the council involve the three exist council area firmly form the currently propose footprint for the future devolution of greater essex as the consultation be conduct on that basis the three council along with the district and borough council across essex be also invite in february to submit proposal for new unitary structure for the county as request they submit an interim plan in march and we provide feedback to support the development of final proposal which be now due in september it be for the local council to develop those proposal and for the government to assess they on that basis it be currently not envisage that the boundary of greater london will be change or that the propose greater essex mayoral combine county authority will be expand although the latter would be possible at later date should it be locally desire and should statutory test be meet as for change the boundary of the council themselves across greater essex that will be for the council to propose if they wish as they develop and submit proposal to the government for unitary local government in that area we remain open to discussion with any council across england on its vision for its region and we continue to encourage discussion across council and area as we deliver on our ambitious agenda for local government hope that this brief and by no means exhaustive summary of our plan for greater essex devolution and local government reorganisation have provide helpful context to the hon member for romford understand completely his point about havering be anchor in greater london but hope he take some reassurance that the guidance we send out throughout the process have anchor two thing that he touch on in his speech first the administrative boundary be draw be about efficiency and the importance of have single tier of local government that people can hold to account and that be sustainable in the future but it be in no way intend to cut across the identity that people feel and be proud of no council should try to cut across the historic identity that local area feel secondly every council regardless of size or where it be in england should always root itself in local community and local neighbourhood the day of council be disconnect and remove from local community be long go and that empower local councillor to be the frontline community convenor that they stand for election to be question put and agree to house adjourn
