popular rumsey which be celebrate year on wendover high street in my constituency email to say we estimate the change come in april will add to our staff cost that we simply do have therefore we have

know whether he now regret the enthusiastic support he give the liz truss budget which do so much damage to our country public finance our budget in october last year start the process of sort out those situation look with interest at his website recently which have my plan section it be completely blank although that be probably well give that he so strongly support the liz truss budget there be at least bit of progress well that be no answer to my question whatsoever it be almost as if labour members have not realise that they be in charge and that it be their decision that be have this impact let tell the minister something else that rumsey report to the reduction in business rate relief will leave no choice but to raise price simply to break even far limit growth and accessibility for customer just do not know how much more the minister need to hear to understand the scale of the problem on our high street he talk of business rate reform but the only business rate change we

an end we have extend retail hospitality and leisure relief we have set out in the budget our plan to permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property on the high street from we be take measure to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour on the high street which his party could have do more to tackle but choose not to we be bring in new legislation to end the immunity for crime on

living wages what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the national minimum wage and national living wage on family in airdrie and shotts constituency what assessment his department have make of the potential impact of the national minimum wage and national living wage on family more than million worker be expect to receive pay rise due to increase to the national minimum wage in april protect the low pay in society after our change to the remit we accept in full the recommendation of the low pay commission which consider the impact of rate on business competitiveness the labour market the wide economy and the cost of living our impact assessment be available only by region estimate by constituency be not available but the simple truth be that worker in every constituency be well off under this labour government thank the secretary of state for that answer just yesterday parliament approve labour new deal for work people the big upgrade to worker right in generation this will see pay rise for more than work scot many in the airdrie and shotts constituency and marked improvement to term and condition which will be beneficial to our young workforce do he agree that with government commit to improve the pay term and condition of worker across the country the work people of airdrie and shotts will always get well deal with labour the plan to make work pay be core part of our mission to grow the economy raise living standard and create opportunity for all and there will be significant benefit for worker in insecure and low pay job in central scotland include in airdrie and shotts this plan be about make people stay in work it be about make work more secure and more family friendly improve living standard and put more money in worker pocket but it be also about show that politic can work for people who may have give up on this place as somewhere that can improve their living standard their life and those of their family for that be very proud of this government the increase in the national living wage in april clearly show that this labour government be on the side of work people in north durham and across the country and be make work pay can the minister tell how many family in north east england will benefit from the increase in the national living wage and national minimum wage next month thank my hon friend for his support around worker in north east england will feel the benefit of this direct pay rise know his north durham constituency well be no strange to chester le street and not only will his constituent get pay rise but his local shop his restaurant his pub and more will get what they need most of all customer who have get bit of money to spend last friday spend the day visit local shopkeeper in kelso many of whom employ their staff on the national minimum wage and the national living wage their big pressure just now be deal with this labour government national insurance hike they be face very difficult choice about whether they continue to employ people what be the message from the minister to those hard work local shopkeeper the thing would cite most of all to the hon member constituent be the doubling of the employment allowance in the budget and the threshold be remove which mean that some small business will actually be pay low national insurance contribution than they would have pay before the budget however never shy away from the fact that the choice we have to make in the budget be out of necessity due to the black hole that be leave behind be yet to hear any offer from conservative members as to how they would fill it at these question we will talk about triple compensation for victim of the post office horizon scandal only because the money be there it be not there under the conservative party we will talk about money for the steel industry stand behind that industry again money be promise but not deliver if promise be make the resource to do those thing have to be there they be not there under the conservative party they be under labour whether it be the increase in the minimum wage the increase in employer national insurance the increase in business rate or indeed the change make to the employment rights bill all of these measure collectively be negatively penalise many business across my constituency whether in keighley ilkley or far afield as result redundancy be have to be make or the price of product and service be have to increase and these business can not absorb the additional increase that this labour government be put on they do the government undertake any economic impact assessment of what all of these measure collectively would have on hard work business across my constituency as have say to conservative members before of course we be very sensitive to the aggregate impact of government policy because frankly have observe the conservative governments of the previous year think they completely miss this point and at many time have different departments do completely oppose thing want to say something specific on business rate no business rate relief be plan have the conservative party win the election the reduction to be an increase in what be in the national account again short term decision for short term partisan political benefit no serious plan for the future the hon gentleman will have see the figure from the insolvency service this week which be very interesting they show that few people have be make redundant over the past month than in the year before so be afraid that the doom monger of the conservative party have be prove absolutely wrong by the statistic that we have product safety regulations what step his department be take to help microbusinesse comply with the general product safety regulation the government be commit to support microbusinesse to comply with the general product safety regulation for northern ireland we have publish additional guidance for business and we will publish an update in the come week in the light of feedback we have receive we will continue to engage with business to ensure that they can trade freely across the uk business target the eu market may use the government export support service since october the department export academy have deliver eight free online gpsr training session to almost attendee thank the minister for his answer my constituent george stevens run microbusiness in lydd make handcraft string instrument it have be run for over year and he have many eu customer he be deeply worried about brexit relate red tape which be hold back his eu export can the minister give he an assurance that as result of the propose measure he will now find it easy to trade with the eu microbusinesse such as that of mr stevens be central to the government growth mission we be committed to strengthen our relationship with the eu and to tackle trade barrier and friction and we regularly engage directly with business and their representative organisation to understand the difficulty they face our export support service help small and medium sized enterprise navigate opportunity in eu market and get the practical help they need to do so for example the unlock europe programme which be launch in december as part of the export academy offer practical guidance to help uk business enhance their export potential to the eu our country very high electricity cost be another huge problem face business in my constituency and nationally reintegrate our power market with europe through the single day ahead coupling system would cost our country nothing save cost for business reduce carbon dioxide and make our power market more efficient will the minister take fast step to reintegrate our electricity market with those of our european neighbour thank the hon member for his tangential question relate to gpsr he make an important point about energy cost and we be work closely with the eu on how to build on that and of course the industrial strategy will also be look very closely at how energy cost can be bring down for business employment regulation if he will take step to reduce employment regulation for business the plan to make work pay be central to our plan for change to grow the economy raise living standard and create opportunity for all it will tackle low pay poor working condition and job insecurity create long term growth and investment to support business insight gain from our ongoing engagement with business will help we ensure proportionate and effective policy our plan to make work pay will ensure level playing field so that employer that be try to do the right thing be not undercut send survey about how the government have treat business to every register company in the weald of kent and they be terrified some of they four in five be less likely to hire follow soar taxis and the truly dire employment rights bill the regulatory policy committee find the government own impact assessment for the bill not fit for purpose will the minister conduct proper assessment of the damage the bill will do or should send he mine be always grateful for advice if the hon lady be conduct survey she might look at the one that say that of her constituent support the plan in the bill to bring in day one right for sick pay the importance of this bill can not be overstate we have plan to bring business up to standard where work be respect and people have security and dignity if the hon lady can not understand that then she need to get out bit more trade union recognition what step his department be take to support trade union recognition in the workplace the government be commit to simplify the process and law around trade union recognition so that work people have more meaningful right to organise through trade union of course refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests in this respect through the employment rights bill we be reform the process for statutory recognition application with exist threshold present too high hurdle in modern workplace they be increasingly fragmented we be also take step to strengthen protection against unfair practice during the recognition process which we debate at length yesterday in january bidfood food wholesaler and major employer in my constituency announce overnight that it would derecognise the gmb and unite the union remove the ability of thousand of worker across the country to collectively bargain through their trade union the union fear that bidfood worker could now be leave at risk of fire and rehire before protection in this government employment rights bill come into force do the minister agree that employer should not be try to dodge protection under the government plan to make work pay and will he join in support the gmb and unite as they seek to protect their worker at bidfood my hon friend will understand that can not comment on individual case but be deeply trouble by what he have say can be clear that the government be determined to reset industrial relation so that employer and trade union work together in partnership rather than in conflict as we have hear we encourage all employer to engage with union in the spirit of co operation and collaboration work in that way benefit employer and worker alike as he know the employment rights bill will end the unscrupulous practice of fire and rehire which have no place in modern economy and workplace so if any company be think of do that it should think again very much welcome the minister response after work in my mum and dad shop join the firm henry denny and be require to join the union be not sure about join but when do so find out that the union back as worker against the employer whenever they be bring in thing that be wrong so encourage everybody who join workforce to join union because it will protect they whenever they need help the hon member could not have put it well he have explain the benefit of trade union membership which be something that member on the conservative benches clearly do not understand hospitality industry call the father of the house what step he be take to support the hospitality industry what step he be take to support the hospitality industry we be create fairer business rate system reduce alcohol duty on qualify draught product and our forthcoming small business strategy will set out our plan to far support small business on the high street and beyond in addition through the hospitality sector council we be address with business strategic issue relate to high street regeneration skill sustainability and productivity and we have recently save the pint obviously the minister be work very hard but he look bit tired so may offer he some lincolnshire hospitality will he come and stay for glorious weekend in one of our farm cottage to enjoy our great sky and brace air and help our distressed farmer frankly they need the income the problem be that the government have abolish the furnished holiday let scheme which be tremendous encouragement for the countryside do not expect an answer now but will he consider approach his right hon friend the chancellor to see if we can reinstate that in the budget to help our farmer and the countryside unusually for the conservative party the right hon gentleman have make an extremely generous offer be almost as tempt by that as by the offer from my hon friend the member for doncaster central sally jameson to visit doncaster be happy to look at the issue he raise and will write to he with more detail the crusty cob bakery have be constant in east devon for the past year but last week the family run business close the door on all nine of its shop make over local people redundant the owner state panoply of issue from manufacture cost to reduce high street footfall and energy price but the kicker be the decision that this business secretary party have make to slam company with increase to the national living wage and employer national insurance contribution the effect of this labour government decision be set in and literally destroy work family business will the business secretary and the minister please give message to the crusty cob team who have just lose their job understand that this will be an extremely worrying time for employee of the crusty cob and their family gently say to the hon gentleman that we be offer discount to retail hospitality and leisure property as part of our business rate package we be go to reform business rate more substantially with permanently low multipli in that while it clearly will not help the crusty cob and its employee will help other business on the high street be slightly surprised that the hon gentleman should be so opposed to an increase in the living wage do not know whether that be his party policy also gently remind he of the datum from the office for national statistics which my right hon friend the secretary of state point out show more people in job this year compare with last year post office horizon compensation what step he be take to ensure that compensation be pay to people impact by the post office horizon scandal in timely manner in the past eight month we have treble the total amount of compensation pay and ensure that more than victim who have as yet receive nothing have now have some financial redress we be make up front fix sum offer and interim payment where possible to speed up the delivery of redress there be still lot more to do though and we remain committed to ensure swift and fair redress for every postmaster affect by the horizon scandal thank the minister for that answer he and will agree that the post office horizon scandal be one of the great miscarriage of justice in modern time but the problem with the post office and its injustice extend far beyond that some case relate to the precursor system capture which bear the same hallmark as those in the horizon scandal have be refer to the criminal cases review commission be afraid that the ccrc be famous for take year to come to obvious decision so can the minister tell that it will deal with this in month if not will his department intervene directly the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to raise the issue of capture as he will know we have publish our response to the independent kroll report on the capture software issue and the way in which the post office respond to the datum that come out of it we have be meet sub postmaster who use the capture system and who be the victim in that regard to talk through redress scheme with they we be also work closely with the criminal cases review commission and have make it clear to the post office that it must co operate with request from the ccrc so that we can speed up its deliberation on the case recently meet constituent who be former postmaster affect by the horizon scandal he have apply for compensation but feel that the process be take too long with unreasonable ask give the legal ruling that postmaster should be afford the benefit of the doubt what step be the department take to ensure that compensation claim be process fairly and without delay that could far affect the victim as my hon friend will know we inherit compensation process that be perceive by many sub postmaster as be slow legalistic and adversarial so we have already take series of step to try to speed thing up particularly in try to get out more fix sum payment for example we be move in more staff to support work on the compensation process if she would like to look in more detail at her constituency case be very happy to do so call the shadow minister the business secretary meet recently in japan with fujitsu which develop the horizon system and have offer to contribute to the compensation for victim can the minister tell the house how much the secretary of state have ask it to contribute so that taxpayer be not on the hook for billion the hon lady be right to reference the discussion that my right hon friend have with the chief executive officer of fujitsu that company have agree to begin talk about its contribution to the cost of compensation she will understand that we also need to wait for sir wyn williams inquiry to conclude and for his recommendation regard compensation from fujitsu to be hear and understand be sure she will also understand that be not go to give running commentary on the discussion with fujitsu but welcome the fact that it have agree to begin talk small business support what step his department be take to support small business what step his department be take to support small business small business need well deal certainly well than the one they get from the last government and our small business strategy which be due this year be design to do that we have already provide more support through the british business bank we have work with the federation of small businesses to take action on issue such as late payment and retail crime and we have announce the creation of the new business growth service which aim to transform business support service later today will attend small business summit in sussex to progress those plan and meet small business leader too many small and medium sized defence business in my community struggle to access the banking and finance facility they need often on the basis of self impose ethical criterion will the business secretary join in welcome how many investor and financial institution have respond to the campaign be lead with my hon friend the member for york outer mr charters and other labour parliamentarian call on our bank and fund manager to broaden their approach to defence investment will he call on investor to take action so that we can defend our country support ukraine and fire up our industrial base agree with my hon friend and thank she very much for her question she will know that my department alongside the treasury and the ministry of defence convene roundtable in december to listen to these perspective and now all three departments be work together to ensure that the problem she have articulate do not occur it be essential that the british people do not think that the substantial significant and historic investment in defence that this government be make come in some way at the expense of domestic prosperity there be no prosperity without security but we should also acknowledge the tremendous economic contribution make by our defence sector there be not foreign and domestic split in that regard thank my hon friend for her outstanding leadership in galvanise parliamentary support for that campaign and hope it will have unanimous agreement in every part of the house as the secretary of state be aware the ceramics industry include in my constituency of stoke on trent south be face immense competition from imported counterfeit good many of those good contain false backstamp that mislead consumer and as the gmb union have raise with threaten great british company such as dunoon duchess and many other will the minister meet again to discuss in more detail create offence and table regulation to deal with import counterfeit ceramic good my department have very strong relationship with the ceramics sector through the energy intensive users group we have regular meeting with that group and would also like to mention the british ceramic confederation and our old friend rob flello who be strong voice for the sector there be many challenge for the ceramics sector not least decarbonisation but on the subject of consumer protection it be firmly against uk consumer law for firm wherever they be locate to give consumer false information such as through fake product marking we have strengthen the regime in this regard with new enforcement power for the competition and markets authority come into force next month but will of course get my hon friend any meeting she require constituent in chorleywood recently contact after need an emergency locksmith due to broken key initially quote over the phone she be later charge and be only give the new key after make that payment while applaud this government ambition to reduce regulation can we ensure that there be appropriate regulation so that consumer be not unfairly overcharge as in this instance too have hear the kind of story that the hon gentleman have articulate there be definitely concern in that regard broadly the government regulation agenda be not necessarily about deregulation but about effective and proportionate regulation feel that our regulatory sector have grow lot in recent year and that it do not always compare well to those of other country in term of timeliness and business response that be the agenda we be pursue but will certainly write to the hon gentleman about the issue he have raise which be very relevant appreciate the opportunity to do so and thank he for raise they today many family be support by the work of my constituent alison and kevin who run small care business they tell that they already operate on tight margin in sector under huge pressure the hike in employer national insurance contribution will force they to make tough decision on staffing and simply reduce the amount of care they can offer kevin and alison rightly say that this hike make no sense at time when the government tell we that they want to move to community care provision and get people out of hospital do the secretary of state not agree thank the hon member for her question and thank alison and kevin for their important work we already talk about the difficult choice that the government face and the unenviable choice that have to be make health and social care be beneficiary of the additional revenue that need to be raise to meet some of the challenge we face but we be not casual about the impact of that and we recognise the pressure that come from that would say that do not agree taxis have to apply to every sector and we can not carve out certain sector however appreciate the pressure that she articulate that be why the rest of the government agenda be set to address all those factor call the liberal democrat spokesperson small business be the backbone of the british economy up and down the country we have success story of innovative start up and family run business that should be part of the government plan to get britain grow again under the conservatives the number of small business in my constituency decrease by between and the tories mess up our national and local economy be the minister concern that his government national insurance rise will damage the economy just as the conservatives do if we be list the difficult thing that small business have to deal with in the previous year we would be here for most of the day and the weekend if we be be honest whether it be how the conservatives handle brexit the mini budget or austerity we could go on and on say to the hon member that we be not casual about what we have have to ask of business because of the unenviable situation we inherit but the fundamental of the uk be incredibly strong in political stability and openness to the world and we have the change we be make to planning skill regulation and energy to make sure we be deliver national insurance contributions sme what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of change to employer national insurance contribution on small and medium sized enterprise the treasury publish tax information and impact note in november alongside the introduction of the bill contain the employer national insurance contribution change it set out the impact of the policy on the exchequer and the impact on business and that approach be consistent with previous tax change the impact hear from sme in my constituency predominantly in the visitor economy be that they be anticipate cut the hour of part time staff or lay they off and reduce the number of seasonal employee that they will take on will the minister take those concern seriously and work with ministers in the scottish government to ensure that the legitimate concern of sme in my constituency do not blossom into full blow crisis of confidence be always happy to work with the scottish government and other devolve government on how we can improve the business environment be sure the right hon member will join in encourage the government in scotland to mirror the change we have make to business rate relief give the sizeable increase in the scottish budget it be somewhat surprising that the snp have not be willing to support the retail sector through an extension of retail hospitality relief international investment scotland what step he be take to help increase level of international investment in scotland the government be commit to support investment in scotland in line with our growth mission the prime minister recently announce that the national wealth fund will provide million of investment in new opportunity in grangemouth in particular that announcement come alongside the recently announce million grant for the port of cromarty firth the two investment zone receive million over the next five year and our expand office for investment be grateful to my right hon friend for that answer the national wealth fund have recently invest million in pulpex ltd to construct sustainable packaging facility near glasgow which be welcome move and will support job and growth what further measure be plan to attract similar green industry investment in community such as my own in north lanarkshire which have scotland fast grow economy my hon friend be tireless advocate for the community of coatbridge and bellshill can assure he that the national wealth fund strategic partnership trial will see each local authority within the glasgow city region include north lanarkshire be invite to submit project proposal include for project focus on hesitate to say green job in coatbridge topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility my department work night and day to deliver our plan for change by make britain the good place to invest work and do business this government have provide political stability and openness to the world and we be continually improve the business environment since the last business and trade question we have publish new steer for the competition and markets authority so that it have growth and investment in mind and more pro business regulatory reform will follow in delhi last month relaunche our trade negotiation with india and have just return from tokyo where the foreign secretary and announce first of its kind industrial strategy partnership with japan we be also ensure that our make work pay reform deliver for business and worker finally we have engage closely with the new us administration include commerce secretary howard lutnick and the new us trade representative jamieson greer the new us trade policy be challenge but we believe that our decision to engage and seek potential agreement on new economic deal between the uk and the us offer we an opportunity to ensure that the uk be the well connect market in the world business across beaconsfield marlow and the south bucks village be face crippling cost from the government national insurance tax raid and the employment rights bill can the secretary of state reassure or advise my business should they stop hire cut staff increase price or all of the above would say that business in the hon lady constituency should contact their local conservative mp and say what be your plan because think we have have three oral question session

whether the government be content to remain bridge between the eu and the us if it be bridge that the us continue to walk all over risk the uk economy with every single step the simple position be that we will represent the uk national interest in this matter the us have objection about its significant deficit in manufacture good with china and the eu but that be not the relationship between the us and the uk so there be chance for the uk to pursue different policy one that produce great benefit for every part of the uk than perhaps be available to other country of course we be cognisant

settlement of pay dispute in the public sector for zero apparent efficiency benefit and heavily tax and spend budget the chancellor be even so bold as member will recall as to announce to the cbi that she would not be raise taxis or increase debt over the course of the government as she say clear not come back with more borrowing or more taxis however the budget start to unravel almost as soon as it be publish we have the bizarre sight of government who be ever more committed to talk about growth while club growth to death across variety of sector through the national insurance rise and the billion burden of the employment rights bill of course but also through their loss of credibility in the market which have push up gilt yield by since september great british energy be announce and do nothing the government make an unsuccessful attempt to claim credit for the achievement of the newly rebrande national wealth fund which have be set up only week before the system of infrastructure monitoring and planning have be dismantle and there have be no news for three month on the decision on small modular reactor which be due on december or thereabout can the leader of the house update

gentle cerise for voter at the general election and now that reality be set in it be pleasing shade of purple with more and more patch of blue the prime minister and the government be become more conservative by the day in sharp contrast it be the government policy towards rural area that be most striking we have see the family farm tax and the disproportionate effect on hospice and social care service in rural area arise from the rise in national insurance now in the same week we have see new compulsory purchase power to seize farmland and the abrupt and unexpected end of the sustainable farming incentive scheme the government be simultaneously reduce farm income threaten farm holding and force the sale of family farm through their inheritance tax change be sad to say that even the million allocate by the previous government to clean up the river wye one of the natural glory of this country have be cut to just million the labour message be clear do not be farmer do not feed the country do not give we food security do not work every hour god send whatever the weather we do not care the leader of the house have be very clear that it be her policy not to answer opposition question or even to answer question about her policy of not answer question she ignore my question yet again last week but perhaps she can have go at these question now why have the government take such punitive approach to the countryside be they do so deliberately or be it just by accident finally will she come to visit some farmer in herefordshire with so that she can see the actual effect of these policy for herself we will throw in some magnificent shepherds or rowlestone ice cream as well if that will make any difference start by congratulate young carer across the

the resumption of military aid and intelligence sharing between the us and ukraine this really be an important moment for peace in the region and the ball be now firmly in russia court the shadow leader of the house spend most of his speech last week and this week give long lecture about why do not answer his question while actually fail to ask very many at all we have couple of small question today at the end of another diatribe that as ever take we through various myth and misinformation he will know that this government have to take some very difficult decision to deal with an economy that no government would want to deal with high and rise debt stagnant growth low productivity low wage and public service on their knee that be why we have have to take some difficult decision to fix those foundation but most importantly to get that investment back into our public service as we desire to do the shadow leader of the house again raise the point about national insurance but must point out to the house that he be treasury minister when his government raise national insurance not only on business but on work people as well be sorry to tell he that this government absolutely back british farmer we be do what we can to support they we have increase the farming budget to billion over two year which be far more than the conservative government ever do we have set out new deal for farmer and we be invest in our flood defence we also have plan for sustainable food and he know well than anybody that the sustainable farming incentive have capped budget which his government do not announce they fail to spend any of it and give the action that we have take it have be oversubscribe in the meantime that be why we have close that fund but we be set out new fund

know that in that time we have make statement to this place because like you respect the house of commons and respect that we make announcement here first but what contrast to the previous conservative government they have to be drag here to make statement their last king speech be threadbare the pinnacle of their ambition be to ban pedicab in london and they be not do much well now be

progress and have poor behaviour and health outcome free school lunch may be the only healthy cook food that some child get or even their only meal of the day that be shameful in country such as england that be why we have table amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill that would increase the tax threshold for free school meal to year expand eligibility for free school meal to

under the conservatives the nhs suffer year of industrial action cost taxpayer billion and cost patient more than million cancel operation and appointment we negotiate an end to the resident doctor strike within three week we have deliver the million extra appointment we promise in our first year and we do it seven month early after year of rise waiting list under the conservatives we be finally turn the tide cut waiting list for five month in row cut waiting list through the winter pressure and cut waiting list by so far and count we have agree the gp contract with gps for the first time since the pandemic our first step to bring back the family doctor and we have deliver the big uplift in hospice funding for generation however there should be no doubt about the scale of the challenge ahead we inherit an nhs go through the bad crisis in its history so there be no time to waste we inherit public finance with billion black hole so there be no money to waste the urgency of the crisis mean we have to go far and fast to deliver well value for taxpayer and well service for patient something the conservative party can not even begin to speak to record on lord darzi independent investigation into the national health service trace the current crisis back to the top down reorganisation of the nhs by the right hon lord lansley the darzi investigation say the reorganisation be disastrous and calamity without international precedent that scorch the earth for health reform the effect of which be still feel to this day the health and social care act establish more than new nhs organisation create complex and fragmented web of bureaucracy and to quote the darzi investigation imprison more than million nhs staff in broken system today we be put the final nail in the coffin of the conservatives disastrous top down reorganisation of the nhs there be more than twice as many staff work in nhs england and the department of health and social care today than there be in twice as many staff as when the nhs deliver the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history today the nhs deliver bad care for patient but be more expensive than ever before the budget for nhs england staff and admin alone have soar to billion taxpayer be pay more but get less we have be leave with two large organisation do the same role with an enormous amount of duplication it be especially in time like these when money be tight that such bloated and inefficient bureaucracy can not be justify however even if the conservatives have not leave billion black hole in the public finance the prime minister would still be announce the change he be today because every that be waste on inefficient bureaucracy in good time or bad be that can not be spend on treat patient fast nor can it be spend on fix our crumble school lift child out of poverty or put money back into people pocket there be always duty on ministers to get as much value for taxpayer money as be possible and can not honestly say that it be achievable with the way that my department and nhs england be set up today nor can say that the current set up be get the good out of the nhs be sure member will have hear their local nhs leader complain about the top down way in which the nhs be run it be something have hear for year now that find myself at the peak of this enormous mountain of accountability do not just recognise the complaint agree with it frontline nhs staff be drown in the micromanagement they be subject to by the various and vast layer of bureaucracy in the hewitt review the former health secretary my right hon friend dame patricia hewitt report that one local service be require to send report and form to nhs england and the department of health and social care in single month that be time and energy that be not be spend deliver care for patient the review also conclude that have two organisation do the same job have lead to tension waste time and needless frictional cost since come into office have seek to correct that by build one team approach between my department and nhs england work towards our share mission of build an nhs fit for the future today the prime minister have announce that we be turn one team into one organisation acknowledge that there be talente commit public servant work at every level of the nhs and my department include at nhs england who have have the privilege of work with over the past eight month the reform we be announce today be not reflection on they they have be set up to fail by fragmented system that hold they back the action we be take today will change that work have already begin to strip out the duplication between the two organisation and bring many of nhs england function into the department nhs england will have much clear focus over this transformation period it will be in charge of hold local provider to account for the outcome that really matter cut waiting time and manage their finance responsibly and it be task with realise the untapped potential of our national health service as single payer public service get well deal for taxpayer through central procurement be well customer to medical technology innovator to get the late cutting edge tech into the hand of staff and patient much fast and be well partner to the life science sector to develop the medicine of the future over the next two year nhs england will be bring into the department entirely these reform will deliver much lean top of the nhs make significant saving of hundred of million of pound year that money will flow down to the frontline to cut waiting time fast and deliver our plan for change by slash through the layer of red tape and end the infantilisation of frontline nhs leader we will set local nhs provider free to innovate develop new productive way of working and focus on what matter most deliver well care for patient can not count the number of conservatives who have tell in private that they regret the reorganisation and wish they have reverse it when in office but none of they act they put it in the too difficult box while patient and taxpayer pay the price because only labour can reform the nhs and this government be prove that only labour can be trust to reform the state the prime minister have commit to cut the number of quango today we be abolish the big quango in the world be delighted that sir james mackey will be lead the transformation team as the chief executive of nhs england jim have an outstanding track record of turn around organisation balance the book drive up productivity and drive down waiting time he be put in place new transformation team to drive change and alongside dr penny dash as the incoming chair be delighted to have such capable leadership team of radical reformer to lead nhs england with through this transformation also take this opportunity to place on record my heartfelt thank to amanda pritchard who have show an outstanding commitment to our national health service over her decade of service which know remain undiminished she have also be rock of enormous support not only in the past eight month but also in the past few week as we have work together with jim prepare for this change also place on record my thank to her deputy julian kelly who be one of the most outstanding public servant of his generation along with the rest of the leadership team depart at the end of the month they deserve our thank and good wish for the future change be hard there will always be cautious voice warn you to slow down however break the status quo be there will be those who resist any change away from it but we should be in no doubt we inherit national health service go through the bad crisis in its history patient be wait unacceptable length of time for an operation gp appointment or an ambulance this labour government will never duck the hard yard of reform we will take on vested interest and change the status quo so the nhs can once again be there for we when we need it the prime minister have set an enormously ambitious target for the nhs to cut waiting time for operation from up to month to maximum of week by the end of this parliament that will require we to go far and fast than even the last labour government achieve but patient in our country deserve nothing less the reform the prime minister be set out today will mean few checker and more doer it will cut through the complex web of bureaucracy and devolve more resource and responsibility to the frontline to deliver well value for taxpayer money and well service for patient it will set the nhs up to deliver on the three big shift need to make the service fit for the future from hospital to community analogue to digital and sickness to prevention the nhs be break but it be not beat together we will turn it around commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement it be disappointing once again that it be not make to the house first in recent day there have be numerous medium briefing about this potential restructure under new leadership on the conservative benches we believe in lean and more efficient state that mean use resource effectively reduce waste and prevent duplication spend money where it be most beneficial after all the public understandably want to see the focus on patient care and not on backroom manager therefore we be supportive of measure to streamline management and we do not oppose the principle of take direct control but we need to know what step will be take to meet target while all the upheaval happen we need to know the specific of what be be plan what be the timeframe for the abolition of nhs england by what date will it be complete how many people will be move into different role how many people will lose their job altogether how much money be that expect to save labour run the nhs in wales which have the high waiting list and the long waiting time in great britain what lesson have labour learn from its failure in wales nhs england as the secretary of state say have just lose much of its leadership be that because they no long have confidence in the secretary of state or because he do not have confidence in they perhaps he can tell the house whether alan milburn will keep his job in the upheaval we also need to be clear that move people into different role will not fix the challenge that face the nhs the secretary of state have speak about take direct control that may help he ensure that the nhs stop waste money on expensive diversity equity and inclusion staff and ensure that it provide dignity and privacy for female staff and patient but what do it mean for clinical prioritisation will condition that be less common and have less glitzy campaign and few celebrity backer suffer because the secretary of state now have political consideration do the secretary of state have the bandwidth for this give he have such busy role already how do the centralisation of power measure up with the commitment to give more power to regional body and local integrate care board in the first six month after enter office the government announce review consultation and call for evidence all of which require more staff be those job at risk or be other pre exist role set to be cut this announcement come the same week as labour employment rights bill pass through the commons be the secretary of state get move on because he know that red tape and bureaucracy will dramatically increase afterwards and make the decision he have to take more difficult to deliver drive to improve efficiency in the civil service and the management of the health service be welcome but what about the nhs itself the government slimme down our productivity plan and deliver pay rise in return for no modernisation or reform how will those decision improve efficiency ask the department what proportion of people with nursing qualification work in the nhs be in patient face role but the minister say that they do not know how can he use the skill and resource effectively if he do not know where those skill and resource be the prime minister be make lot of noise about productivity and cut waste but he still refuse to set target for cut the civil service headcount thank to the decision he and the chancellor take at the budget the size of the state be grow rapidly not shrink while change to national insurance contribution have divert funding away from the frontline into compensate the treasury ultimately any restructure will be challenge by the government continue failure to tackle immigration while step to improve efficiency in the healthcare service be welcome these word ring hollow across government will take the more serious question from the shadow minister first on timeframe we will work immediately to start bring team together as we have do with the one team culture we have be build over the past eight month want the integration of nhs england into the department to be complete in two year the shadow minister ask about the reduction in the number of official nhs england have staff the department of health and social care have we be look to reduce the overall headcount across both by which will deliver hundred of million of pound of saving the exact figure will be determine by the precise configuration of staff and we will obviously keep the house update on that the shadow minister ask about clinical leadership one change we will be make with the transformation team be to have two medical director succeed professor sir stephen powis whose departure from nhs england be plan long before these change there will be one medical director for primary care and one for secondary care underpin our commitment to the shift we have describe must say there be enormous improvement to be make in clinical leadership for patient outcome patient safety and productivity and be demand strong clinical leadership to drive those improvement to productivity frankly many consultant and clinical team on the frontline will welcome that liberation they be hungry for change the shadow minister ask about the workforce datum and complain that we have not be able to give she the precise answer agree it be frustrating not have that precise information at my fingertip would gently remind she though on this as on so many thing that her party be in power for year she can not very well complain eight month in give that they leave we woeful embarrass datum architecture and infrastructure the shadow minister ask about efficiency once again she refer to the resident doctor deal as if it be failure the actual failure be leave doctor on the picket line not on the frontline and waste huge amount of taxpayer money with cancellation and delay to patient appointment operation and procedure we stop that within week of come into office the deal do include reform to improve productivity if she be any doubt about the result she should look at the fact that despite winter pressure nhs waiting list have fall five month in row once again we get the facile point about my right hon friend alan milburn who be the lead non executive board member for my department honestly do not know why he bother to pay for mortgage he live rent free in the conservatives head they need to move on by the way just for the record alan milburn have record on the nhs that the conservatives can not even begin to touch the shadow minister ask about confidence be delighted to be introduce new transformation team different leadership challenge require different leadership skill as say have be really pleased to work with amanda pritchard for the past eight month include on this transition people should have no doubt about the confidence have in her skill talent and ability and think she have lot still to contribute to our nhs we do not need to ask about confidence in the conservative party it be reflect in the scarce number on the opposition benches what be the lesson from wales the lesson be that when there be conservative government in westminster the national health service suffer in england wales scotland and northern ireland that be why we be create rise tide to lift all ship be sure we will see improvement across the united kingdom snp members who be not in their place do not have any excuse now as say before the election all road lead to westminster and the big funding settlement since devolution begin be go down the road to holyrood there be no hiding place there for the snp if people want real reform of the nhs in scotland they should vote for scottish labour under anas sarwar and jackie baillie people can see here in westminster the difference that new leadership provide the shadow minister laughably refer to new leadership in the conservative party well it be certainly lean and mean but it be the same old conservative party the only thing that the conservatives have shrink be their own party the only job that they have lay off be those of their poor party staff the only thing that they be capable of well come to think of it do not think that there be anything they be capable of change instead they look over their shoulder at party leader who can not even manage five aside team let alone country the conservatives be just so diminish as party appreciate that it must be so painful for they to watch labour government do the thing that they only ever talk about reduce bloated state bureaucracy invest in defence reform our public service and bring down the welfare bill the public be ask what be the point of the conservative party bet they be glad that they choose change with labour applaud my right hon friend for his leadership and for the reduction in waiting list which we so desperately need we all know that there be still struggle with budget in the health service my excellently run honiton hospital be face deficit for the first time in its history so can he give more detail about how he will reform nhs procurement so that we can use the purchasing power of the nhs to get more bang for our buck my hon friend be absolutely right about the need to improve procurement one thing that attlee and bevan could not have predict in be that the single payer model of the national health service make it ideally place for this world of artificial intelligence genomic machine learning and big datum we must unlock that potential so that we have new treatment new technology productivity gain and efficiency but we also have to get the basic right on procurement we have to change the culture of profligacy routine deficit and routine spending that be why today the leadership of nhs england have summon to london chair and chief executive from across the country to get an immediate grip on the billion to billion deficit that be already be bake in for the financial year those chair and chief executive have just become so accustomed to the idea that government will just come in and bail they out say before the election that there would be no release of money in winter because winter be predictable the nhs be give additional resource and it must learn to live within its mean despite howl of outrage before and since the election have keep to my word say that there would be accountability for people who think that the government be there to bail they out have come from local government where that culture would never be tolerate and this government be bring that same financial discipline to the nhs we will not tolerate deficit it be important that we get well value for money while also make sure that nationally we be provide support through the procurement platform that be how we will help the system deliver well value and we will liberate frontline leader to focus on the thing that really matter which be service for patient call the liberal democrat spokesperson the secretary of state nhs shake up be well under way many member would agree that the nhs use to be the envy of the world but year of conservative failure have leave patient suffer and unable to get the care that they desperately need and my liberal democrat colleague therefore welcome step to reform the nhs the new leadership of the nhs have much to do but can the secretary of state advise the house whether new legislation will be need to scrap nhs england give that he tell the shadow minister that it will take two year to complete this merger when will that new legislation if it be require be bring forward any attempt to fix the nhs will ultimately fail if we also do not address the crisis in social care the secretary of state must show the same urgency in reform social care as be be show on the nhs where be that urgency long promise cross party talk have now be postpone indefinitely with no new date in sight care provider be hang by thread due to the rise cost of national insurance contribution do the secretary of state agree that any attempt to fix the nhs will prove futile if we ignore the elephant in the nhs waiting room that be the crisis in social care we will clear our diary for cross party talk so will the secretary of state give we date today be grateful to the liberal democrats for those question much of the change need can be deliver without the need for primary legislation which be relief because as right hon and hon member will have notice this government have come into office with the most ambitious legislative programme of any incoming government time be at premium give the business of this house and the other place we will work immediately to move forward without change to primary legislation but we will need to make they be work with the leader of the house and business manager to ensure an appropriate timetable that enable we to do the thing that we need to do in timely way but that also safeguard the ambitious legislative programme that have already be set out the hon lady be right to talk about the importance of social care she ask where the urgency be it be to be find in the immediate step that the chancellor take on come into office to stabilise the finance of my department with an immediate release of funding it come with the budget which deliver an extra billion for the department for health and social care protect funding specifically for social care and boost spending power for local authority it come with the big expansion of carer allowance since the and an million increase in the disabled facility grant not just from next year but release in january for the remainder of this financial year the urgency be reflect in the employment rights bill which make provision for fair pay agreement to deal with the force crisis work with employer and trade union to prepare for that legislation and the introduction of fair pay agreement be already under way regret that we have not convene cross party talk that be genuinely due to practicality on the part of number of party involve we will be in touch over the next week to make arrangement for baroness casey to engage with party across the house thank my right hon friend for his excellent statement as he know be work gp in stroud we clinician be simply feed up with the micromanagement of our caring clinical role and many hospital colleague feel the same we want to be free to deliver excellent clinical care do he think that the abolition of nhse will reduce the admin task for doctor do think that be the case also think that this be not just about form and function but about the opportunity for productivity gain through modern technology and practice one of my frustration be that whenever we talk about the exciting frontier of life science and medical technology this country competitive advantage and how we need to build on that position be greet with weary sigh from poor frontline nhs staff and manager for that matter who say that lovely and we agree with you but we just like machine that turn on reliably and it would be nice to use system that do not require seven password to deal with single patient feel their pain we will prioritise that investment in technology finally we do want to liberate the frontline and be grateful for the leadership that gps have show in agree contract with the government for the first time since the pandemic which contain substantial reform to benefit they and even more importantly their patient we also have to liberate management in the nhs as lord darzi say it be not the case that there be too many manager but there be layer and layer of bureaucracy between as the secretary of state and frontline staff we have to liberate frontline staff and manager to help they be more effective to manage their resource more efficiently and most importantly to deliver well and safe care call the chair of the health and social care committee this be bold change indeed the job of my committee be to help the secretary of state to do it so let start by ask he to come in front of the committee as quickly as possible certainly before easter because there be lot of detail that we need to drill down into on more substantive point the right hon member mention the financial reset that sir jim mackey announce to integrate care board just yesterday which mean that they need to cut their running cost by be concerned that when my buckinghamshire oxfordshire and berkshire west icb struggle with money the first thing it cut be the place base team if we be to deliver the neighbourhood nhs that the secretary of state and both want those be not the team to cut will he send signal to icb that cost saving should not be at the expense of the broad shift in the year plan first give the chair of the select committee my assurance that would be delighted to appear in front of her committee at the early opportunity that mean soon appreciate that it will want to scrutinise these change in more detail and would welcome the constructive challenge that it offer also reassure she that the direction that we be give to frontline leader be to deliver the three big shift in our year plan and to ensure that as we take immediate step to bring the finance under control we do so in way that lay the firm foundation for the future of the nhs that we need to build my cautionary note to member across the house be that when we ask frontline leader to reform and to change way of working sometimes that require not just change to the bureaucracy as it be the easy and lower hang fruit but service reconfiguration in the interest of patient outcome and well use of taxpayer money sometimes they get those change wrong have successfully campaign against closure of service such as the king george accident and emergency department which should not have close and where we win the case on clinical ground sometimes let we be honest the public can get anxious and member of parliament feel duty bind to act as megaphone and amplifier for public concern it be important that we support and engage with local nhs leader by all mean we should scrutinise challenge and ask question but we must give local leader the support to do the task that we be ask of they on behalf of patient and taxpayer the power that have to intervene in those frontline service reconfiguration be one that will use only in the most exceptional and necessary case and that be why have not use they once in the past eight month the crisis in our nhs go deep be sure that the secretary of state agree that it be an existential crisis that pose threat to the future of the nhs if fundamental change do not happen while strongly welcome today statement what assurance can he give and the house that the right people will be in the right place in leadership position to drive the fundamental change that be necessary that be an excellent question we be build an outstanding transformational team with sir jim mackey which will be announce very shortly it will bring together some of the good leader across the country and expertise from outside the nhs to drive the scale and pace of transformation that be necessary my hon friend be right to say that it be existential because we can not allow the curve of cost and demand to continue to rise to the extent that it be the nhs long term workforce plan have one in nine people in our country work for the nhs on the current trajectory in year time of the public would be work for the nhs that be clearly not sustainable position tell people who resist this reform out of love for the nhs not to kill it with kindness we have to bend the curve of cost and demand to ensure that our health service be sustainable for the long term on the equitable foundation of public service free at the point of use that we will always defend also say to my hon friend on the government back benches that if we do not get this right goodness know what will come next the leader of the opposition say that she want debate on the funding model for the nhs the leader of the reform party be not sure whether he be the leader of the opposition yet say that he be up for anything be sure he be that should worry we to those who want to debate the funding model of our nhs and the equitable principle of it be public service free at the point of use say that we be happy to have that debate but the government be unequivocal under labour the nhs be not for sale it will always be public service free at the point of use so that when people fall ill they never have to worry about the bill may commend the boldness of today announcement if the nhs be to be turn around it will need radical reform if the result of today be to replace bureaucratic overcentralisation with political overcentralisation it will fail but if we move to the decentralised model that we have for the police and school it could be the start of real transformation will the secretary of state give the house more detail about the change he have in mind be we go to get rid of the central target that make the nhs the most micromanage system in the world and make it impossible for manager to deliver real change on the ground because they be work to about hundred operational target if that be the case and we be go to decentralise the nhs do the secretary of state agree that there remain vital role for reform care quality commission to call out poor care whenever it find it be grateful to the right hon gentleman for that thoughtful question let say two thing to he first democratic accountability matter both in term of patient outcome and value for taxpayer money one of the thing that my labour and many of my conservative predecessor have reflect on lot over many year be what the role of the secretary of state and government be in national health service where clinical decision should always be clinically lead it be the secretary of state responsibility to be the champion for patient and for taxpayer and to ensure that the system as whole deliver well outcome for patient and well value for taxpayer the argument that have start however which have ruffle some feather within the nhs and even more so with some of our country most love charity in recent month be the fallacy that the secretary of state can or should just fire endless instruction into the system as if secretary of state or for that matter an nhs england could just pull some big lever and drive change in such vast and complex system that be falsehood of course we should set national strategic priority on behalf of the public we should ensure that there be more transparency and information so that patient community and staff can hold the system and themselves to account to improve performance however the overcentralisation have to stop in future it will be for the department and the nhs nationally to do the thing that only the national health service can do provide the enabler for the system as whole what we be preside over and embark on however be the big decentralisation of power in the history of our national health service that will put more power into the hand of frontline leader and clinician but even more fundamental and transformational more power into the hand of patient if we get that right we will have an nhs that can truly be the envy of the world if people continue to indulge in the fallacy that more target from the centre or more or indeed less political control be the answer we will fail the right hon gentleman also mention the cqc it have get itself into terrible mess and know that that be not what he intend when he rightly make the decision to create the care quality commission that be why sir julian hartley know that he have our full support not just in turn around the cqc as it be but in reform it so that it can be the good guarantee and safeguard of quality that patient and the public deserve dr penny dash forthcoming review finding will also help to drive that reform agenda at pace thank the secretary of state for make the statement today want to echo the thought of the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran that it would be helpful to see he in front of the select committee to outline his vision for nhs england will he tell we today how the new structure of the nhs will help we deliver truly excellent social care and also primary care and what driver he can use to make that happen it always worry when my hon friend say he want to see in front of the select committee because he do not pull his punch despite be on the government side of the house let reassure he that on primary care hope that we be begin to turn what think have be deep anger frustration and anxiety among primary care leader about the state of the system as it be and pessimism about its future into increase amount of quiet optimism and hope think gps can see we be walk the talk with the big funding uplift in generation and the fact that we have work constructively with gp leader to reform the contract and agree that far more radical reform be need together we will be embark on that under the auspex of the year plan as well as deliver that significant achievement with gps the minister for care my hon friend the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock be also in the very final stage of work with pharmacist to stabilise the community pharmacy sector which be vital for the nhs future as neighbourhood service may also reassure my hon friend the member for calder valley josh fenton glynn that under the auspex of the year plan for health notwithstanding baroness casey work on the long term future of social care we have an eye on social care and the relationship between health and social care people will not therefore be wait until next year for the first casey report or indeed later for the final casey report on the long term to see action from this government on social care particularly as it relate to the nhs welcome the ambition of the secretary of state one area that ask he to focus on be the future of the uk health security agency over the last year it have evolve from the health protection agency to public health england and now to the ukhsa find it impossible both as treasury minister and as constituency mp to penetrate the decision make process around resource allocation which now believe be duplicative as move to new site in essex be be contemplate that be an area where the secretary of state can demonstrate to my constituent in salisbury and at porton down that he mean business and can resolve the future of ukhsa once and for all would be delighted to speak far with the right hon gentleman draw on that valuable experience both as constituency mp and as treasury minister always for the record my favourite people to work with what wrong with dcms and my friend at dcms with their considerable spending power no will stick with the treasury in my order of favourite thank you very much know where my bread be butter to return to the point make by the right hon member for salisbury john glen thank dame jenny harries for her leadership of ukhsa we be recruit for an outstanding replacement and successor and that be an opportunity to look in the wide context at some of the first principle the right hon gentleman mention the specific traditional porton down versus harlow decision which have be run around the system so long that be now use in case study for senior civil servant recruitment the bad decision be indecision it have plague we for too long and hope we can soon report back to the house with decision on that for everyone benefit welcome the statement today from the secretary of state clearly there be massive duplication of function across the many regulatory national local and regional nhs body and huge room for efficiency want to press the secretary of state on two point first will he assure that the bonfire of bureaucracy will not stop effective local management of nhs trust and community setting as ippr have find that locally the nhs be poorly and under manage and clinical staff be backfille admin and management role secondly as he mention the roll out of digital technology have be far too slow with nhs digital move into nhs england not direct change fast enough so how will the change ensure that the department of health and social care grip the digital roll out accelerate it and ensure the proper integration of nhs digital function that be great question from my hon friend we have to give people the tool to do the job the prime minister set and my hon friend in the department an enormous challenge on behalf of the public in turn be set an enormous challenge for nhs leader at every level but particularly for frontline nhs leader we have to give they the tool to do the job in term of datum platform and the technology that they be give to work with ensure that they have access not just to cut edge treatment and medical technology but to the back office productivity support that can drive efficiency and improvement and frankly liberate manager and frontline staff from the arcane system they be work with some of the very good people have meet in the last few year shadow this portfolio and now hold it in government be nhs leader especially on the frontline it be my responsibility to give they the tool to do the job that be not just about financial resource it mean bulldoze through some of the regulatory barrier and overcentralise instruction that stop they make decision in the good interest of patient in term of clinical pathway and value for taxpayer have give they an undertaking that will have their back both on the decision that they will have to take on the frontline and on bulldoze through the national bureaucracy that be tie they up in knot when we need to set they free congratulate the secretary of state on the change announce today to cut unnecessary waste and bureaucracy we all know and agree that healthcare should remain free at the point of delivery and of course that the nhs need reform just last saturday be in care home in boston with lady an expert who know melanie weatherley and she be tell about the unnecessary process within nhs england on the frontline that constrain good care in care home impose unnecessary constraint on ambulance and block ward will the secretary of state confirm that the change and reform will include unnecessary process on the frontline in care home can certainly give the hon gentleman that assurance we have to cut through the unnecessary red tape that tie leader and frontline staff up in knot and we be absolutely determined to do that regulatory reform will form big part of this department agenda and the wide government agenda as to an nhs free at the point of use he almost say it with straight face be sure that he mean every word he say think he might want to have word with his party leader who be his successor and who his predecessor we must remember that nhs england come out of the tory government reform that be intend to privatise the nhs want to thank nhs england staff for their work be sorry about the way in which they have hear this announcement because it be their job that be be put at risk we have to ensure however that we be not replicate nhs england across the icb of our country and that icb be also reform to transform the nhs through the three shift that will be place on they with the publication of the year plan how will my right hon friend ensure that we have the machinery to hold the system to account but also to put those reform in place my hon friend be absolutely right if we just replicate nhs england as it be with all the challenge in its set up in icb across the land we will have fail frankly if we replicate nhs england and the department as they be today just in one organisation we will have fail to meet the challenge of change it need to feel and act like completely new organisation culture and way of work to modernise the state so that if disraeli gladstone churchill or attlee walk into whitehall at the end of this government it would not look so much like the government they work in during the and century that be the reality of whitehall today it be not reflection on the people who work in it but it show why it need to change and that be also true of the nhs look forward to work with icb leader to reform their way of working clarify their priority give they clear marching order and ensure that they can deliver finally my hon friend mention the staff of nhs england indeed this affect staff in my department too and thank she for the care she have show change be always disruptive and it can be scary and of course that be particularly the case when job loss be involve want to acknowledge that on the floor of the house as have to staff across both organisation this morning know that the permanent secretary and the chief executive of nhs england have do so in recent day and will be hold town hall with staff next week this really be not reflection on they in fact think they will recognise in my description of our way of work the many thing that frustrate they none the less they be dedicated and talented people and some of the good people have ever work with in any walk of life or career work in this system look forward to work with they in the come week and month with the same dedication and professionalism they have always show so that we can all look back on this time with pride know that we be part of the team that take the nhs from the bad crisis in its history to get it back on its foot and make it fit for the future do the secretary of state agree that one of the bad and most intractable problem that the founder of the nhs have to deal with be the involvement of medical practitioner and consultant who be use to receive private income in national service where they would not receive anything like the same remuneration if he agree would he accept that there be similar situation with nhs dentistry today the darzi report say there be enough dentist in england just not enough dentist willing to do enough nhs work which impact provision for the poor in society how do he think his reform will help address that particular crisis on which member like myself and my right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne be be consistently and rightly lobby by such formidable organisation as the new forest branch of the woman institute nhs dentistry be in terrible state and in fact in many part of the country it barely exist there be lot of reason for that and it be source of constant astonishment to that the dentistry budget be underspent year after year despite that situation the minister for care be work with the british dental association to reform the contract know that member be frustrate at the pace and so be we be try to clear an enormous challenge it be not go to be easy but we be commit to work with the profession we be roll out the urgent dentist appointment and supervised toothbrushing as we promise and as the bda have welcome but we have lot more to do that require work with the profession not simply tinker with the system as it be but fundamentally rethink it and how we rebuild it into an nhs dentistry service that we can be proud of welcome the statement particularly the commitment to ensure that as much money in the nhs as possible be spend on the frontline where it can really affect patient outcome nowhere be that more need than in my constituency of dartford which be the fast grow town in the uk that extra population be impose huge strain on our local district general hospital at dare nt valley despite the excellent effort of the staff there could the secretary of state outline how the change will support the shift we need to see from service be deliver in the hospital to the community thereby relieve the strain on hospital like dare not valley the frustrating thing be that we be deliver the wrong care in the wrong place at the wrong time which be deliver poor outcome for patient and poor value for taxpayer people can not get gp appointment for example which might cost the nhs and then they end up in accident and emergency which could cost if people can not find bed for delay discharge and rehabilitation outside of hospital they end up stuck in hospital bed waste away at great cost in fact when be up in carlisle early this year such intermediate care be be offer by local social care provider commission by the nhs at half the cost and of much well quality than the hospital bed that patient have be discharge from that shift to the community be about deliver well outcome for patient and well value for taxpayer and that will be reflect in our year plan declare an interest as the vice chair of the newly form all party parliamentary group on emergency care staffing across the country be dangerously low especially at night put unacceptable pressure on staff who warn persistently about the risk to patient safety hundred of keen applicant be be turn away from emergency medicine training last year there be place for applicant follow this announcement how quickly will emergency care and department see change and have more permanent staff and consultancy place but especially more training place we will shortly set out our emergency care improvement plan so that we can deliver the year on year improvement that people deserve the long waiting time not just in emergency department but in ambulance response time and across the entire system be completely unacceptable refuse to use term such as temporary escalation space to describe the true grim reality of corridor care that be shameful situation and be genuinely sorry that patient be be treat in those condition and that staff have to suffer the moral injury of work in those condition from the moment we come into government we have work to ensure that we get through the winter as well as we could that be reflect in the fact that despite the winter pressure waiting list fall five month in row throughout the winter on the target and standard challenge set out by the royal college of emergency medicine ahead of the winter be very clear with frontline leader that patient safety must come ahead of performance target particularly the four hour target but the hour target be absolutely related to patient safety as think the royal college would agree we must work together to get wait of long than hour down as priority because those wait be directly link to safety and patient outcome rise order gently ask right hon and hon member and indeed the secretary of state to keep their question and answer short so that can get everyone in two gp practice have tell that they be wait for section money to be release so that they can improve their facility but that it have be stick between decision maker will the secretary of state outline how the change will help to release those kind of delay and finally allow north west leicestershire resident to get the facility that they deserve be grateful to my hon friend for raise that example she be welcome to contact my office to see if we can expedite that kind of decision making in fact member will have see the work that the deputy prime minister be do to speed up decision making in local government which have an impact and bearing on the nhs we will work together to speed that up so that where resource be available we get they out and deliver change as quickly as possible my constituent be particularly concerned about the very bureaucratic approval process for the new hospital programme through investment committee then the regional nhse team the department then nhs capital assurance then joint investment committee then the treasury and then finally ministers can the secretary of state guarantee that this decision which welcome will speed up that process and that the business case for the multi storey car park at the queen elizabeth hospital in king lynn will be approve so that work start this year the hon gentleman make fair challenge on the bureaucratic nature of decision making we be work with treasury ministers and colleague across government to take an axe to that unnecessary bureaucracy he will be absolutely fume when he find out who be responsible for it be conscious that my former colleague at nhs england will be concern about today announcement but be very confident that the secretary of state will do all he can to support they it be an inescapable fact that the reorganisation lead to inefficient layer of management in the nhs deliver poor care and great cost to the taxpayer how do he plan to cut excessive layer of bureaucracy get resource to the frontline and crucially deliver well care for the people of this country that be brilliant question we have put in place transformation team lead by sir jim mackey which we will work with to start fundamentally change the way the nhs work by shift more power resource and responsibility out of whitehall and close to the frontline and the community where decision be make and by get rid of the unnecessary bureaucracy that drive patient and staff to distraction thank the secretary of state for his statement we all want to see well run nhs that deliver for patient but as he know patient be be treat in corridor staff be severely overstretch and too many people can not get access to gp or dentist when they need one in that context be concern to read in the medium last week that there be plan for billion of cut to service and for icb to be ask to cut cost by can he reassure we that as we go into the new financial year we will not see cut to frontline service when meet the chief executive of norfolk and waveney icb next week will hear that cut to frontline service be be consider as result of government budget the report relate to the deficit send into nhs england ahead of the financial year those be completely unaffordable for the nhs and completely unrealistic those financial plan be be revise as we speak which be why leader have gather in london today to receive that message and that set of instruction be ask frontline leader to improve service and reform way of work and they will have my support in do that as for the resource that be go in gently point out that the investment that the chancellor unlock for the nhs and social care in her budget dwarf that which be promise in the green party manifesto hold public consultation in my constituency on the future of the nhs participant be crystal clear that we need to cut bureaucracy and get resource to the frontline when they talk about the frontline they mean not just hospital but people out in the community and crucially for my constituency gp practice will the secretary of state share more about how he intend to make that shift there be million reason for gps to be cheerful that amount be the allocation for general practice before christmas and it have result in fruitful negotiation with gp leader that will deliver the necessary reform and well access for patient particularly through online access to modern appointment booking that be something to which we have become accustomed in every other aspect of our life and the nhs should be no different it be an inescapable fact that one top down reform be be fix by another one that will last about two year accord to the statement although wish the reform every success we must recognise that the experience of the nhs in wales show that reform on its own be no guarantee of success the secretary of state rightly say that change be hard and it be inescapable be afraid that while this reform be ongoing the nhs leadership will be hugely distract by turf war redundancy and the development of new working practice what step will he take to prevent that distraction from have negative effect on frontline service the government have come in with an ambitious reform agenda as we embark on that reform we be cut nhs waiting list we have do that five month in row we be reform the gp contract those negotiation have successfully conclude we be about to conclude community pharmacy too we have put in place transformation team who be experience frontline leader with demonstrable track record particularly in the case of sir jim mackey of deliver those change outcome there will always be people who say that it be too hard too difficult or distraction but that be how we have end up with this status quo that be how the conservative party preside over the long waiting list and the low patient satisfaction on record while spend staggering amount of public money more money and no reform be not the answer the lesson of the previous labour government be that investment plus reform deliver result that be what this labour government be do thank the secretary of state for his statement and pay tribute to nhs professional in harlow particularly those at the princess alexandra hospital for their incredible hard work every single day do he agree that nhs staff who work incredibly hard be fail by an overly bureaucratic and fragmented system and that spiral staff cost be partly result of the need for additional agency staff we absolutely need to reduce the cost of agency staff in the nhs that cost the taxpayer billion and that money could be well spend on ensure that we have the right staff in the right place on well term and condition and with permanent contract where we do need flexibility we should drive it through the nhs bank we be determined to reform the way that work and deliver well staffing well outcome for patient and well value for taxpayer welcome any measure to reduce the bureaucratic overload in the nhs so congratulate the secretary of state on come forward with his bold plan we must also take sledgehammer to the business case process which frustrate the delivery of service and new building for the nhs will he consider bring nhs own land into use for new care facility and step down hospital for example so that we can free up hospital bed and get people into the care they need at much low cost the hon member be absolutely right the estate be vast it be underutilise and we need to sweat our asset more effectively we also need to reform bureaucratic process there be lot of reason why we need to have tough control on thing such as spending procurement and value for money to ensure that there be appropriate and effective use of public money but business do not operate in this way they be able to counter fraud waste and poor value for money and they do it much fast that be what the nhs need to do across the public sector we need to use our estate far more effectively to deliver well value and well service for the public thank the health secretary for the announcement he have make as he rightly say staff work incredibly hard and deserve our thank but we all recognise the huge strain that they and the organisation have be under the health service be consistently raise as one of the top concern by resident in my constituency can he share how today announcement along with other measure he have previously announce will build an nhs that be there when people across cramlington and killingworth need it we have to deliver improved service for patient in every part of the country her constituency and mine which be on the london essex border will have different need contexts and set up and service may need to be shape differently in order to meet those need but the standard should be consistent the quality should be good and the safety should be guarantee at all time that be far cry from where we be and genuinely think that decision about service for her constituent will be far well take much close to her constituent and her community than here in whitehall that be why as we be deliver month by month and year by year improvement in service for patient in every part of the country we will also deliver the big devolution of power in the history of the national health service really welcome the secretary of state statement and be particularly keen that he look at the multiple layer of sign off and the bureaucracy that sometimes forget patient be at the other end of it hospital in england have have to rely on charitable fundraising to buy some of the most cutting edge radiotherapy machine because of nhs england policy and bureaucracy this year highly advanced machine such as the cyberknife which have treat thousand of nhs cancer patient over the past year will need upgrading but nhs england be refuse to include they in this year funding because they be all buy by charity the secretary of state talk about give people the tool to do the job could he change that policy so that our hospital do not have to continue rely on charity for the late technology this government commit in our manifesto to double the number of diagnostic scanner and we will deliver that over the course of this parliament nhs charity have valuable role to play philanthropy have valuable role to play as an additional source of support to the nhs when public funding be as tight as it be we need to look at how we can maximise the benefit and the impact of bring together source of public investment private investment voluntary sector and philanthropic investment to deliver the most bang for the buck without know the detail of the specific case the hon lady mention would not want to comment too strongly except to say that we be committed to double diagnostic scanner through public fund but be not sure necessarily share the view that nhs charity do not have role to play know from my experience of work on the nhs frontline how hard it have become over the year to get basic thing do nurse and matron spend hour and hour get basic change make to their workplace on the frontline therefore welcome my right hon friend announcement will he ensure that by cut bureaucracy we can

graves commission and commemoration welcome the minister statement do she agree that the integration of the cwgc for evermore project into the ve day and vj day celebration be wonderful opportunity to draw the public attention to the cwgc relatively new online portal through which descendant of the man and woman of the commonwealth whom it commemorate can now share in perpetuity their story of the love one they lose the cwgc be therefore connect burial record with the life story and photograph of those who be commemorate for future generation the hon lady make an important point which echo the for evermore project be fantastic initiative as she say people can reach it online and understand that there will also be mobile exhibition not just across the uk but across the world our local noak bridge and billericay council have already sign up to the beacon lighting for ve day will the minister encourage all local council across the country include district county and parish council as well as community group to come together and do everything they can to make these celebration something for their whole community as have be listen to other hon member have also be reflect on our recent commonwealth parliamentary association visit to singapore and malaysia during which we visit the commonwealth war graf there perhaps the minister could write to those organise all the international visit that parliament be undertake to ensure that parliamentarian visit war graf around the world as part of the celebration particularly this year the right hon gentleman make number of valid and important point in my statement talk little bit about how council and local councillor can get involve we be keen that street party can take place and we hope that local council can be as flexible as possible when it come to rule and regulation we be also launch our new initiative tip top town to encourage people to decorate their local area whether that be with bunting or letterbox topper should also say that grant be available for local community for thing like street party and decoration if they want to access those grant they can make an application to the national lottery community fund will also take the right hon gentleman up on his suggestion that write that letter thank the minister for her statement and for the energy and enthusiasm that she show on behalf of this great nation over the year my constituency have have great history of service in the army raf and royal navy in the second world war in every war since and indeed during the trouble we have have the victory in europe and the victory in japan be significant milestone in british history mark the end of the second world war and germany surrender it be crucial that we do all we can to remember and celebrate those event so will the minister consider allocate additional fund to devolve nation say that for reason my local council ards and north down be oversubscribe by long shot when it come to application we need to ensure that local council have the capacity to fund the service and event that will celebrate those milestone so that generation to come will not forget and importantly will be able to learn from the past also extend an invitation to the minister to come to strangford there be no well place if she have the time have the time for she thank the hon gentleman for his kind word it be huge privilege to make this statement on behalf of the government and be proud to be announce our activity on ve and vj day it be hugely important to our whole united kingdom as he rightly say we be work closely with the devolved nation and will certainly reach out to he when be in northern ireland backbench business farming relevant documents oral evidence take before the environment food and rural affairs committee on january and december on the future of farming hc correspondence between the environment food and rural affairs committee and the exchequer secretary to the treasury on inheritance tax relief reform contain within the autumn budget report to the house on february and january correspondence between the environment food and rural affairs committee and the parliamentary under secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs on strategy and vision for farming report to the house on february and january beg to move that this house have consider the future of farming first remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests and place on record my appreciation for the backbench business committee in allow we this time in the chamber it might be helpful first just to explain to the house why think this be an important time to have debate of this sort and that be before know anything about what happen early in the week the select committee that chair have an inquiry title the future of farming and have think that this would be an opportunity for member and other to shape the course of that debate and to contribute to the work of the inquiry still very much hope that be the case have also privately hop that this might be an occasion when we could look beyond some of the change that have occupy so much of the bandwidth in our political debate since the budget include the removal of the basic payment scheme and the change to inheritance tax double cab pick up and the ringfencing of agricultural budget for devolved nation this debate be an opportunity for we to remind people just what we have get go with british farming because there be some tremendous positive we have the farmer here again today in westminster demonstrate how much they care about their industry and their community for those who see this debate whether in the gallery or outside hope the message will go to they loud and clear that there be those of we in this house who want to see they stick at their effort because we be on their side and it be worth it agriculture have one of the most resilient and resourceful workforce to be find anywhere there be apparently an active debate within government on how we make work pay and what the value of work be if anybody want to see the work ethic in action they should go and spend few day on farm because that be where they will see it clear than anything we have hear lot of concern in recent year about the balance to be strike between import food and food produce domestically some of the trade deal be apparently underpin by thinking or an agenda that we do not need to produce as much or indeed any of our food domestically and that we could rely on import then of course vladimir putin invade ukraine and we have rather rude wake up call since then we have see donald trump back in the white house talk about trade and tariff change surely those thing alone should make we understand the importance of healthy home grow agricultural sector we should not be offshore to other part of the world our standard of animal welfare or environmental protection climate change be so often hold up as some sort of stick with which to beat our farmer but there be real opportunity those area of the world from which we be import food be also undergo the change that come from climate change and they will not be as able to produce the food that they would wish to export to we in year to come in this country we still have good temperate climate which be absolutely suited to that farmer in ely and east cambridgeshire face the threat of flood and drought which be make infinitely bad by the climate change that my right hon friend be talk about in addition to all the other challenge that farmer be face do he agree that the government should invest in rural flood management and water storage and work with farmer to help they manage water on their farm absolutely do and my hon friend put it perfectly when she talk about work with farmer it seem that this be as true for government north of the border as it be for those south of it so much of what pass for agricultural policy be something that be do to farmer rather than in partnership with they to get to the bright future that believe farming can have we have to get past the present the decision to close the sustainable farming incentive scheme on tuesday without any notice have provoke predictable and justifiable fury but do it with press release that seek to present it as some sort of triumph add insult to injury it be almost like return to the glory day of the soviet union when the politburo would boast about their advance in meet their target in the five year plan for tractor production the government have pull the rug out from under farmer across england and that come on the back of the accelerated removal of the basic payment scheme in the budget be afraid that the minister defence in the house yesterday around an uncapped budget be not adequate and do not tell the whole story on january this year the director general for food biosecurity and trade tell the environment food and rural affairs committee that they have have almost application to the sfi with contract offer she say if that continue at that scale there may come point where the budget come under pressure and we have to consider take action what have be happen in defra since that time the permanent secretary be open with the select committee she say that future funding hinge on the spending review how do we get from that point where official seem to be warn we to the point we get to on tuesday when we see the scheme close without notice the press notice announce the closure of the sfi specify the budget as billion cap that be the first time have be able to discover that that figure have be put into the public domain without that transparency how on earth can farmer and their representative possibly hope to regulate their behaviour or know when the money will be run down and when they should be get their application in the frustration be that for some this situation do not come out of clear blue sky it have be rumour for some time and it be well know that land agent consultant and other have be quietly advise client to get application in to beat the deadline and the exhaustion of the pot that be fine if farm be big enough to employ land agent or consultant but this be busy time of year for small family farm upland farmer and other those be the people who deserve and need the assistance more than ever and they be the one who have again be leave behind tom bradshaw describe defra as fail department that be strong language from man not give to hyperbole but the minister would do well to take heed in that evidence session on january we hear evidence from the permanent secretary the director general for food biosecurity and trade and the deputy director of policy engagement and strategy the committee have not formally express an opinion but it be fair to say from the informal discussion that follow that that session leave few of we if any with the impression that it be an impressive leadership team entirely in command of their brief it be clear that the team understand the target and where they want to get to but it be unclear how they would achieve their target we see that with the various false start and misstep on the road to the environmental land management scheme although acknowledge that much of the responsibility for that lie with ministers from the previous government the permanent secretary call it an iterative process which to my mind just seem to be another way for people to say that it be okay to get thing wrong and to make it up as they go along be afraid that in the mind and eye of farmer across the country tuesday announcement on the sfi simply reinforce that impression the future of farming could be bright but we have to give farmer the confidence to invest and bank the confidence to lend the government have to acknowledge the damage that be do to that confidence by the budget change especially in relation to agricultural property relief and business property relief anecdotal evidence have be grow for month we have see the closure of agricultural merchant and machinery dealer and we have see the number of first registration of tractor fall this week we have the publication of the national farmers union confidence survey thank the right hon gentleman for his excellent contribution to this debate do the point that he be make not underline the issue that be face in my constituency give the value of land it be be buy up by private equity firm and pension fund for use in industrial tree production or solar farm land be lose to food production as result of such development what the right hon gentleman refer to be the consequence of an agricultural policy that despite aim to do many worthy and worthwhile thing no long have the concept of food production at its heart across this house and the different party we need to rebuild consensus around get food production back into agriculture climate change mitigation nature restoration and the rest of it be all important part of the context but without food production at the heart of it we will have the unintended consequence that he outline would like to take the right hon gentleman back to the point that he be make before he be interrupt early today at business and trade question the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone ask what the government be do to assist the rural economy but answer come there none be it not the case that the rural economy be interlink and that if we damage one part of that economy farming we damage all of it on the right hon gentleman point about the supply of good and equipment to farmer there will be so many other industry affect if this persecution be allow to continue the right hon gentleman be absolutely right it have to be properly understand that farming underpin everything in rural community to take the example of agricultural merchant and machinery dealer these be successful businesspeople they will be people who be part of the local rotary club they will have child in school they will be people who take on all sort of leadership responsibility within the community if they can not make their living in the countryside we should not expect they just to sit around and wait for something to come along of course they will leave and the population will decrease and we will be in vicious downward cycle which be the very opposite of what we need it be also the very opposite of what good well resource and value farming industry can provide for the country as whole if we be serious about the mission for growth as the government tell we it have to be growth for everyone it have to be growth across every sector and every part of the country include rural area and farming that allow to come back to the point that be about to make about the nfu confidence survey which be publish just this week be afraid it make grim reading for anybody who care about the countryside and agriculture it tell we that of landowner believe that the reform to apr and bpr will increase their inheritance tax liability of those say they plan to reduce investment to mitigate the increase the figure increase to for mixed arable and livestock business and to for arable farm some of employer expect to be impact by the increase in employer national insurance contribution say they expect reduction in profit because of the increase and expect to reduce investment to offset the additional cost again that be on top of this week change to the sfi and the basic payment scheme would like to say quite lot more about other aspect of the budget particularly the removal of the ringfence for devolved budget but be reluctant to do so give the pressure on our time this afternoon and the number of people who want to contribute to the debate however have speak about those issue before so those who be interested in my view can refer to my previous contribution small silver lining be to be find in the debate on apr and bpr because it have force we to think about the extent to which farming produce such spectacularly poor return on capital this be something we have all know for year but now we have be force to ask ourselves why it be the case the hard fact of the matter be that year of government interference in the food market through agricultural subsidy have have the unintended consequence of keep farmer poor and make supermarket rich have ten minute rule motion next week to encourage the government to introduce meaningful regulation in the food supply chain and the minister and his colleague have recently speak about their intention to see farm income increase that be to be welcome but it will need much more comprehensive and coherent strategy than we have see thus far not all confidence be about finance we have see lot of doubt throw into every sector of agricultural production in recent month because of the biosecurity threat that face this country the poultry sector have be hit hard as consequence of avian influenza we have see foot and mouth outbreak on the continent we see african swine fever move across the continent and it seem likely that we will see bluetongue disease back in this country soon the vet on the frontline those in the animal and plant health agency do remarkable job and we owe they all debt of gratitude but so much more need to be do the environment food and rural affairs committee have hear evidence on this issue from port health authority local authority and the apha itself we have ask the department about the point at which government software system be update to stop animal product come from germany follow the identification of foot and mouth outbreak there despite get answer to our letter we have still not be tell by the department whether ipaffs the import of product animal food and feed system be update on or january that be something that the government should be able to tell we have sympathy for the government because they be deal with brand new system essentially we should be able to see this as pressure test on it if the system do not work perfectly everywhere let we identify those part where the pressure escape but in order to do that we need more transparency and more candour from government departments if the minister can answer that question when he respond to the debate will be enormously grateful if he can not it would assist the environment food and rural affairs committee greatly if we be able to get that answer in correspondence time really be against we this afternoon would have love to have the rest of the afternoon but we do not will conclude my remark but let say on behalf of the environment food and rural affairs committee that very much hope that member from across the house will continue to engage with our inquiry because if food security be national security as the prime minister keep tell we then our committee be one of the most important committees in this house rise order after the next speech will be impose four minute time limit with the exception of front bench speech as the representative for north somerset like many in this debate represent rural constituency and thus great number of farmer whom have have the privilege of meeting on number of occasion since july the farmer of north somerset have not shy away from express to their wide range of concern go far beyond merely change to the inheritance tax regime from those meeting have grow increasingly concerned that the outcry over change to inheritance tax in this house and the time subsequently give to the topic have distract we from the more fundamental question about the future of farming that be why thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure this debate and for make it clear in his application that he wish to debate farming more widely than merely discussion of the merit of the inheritance tax change start by recognise that farming be an issue that arouse great passion we have see that in our own constituency during visit in the past six month and even on the very road that surround this building with the protest that seem to occur every other week from conversation with farmer in my constituency have quickly gain an appreciation that we be talk about not just profession but lifestyle and often calling the constituent have meet be often work the soil that their father their grandfather and the generation before they work in some case back even beyond the creation of this chamber it be thus understandable why there be widespread feeling among farmer that too often this place so distant to so many do not listen to their need do not discuss the issue so pertinent to their livelihood and too often impose its will arbitrarily on they if we be be fair think all of we would admit that this be not new sentiment since the autumn budget this go back decade and have be direct at all party in turn want to use my speech to talk about an issue that may not be grab the headline currently but which from discussion with farmer in my constituency believe constitute the great impediment to thriving farming sector concern hear again and again no matter the product farmer may choose to specialise in be the excessive power of supermarket in contract negotiation and the raw deal farmer get as consequence too often farmer have speak to have be subject to take it or leave it negotiate position from these mega corporation which be able to dictate price and impose unfair condition on farmer many farmer have speak to have have perfectly edible crop reject due to minor aesthetic defect excessive delay in payment and indeed as some have tell even instance of entirely arbitrary cancellation of order with no reason give the fear of retaliation keep many of these instance from see the light of day and that fear have arise due to the oligopolistic nature of the supermarket industry in the flow from farm to fork the supermarket act as great gatekeeper siphon cut from the pass traffic while this issue be not unique to the uk after all mere five company control of the global trade in grain think it fair to say that in recent year our constituent have become increasingly aware of the greedflation they see reflect every day in the increase in the price they pay for food in supermarket these increase in price be not benefit the hard work farmer who produce that food but rather the shareholder which be often not even base in the uk last year alone we see the big four supermarket increase their profit by while farmer feel the continue squeeze from rise energy price rise fertiliser cost and rise labour cost to name but few thing if we be serious about improve the lot of farmer in this country think this be where we need to focus our attention and our effort do my hon friend agree that not only do the big six supermarket not have the interest of farmer at heart but two of they do not even pay corporation tax last year it be critical to address that in this wide discussion thank my hon friend for worthy contribution to the debate and completely agree it be fundamental that we fix some of the problem in the supermarket supply chain that be affect farmer and that company pay their fair share to this country farmer continue to feel the squeeze from rise price and think we must strengthen the groceries code adjudicator and give it real tooth and thus empower farmer to fight back and get the fair deal they deserve to do this it will need to be properly resource and to that end suggest that we look again at the levy supermarket pay which have not increase since despite dramatic rise in price and profit the farmer have meet do not shy away from tell how much they love their profession and how sad they be that their child do not see it as viable future career if we be to secure the future of farming we must secure the future workforce and to do that we must make farm profitable business without fundamentally rebalance the scale of power between those who grow our food and those who sell it farming will continue to be an unprofitable venture and an unattractive career for young people note that the next review of the groceries code adjudicator will start after this month and like the farmer of north somerset eagerly await to hear how my hon friend in the department for environment food and rural affairs intend to ensure that it be fit for the future the importance of farming can not be overstate it be vital not only for farmer but for all our community our economy and our national security farming allow we to keep food price as low as possible in shop and supermarket farming be the foundation of the rural economy it support ten of thousand of job not only on farm but all along the supply chain there be no national security without the food security that home grow farming provide have know this for all my year because grow up on farm see my family and friend work extremely hard to earn living get up before dawn and sometimes work until after the sun go down and toil in difficult condition away from the limelight in protect the environment and the countryside often with little thank or reward that be the story of so many family run farm across our country it be story of the borders of scotland and of british business up and down the united kingdom the labour government be put the huge benefit that farmer deliver at risk the future of farming be under threat because of labour family farm tax which will only compound the damage that the snp have already do to rural area across scotland family business which have often be pass down from generation to generation will be hit hard by labour vindictive family farm tax these small family business be the lifeblood of entire community they support job in local shop the worker who rely on their trade for their own business to survive and the business that maintain their equipment and supply their farm they be more than family farm they be community farm because they benefit everyone in the local area these fact have be ignore by the snp during its year in power and they have already be ignore by labour within year of its being in power what do the future of farming look like once labour bring in its family farm tax the national farmers union estimate that hundred of farm will face collapse because of this tax and future generation will be deny the chance to farm their family land if their farm do not need to be sell farmer will still be discourage from invest in their property because that would only increase the tax their child will have to pay and they may feel the need to save cash to cover future tax bill what will happen be that labour will force farmer to sell their family business our countryside will not be maintain to the same standard the same volume of high quality food will not be produce our environment will suffer as more foreign food have to be import other rural business in the supply chain will suffer from the decline in investment and ongoing trade and food price in shop and supermarket will rise in the end labour family farm tax will not just harm the future of farming but the future of the economy and the cost of live for we all in conclusion if the labour government be serious about support farm they would listen properly to farming community they would listen to the single big thing that farmer in our country be demand which be to scrap the family farm tax and restore the exemption of apr and bpr that be the only way to secure the future of farming the government should do the right thing and scrap the family farm tax rise order have to introduce an immediate three minute time limit because want to get everybody in on this important subject be grateful to be able to contribute to this debate give that have farmer in my constituency of shrewsbury which be famous for its food and drink sector and not least for the nation favourite market shropshire overall have more farm holding than any other county in the uk be very proud of some of our produce and in particular be proud of new technology that be be use in our area of outstanding natural beauty which be unlock hilly and rocky terrain for new productive land use have have the privilege to be invite to visit so many of our farm and work alongside local support network such as the shropshire nfu the country land and business association and our farmer support fund locally overwhelmingly my farmer tell one key message farming be tough profit margin be so tight and they have struggle for year with high input cost such as energy fertiliser and animal feed up by since while food price from the big six supermarket have be decrease since brexit leave we with some of the low price in europe far compound by terrible trade deal with new zealand and australia low productivity in farming be not just an academic description it be harsh reality for the farm livelihood that be force out of business since to help we comprehend the scale of sectoral collapse under the previous government that mean that more than farm go under every year of their government farm close every week it have leave farm with the low profitability of any sector in the uk this have to change for the sake of our hard work farmer and for the sake of our vital food security we must revitalise farm with productivity new technology and sustainability give what the hon lady just say about the number of farm holding would she regard it as sign of failure of this government if that number be low at the time of the next election have just explain that it be low since the start of the previous government so by the hon gentleman own admission presumably that be catastrophic failure so let we support our farmer to deliver their high quality food to high environmental and welfare standard into more market such as by the government new procurement policy do my hon friend agree that give some of the challenge that we have discuss today university research farm like henfaes in my constituency will play vital role in the future of farming do she welcome some of the grant announce by the secretary of state for farming innovation and technology that be most interesting that be exactly the direction of travel to make farming more productive and profitable we must embrace innovation let we take support measure such as the government new procurement policy to back british farming from defra which will promise that of public fund catering must come from local farm that meet our high welfare standard that mean that every meal in every hospital on every army camp and in every prison will be supply with at least local produce from british farmer can not wait to see the impact that will have at royal shrewsbury hospital and nesscliffe army camp in my constituency be sure that opposition member have question about yesterday because follow yesterday announcement from defra several farmer get in touch with with question about the propose change to the sfi scheme be glad to reassure any farmer who have apply that their grant will be forthcoming as all submission will be honour from the budget which have now be completely maximise in contrast to last year when the previous government be unable to distribute the fund to desperate farmer waste million under this government the entire budget have be commit three week before the end of the financial year help over farmer minister have clearly set out their approach which will take on board feedback from farmer on the complexity and inconsistency of the previous scheme and aim to provide more carefully manage programme the new improve sfi scheme will reopen this summer with large budget and more targeted approach deliver in fair and more orderly way ensure value for money for taxpayer and invest in food production and nature recovery project in my professional career before come to this place work for over year to design develop and deliver eu grant funding scheme such as these in my professional experience the most impactful scheme be those with robust strategic objective that be multi annual in nature and take regular opportunity to review and improve technical specification with feedback from applicant welcome this review and launch order be grateful to the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure this afternoon debate want to make three point salisbury my rural constituency have farming at its heart the universal feedback that we have have from farmer be that since this government have come in they have be very very disappointed the change to the apr and bpr have catastrophic implication for succession planning and despite make really sensible suggestion the nfu have be completely rebuff farmer be in absolute despair that come before we have all the change to national insurance and to the national living wage the overall context for operate small business which be what farm be have be transform the level of exposure that farmer feel to these combine pressure be enormous then yesterday we have the announcement of the suspension of the sfi key part of the environmental land management scheme number of farmer ring up yesterday and say this be the end what be we go to do one farmer speak to yesterday afternoon who operate farm work with an agent to prepare document to apply for grant but those have not quite go in so he now face grave uncertainty real black hole this need to be address urgently the combined effect of the change in the budget and last night announcement have have massive impact on the industry across the united kingdom want to use my remain time to focus on where we need to go now this be debate about the future of farming after all recognise that post brexit we need serious thinking and leadership about reconcile food production incentive environmental management and get in place the right arrangement for trade transition from where we be before be not straightforward but urge the minister to put some define objective into the public domain and make his official accountable for deliver on they that would help the government to set clear road map go forward and help famer know what food security really mean from his perspective farming be the lifeblood of our local community in my constituency recognise that farmer be often the guardian of the countryside and our natural heritage farmer like richard evans in my constituency brilliant sheep farmer at larling whom meet early this year and lead voice in the breckland farmers wildlife network that network be farmer lead group collaborate to support farming and the environment with member cover more than hectare of farmland in the breck they recognise not only that they be custodian of very special area for agriculture and food production but that it be home to huge range of specie many of which be find nowhere else in the uk on my visit with richard be join by representative from norfolk rivers trust to talk about how we can work together to support our river locally include rare chalk stream because farming have significant impact on our waterway however for farmer such as richard to continue their excellent work we must move towards future for farming that prioritise such farm we can not allow megafarm to dominate the industry and the landscape compassion in world farming study show that there be more than large intensive pig and poultry farm across the uk increase since norfolk have sadly be dub the megafarm capital of europe resident in my constituency be very concerned about the increase number of intensive farm and how they be contribute to biodiversity loss as well as climate change and air and water pollution very often such farming practice adversely affect people live nearby especially because of the health hazard pose by ammonia we have far propose megafarm to be build in my constituency at methwold if approve on april it would become one of the large in europe that application have receive over objection include from all local parish council nearby as well as the world wide fund for nature and compassion in world farming if the council be to make that decision early next month it would be disaster as have say no ifs no but it can not be allow to proceed this be not farm this be industrialisation also want to make reference to our county farm estate in norfolk which be particularly passionate about once mighty holding of more than acre it be now sit at around acre which still make it one of the large council own farming estate in the country recently meet richard and danielle gott at their farm in nordelph in my constituency who have successfully farm the land there for year we need to support farmer like richard and danielle and the next generation of farmer such as their daughter emma and jessica it be highly likely that with devolution the exist governance model will go we need to give priority to entry level farming as we move toward farming future thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure the debate the future of farming seem an apt title for this debate give the grave concern hold by the farming community the length and breadth of scotland and beyond over the government propose tax reform to apr and bpr and the inheritance tax come in next year the argument against the proposal have be well rehearse in this place they have be put to ministers time and time again here and in other forum consistent theme however seem to be their complete inability to listen to hear and act on those concern do not blame the minister in his place today blame treasury official think the minister be an honourable man who be try to do good job for farmer but do not think he be be listen to by other even on the government benches understand that around mp represent rural area have make their concern know to the treasury and be call for the million threshold to be raise to protect small family farm and for an amnesty for old farmer and those with serious health problem that seem reasoned and reasonable approach to but as say do not blame the minister for any of those thing research by farming association have already call into question the accuracy of the datum from which the million threshold be choose surely it be not outwith the wit of treasury official to return to their number and think again but rather than back the treasury into corner here let offer the government very sensible and reasonable way out of this impasse farming representative include nfu scotland which meet recently be suggest clawback mechanism as an alternative approach to generate the require tax revenue the mechanism would allow relief on qualifying asset but suggest charge iht on all those asset if subsequently sell by the beneficiary within an agree timeframe they suggest seven year the nfu say the proposal will meet the uk government aim of raise revenue avoid penalise elderly farm owner and risk break up family farm prevent stifle investment in food production and environmental stewardship and take away the incentive to use apr and bpr solely as way of avoid tax liability it would also target individual and corporation who be game the tax system by use the land to shelter from their liability the government do not have to cave in on this there be time they should simply agree to enter new round of consultation aim at hone their proposal engage with industry representative and consider how there might be some compromise finally want to finish by reference discussion have with the minister recently on the need to kick start the trade in seed potato which have be so damage by brexit the government be make positive move in the reset with the european union hope the issue will be high on their priority list to revive scotland important seed potato industry want to start my contribution today by pick up where leave off this morning in my question to the under secretary of state for business and trade my hon friend the member for ellesmere port and bromborough justin madders at the heart of the problem face farming and profitability be an unfair supply chain as we hear early the big six supermarket be in effect act like cartel force unfair price on farmer and pursue unfair practice towards family farm last year alone the big six make combine pre tax profit of more than billion of those big six two asda and morrisons do not pay penny of corporation tax as we know supermarket be price setter seek maximum profit to drive down on the cost they be prepared to pay for home grow quality produce at the same time the cost of run farm continue to rise with soar fuel fertiliser and equipment price in world where farmer and producer be struggle to make living and be rely on government grant and subsidy so that they can survive from one year to the next that can not be see to be fair or right will the hon lady give way will continue if may we need to look properly and with real scrutiny at the supermarket those practice need to change we can not allow farmer to bear the brunt of this system while other in the supply chain benefit so disproportionately want to address the issue of apr many many farmer have raise their concern with directly have listen to those concern in suffolk coastal and raise they directly with the treasury and defra remain committed to continue to advocate for farmer in suffolk coastal over the month ahead will the hon lady give way on that point will continue however it be important to reiterate that while the change to apr be significant they be not the root problem face the farming industry if farming be profitable farmer would be less worried about pay new tax bill the focus must be on make farm more profitable without profitability tax relief or government support will provide only limited help that include ensure fair price for quality produce protect farmer from unfair competition and address rise cost from fuel to fertiliser to equipment do not doubt that that will be tough battle to fight when society often prioritise price over quality people will happily spend more on cappuccino than they will on locally produce chicken but if we want to protect british farming we must change our approach the future of farming be essential not only for the economy but for the very fabric of rural society itself we must continue to put farmer first ensure they continue to feed and sustain we for generation to come rise as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture the deputy chair of the science innovation and technology committee and former minister for agritech and uk trade envoy be also from farming family and have no interest to declare other than deep interest in my family ability to continue farm their farm in suffolk most of all be the member of parliament for mid norfolk fabulously rural constituency do not need to tell the minister that because he have the privilege of be the labour party parliamentary candidate there three time he know what the house need to know which be that it be magnificently rural with village and three town it be the absolute engine room of food farming and food processing from banham poultry to cranswick right through to the goat shed rosie and alex begg grow blackcurrant for ribena carrick farms which supply all the food to darbys pub and novo farina develop gluten free flour it be an engine of some of the most exciting activity and technology in uk agriculture it be that engine because for or year it have enjoy relatively stable framework of support but history show we friend and colleague that if agriculture do not have that support it be vulnerable we have agricultural depression at the end of the century in the and and in the and we be at most extraordinary moment for uk agriculture we could be incubate fabulous agritech industry across the world there be wall of money to invest in agricultural science and research the world have to double food production in the next year on the same land area with half as much water and energy we be home to of the world top research institute we be an engine room for those technology say to the minister that current policy will overnight massively reduce the market in the uk for those innovation it will remove great industry which be begin to get off its foot and tackle the opportunity it have to be global engine of innovation if we be not careful we will sleepwalk into it despite the warning of the pandemic global supply chain shock the ukraine war and now president trump trade war as other have say in the interest of food security affordability and sustainability we need to support our uk agricultural industry and show the world how to deliver more from less that be why the all party parliamentary group on science and technology in agriculture of which be chair have call for tyre screech turn to support the sustainable intensification of agricultural productivity we need to produce more can tell the minister that in my beloved constituency which he know well with the impact of the farm tax the small business attack the abolition of sfi and the massive subsidy for solar farm it be begin to look as though the department for energy security and net zero and the ministry of housing communities and local government with its increase in housing target be try to get farmer off the land to make way for solar farm and badly design housing this be disaster for one of our most exciting industry uk agritech and beg the minister to take stand for it it be an honour to speak in this debate as member of the environment food and rural affairs committee thank our chair the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure the debate the future of farming be not simply about keep our field green livestock shed full or supermarket shelf stock but about secure the future of our rural community protect the environment and support the farmer who be the backbone of our nation food system this government inherit underspent farming scheme result in hundred of million of pound not reach farmer pocket record farm now use these scheme and more money than ever before be be spend through the sustainable farming incentive and countryside stewardship the recent publication of the land use framework set out the change and complementary use of land need to achieve our environmental target alongside support for the environmental land management scheme the framework will help to drive improvement on food security biodiversity carbon emission water and air quality and flood resilience the scottish land use strategy have show that we also need clear policy to give certainty on how to deal with directly compete interest on land as we know england be in the midst of transition if we be to make this transition successful we must ensure that farmer be support in this shift ensure new scheme be accessible flexible and equitable welcome the progress the government have make on free up bottleneck in application as the mp for most of the cannock chase national landscape also welcome the extension of the farming in protect landscape programme we know that any sector that do not have certainty in its workforce lack certainty for the future commend the stride the government have make on expand apprenticeship across the uk but our agricultural and land management sector need to share in the benefit of that figure show that only of the people work in agriculture be under and with the twin pressure of climate change and global food insecurity the next generation of farmer need to be equip to meet the challenge of the century automation be another way of address these challenge but the harsh reality be that small farm can not shoulder the burden of the risk of invest in expensive new tech there be good work be do on this with and year agreement be sign with farmer to unlock long term investment which hope will become the new normal without that certainty farmer will not be able to do everything we want to see lastly want to raise the long term plight of abattoir it be not frequently speak about but while there be abattoir in the there be now just make it far hard for many farmer to keep their supply chain small and local from farm to fork to bring my remark to conclusion the reality be that for many many year our farmer have be worried about their future and the future of their sector we need to ensure they feel confident that their concern be be hear and address so that we and our farmer can achieve the world lead ambition we have for our agricultural sector farming be the backbone of this country not only provide we with the food we need to feed our family but act as steward of the land that we hold dear farmer do so much more than grow our food they protect the countryside create job and contribute immensely to rural economy my constituency may not have as large farming population as some other but believe you madam deputy speaker the farmer we do have be vital to the national picture as the shadow farming minister my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore recognise during his recent visit to some of my local farmer their effort support local community provide employment and contribute to food security and pay tribute to each and every one of they also pay tribute to the farmer who take valuable time off the land today to bring their tractor down to parliament and support we here in this debate suspect there may even be some sit in the gallery upstairs change to agricultural property relief and business property relief from april will have profound consequence for family farm include those in my constituency the removal of the relief above the first million in agricultural and business property could mean farmer be force to pay inheritance tax at on the value of their property above the threshold which will push many of they out of business do my right hon friend agree that the change to agricultural property relief be completely contrary to what the prime minister outline in his initial speech on downing street where he say he want the government to tread more lightly on people life do she also agree that this policy be false economy and that it ultimately risk concentrate farming asset in the hand of very few which will make the market much bad for british consumer society and food security my hon friend be absolutely spot on know he speak and stand up for his local farmer very powerfully far from treading lightly this government be trample over our farmer this policy will lead to the break up of long establish farm with land be sell off to meet tax liability which will fear lead to the concreting over of our beautiful countryside another topic that demand our attention be the use of agricultural land for the siting of battery energy storage system while be fully supportive of the move to renewable energy just as with solar farm we must ensure that the siting of bess which be often large in scale be do with care and consideration in my constituency planning inspector have approve one of these battery storage facility on green belt agricultural land at chapel lane in pheasey park farm ward against the will of the local council and the community our land be finite and we must balance the need for renewable energy with the need to safeguard land for agricultural use and food production urge the government to take more balanced approach to land use ensure that agricultural land remain available for farming and food production fear that the change to the national planning policy framework and the planning and infrastructure bill will simply drive coach and horse through our arable and green belt land disrespect the view of local resident and risk our food security we can no long take food security for grant the war in ukraine global inflation supply chain disruption and extreme weather event be all contribute to rise food price and shortage in some area here in the uk we currently produce just of the food we need we can no long be complacent it be time to stand up for our farmer just this week the government announce the closure of the sfi scheme another kick to our farmer who be lead the way on change let conclude could say more and would love to say more by say that farming be not just job but way of life no farmer mean no food it be time this government ax the family farm tax the economic fundamental of farming must be priority and call on the government to focus on the key determinant of farm operating profitability there be many driver of what make british farm successful but structural pressure buyer oligopoly price input volatility international trade challenge differential in welfare and environmental standard and even our consumer culture continue to threaten their viability as result we have see increase consolidation with many farmer shift to large more arable focus operation when it come to trade livestock farming have be hit particularly hard the deeply flawed trade deal with new zealand be hammer blow to sheep farmer and our great british land industry undermine domestic producer and put british farmer at competitive disadvantage then there be the standard themselves our farmer operate to world lead standard of animal welfare food safety and environmental sustainability standard of which we be rightly proud yet there be little recognition of the additional cost that those standard impose instead we allow product from other country with low standard to flood our shelf undercut the british farmer who be do the right thing if we value high quality british food we must ensure that our policy reflect that through for example fair trade deal well labelling financial support that compensate for those high cost and be honest about the onshoring of emission as the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael outline at the start of the debate some farm be more profitable than other not just because of their scale and type of agriculture but because of their operating environment an operate environment that the government play crucial role in shaping access to target support for innovation and environmental land management can empower farm to thrive yet too often the support fail to reach the farm that need it the most welcome this government successful deployment of sfi which be something that the previous government fail to do but immediate visibility be need for farm look to implement the next wave of those initiative the power of supermarket must also be address to ensure that farmer receive fair return again must say that this be massive cultural challenge and shift that need to take place regard the value that we place on our food consider too the geographical disparity farmer in cornwall for example face unique challenge small field which take great often generational knowledge to manage high transportation cost and great exposure to extreme weather yet they receive the same market price as large lowland farm with few overhead government policy must acknowledge that uneven playing field and ensure that support reach those most challenging farm and geography which be essential to navigate our rural landscape such as that in cornwall congratulate my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on secure this important debate wish to follow on from what the hon member for st austell and newquay noah law say about trade deal we know that trade deal particularly the potential one with the us threaten to undermine our high animal welfare standard that we have spend year work so hard to establish if we allow product that be produce to low standard such as hormone treat beef or chlorine wash chicken to become the norm that will undercut our farmer this be not about protectionism but about fairness not only be vet and farmer proud of our high animal welfare standard but the british public be too we should not in any way be look to compromise those the uk have already make significant stride in reduce antibiotic use in livestock without compromise animal welfare our veterinary and farming sector have work together to promote the responsible use of antibiotic we be set an example for the rest of the world to follow as the responsible use of medicines in agriculture alliance report in highlight sale and usage of antibiotic in food produce animal remain low in fact the past year have see decrease in the use of antibiotic in animal and livestock long term antimicrobial resistance surveillance carry out by the veterinary medicines directorate show that multi drug resistance in animal be at its low level in decade such encouraging statistic be product of year of work and dedication between scientist and the farming community this be huge public health issue and we should be ensure that trade deal do not force our farmer to compete with country that do not have the same judicious use of antibiotic as we do on saturday visit the nfu in hampshire at ben robinson farm where like many lowland farmer they be about to start lamb this be the hard time of the year for sheep farm grow up on sheep farm those farmer will be work all day and all night in farming the amount of effort time and work that farmer put in do not always result in profit because so many factor be out of their control international disease outbreak geopolitical event that put up fertiliser price poor weather change government policy and potential trade deal pay tribute to the farming community network which work so hard to support the mental health of farmer on friday find myself more than metre under the north sea will explain why in just moment but before do so let acknowledge the hard work that our farmer do across the country and acknowledge point that hon member across the house have make which be that in recent year farmer across britain have face serious squeeze have meet local farmer and the nfu in my constituency and they put that squeeze down to range of reason range from poor trade deal to poor policy but one factor that wish to focus on be the soar cost of fertiliser which be drive by global supply chain shock price volatility and an over reliance on import these pressure be not just hit farmer in their pocket but threaten our food security and the resilience of our agricultural sector but deep underground in north yorkshire there lie potential solution last week have the pleasure of visit the icl boulby facility in my constituency which produce the crop nutrient fertiliser polyhalite and export it around the world polyhalite contain four essential nutrient potassium calcium magnesium and sulphur which be vital for plant growth not only that but it be super low carbon it require minimal processing and zero chemical additive mean that it lead to healthy more resilient soil in fact study have show that it can boost crop yield by to compare with standard fertiliser if we be serious about support british agriculture we must back british solution that mean clear strategy on fertiliser security investment in research and support for innovation that reduce cost for farmer while strengthen our food system the icl boulby facility be currently the only operational polyhalite mine in the world although second the landmark anglo american woodsmith project also in north yorkshire be on its way and have strong future ahead have be down both facility and be strike by their ingenuity above the wild unbroken heather of the north york moor and the beauty of the north sea coastline be untouched by the operation in the depth of the earth below pay tribute to those skilled team work underground in tough condition to produce these export which be boost our food security britain can not afford to be at the mercy of volatile global market when we have the resource the expertise and the ambition to build more resilient productive and sustainable farming sector right here at home it be clear that polyhalite can play significant role in support the government goal to strengthen british food security hope the minister will agree to meet and representative of the sector to discuss the challenge they face and the value of this export urge the government to recognise the potential of polyhalite to support farmer in adopt british make british mine solution do so would unlock further private investment safeguard job and secure the uk position as global leader in sustainable fertiliser production decision make in london be risk the future of farming in wales change the funding model for agriculture from one that be need base to one base on the barnett formula could lead to cut in funding for welsh farming of about that be despite wales have high proportion of farmer than other part of the uk the change to agricultural property relief and business property relief will have dramatic impact on the future of farming how can the uk government justify those change when they have no concrete datum on their impact in wales that be why we need wales specific impact assessment it be crucial that the government have accurate datum to understand the real impact of the change how do this help economic growth in wales ninety per cent of our land area be give over to farming in gross agriculture output be worth billion to the economy the wide food foundation sector in wales business that produce process manufacture and wholesale food and drink good turn over billion in never mind the wide supply chain of agricultural mechanic vet and animal feed producer why be the uk government undermine rather than support this industry and its growth potential government who do not understand the agricultural economy risk the future of rural community too westminster policy that do not consider the particularity of the welsh agriculture industry in which speak welsh trample over the future that we fight so hard for in wales threaten the future of agricultural and food production far threaten the ability of family and young people to stay and work in their community it be crucial that good quality fruitful farmland continue to be use for food security as land demand for non agricultural purpose increase the transfer of welsh land to company that do not have to worry about inheritance taxis be likely if not inevitable in my constituency of ynys môn we be battle to keep valuable fertile land away from developer plan for acre of solar farm which would have negative impact on the local economy this land have sustain we for generation in ynys môn across wales and far afield there be reason we be name môn mam cymru môn the mother of wales undermine welsh farmer and agricultural producer risk miss critical opportunity to shorten our food supply chain and improve our resilience the labour uk government decision show significant lack of understanding of the importance of farming in wales their inability to distinguish between tax avoid millionaire and corporation and hard work people make living from the land speak volume the uk government make the wrong decision now be the time to show that they truly support hard work people by listen to our farmer and reverse these ill thought out plan welcome this timely debate on the future of farming in the week in which the sfi rug be pull out from underneath farmer surely the future of farming have to be young farmer have be in touch with some young farmer in my constituency to ask what they think should talk about in this debate be send screenshot by beth who be partway through her sfi application it say thank you for do your application when you be ready submit it if we need to close application we will give you six week notice we will publicise this on and we will email you if that be not broken promise do not know what be louise another farmer in my constituency say that she be angry disappointed upset and exasperate we have follow the government advice to the letter and be kick in the tooth another farmer say pull sfi be absolutely criminal just more short term thinking that force we into decision we do want to make ben say yet another nail in the coffin for family farm with no warning environmental project that have be in planning for month on our farm will have to be stop can not plan for the future when the rule keep change the future of farming need to be and for sustainable for fair and for in partnership think the hon member will agree that the shutting down of the sfi with no notice on tuesday night be an awful situation defra have be either disorganised or sneaky but either way it diminish the trust of our farming community in the government could not agree more this have diminish trust it be vital to rebuild that trust because we need that sustainable fair and in partnership future for farming it need to be sustainable in environmental term we need to recognise the reality of the climate crisis and the nature crisis we need to support our farmer to make the vital transition to nature friendly farming farmer in north herefordshire be at the forefront of that but they need the government to back they not knock they off their foot with policy change with zero notice we need farming to be sustainable environmentally and sustainable economically it be not acceptable that the rate of return on farming be so low for so many the government have crucial role to play in tackle that the green party have long call for doubling of the nature friendly farming budget because of all the extra benefit that farming provide socially economically and environmentally we need the government to step up on that farming need to be fair both internationally and locally internationally our farmer must not be undercut by trade deal that let in product that undermine our animal welfare and environmental standard we need to ensure that the government stand firm on that farming need to be fair locally because access to farming support scheme have not be equal it be hard for many farmer to access those scheme whatever replace the sfi hope that the minister will ensure that farmer have equal access and the support that they need to access those scheme interruption see that the minister be nod finally the future of farming have to happen in partnership with farmer themselves their voice have to be hear and with the rest of government we need fully join up approach to land use food farming and sustainability it also need to happen in partnership with nature because without thriving natural world there be no sustainable future for farming have often speak about my deep connection to farming it be in my dna love the rural way of life and for year have be part of local farming community that value hard work resilience and responsibility for the land my granda always say if the farmer be do well in this country no one be he be not prophet nor do he hold any of the grand title or credential so often revere in this place what he be be farmer one who understand all too well that agriculture be the cornerstone of our economy and that when that cornerstone be break remove or chip away at the consequence be dire our economy weaken our rural community suffer and our food security be place at risk trust in politic be hard earn but easily break so when our farming community hear promise from the now prime minister at the national farmers union conference in they could have be forgive for place certain degree of trust in this government farmer could relate to the prime minister when he say lose farm be not like lose any other business it can come back you deserve well he go on to say we can have farmer struggle and he claim that farmer deserve government that listen he talk about stability and certainty well those word ring hollow do they not the october budget be defining moment in this parliament history deliver the big hammer blow to farmer in generation the family farm tax grab as it be now know be an existential threat to the future of farming and those who survive that blow will be strangle by the government other disastrous policy let we consider the closure of the sustainable farming incentive this week and new tax on double cab pick up which be lifeline vehicle for many farmer we can add to those tax increase on fertiliser hike in national insurance contribution cut to business property relief and an ever grow burden of environmental rule regulation and requirement to add insult to injury while the government speak about those thing be need to fill the black hole and rebalance the book million be go in uk aid to foreign farmer what good be so call environmental progress if we end up import more food from abroad food produce to low standard and with far great carbon footprint than what we can grow here at home this debate be rightly focus on the future of farming but without urgent action there will be no future for many of our farming family for generation they have feed the nation and be steward of our land yet today they face relentless threat and none more so than the family farm tax implore those across the way on the government benches who represent rural constituency to rise up and fight back for uk farming fight back for their rural constituent and fight back for the man and woman who feed we and for the circular economy that depend on farming our farmer find themselves in an increasingly precarious position politically we see drip drip of punish legislation erode our agricultural sector the family farm tax have see regular protest here in westminster and those farmer do not come here to pledge their fealty much as the government would like they to note that the hon member for north somerset sadik al hassan mention how unprofitable farming be do not know how he hop they will be able to square the inheritance tax issue with an unprofitable business we have recently see the announcement of the suspension of the sustainable farming incentive with only minute notice and of new compulsory purchase power that will see yet more farmland concrete over dozen and dozen of solar farm be in the pipeline which will all be easily force through as nationally significant infrastructure project because of laughably low qualifying threshold that be now nearly year old the future of farming under this government look bleak diversification appear to be one of the few option available to farmer and innovation be another visit vantage in great staughton in my constituency to discuss how advance in agricultural technology can have positive impact on farming technique particularly as farm face manpower shortage few resource and increasingly few available experienced farm worker will mumford fifth generation local farmer and the manage director take the time last year to meet and talk through some of the local challenge face by farmer and to highlight the opportunity present by development in agricultural technology that give an opportunity to see demonstration of will robot tractor the agxeed agbot not particularly snappy name grant you and surely miss opportunity to call it robocrop the agxeed tractor be remotely control robot tractor that plough pre program route it be small than conventional tractor and do not look recognisably like one but there be multiple benefit to use such technology be remotely pilot the tractor do not require driver or therefore cockpit which make it significantly light the benefit of that be small footprint and therefore reduce soil compaction which in turn improve drainage and reduce flooding further benefit be how the tractor can be use day or night without the need for human operator at busy time of the year it allow work to continue when resource be stretch many of our generational farmer increasingly see old family member unable to work the hour they once do and automation within the industry can benefit those small family farm by reduce the need for reliance on additional farm worker give the struggle to guarantee that resource robocrop be clever and impressive piece of farm machinery and though not commonly see at present it be now use in my constituency that be just one example of forward think sustainable technology that be make difference for farmer like will we need the government to take action to ensure that british farm can utilise groundbreake technology like that to secure the future of british farm want to see our farm food security and rural way of life protect want to see the future of farming be able to display the innovation that have lead the world in sustainable practice for farm to succeed we need farmer collectively we must support and protect our vital farming sector declare an interest as the wife of farmer and agricultural contractor farming be difficult job unbelievably long hour and physically hard work in all weather every day of the year but it be true vocation and labour of love that farmer do to provide we with food eat and food security lincolnshire farmer be particularly important for food security provide of the uk food of its veg of its poultry and of its wheat job in the food chain make up of job in the greater lincolnshire area and farmer locally care for acre of farm woodland and mile of public right of way but all that be under threat food production be less profitable and in some case it be not profitable at all thank to this labour government the hon lady be make an excellent speech throughout the debate have struggle to understand the point put forward by labour members that while they rightly acknowledge that farming be not profitable they support policy that will take even more cash away from farming business do she like find those two policy hard to reconcile find they extremely difficult to reconcile in early october go to the farmers weekly award in london where the minister in his red bowtie give speech in which he say that the government would have the farmer back be sure he believe it be true when he say it but within month he be unfortunately prove wrong with this government budget many member have talk about the profitability of farming how will the family farm tax make farm more profitable how will the family business tax the drastic drop in delinked payment the rise in the minimum wage rise national insurance contribution or the tax on double cab pick up make farm more profitable they will not how will close the spi payment scheme early and without notice despite have promise to give notice make farm more profitable and business more secure it will not the government now talk about take land without proper due consideration that have lead many farmer in my constituency to ask why do this labour government hate farmer so much why do they want to hurt our farmer so much what do the hon member think that the large farming budget in recent year will do if not make farming more profitable do not support the hon gentleman figure or think the government will make farming more profitable it be the classic socialist trick of say we give you some money here and we take some money there we have see it with hospice and the nhs and we see it with farming as well they be take money away in taxis leave right and centre then give few penny over there and say be grateful why do you be afraid that it do not wash with farmer farmer be clever people and they can see straight through it the effect of the government policy will be reduce food security the collapse of small business and the purchase of that land by large corporation and an increase in food price for consumer rich and poor across the country this be debate on the future of farming many farmer in my constituency feel that thank to this labour government they have no future in farming we believe in future in which farming thrive one base on stability growth and sustainability sadly labour policy jeopardise all three whether it be the disastrous last minute overnight closure of the sustainable farming incentive the relentless family death tax assault on family farm or the negligence towards rural business labour agenda harm the heart of rural britain include my kingswinford and south staffordshire constituency labour short sightedness in decide to stop accept new application for the sustainable farming incentive with just half an hour notice give to the nfu despite the promise of six week notice be clear sign of its failure to understand the long term need of our farmer while thousand of farmer be look to the sfi for support labour have choose short term political convenience over long term sustainability our farmer deserve consistency and trust in the future not abrupt cut to vital programme we will continue to back farmer labour inheritance tax policy be direct attack on the heart of family farm the plan cut to agricultural property relief and business property relief will make it impossible for farmer to pass on their livelihood and their business the farm that they have be farm for generation to their child without face huge tax burden accord to the nfu someone who inherit an average cereal farm from their parent face inheritance tax payment with each one represent time what they can expect to make in annual profit they be run at loss to fund the government that be serfdom not farm my hon friend be make great and impassioned speech the government be say that one can avoid the tax but one do not know who be go to die and when in fact the generation do not necessarily always occur year apart which could compound the tax even far could it not my hon friend be absolutely right clearly the people who be well place to avoid pay the tax be the very people who ought to be pay and contribute the mega landowner for the average cereal farmer however who could face inheritance tax bill of time the value of their annual profit the only recourse will be to sell land or machinery that be so blatantly obvious that the fact that the government do not see it make it difficult to assume that the policy be down to incompetence rather than deliberate strategy to dismantle family farm particularly when combine with the compulsory purchase plan set out by the deputy prime minister this week labour policy threaten the future of farming rural business and the community that rely on they the sustainable farming incentive inheritance tax relief biosecurity and the damage cause to our high street by labour budget in each of those area labour mismanagement be let down farmer their family and our rural community rural britain can thrive when farmer be support business be protect and community grow strong we will continue to fight for that future and call on the government to change course before it be too late for our rural way of life we will continue to fight for our farming community include mine in kingswinford and south staffordshire it be pleasure to speak in this debate and thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for lead it be always so proud to stand up in this place and represent farmer in strangford and across northern ireland who be nothing but dedicated to their trade declare an interest as member of the ulster farmers union farming be massively important in northern ireland where it contribute billion annually to the economy furthermore we be pivotal to the agricultural output of the united kingdom account for growth of which be more than any other nation that contribute to this great united kingdom northern ireland export large amount of beef dairy and poultry to gb the republic of ireland and far afield lakeland dairies in my strangford constituency send its milk product all over the world that create sense of just how important our farmer be to state the obvious it be no secret that my party colleague and other member across the house be shock and sadden by the chancellor decision in november to introduce inheritance tax for family run farm the fact be that of farmer can not and will not survive this live on farm and have great relationship with my neighbour every one of they speak to before this debate and local farmer in my constituency know all too well the impact this will have thank the hon gentleman who be in fact my neighbour for give way he talk about the number of farm that will be affect by this it be far high than the treasury tell we we know that the scotland office be compile its own figure to push back against the treasury figure which will no doubt be trot out here again today be there not fundamental problem here as the vast majority of farm will be affect by this the hon gentleman be absolutely right and he sum up our view the decision to introduce the farmer inheritance tax will destroy the very essence of what so many farmer have work hard to achieve have call on numerous occasion for the minister to support we he be an honourable man he could be friend of the farmer we will see just how much of friend he be if he contact the chancellor and suggest to she that one solution be to increase the threshold from million to million if that be do farm will be save as will the future of family farm in northern ireland do he want to be the farmer friend be the farmer friend when the minister approach the chancellor and persuade she to increase the threshold from million to million he will be my friend forever and he will be the friend of all the farmer in my constituency he need to do that the national farmers union and the ulster farmers union have the solution if can digress slightly northern ireland have one of the high tuberculosis rate in europe with over of our herd affect annually what discussion have the minister have with the farming minister in northern ireland andrew muir in relation to tb and avian flu to ensure that we can overcome these setback together our food security and farming industry matter it be the young farmer who we be fight for be fight for my neighbour son who want to have farm for the future there be so many expectation on farmer be pleased to see that there have be boost in the conversation surround the decline mental health of our farmer which be another massive issue there be no doubt that our farmer need to be support not tear down by government who be mean to represent they to conclude be proud of our farming industry and grateful for it and want it to succeed for those who represent rural constituency or those who do not the importance of agriculture can not be disregard and we must make it goal to preserve protect and progress the success of farming across northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom we need the minister to stand up for farming we all look to he to do that go to the chancellor tell she what we need to increase the threshold from million to million and thing will be well call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on open the debate and on the thoughtful and knowledgeable speech he make also compliment member on both side of the chamber for what they have say be bring up on farm be the wee boy who shoo the cow home to the faraway field represent the big constituency in the uk have an awful lot of farm and croft in my constituency farming be part of our way of life it be about the food we eat it be about the fight against climate change it be about our heritage and in constituency such as mine it be about the tourism economy the change of government have be difficult before brexit do not help we all know that argument and botch trade deal have not help either much have be say about the taxation and will not repeat it but will remark on one thing that have be say which be that land price in the six counties of northern ireland be much high than in other part of the united kingdom so the effect of the taxation will be rather large there to compound this cut to defra day to day spending mean that many family farm and rural business will struggle that be why my party be say that we should raise the farming budget by billion if we can do that perhaps we can help we want to see renegotiation of trade agreement to protect british farmer and strengthening of the groceries code adjudicator first should declare that my partner be conservation farmer in somerset have be parliamentary private secretary to vince cable the then business secretary who set up the groceries code adjudicator recall his frustration that the then prime minister and chancellor of the exchequer refuse to grant the adjudicator the power she need do my hon friend agree that the adjudicator will never be able to exercise meaningful control over the big supermarket which fund its operation through levy if the cost of single investigation be great than its annual budget may ask the minister through my hon friend to remedy this decade old wrong my hon friend bring knowledge from the past which be very valuable to the debate my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland be also champion of this cause and what he say strike chord among farmer in my constituency get fair deal be fundamental to make farm viable for the long term it be not that we want to do everything but hope that the government will engage constructively with my right hon friend on this it be too important to let this one go and it could be an easy win for the government and for all of we the hon gentleman be make an excellent speech but do he agree as fellow scottish mp that our farmer be face double whammy not only do we have to deal with the vindictive family farm tax be impose by the government opposite but we face the hostile environment that the scottish national party government be create towards our farming community in scotland thank the hon gentleman for his contribution and what pity it be that our snp colleague be not with we at this point because we both might have something to say about that there have be lack of knowledge north of the border or lack of understanding believe of thing that be fundamental to the way of life in the constituency we represent at the different end of scotland time be short but want to conclude by mention three thing that be cause my constituent some anxiety in particular speak with farmer this week and there have be recent publicity about what be know as lab grow meat produce from cell in laboratory environment it be think that this could be upon we within two year yes it be way of produce food but what do that mean for our livestock farmer that need to be look at very carefully indeed the second thing be duty bind to mention be the low price of malt barley this be the high quality barley and be use to make whisky it be low price because not so much be be buy by the whisky distiller reflection of the fact that they be not sell so many bottle of whisky be do my good my right hon friend be indeed do his bit and never cease to do so but this again go back to an early point that farming be intermingle throughout the entire economy if we can have measure from the government to increase whisky sale and to encourage export such as get good quality scotch whisky into the indian market that will in the long term benefit the grower of malt barley which will make farm more viable again be sorry that the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan be not with we because in all fairness he do make that point the hon gentleman also make point about seed potato welcome the windsor framework at the time and be thank by the then prime minister for do so it mean we could get our seed potato into northern ireland but know from talk to seed potato farmer that there be market in europe cry out to get hold of high quality scottish seed potato they be the good because they be some of the safe from virus eelworm or whatever will be extremely grateful to the government if they use every measure at their disposal to try to improve sale finally want to make rather strange point number of farmer have tell that people who have work on the farm sometimes for decade be now move on to other job people who drive tractor or use implement to cultivate field be sometimes take the option of go off to drive digger for builder and labour shortage be begin to occur on some of our farm that should be worry not just for way farm be run presently but for find new entrant into farming again commend my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland for his speech and for bring this debate before we farming be absolutely fundamental to the country and the way we feed ourselves and in world that as we have see be quite dangerous to say the least the more we feed ourselves and the less we rely on import the well call the shadow secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs congratulate the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael on secure this important debate thank he for bring his expertise as chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee to the discussion may welcome although be not suppose to the farmer in the public gallery who have be know make their view not all of they terribly happy about various contribution during the debate and the tractor outside we can not hear the tractor in the chamber but they have be toot as loudly as they possibly can be not sure the tooting be to welcome the sfi scandal that emerge on tuesday but no doubt the farming minister the hon member for cambridge daniel zeichner will be able to help we with that this debate should have be fill with positivity and confidence about the future of british farming instead it have be overshadow by this labour government farming fiasco in just few short month this city dwell government have destroy family ambition for the future put at risk generation of expertise and custodianship and less than hour ago rip the rug out from underneath business immediately this government have treat farmer and the countryside with unashamed contempt and that contempt have consequence the nfu announce this week that farm business confidence have reach historically low level and that be before the sfi scandal on tuesday night new tractor registration be at the low level since when visit the lincolnshire agricultural machinery manufacturers association in january the farming minister apparently could not make it manufacturer be tell how people be not invest in new machinery as direct result of the budget be afraid robocrop will have to wait for the next conservative government just as the chancellor inherit the fast grow economy in the and have grind it down into stagflation so too the secretary of state inherit grow farming sector that have go through massive change since brexit but be seize the new farming and environmental opportunity available after few month of this city centric government farming family be feel ignore alienated and disrespect to use the secretary of state own word but where be the secretary of state have be hunt high and low for he but nowhere be he to be find he have major announcement yesterday but he send his poor junior minister out to take the flak because the secretary of state be miss in action where be rural labour mp hon member here we have hear about rebel force rise oh would not do that if be you we have hear about rebel force of labour mps who be go to stand up to the government on the family farm tax this debate be their chance to show their support for their farmer but where be they total of labour mp have turn up and six have speak that be of the parliamentary party the labour government farming fiasco policy can be summarise in three point they will remove without warning farming and environmental scheme that help farm thrive and on which farm build their business case they will permit the state to seize farmland without consent or market value and if family farm manage to cling on despite that labour will tax farmer for die let we deal with the first point the abrupt halting of the sustainable farming incentive and the massive cut to delinked payment the government sneak the sfi decision out late on tuesday night before be drag to the dispatch box by we yesterday that be chaotic and inept way for government to treat taxpayer business and family yesterday the minister keep use the figure of billion for farming over two and of course the funding for the first year be set by the previous government include the million that be roll over from the previous year it be for labour ministers to set the budget for after the spending review will the minister confirm that the defra budget will not face substantial cut in the spending review give he have rely on that figure so much if he can not confirm that then those figure be meaningless as ministers be count money for that could be remove at stroke by the chancellor the decision on sfi have consequence as my right hon friend the member for salisbury john glen and my hon friend the members for mid norfolk george freeman for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson and for kingswinford and south staffordshire mike wood have make clear david from gloucestershire farmer ask the minister whether he should simply plough up his farm and turn his back on year of farming with an environmental focus he say we be small family farm will be able to afford environmental principle everyone lose but the environment mostly we have hear from hon member about how farmer have contact they because they face financial crisis as result of this decision yet the no farming minister tell they that they should be celebrate well the tractor outside do not seem to be toot in celebration at his announcement yesterday let we move on to delinked payment which be cut in the budget ten of thousand of farmer who be not sign up to sfi in any of its iteration be still be subject to cut in their delinked direct payment leave many in cash flow crisis include tenant farmer that be not mention at all by the hon member for shrewsbury julia buckley for south west norfolk terry jermy for cannock chase josh newbury for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter for st austell and newquay noah law or for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer an urgent issue face the industry be the importance of biosecurity to the future of farming the second case of foot and mouth disease in europe be alarming but we have hear nothing from the government on that will the minister confirm whether funding for dover port health authority have now be agree outline how he be prevent the rise trend of bushmeat be sell over social medium platform and explain why the government continue to ignore our call to increase funding for the redevelopment of weybridge can reveal what the secretary of state and the farming minister have be prioritise this week they have issue consultation not on sfi the family farm tax or cut to delinked payment but on how to carry chicken be sure everybody think that really be the national priority for farming at the moment let we turn to the government plan to undercut property right and force farmer to sell their land at below market value this be policy that go against the fundamental british principle of land ownership and put food security and price at risk my hon friend set out the case on that we then move on to the point make about the family farm tax which the hon member for north somerset sadik al hassan criticise as be distraction the hon member for suffolk coastal seem to be argue for more taxis on farmer but at least those labour members mention the family farm tax the hon member for shrewsbury for south west norfolk for cannock chase for st austell and newquay and for middlesbrough south and east cleveland do not see fit to mention it because they be ignore the fact of life on this as conservative member know this policy be have genuine emotional and economic toll on farmer throughout the united kingdom one farmer tell ve stop encourage my daughter to spend time on the farm so do have to have the conversation of why she can take over in the future this government be rob the next generation of farmer of their future and this be also have devastating impact on elderly farmer it be share in the senedd this week that farmer decline cancer treatment month before his death as he want to make sure that he die before these change come into effect that be desperately harrowing yet we be be tell this week in week out by farming organisation all because the chancellor who by the way refuse to meet farmer be destroy british farming with her taxation policy this be not just about the family farm tax it be about the family business tax the national insurance hike the fertiliser tax and the double cab pick up tax which be all set out by the hon member for upper bann carla lockhart and my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham you name it the government will tax it that be why my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham say that farmer see no future in farming under this government in the word of one mid devon farmer at no time in all these year have feel so deflate with the job to the farmer despair at this city dwell government please know that we conservative hear you support you and will work with you to mend the outright assault on the countryside that this labour government be carry out together we will build bright future for farming thank the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael and congratulate he on secure this very important debate on the future of farming will not say that agree with all his conclusion in his opening comment although listen to they closely but thank he and his fellow member of the environment food and rural affairs committee for their continue work look forward to meet his committee in time be very grateful to have the opportunity to talk about the very important role that farm play in this country because food security be national security and our commitment to farmer be absolutely steadfast it be the hard work of the uk farmer that put food on our table and steward our beautiful countryside as we all know though the sector be face high cost and tight margin farmer have struggle to get enough worker to pick fruit and veg and frankly they have be sell out in past trade deal farmland be increasingly at risk from severe flooding and drought and this all come as we face the big transition for farming in generation move away from the basic payment scheme towards more sustainable method of farming the underlying problem in the sector be that farmer do not make enough money for the hard work and commitment that they put in we be absolutely committed to make farming more profitable and that approach will underpin our year farming road map and our food strategy through which we will work in partnership with farmer to make farming and food production sustainable and profitable that road map stand on three principle the first of which be sector that have food production at its core the role of farming will always be to produce the food that feed our nation the instability that we have see both relate to ukraine and during covid show that food security truly be national security the second principle be sector in which farm business be more resilient and able to withstand the shock that disrupt farming from time to time whether it be severe flooding drought or disease we will help farmer who want to diversify their income to put more money into their business so that they can survive those more difficult time when they come will the minister give way be go to make some progress because know that time be short the third principle be sector that recognise that restore nature be not in competition with sustainable food production but be essential to it on our first strand food production our new deal for farmer be support they to produce food sustainably and profitably and we be make progress statistic release early this week show that average farm business income across the country be forecast to rise in the first year of this government that be welcome news but we recognise that there be more to do that certainly will not happen overnight but over recent week we have announce series of new policy we be extend the seasonal worker visa for five year and we be make the supply chain fairer an issue raise by my hon friend the members for north somerset sadik al hassan and for suffolk coastal jenny riddell carpenter in the next few week we will see new regulation for the pig sector make sure that contract clearly set out expectation and only allow change if they be agree by all party of course we be also introduce new regulator alongside the groceries code adjudicator build on the work of the exist regulator the agricultural supply chain adjudicator which be already in place we be use the government own purchasing power to back british produce work with the cabinet office to create new requirement for government catering contract to favour high quality high welfare product that british producer be well place to provide as be outline very well by my hon friend the member for shrewsbury julia buckley that will mean that british farmer and producer can compete for fair share of the billion year that the public sector spend on food with that money go straight into farmer bank account to boost turnover and profit we will never lower our food standard in trade agreement but will promote robust standard nationally and internationally and will always consider whether overseas produce have an unfair advantage that point be make by my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay noah law and by other we be invest in the uk agri technology sector and listen closely to the comment make by the hon member for mid norfolk george freeman there be always much that we agree on as we announce last month we be look to put in furth million in farming grant and we be also strengthen the wide british tech sector point that be make well by my hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer these reform will support farmer to make more money from the food they produce on the second strand diversification farmer must be resilient against future challenge if they be to remain financially viable and strengthen food security we know the threat from flooding drought and animal disease as well as the geopolitical tension that increase demand on our land for energy generation we be invest to help farm business build resilience against animal disease that can devastate livelihood and threaten our entire economy we be all mindful of the issue with bluetongue and avian flu on the recent case of foot and mouth that we see in germany and the one in hungary speak to the hungarian minister early this week and we have put in place all the appropriate precaution as ever though if the shadow secretary of state want briefing with the chief vet that be always available in these case we be invest over million to set up new national biosecurity centre modernise the animal and plant health agency facility in weybridge which will be vital for protect farmer food producer and exporter from disease outbreak that we know can be devastating to business we be help keeper of cattle sheep and pig in england to improve the health welfare and productivity of their animal by expand the fully fund farm visit offer we have also announce new way to help farmer to remain profitable and viable even in challenging harvest we will consult on national planning reform this spring to make it quick for farmer to build new building barn and other infrastructure to boost food production and we will ensure that permit development right work for farm to convert large barn into whatever be require or suit their business planning whether that be farm shop holiday let or sport facility we be work with the department for energy security and net zero so that more farm business can connect their own electricity generation to the grid more quickly so that farmer can sell surplus energy and diversify income the third element be nature restore nature be vital to food production it be not in competition with it healthy soil abundant pollinator and clean water be the foundation that farm business rely on to produce high crop yield and turn profit without nature thrive there can be no long term food security that point be well make by my hon friend the member for south west norfolk terry jermy we now have more than half of all farmer in environmental scheme that include live sfi agreement mean that hectare of arable land be be farm without insecticide hectare of low impact grassland be manage sustainably and km of hedgerow be be protect and restore that be important for nature we have already have discussion about the sfi cap it be set at billion for and as we discuss yesterday that cap be reach this week with record number of farmer in the scheme and live agreement every penny be now pay to farmer or commit for payment through exist agreement or submit application we will continue to support farmer to transition to more sustainable farming model and we will announce detail of the revise scheme after the spending review the clarification that everybody want be this we see the figure last night and they cut across two year so what be the money for this financial that the minister describe as cap what be the value that he reach on tuesday night that lead to that announcement we have be far more transparent in disclose how the budget work than the previous government the figure be disclose last night and the shadow secretary of state can look closely at that as she will know we have to monitor thing closely over multiple year what we can not and will not do be play fast and loose with the nation finance we be take no lesson from the conservatives about how to manage public money in this country this be about use public money in way that support food production restore nature and respect farmer for the effective business people that they be while ensure that we stick to our budget we be also improve other farming scheme the government have announce an increase in high level stewardship payment rate across range of option for this year we will reopen the elm capital grant scheme and open the rolling application window for the countryside stewardship high tier later this year we be continue with the important landscape recovery project that be award funding in round and as well as some of the other fund reference by my hon friend the member for cannock chase josh newbury it be those three strand that will create resilient profitable sector for decade to come look forward to continue this important discussion with member from all part of the house call alistair carmichael to quickly wind up since open this debate douglas paterson seventh generation farmer in my constituency have send copy of letter address to his great grandfather from downing street date march it state dear sir we have now reach crisis in the war when to ensure victory the heroism of our army at the front must be back by the self sacrifice and tireless labour of everyone at home to this end the production of each quarter of wheat and oats and of each bushel of potato be of vital importance the letter finish by say that the government be confident that farmers will at once step forward and do all in their power to utilise their service to the good advantage the farmer of this country can defeat the german submarine and when they do so they destroy the last hope of the prussian it be sign lloyd george the fact that we can stand in this chamber today and debate this matter be testament to the fact that charles paterson and his generation do step forward and it be why we have solemn and historic duty to ensure that his great grandson can continue to do the same can think of no well definition of what be mean by national interest question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the future of farming mental health support educational settings beg to move that this house have consider mental health support in educational setting thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate and the mps from across the house who support its application also thank emily horsfall my team and the staff at the mental health foundation for their support in prepare for today debate there should be no doubt that good mental health and wellbeing be as critical to the progression of our young people as physical health be protect mental health at an early age can have defining impact on lifelong resilience and ensure positive mental health outcome at time when young people up and down the country especially girl and young woman face barrage of challenge from what feel like never end conveyor belt of demeaning and misogynistic content on social medium the consequence of the pandemic and the cost of living crisis this be timely debate and thank hon member who have stay in the chamber to contribute to it much of what will say today reflect my conversation with young people parent teacher and professional in my constituency of redditch and the village when they approach on visit when be food shopping in tesco or at one of my surgery they display courage and determination to build system that be fit for purpose and which will ensure that all child get the support they need to have the most fulfilling life possible hope this debate can be about how we can support our school and education professional who be not train mental health professional but be so often on the frontline to ensure that our child get the good support they can at the most appropriate time commend the hon gentleman for bring forward this issue be just look at some of the stat for northern ireland in order to support his argument in pupil with disability report low level of general wellbee across all measure than those who be not disabled do he agree that access to pastoral care team who be equip and train to help those with decline mental health due to disability would be one way of address this very issue think that be the first time the hon gentleman have intervene on so feel very honoured absolutely agree with he and will talk about other affected group later in my remark thank he for his intervention hope this debate can be about how we support our school and education professional but also hope that the discussion raise awareness about the challenge face young people know that some people like to hand wave away any discussion about mental health problem among child and young people since the announcement of this debate have read previous debate elsewhere and few people have whisper in my ear that they do not believe that child be resilient enough these day well simply do not buy that argument know it make some uncomfortable when young people talk about their mental health challenge but it can only be positive that awareness and the mainstreaming of mental health condition have give so many across society the confidence to have honest conversation about how they be feel and the impact that other action can have on their mental health what do the statistic tell we about the state of our young people mental health nhs statistic show we that about one in five child and young people age eight to have probable mental disorder in and that the number of urgent referral of child and young people to emergency mental health service have triple since the uncomfortable truth be that waiting list for child and adolescent mental health service can be postcode lottery for instance in november last year the average waiting time for child to receive referral for first appointment in hereford and worcestershire be seven week compare with the national average of five week from freedom of information request we know that one child wait almost two year for an appointment referral at the hereford and worcestershire health and care nhs trust have increase by in the last five year trend that be reflect across the country thank my hon friend for secure this backbench business debate that statistic of one in five young people have mental health condition must concern we all hear from my own constituent in shipley that they be wait long time to get their child see on the nhs whether for an attention deficit hyperactivity disorder assessment or to get medication and during that time the child be unable to participate in school do my hon friend agree that it be vital that child and young people get access to mental health support and that we get wait time down so that they can participate properly in school absolutely agree this be about parity between mental and physical health we would move heaven and earth if those child have physical injury and we must do more to assess and treat the mental health condition from which young people be suffer my hon friend make valid point about the need for parity between mental health and physical health do he agree that there be actually connection between the two quite often poor physical health can impact the mental health of young person and vice versa agree entirely many of the young people have speak to have suffer from long term physical condition or illness that have have detrimental impact on their mental health there be evidence that the severity of mental distress have increase admission to acute medical ward for child and young people with mental health concern increase by between and the mental health report by the association of colleges publish in september find that of respondent report an increase in disclosure of mental health issue in to year old and do so for those over most college be increase their mental health resource but the need for join up and well resource service be urgent the report find that almost third of college report at least one death by suicide in the previous year it be distress to consider that such an escalation can and do happen and that be why this debate be so important despite the expansion of child and young people mental health service increase demand mean that the nhs estimate that less than half of those with such need be be support the children and young people mental health coalition find that certain group have an increase likelihood of be impact by mental health challenge such as child and young people with special educational need and disability those from racialised and background divergent young people those with physical or long term condition young carer child in care and refugee and migrant child child in kinship care arrangement also have high prevalence of social emotional and mental health need similar to those of look after child but owe to their less entitlement and lack of access to suitable support their experience and need should be consider when design vital mental health support in education setting the complexity of the issue that may impact on child mental health be the reason why mental health charity have be campaign for cross government mental health approach for such long time and hope this government will deliver on that why be education establishment so crucial to this debate the centre for mental health have publish research show that of lifetime mental health difficulty occur before the age of and that occur before the age of that be why education setting be critical in address this national crisis of course school and college be see as place where child learn academic skill but they be also safe place for some to seek support currently mental health provision in education setting in england be varied mental health support team can be find in almost of school and they have prove highly effective research publish by barnardo have demonstrate that for each invest the government have save the education and health official have speak to say that we must reach england wide coverage of mhst as soon as possible if this be do in combination with the government promise to deliver school counsellor in every school that would be powerful indicator of their commitment to tackle the crisis thank the hon member for give way on this hugely important subject as be sure be the case for other member across the house find that child mental health be one of the subject that come up most frequently on the doorstep with parent really struggle to get the mental health care that their child need one of the question that be ask most frequently be how can we afford to increase mental health care do he agree with that it be actually more cost effective to provide timely mental health support than to end up treat people when they have be sicker for long thank the hon member for his intervention would argue that we can not afford not to engage in early prevention and early intervention it do save the government money far down the line my hon friend will know that suicide be the main cause of death for young people under the age of in the uk for those under school be where they spend the majority of their life and somewhere we have an opportunity to make change will my hon friend join in pay tribute to the dads walking who have play significant role in ensure that this issue stay on the agenda and in tackle the assumption that talk about suicide make it more likely to happen thank my hon friend for that important contribution to this debate and pay tribute to the group she mention it be such critical issue to the future of our young people congratulate anyone who come into this space and make positive difference to the outcome despite the good effort of many teacher education setting be yet to have much of that dedicated support the experience of some young people and their family show that the support on offer in some school be not sufficient the mental health foundation work with whole family to support they in develop their mental health together ahead of this debate it ask two of the participant in one of its programme in london bemi and her daughter ayo to share their own experience bemi say that the government say be go to invest in child mental health but this be happen there be lot of pressure on child these day she say that it be have toll on child mental health and as parent be also feel this strain of see the constant breakdown and the failure to access support her year old daughter ayo suggest that school need to be much more proactive in ask about child mental health nobody be ask how we feel and never attempt to get to the root cause of thing they only pick up on when you be behave irrationally but never try to figure out why you feel this way school staff be often the first point of contact when pupil struggle with their mental health so they need to feel confident to support their pupil and be able to spot the sign of difficulty education support charity support the mental health and wellbeing of teaching and education staff find that of staff often help pupil with personal matter beyond their academic work educator be fill in where there be gap far highlight the need for join up and embed service totally agree with my hon friend that school and teacher be at the forefront of the mental health crisis face our child recently visit local primary school burley and woodhead church of england primary and pay tribute to the staff there for the excellent work they do to support the young people with their mental health and to make it much easy for they to talk about it do my hon friend agree that it be vital that school have adequate resource to provide such support thank my hon friend for her intervention absolutely agree it be not just young people who be struggle the additional workload of carry out wellbee check sometimes in distressing situation be take its toll on staff of all staff be stress in education setting rise to among senior leader no one can do their good at work if they be mentally deplete and healthy teacher can well provide high quality support for their pupil what else can we do we can not ignore the other factor that have significant impact on young person wellbeing which be why we need whole of government approach child and young people might be experience poor quality housing and overcrowding family member in low pay and insecure work or the inability to get gp or nhs dentist appointment when they need it all challenge that be glad this government be take action to remedy but we can go far mentally healthier nation report unanimously endorse by mental health charity call for the roll out of anti bully programme across the country crucially the evidence show that these programme work well when deliver in whole school way that is rather than take narrow approach base on discipline the student and staff body understand what constitute bully and its impact stand against it and have tactic to prevent it these programme have be test and show to be effective they create healthy school environment prevent mental health problem in the future and lead to economic gain the cost of pick up the piece of childhood bullying in later life be enormous as be the loss to the labour market it can cause as well as the toll of bully in the here and now young people can text shout crisis line for help when they be be bully those who run the service report texter struggle with suicidal thought urge to self harm insomnia and feeling of depression and anxiety some refer to the anger shame fear confusion vulnerability hopelessness and frustration that result from be bully other speak about their lack of focus and poor performance at school as result of their bullying we also need to look at innovative way that have be develop to address the threat our young people be experience in world where so call influencer like andrew tate can get their claw into our young man mind we need to look to at work such as the mental health foundation become man programme currently operate in lambeth and islington it work with young man age to who face disadvantage and inequality that put they at great risk of develop mental health problem it create safe space for young man to come together and discuss issue about their life take into account their live experience and the often difficult environment they navigate it help they to develop strength such as integrity self determination positive anger expression and respect for woman early evaluation of this work be promise and government support be need to grow the evidence base school have vital role in understand young people online experience and how they might impact their mental health the girlguide girl attitude survey find that one in eight young people age to have see sexual threat direct at woman and girl online include those of rape one in eight girl say that they have receive sexual threat online from stranger or someone they know over year after the passing of the online safety act suicide eat disorder race hate and incel forum remain easily accessible and it be not clear if and when action might be take against they give ofcom permissive approach it be likely that school staff will need to understand what sort of community pupil be involve in and the impact they be have on they at time when of boy say they have have andrew tate content show to they by friend in school the onslaught against young girl self confidence value and worth go far than be content on screen it be put they at risk how do we pull all this together preventive mental health initiative perhaps overwhelm by the complexity of the challenge be scatter and rarely appropriately fund and they often do not learn from each other sometimes we even use localism as an excuse to neither fund system nor hold they accountable we must create public mental health infrastructure the mental health foundation describe it as have clear road map lead by evidence in which every part of the system know its own responsibility for reduce mental health problem and be fund and hold accountable for its delivery that mean re examine the public health grant which despite welcome uplift this year be still well below level it mean ringfence funding for school and the nhs tie to specific outcome it also mean the roll out of england wide mental health support team and counsellor in each school the children and young people mental health coalition respond to the nhs year plan consultation call for the plan to financially support integrate care system to deliver comprehensive road map for mental health for to year old the association of colleges find that more than of college be not involve in their local suicide prevention plan and state that they do not have joint provision with their local nhs trust it be clear that to keep child well and safe our nhs service and their commission body must be fully integrate into mental health support in educational setting school college and university should be include in local mental health strategy and datum should be share freely be excite by the government pledge to roll out young futures hub which aim to bring local service together deliver support for teenager at risk of be draw into crime or face mental health challenge and where appropriate deliver universal youth provision these initiative could represent the start of such an infrastructure and an implementation plan for national network of these hub the royal college of psychiatrists state that the hub have the potential to support some of the most minoritise child who might not be able to access camhs or school base service consistently be pleased to see that the nhs remain committed to expand access to child and young people mental health service and that the operational planning guidance recognise that early intervention improve outcome for child throughout their life reduce long term pressure on health service and benefit the economy and wide society urge the government to seize this moment and see if they can create true network of mental health support across the country by get anti bully programme in place follow the evidence and commit to relentlessly drive down level of poor mental health and thereby build mentally healthy community in our school and beyond prevention early help and treatment can help young people to deliver positive outcome yes many of the measure have refer to today and

much for keep well within the time limit call the chair of the education committee congratulate my hon friend the member for redditch chris bloore on secure this important debate and on his excellent speech the starting point for think about mental health service in educational setting must be an understanding of the foundational nature of good mental health and wellbee in everything we seek to do in life challenge with mental health be corrosive in every aspect of our life depression or anxiety can ruin the happy of celebration on the sunniest of day prevent we from focus on essential task affect our relationship with friend family member and colleague and leave people feel unable even to get out of bed in the morning that be true for all of we as adult and it be equally true for child and young people good mental health and wellbeing be essential for access and get the most out of education yet our child and young people be suffer an epidemic of poor mental health and wellbeing and it be hold they back on visit to school in our constituency be sure all member will have hear headteacher senior leader and teacher in our classroom talk about the challenge the young people in their class face with their mental health that be bear out by the datum too in one in five child age eight to have probable mental health disorder such as depression or anxiety while the rate of probable mental health disorder among young people age to have increase over just five year from tenth in to more than quarter by in this context welcome the government commitment to place mental health professional in every school across the country however wish to raise some additional point that will be relevant to the effectiveness of that roll out the first be clarity on the level of qualification that the mental health professional in every school will be require to have which hope the minister can provide the second be on their remit in addition to deliver service to young people will they be expect to drive culture across the whole school that be conducive to good mental health and wellbee that as we all know will involve the buy in of the most senior school leader there be also other area outside school that be relevant to child mental health and wellbeing include the crisis in our special educational need and disability system which be have profound impact on child mental health and wellbeing my committee hear this week from child who have be hospitalise and diagnose with post traumatic stress disorder as consequence not of their additional need but of be in school that be unable to meet their need know that the minister be aware of the urgent need to reform our send system mental health professional in school will also quickly be overwhelmed if we can not get to grip with the crisis affect our child and young people as consequence of their addiction to smart phone and their access to social medium which we know be make they more anxious less able to focus more sleep deprive and more stress out welcome the measure that the minister announce in response to the bill of my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister but do believe that there be need to go far with this urgent crisis which be affect the mental health and wellbeing of our child finally wish to touch on the vital issue of camhs wait time we have gps to prescribe antibiotic so that infection do not become sepsis or blood pressure medication to prevent heart attack or stroke but when an infection have become critical illness or patient have suffer heart attack or stroke we would not think for one second that it be appropriate to send they back to their gp yet that be exactly what happen to far too many child and young people who be seriously mentally unwell it be an unacceptable situation and as well as look at mental health and wellbeing support in education setting we also need to look at how our nhs can deliver much more quickly and effectively for child whose problem be much more serious than that thank the hon member for redditch chris bloore for secure this important debate it be time to acknowledge that special educational need and mental health provision in school be one of the great crisis that we face today although do appreciate that there be lot of competition for that particular accolade financial pressure have significantly impact camhs funding in my constituency of horsham despite modest fee uplift for sussex the sector have face mandate funding reduction approximately million and that be couple with rise staff cost due to high national insurance contribution and an increase in the national living wage meanwhile demand just keep on go up since september sussex camhs have experience substantial rise in referral attribute to the pandemic and the easing of lockdown restriction this surge have adversely affect waiting time for initial assessment and treatment the crisis be even sharp at the local education authority funding level my local authority west sussex have dedicated school grant deficit schedule to go past million by april it be allow to keep this off the balance sheet for another year but there be only so long that we can maintain the fantasy that this service can be afford without major central government intervention most of all the pain be be feel at the school level and by the child and family who experience the many failing and gap in service have be contact by no few than five school in the past fortnight alone regard this issue typical of their message be this from holbrook primary school governing board school trust and local authority be overwhelm by the rise number of pupil who be seek additional support and the ever increase cost of provide assistance urgent action be require now to help solve the crisis in send so the future of our child be not blight by system that be not fit for purpose have visit many school recently note that teacher be verge on desperation note too their love for the child they be look after they desperately want to help they but they be in an impossible situation there be be afraid to say an element of physical danger in some case this be not the child fault this be our fault horsham school be ask for health service to take on more of the strain because they be at break point although mental health provision in school have clear benefit we must ensure that this provision do not fall on school budget mental health support team cover about of school in the uk and come from nhs budget not school budget that should become coverage the pressure on school to cope with more and more sen child with little or no extra funding be set to undo every gain we have make in educational standard over the past decade appreciate that the government be take at least some action to assist the situation now but urge they to use every lever at their disposal to avert this crisis before it spin entirely out of control congratulate my hon friend the member for redditch chris bloore on secure this debate and be grateful to the backbench business committee for find time for it know from experience that our mental health system be overstretch and under resource in fact there have never be so much demand for mental health support from child and young people in june the number of active camhs referral in england be record it be clear that this government inherit crisis in child and young people mental health we all want young people to be happy healthy and safe and to be equip with everything that they need to achieve and thrive as adult but with half of mental health issue develop by the time that young people reach the age of and three quarter before the age of early intervention in mental health support for child and young people be essential last year meet the parent of young woman struggle with her mental health in my constituency she be not in crisis but she do need some additional support her school encourage her parent to withdraw she because they could not provide the support which her parent do because they do not know what else to do that have leave she out of education for over month and severely in crisis do my hon friend agree that early intervention in school be crucial for break down barrier agree and have many similar case want to refer some real life example there be an excellent exhibition in the upper waiting hall this week about the mental health act which have be put together by mind it feature artwork and write piece by people who have be detain under the current act have the pleasure of meet some of they on monday include young lady call afeefa afeefa be but be first detain under the act when she be she speak powerfully and movingly about the treatment that she endure while she be under section when ask she if there be one thing that could have help she she say without hesitation that if she have receive mental health support at an early stage her experience would have be very different recall two example from my experience of work in mental health system that demonstrate the difference that early intervention and support can make they be of two young people of similar age one be teenage boy who unfortunately have not be able to access the support he need and as result be struggle to cope that be not only impact on his mental health but be have detrimental impact on his family especially his parent by contrast in the second case the parent of teenage girl who have be diagnose with mental health condition know that work in mental health at the time and come to see be able to ensure that she be refer to camhs at an early stage as result both she and her parent be do well she be due to sit her level in the summer these example underline how child who receive support quickly be less likely to develop long term condition that negatively affect their education social development and health later in life welcome the fact that my right hon friend the secretary of state for education have be clear that child wellbeing will be priority for this government research from the british association for counselling and psychotherapy indicate that child whose mental health difficulty be initially too complex for low intensity intervention but not complex enough to be refer to high intensity intervention such as camhs can easily miss out on the mental health support that they need ensure enough mental health support for child and young people in educational setting will help to free up nhs time and resource while make sure that we have healthy and productive population in the future we should also make sure that support exist in the community can the minister provide an update on the government plan for young futures hub do he agree that open access drop in hub could be an important step in provide community base mental health support for child and young people there be clear evidence that the place and circumstance in which people be bear grow study live and work have powerful influence on their mental health as have say child and young people from low income family be four time more likely to experience mental health problem than child from high income family while one in four child and young people with diagnose mental health condition live in household that have experience reduction in household income this be why want reform of the way that we deal with mental health from westminster would like great cross government work to address the social detriment of our mental health at local level believe that great co operation between school college and university along with local health provider and other in the local community can help create education setting that be effective at protect young people mental health and general wellbeing take that long term approach will help create society that prevent mental ill health for child and young people in the first place due to the number of withdrawal member may have notice that we have stop the clock time speech there be two colleague leave and will allow you to police yourself member on the front benches want to be up by pm so will let you manage the time between yourself have just go through my speech and scratch out quite lot but you will probably be pleased about that madam deputy speaker pay tribute to my hon friend the member for redditch chris bloore for his effort to secure this important debate be an mp be difficult job to define it be true that there be way to be an mp and we be all find our way but in choose such subject for his debate my hon friend show his humanity and the man that he be commend he for that with debate such as this one we can do good in this place we have profound opportunity to profile issue we and our constituent care about and amplify the voice of those in our constituency who might not otherwise get the attention they deserve we can show they that they matter and restore their trust and faith bit by bit love this job because we get to do that it be therefore an honour to speak in today debate on topic that be critical to the future of our young people mental health in education setting be an issue that affect the entire country and one that demand urgent action one in eight child and young people in the uk be live with mental health condition often leave without the support guidance and critically treatment they need to build resilience to thrive in our fast change world for year government fail our young people by not provide the certainty and the early intervention need to support they mental wellness and the knowledge that when thing go wrong there be safety net for they the issue have only worsen since the pandemic which amplify the strain on the mental health of young people and too many student we all see this across our family be still not receive the support they need it be crisis that we can not afford to ignore too many young people be not in education employment or training because they have be fail by system so woefully unsupported during time when anyone who have child or work with they know that this be crisis and have be for long time funding for mental health support team represent step forward in ensure that young people receive the help they need particularly at an early stage however we can not overlook the fact that much more still need to be do to ensure that child in town such as weston super mare worle and beyond do not fall through the crack any more welcome the government progress in short time yet the reality be that not all school be currently able to access those service and even when mhst be available the support be often not enough know that everybody across the house be impatient for those much need improvement as constituency mp we see the pain of the previous government failure on child mental health at surgery after surgery we must ensure that the team be expand across the country reach every school and every student who need help pay tribute to all the teacher support staff volunteer and family across weston worle and the village for their crucial role in support the mental health of our young people they be the one who see student day in day out and the first one to notice when something be wrong yet many teacher and teaching staff feel underprepared to deal with the mental health challenge in their classroom staff should not feel that they be manage such challenge on their own and it be vital that school be support not only with resource but with ongoing professional development to help deal with the increase prevalence of mental health challenge face by their student we must also recognise that the mental health of teaching staff be just as important teach staff work under incredible pressure and the emotional and psychological toll of support student often with their own challenge can be overwhelming if we expect teach staff to support the mental health of student we must ensure that they receive appropriate support too we can not pour from an empty cup the evidence be clear invest in mental health support in school not only help student emotionally and physically but boost academic outcome and overall school wellbeing it cascade out to family and well beyond the school gate we can not and must not fail more child and family by not take this issue seriously the young people of weston super mare like those across the uk be burst with potential but without the right support for their mental health to help they navigate the challenge and take advantage of the opportunity of our fast change society that be important we often talk down not up the nature of our fast change society that potential will not be realise and we must equip they with those tool look forward to the government continue expansion of mental health support in school and urge they to ensure that our teaching staff be give the tool and support they need to look after their own mental health so they can continue to be the positive role model and carer that our student need we trust they to look after our child every day we owe it to they to ensure that they be look after too first want to say how incredible it be that member be stand here in the houses of parliament discuss the mental health of our young people and thank my hon friend the member for redditch chris bloore for bring forward such critical debate in previous role on the health scrutiny committee for leicester leicestershire and rutland it be clear to that young people be wait too long for treatment and that be have long term detrimental impact on they that be in addition to the increase number of young people on too long camhs waiting list we also need to look at specialist service such as for those suffer with disorder eating which have double in just couple of year it be clear that we need to improve early intervention for our young people we have to ensure that young people discuss mental health not only as part of the curriculum but with their peer we also need to ensure that young people reach out for support when they need it just as importantly we need to listen to they and act when they do reach out often young people be ignore our child and young adult have experience global pandemic we can not ignore this period in their life and the impact it have have on some of they have two teenager so have see it at first hand by increase mental health support in educational setting we know that we can provide the foundation that our young people will need for their future we be discuss something that can not always be see on the surface and that be often view as off limit often think about group of young people visit in an alternative educational provision set in moira in my constituency from speak to they know how difficult and tough life have already be for they at such young age but also feel empower by they they be amazing young people they know the support they have receive when they need it have turn their life around for some school can be six hour of relentless bullying abuse or loneliness sixty per cent of our to year old tell girlguiding that they have receive negative comment about their appearance from other people some of which be in school setting nearly half of seven to year old say they feel alone some or all of the time seven to be so little too often when we have conversation about mental health support we just talk about teenager mental health support need to be available for young people of every age to help they build healthy habit to help they talk about what they need from we and to set out where they can go for support that be salient point before become an mp work with young people in youth work increasingly over the last few year mental health issue that we normally see in teenager be affect young and young child one reason be young and young child have access to social medium and not have the break we would have have as young people my hon friend point be valid will she tell more about that absolutely the sad fact be that we always talk about teenager but if we can give that resilience to child as young as seven to we might be able to prevent they from become poorly when they get old we have to start those conversation as early as possible to build resilience and confidence in our young people put mental health support in educational setting will mean not only that we can change the culture in school for child struggle with their mental health but that we will be able to see how young people can be support in the right place at the right time and in the right setting on point of order madam deputy speaker in my speech refer to west sussex county council but neglect to mention that as declare in my entry in the register of members financial interests be still member of that council want to put that on the record my apology thank the hon member for his point of order now that he have put it on the record it will be record as such we come now to the front bench contribution call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate the hon member for redditch chris bloore on secure this incredibly important debate have spend much of the past five and bit year in this place talk about child mental health which frankly do not think we can ever have enough debate about it be so incredibly important we have hear many statistic from hon member today to which will add oecd evidence base on survey of year old show that uk student have the low report wellbee in western europe in the children society find that the happiness of uk child age to be at its low since recording begin in as we have hear nhs reporting show that staggering one in five child six in every classroom on average have mental health disorder would argue that it be not an exaggeration to say that we be head towards public health emergency as far as our child mental health be concern yet as be so often the case child and mental health be both overlook and low down on the priority list the darzi report highlight that child account for of the population but only of nhs expenditure the late evidence from rethink mental illness state that people who need mental health be treatment eight time more likely to have to wait over month than those seek treatment for physical health despite that the government target to bring down nhs waiting time exclude mental health give that more than child be wait for over year to be assess for mental health treatment it be clear that child have be deprioritise but as have say repeatedly in this place put money into service that support child be the great investment we can make as country when budget be tight support for child and adolescent mental health should not be push aside do not think it an exaggeration to call the situation public health emergency in public health prevention and early intervention be absolutely key that be where the role of school college and university come in as we have hear half of lifetime mental health condition arise before the age of so ensure that mental health support be available in school from primary upwards be critical intervention the liberal democrats have long call for mental health practitioner to be place in every primary and secondary school in the light of the impact of online harm on our child mental health we have make strong case for the polluter pay principle whereby big tech giant bear the cost burden of the measure trebling of the digital service tax would fund practitioner in every primary and secondary school be slightly confused because as the minister say during the children wellbeing and schools bill committee and as have see in labour party material the government be commit to introduce specialist mental health support for child and young people in every school however labour have previously commit to have counsellor in every secondary school and indeed the hon member for redditch talk about have counsellor in every school hope that the minister will clarify that point of policy when he speak in moment my impression during the bill committee be that the government intend to build out from the mental health support team that be establish by the previous government the minister confirm in committee that only of child and young people have access to such team which will rise to in april but he do not set out timeline or plan for how or when the government will meet their commitment by ensure that every school have access to specialist support mhst be brilliant have speak to staff who work in those team both in my own constituency and in carshalton with my hon friend the member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean however the reality be that mhst be spread far too thinly across number of primary and secondary school with some school only get half day or day of support that be not enough last year one teenager in secondary school in my constituency take their own life another school in my constituency have three teenager end up in in the space of about two month have attempt to take their own life clearly that level of mental ill health require much more acute intervention than therapy in school but the reality be that if we start early if we start young with proper support some of these truly awful incident might be prevent the mhst model may well be the good model for support in school but urge the government to be ambitious in the resourcing of those team so that every school have the full time equivalent of one person in the provision of this support know that many school be try to top up the resource out of their own fund but with budget be stretch ever far sadly mental health support be one of the area that headteacher and governor tell they be have to start cut back on we know that the epidemic of mental ill health be drive the crisis of persistent absence in our school as the hon member for weston super mare dan aldridge say we have hear lot in recent day about the million or so young adult who be not in education employment or training often because of mental ill health for the sake of those young people future our economy and our society we must do well and we must do more do not have time today to talk about school staff which be mention by the hon member for weston super mare but we have recruitment and retention crisis in our school and that be because many teacher see themselves as the fourth emergency service we have to support they with their mental health if we want to stop that flow out of our school in high education hope the government will look at introduce duty of care because we have hear too many tragic story of student take their own life and their loved one know nothing about their mental health problem pay tribute to the charity around the country that be plug the gap in mental health support in my constituency we have amazing charity such as the purple elephant project and off the record work with child and their family anstee bridge work across richmond and kingston with child who be no long engage with school as say there have be number of attempt suicide case in my constituency and when have be to anstee bridge have hear many more story of child attempt to take their own life these service be critical if we want to keep those child and young people safe and help they to recover want to touch on two more point childhood bereavement be really important and often overlook issue pay tribute to my hon friend the member for edinburgh west christine jardine who have long champion the need for register of child who have be bereave we know that childhood bereavement have terrible impact on child wellbee potentially their mental health and their educational outcome hope ministers will look seriously at introduce register so that we know how many of these child there be where they be and what support they need because that information be not available at the moment additionally there be no national mandate from the department for education for school to have bereavement policy nor be there any national policy to support school with this hope that will be address the hon member for redditch mention child grow up in kinship care the minister will know that have long be campaign cross party on support for kinship carer and child grow up in kinship care like other member my inbox have be fill recently with email from constituent who have either adopt child or be kinship carer for child whose parent can no long look after they and have benefit from the adoption and special guardianship support fund it be critical fund that carer often access to provide therapeutic support for child who have experience terrible trauma loss and instability however there have be no reassurance from government about the future of that fund think at the moment we only have funding confirm until the end of this month there be huge amount of uncertainty and hon member from across the house have table write question but there have be no clear answer on the future of this fund hope that when the minister rise at the dispatch box he will put on record the plan for the adoption and special guardianship support fund as it be crucial and we can not lose it our child can not thrive and can not achieve their full potential if they be not happy and if they be not well so implore the minister to work closely with his counterpart in the department of health and social care to treat this public health challenge as an emergency our child and young people be only young once they deserve the good future they can get they can not afford to wait we need to prioritise this call the shadow minister congratulate the hon member for redditch chris bloore on secure this important debate in the chamber should also declare an interest be consultant paediatrician and have work throughout my career with child usually at the point of severe crisis when they have be admit through to hospital follow episode of deliberate self harm such as cut themselves or take overdose and have clearly see the heartbreak for family as they have struggle to understand what they can do to well help their young person get well over recent year there have be decline in the mental health and wellbeing of child and young people and an increase demand for mental health service this be perhaps one of the big challenge of our era currently around one fifth of child age eight to be say to have probable mental health disorder up from in this figure be even high at for people age to the consequence of mental health issue for student range from poor academic performance and drop out of university or college to self harm and suicide and we must do all we can to help want briefly to talk about university student because university be suppose to be one of the most enjoyable and formative period of person life but for many it be also when they leave home for the first time and when they be separate for the first time from their family and friend and their support network datum from the office for national statistics show that during the pandemic student report high level of anxiety and low level of happiness than the general population the number of student say they have mental health condition have increase sevenfold in the last decade even before the pandemic student consistently report bad mental health than the rest of the adult population but these trend be greatly exacerbate by the impact of lockdown will the minister update the house on what step he be take to support young people with mental health problem as they go to university or who develop mental health problem at university despite the unprecedented challenge the previous government face not least the pandemic we make important stride in improve mental health service in increase the recognition and discussion of mental health problem in increase investment and in reduce stigma between and spend on mental health service increase by billion which give an additional young people access to the mental health support they need and the number of mental health nurse increase by since yet still we see that demand be outstrip supply prevention be well than cure and we need to understand why we have such high level of mental health problem in child can the minister update the house on how the government be work to identify risk factor for poor mental health and how they will support child and family to prevent it the last government try to detect mental health problem early and stop they escalate expand mental health support team in school commit almost million of funding for early support hub in these offer early open access mental health intervention without the need for referral by doctor or school the drop in centre offer vital advice to young people go through the trauma of stress and anxiety give they space to go to when their problem first emerge can the minister update we on what the government be do in term of expand the availability of these centre the online safety act make very good progress in protect child from harmful online content but there be much more to do on the topic of screen time as have be mention by hon member this afternoon do the minister agree that the mount evidence we be hear especially from health professional about the impact of smartphone in particular on child mental health be very concerning if so will he support the conservative amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill to ban smartphone use in school however there have be some concern that in the desire to support and enable individual to have positive mental wellbeing there be danger that the pendulum have swing little far and the boundary between distress and disorder have become blur that mean that there be risk that those who be most unwell may miss out on the treatment they deserve and need because of the volume of referral as well as risk of burden other with unhelpful label and prescription that could hold they back without address the root cause of their very real need some of gps be now say to believe that society approach to mental health have lead to medicalise the normal up and down of life the term wellbee mental health and mental illness be often use interchangeably so what step be the minister take to distinguish between those term in educational context and to deliver public service to ensure that we can get the good outcome for those affect so people get the treatment they clinically require pay tribute to the work that many charity do to support our young people with mental health problem will the minister talk to the chancellor about fund for those service dr sarah hughes the chief executive of mind say that the implication of the nic rise be eye watering at time when we be try to direct every penny towards deliver the good support such charity do immense work to create mentally healthy society put everything they have into it and the government should recognise that huge investment not destabilise it by introduce mount cost that charity simply can not subsidise it be important to recognise the connection between physical and mental health and that those with long term physical condition be considerably more likely to have poor mental health what be the government do to support child who have chronic illness to help improve their mental health in the now education secretary say that labour want train mental health counsellor available in every secondary school what step have the government take towards achieve that aim more specifically why have they focus on secondary school in april dr patrick roach the general secretary of nasuwt say we also need to see improved support for pupil in primary school to secure wraparound care for pupil at all stage of their education what be the government do to support child in primary school with their mental health ahead of the last general election the labour party promise to establish young futures hub recruit mental health staff and provide mental health support in school why have so little progress be make on deliver those promise when the minister stand on manifesto to establish the young futures hub which be say to have cost of million and to provide mental health support in all school at cost of million the government say that they would fund that through revenue raise from apply vat and business rate to private school will the minister confirm whether the revenue obtain from apply the vat to private school look like it will be sufficient to expand the mental health support as describe if not how do the government intend to fund the measure they say they would implement in speech to the confederation of school trusts on november last year the education secretary claim that the government would give every single child the very good life chance in new era of child centre government how do she justify the impact on the wellbeing of those child who be force to move school due to the imposition of vat on the private sector numerous think tank and mental health charity have note that be force to move school at non standard time can have significant and long last impact on child friendship support network and emotional development what support be the minister offer to those child mental health issue among our young people be one of the define issue of our time as with so many other policy area the government have promise panacea but so far they have deliver sticking plaster call the minister be grateful to my hon friend the member for redditch chris bloore for secure debate on such an important subject which rightly invite considerable cross party support we know that one third of adult mental ill health originate before age and six in of those that suffer from mental ill health have their first onset by age mean that childhood and early adulthood be critical period for early intervention and prevention that be why this government have set bold new ambition to raise the healthy generation of child in our history which of course include their mental health and wellbeing we have see increase in mental health issue in child nhs survey suggest that around of to year old have probable mental health disorder in up from in the wellbeing and life satisfaction of child and young people also show cause for concern long term reduction in the wellbeing of child and young people be common trend across country and we have to acknowledge that england and the uk report among the low level of average life satisfaction among participate country there be no one simple reason for that and rise mental health challenge be an international phenomenon the ongoing impact of bring about by school closure and reduce opportunity for social and emotional development be factor as be change in health behaviour such as low physical activity increase eat and sleep problem and increase screen time and social medium use point make by number of member this afternoon there be also wide range of contribute societal factor and ongoing national and global issue such as the economic outlook international conflict and climate change the relative influence of those different driver be complex and take together they show the scale of the challenge that we face among child and young people who suffer the most acute mental health challenge be look after child and young people all of whom will have experience some kind of adverse childhood experience or trauma result in their be take into the care system my committee hear evidence couple of week ago from child and young people who talk about the lack of adequate assessment of their mental health when they be take into care and when they move placement they call for strengthening of the regulation around that so that their mental health and wellbeing be properly take into account have table an amendment to the children wellbeing and schools bill which we will discuss early next week will the minister give commitment to look at that and see whether we can make the support well for child who be look after know that my hon friend be real champion of look after child we will certainly look at those proposal and at all the work the education committee do to support

be the contribution of muslims to community so look forward to hear it ramadan or ah as many muslims know it be the first be observe since be elect to this place as the member of parliament for glasgow south west as the only ethnic minority and muslim mp represent scottish westminster constituency feel sense of unique responsibility to espouse the positive role that muslims play in our country which should but often do not feel natural and easy to celebrate vocally accord to the census over muslims live in scotland and be proud that of they almost one in six live in my constituency of glasgow south west it be vibrant and diverse community of people of all colour and ethnic background who find way to be multicultural but who still tend to coalesce seamlessly around our scottish and british identity perhaps we have much to teach the rest of britain and would welcome visit from the minister or one of his team whenever they have time across the uk there be million muslims represent of the total population their contribution be vast particularly in the month of ramadan when many will redouble and amplify their effort in their community and charity work british muslims

active in my constituency include islamic relief which diligently work not only on international cause but increasingly on local cause business own by muslims contribute billion year to the british economy notwithstanding the fact that the uk be world leader in islamic finance hold of the european islamic finance banking sector as with every community there be challenge around inequality but vast stride have be make in education and in the participation of muslim woman in society there have be notable increase in educational attainment with of muslims hold degree level qualification in compare with only in that be largely drive by muslim woman come into high education something that we can wholeheartedly welcome the story of muslims be intricately weave into our society and be worthy of celebration it be apparent in every walk of life but perhaps most prominently in our nhs where work as full time surgeon prior to my election to this place that footprint be most palpable during the covid pandemic when many serve on the frontline despite know that they be at disproportionately high risk of harm many make the ultimate sacrifice with muslim doctor alfa amged el hawrani adil el tayar and habib zaidi who have ancestry in africa pakistan and the middle east die of covid in the course of their clinical duty unlike this ramadan when mosque at night be resplendent with light and beautiful recitation of the quran in they go dark and fall silent with many take the decision to close their door to worshipper to stop the virus and protect everyone in their community long before the government tell they to do so many such as the glasgow central mosque which be stone throw from my constituency boundary transform into testing and vaccination hub undoubtedly save thousand of life that should not be surprise because despite recent rhetoric it be important to place on record that the footprint of muslims on the british isles and in serve british interest have be long endure and at time existential for our country be very grateful to my hon friend who be my office neighbour for allow to move we down from scotland to staffordshire in the heart of the country

the first ever female muslim minister serve in government and of course as the first ever muslim deputy speaker despite the contribution have describe with that share history and those share value it be unfortunately tumultuous time for many british muslims over anti muslim hate incident have be report in the last year see sense of this increase in my own social medium timeline with an increase diatribe of hatred direct at not so much because of the colour of my skin any more as it be when be young but because of my religion despite my be bear here and serve in the nhs here many question my

diverse community from different part of the world and particularly of those in the muslim community with how they engage themselves in business charity and social life show that up to be the lie that it be wholeheartedly agree and thank my hon friend for his intervention in fact the thrust of the conclusion of my speech will be how important social cohesion be we must keep that at the forefront of our mind the rhetoric we see online have the ability surreptitiously to desensitise all of we and that desensitisation be find its way to place such at the dinner table where it be become an increasingly acceptable form of conversation to indulge in anti muslim rhetoric as it do so at those dinner table at muslim dinner table across the country people be question their place in this society this trend should worry we all because it undermine the fabric of our society our cohesion and our identity as country we know from other form of hatred that what start with antisemitism or anti muslim hatred rarely stop there commend my hon friend for his contribution to this house and echo the comment about how great it be that we have you in the chair madam deputy speaker for this

heritage elect mayor of london sadiq khan it be testament to he that he have be fight against this hatred and show that london can stand as beacon of hope against it it be really important that we be here today to celebrate the achievement of muslim resident around our country and there be many amazing organisation in my constituency of stratford and bow such as the minhaj welfare foundation soul sisters and the british bangla welfare trust would my hon friend join in thank they for their contribution to stratford and bow and in wish they peaceful and bless ramadan thank my hon friend well respect politician who represent all her constituent well and will definitely join she in congratulate those organisation particularly the minhaj welfare foundation which also operate in my constituency as be say this trend should worry we all because of its undermine nature we know that that kind of hatred which begin as anti muslim rhetoric do not stop with muslims it have common denominator to divide and to fragment the bond that have be forge over year and indeed be lightning rod to violence and civil disorder this come saturday be reminder of where that hatred lead if leave unchecked it will be the sixth anniversary of the christchurch mosque shooting in new zealand on march innocent life be tragically take in that act of hatred the young be just three year old that sicken attack on those attend friday prayer be dark day but in that darkness come the light of the response by the now former new zealand labour prime minister jacinda ardern she envelop the muslim community in empathy inclusiveness and acceptance in way that muslims live in the west have rarely experience and in way that will never be forget remember the follow day come out of the operate theatre and be drive to tear by her compassion she validate my existence as muslim in the west in way that no one in this country could have manage at the time and for that muslims far and wide will hold she in special place in their heart but we must not mistake compassion for weakness in compassion there be often strength and perhaps an even clear vision of the future and bravery to confront difficult issue and have the difficult conversation across community but most importantly within we see that sense of compassion and bravery in our country last summer in our prime minister who act so decisively during the riot to protect mosque to protect those at risk of violent attack and to mobilise the state quickly and effectively against anarchy he attend the big iftar at westminster hall the first time it have ever be hold there and tonight he be host an iftar at downing street too commend my hon friend for secure this debate it be fantastic it would be remiss of come from small town in the west country not to talk about the muslim population in my town in the context of what happen in the summer be really proud to be able to stand with the muslim community in weston super mare and also to see how the civic pride and civic duty of that community be not diminish by the hostility that they face really want to pay tribute to the ahmed family and aishah in particular year old she have have aishah food charity for year feed the people of weston super mare and supplement the assistance that be provide in the context of the issue that we have with destitution the family be amazing and huge asset to the town thank my hon friend for his warm word join he in commend the ahmed family for all that they be do to cement the bond of community cohesion in his constituency the prime minister action be clear indication that this labour government under this prime minister value and share bread with all community and be friend of the muslim community thank my right hon friend the member for ilford north wes streeting for his tireless effort over the last decade in tackle anti muslim hatred he also be true friend of muslims across this country when hatred take root in our society it diminish we all that be why be glad that the deputy prime minister be also take action perhaps the minister might be kind enough to outline some of the detail of the new group set up by his department to tackle anti muslim hatred in this country once and for all lead by dominic grieve kc which be welcome the minister will know that this not just an issue for muslims it speak to the wide issue of social cohesion the khan review of social cohesion in march argue that social cohesion be not just about protect the democratic norm of our country it have wide reach benefit for society as whole from help achieve sustainable economic growth to reduce the threat of terrorism and hate crime increase societal resilience to shock such as pandemic improve public health increase volunteering and strengthen community social cohesion and wide range of adjacent policy area area that know this government take seriously believe recent event around the world demonstrate that we be at an inflection point in our country we can roll over to the easy answer to the scapegoate community or conversely avoid as have be do in the past the difficult conversation that sometimes need to be have within community neither of those attitude serve any of we well we should call out hatred when we see it online at dinner table in change room in public space but in pluralistic british society we should also be able to issue challenge to community when we see failing be proud to be an mp on the labour benches because believe it be only this government who can achieve that many community with their own separate tradition but still able to coalesce naturally into one british identity thank my hon friend the member for glasgow south west dr ahmed for secure this debate during such an important time for muslim community what pleasure it be to follow speech that be thoughtful and reflective but also challenge to we all in this place and in particular to we as govt look forward to feed back on some of the point he raise and will of course take he up on his invitation to visit never miss chance to go to glasgow this debate be perfectly time it be only right that we honour and celebrate the contribution of british muslim community during the month of ramadan time of reflection devotion and community we have have little tour in this debate we start in glasgow but we have also be to newcastle under lyme weston super mare and the east of london and now be add little bit of nottingham for muslims across the uk and around the world ramadan will be sacred period of fasting prayer and charity it be also time that bring people together strengthen bond between neighbour colleague and friend of all faith and belief and of none here in the uk we see the vibrancy of ramadan reflect in our public life in this debate today the ramadan light on oxford street the historic iftar recently host at windsor castle and the many gathering take place across the country they show how deeply embed and richly value these tradition be within our national culture think of my own in nottingham think of the al khazra mosque and how it throw its door open during ramadan because it be good time for people be curious perhaps about what they be read and see to come and understand islam of course food be always great draw there because it be fantastic also think of the work that mufti ahmed peerbhai do to get people in include myself to learn about islam and to talk and to educate which be very very important work minister across the government be honour to be join iftars throughout this month celebrate the richness of our community and the value of compassion and generosity that ramadan embody and as my hon friend mention the prime minister be host an iftar at downing street tonight it be also particularly fitting to have this debate during muslim heritage month this be great moment to reflect on the immense contribution muslims have make to britain past and present islam and muslims have be part of britain for century from the early and the small community of muslim sailor and trader from assam bengal gujarat and yemen outside the port community of east london we have hear from colleague from east london south shields and liverpool and the community in woking surrey muslim population remain small indeed it be surprising to hear that the first mosque in london do not open until as my hon friend note in his own powerful personal story it be only after the second world war when many former soldier answer the call to help rebuild the nation that our muslim population grow substantially from the soldier who fight alongside british force in both world war to the innovator shape our future today the legacy of british muslims be one of resilience dedication and excellence be furious that my hon friend have beat to the opportunity to embarrass you madam deputy speaker be sure you do not want we to highlight your own personal achievement but they be very important hon member hear hear you be of course the first female muslim minister to stand at this very dispatch box and you be now the first muslim person to sit in that chair as deputy speaker think of the people who watch these debate and the importance they will place on that certainly we think of the young girl and boy who will see you and see your example and know that if you can do it perhaps they can do it too to those who be watch say you can you must and you should there be lot of very good example in parliament of people who look and sound like you who have do so much for our country and our democracy we want to recognise that history the government be commit to do so which be why we support the creation of muslim war memorial it will stand as lasting tribute to the courage and sacrifice of muslims who serve britain in time of conflict ensure that their contribution too often forget be finally give the recognition they deserve we intend for the memorial to include an educational element to ensure that people of all background and age be able to learn about and understand the sacrifice make by muslims in the british armed force during the two world war and beyond turn to the theme of the debate my hon friend the member for glasgow south west clearly set out the contribution that muslims make to the uk but will add little bit myself too whether in business the art science or healthcare british muslims be at the forefront of progress and innovation their contribution to the economy be substantial with muslim lead business generate billion of pound and create thousand of job recent report by the equi think tank estimate that british muslims generate billion year for the uk economy through income business and charitable giving think of himmah charity in nottingham that be recently award the king award with its food bank and what it do for my community to ensure that people where we live do not go hungry be look forward if that be the right word to run the london marathon next month to raise fund for himmah really really wish have start training currently do own pair of trainer which believe be an impediment to the exercise that same equi report note the huge contribution that muslims make to our public service include education social care and emergency response fill more than role across our nhs deliver essential care to our sick and elderly of course my hon friend be shin example of that surgeon who have make such difference to so many people at the most challenging moment we be very lucky to have have he serve in our nhs and we be very lucky to have he serve in our legislature too wish the minister all the good for run the london marathon my father do it five time in the so be happy to get some tip for he after the debate as he talk about the contribution make by the muslim community up and down our country would he join in express note of disappointment that there be not single member from any opposition party on their bench this afternoon we be mean to be one united kingdom speak for all community and it be real disappointment that nobody else be present to listen be grateful to my hon friend for the kind offer of support have to say be not generally one for police colleague diary but hope that during this period colleague from all political party and none be able to use their platform positively to promote the important work of britain muslim community and to fight the rise of islamophobia which will turn to shortly before do want to reflect on two thing that my hon friend the member for glasgow south west mention first london be the west islamic finance capital with uk base islamic bank control asset worth nearly billion which be of the total asset in europe what great success story that be for our country secondly want to mention the practice of zakat and the extraordinary charitable giving of british muslims who donate million every year to support those in need both at home and abroad as my hon friend have say british muslims give four time more to charity than the average uk adult donate more than year during ramadan alone we can expect contribution to exceed million what lifeline that be for those who receive that funding civil society also benefit immensely from the leadership and activism of muslim community think of the muslim councillor on my local authority as well as colleague in this place it go much deep too with remarkable contribution to volunteerism and social welfare whether it be support food bank as mention support homeless shelter mentor young people or engage in community outreach their service embody the value of generosity and civic duty that strengthen our society and foster social cohesion in nice intersection between faith and our national value think we would like to think that those be british value too none the less as my hon friend have say we know that despite invaluable contribution muslim community continue to face discrimination and prejudice within our society anti muslim hatred remain real and persistent issue affect the life of many my hon friend talk about online hatred and also about creep normalisation and we should stand against that and we as government most certainly do so it be impossible not to go back certainly with the sixth anniversary of the horrific christchurch terror attack be on saturday that be stark reminder of how online hatred can fuel real world violence remember be at al khazra mosque in the day follow the attack talk to muslim constituent and indeed to those who like come in solidarity they tell about their fear and how they feel when face with the reality that that could have be they at friday prayer we also talk about the thing that we have to do to stand against such terror and to make sure that they be safe in our city we have recently establish new work group to define and tackle anti muslim hatred and islamophobia hope that this initiative reflect our unwavering commitment to ensure that all community in the uk can live free from discrimination and fear my hon friend ask for little more detail on this as he say the group be be chair by dominic grieve kc once of this place which be really positive the group will advise government on how good to understand quantify and define prejudice discrimination and hate crime target at muslims the context behind the establishment of this group be the fact that hate crime be at record high in england and wales which be why we think that this be an issue that require urgent attention the work of the group will be measure in month rather than year we want its member to come back to we as swiftly as possible to help shape our government response to make sure that we be truly stand up against the rise of this hatred be sorry to interrupt the minister again he talk about the work of the group take month which be the correct approach as we want to make sure that this be do properly will he explain how member of this house can feed into the process so that we can be sure that the experience that our constituent raise with we be also raise with the group that be an excellent question will make sure that colleague through the minister for faith lord khan be able to have that opportunity we be very good conduit of information and insight because we see this every day in our constituency and by definition we cover the entire community that be an excellent idea which shall make sure come to fruition in conclusion ramadan remind we of our share value kindness unity and commitment to justice during this important time for british muslim community the government reaffirm their dedication to build society where everyone regardless of background or belief be value and respect hope that all those observe this debate have see the strength of feeling across the house say to they ramadan mubarak may this month bring they peace strength and countless blessing question put and agree to house adjourn
