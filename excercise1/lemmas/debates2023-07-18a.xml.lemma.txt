with permission would like to make statement on the publication of our refresh defence command paper it be just over two year since we publish the original command paper in march in those two year our security have be challenge in so many way this be defence response to more contested and volatile world in the last four year that have be defence secretary have be consistent about the reform have seek to implement want defence to be threat lead understanding and act on the threat face our nation as our sole mission not protect force structure cap badge or much love equipment but ensure that we be focused on challenging threat want the ministry of defence to be campaigning department adopt more proactive posture and our force more forward and present in the world with return to campaign assertively and constantly push back those threat and our adversary want defence to be sustainable in every sense for too long defence be hollow out by both labour and conservative governments leave our force overstretch and underequipped we must match our ambition to our resource our equipment plan to our budget and take care of our people to sustain they in their duty we must never forget the travesty of the snatch land rovers in afghanistan the defence command paper be true to those principle and with some tough choice present an honest plan for what we can and will achieve credible force capable of protect the nation ready to meet the threat of today but invest heavily to modernise for those of the future force in which every major platform would be renew by from armoured vehicle to dreadnought submarine frigate to satellite we do not plan on issue new command paper just two year on many of the conclusion of that command paper remain right russia be and be the great threat to european security and china rapid military modernisation and grow assertiveness in the indo pacific and beyond do pose an increase challenge to we all however have always say that as the situation change we must change with it since the first dcp be release the world have shift once more from competitive age to contested and volatile world the technology advance we predict materialise the threat and challenge we fear have manifest there be no more immediate threat than russia its full scale invasion of ukraine be not simply an assault on proud and sovereign nation but an attack on all our value european security and the open international order on which stability and prosperity have depend for over three quarter of century right now the people of ukraine be suffer the tragic consequence of president putin illegal unprovoked invasion his naked aggression and imperial ambition have play out in tragedy of epic human suffering the brave citizen soldier of the armed force of ukraine be protect their own nation and people quite heroically take on the once mighty russian force the whole house recognise that they fight not just for their freedom but for our they be not just liberate their homeland but defend the rule base system as defence secretary it be important to import the lesson learn from the conflict to our own force while wish such lesson be generate in different war the conflict have become an incubator of new way of war they be prove the way for warfare in the whole of nation internationally partner innovative digitise operate with tempo precision and range requirement and recognition that there be trade off between assurance level and operational impact be proud too of the role the uk be play in support ukraine whether provide equipment training or political support or galvanise european and international ally and industrial partner to do likewise but the return of war to the continent of europe alongside grow threat elsewhere in the world have mean that we must sharpen our approach the integrated review refresh publish in march outline how we would do that it would shape the global strategic environment increase our focus on deterrence and defence address vulnerability that leave our nation expose and invest in the uk unique strength defence be central to all those effort that be why after three decade in which all party have continue draw the post cold war peace dividend this prime minister reverse that trend and provide defence with an additional billion over four year he and the chancellor have go far since in response to the war in ukraine next year we will spend over billion on defence for the first time in our history that be nearly billion year more cash investment than when become defence secretary in real term increase of more than this government have commit to increase spending yet far over the long term to of gdp as we improve the fiscal position and grow our economy our defence plan and the armed force to deliver they must be robust and credible not fantasy force design unfunded gimmick or top trump number as russia have so effectively prove there be no point have parade ground army and massed rank of man and machine if they can not be integrate as single full spectrum force sustain in the field under all the demand of modern warfighting that take professional force well equipped and rapidly adaptable support by critical enabler and vast stockpile of munition that be why in this document hon member will not find shiny new announcement comms lead policy drive unsustainable force design or any major new platform for military enthusiast to put up on their chart on their bedroom wall we stand by the command paper we publish in but we must get there fast do defence differently and get ourselves on to campaign foot to protect the nation and help it prosper as say stand here when be announce we owe it to the man and woman of our armed force to make policy reality the work be just begin in this refresh we have focus on how to drive the lesson of ukraine into our core business and on how to recover the warfighting resilience need to generate credible conventional deterrence the great advantage of have serve in defence for some time be that my ministerial team and have now take proper look under the bonnet consequently we be clear that our strategic advantage derive from four key source which require urgent prioritisation first and foremost be our first class people our man and woman be not just brave and committed but talented and incredibly skilled they be our real battle win capability it be our duty to ensure they be as well support prepared and equip as possible so we be go to invest in they last year commission richard haythornthwaite to conduct the first review of workforce incentivisation for almost year it be such good work that we be incorporate the response into our command paper and today be unveil new employment model and skill framework for our armed force it will offer our people spectrum of service that allow far great career flexibility make it easy for military personnel to zig zag between different role whether regular or reserve or between the civil service and industry we be transform our force overall employment offer by adopt total reward approach to provide much more compelling and competitive incentivisation package since all our armed force personnel deserve the good quality accommodation we be inject furth million to improve our service accommodation in the next two year many of we over christmas will have be frustrate by the poor support our service personnel and their family receive from those task with look after their accommodation it be for that reason that have withhold their profit and use the money to freeze for one year only the rent increase our personnel be due to pay take together alongside such initiative as wraparound childcare they be intend to enrich career and enhance the ability of our most talented people to keep protect the british people and to ensure they be reward and fulfil while they do so our second priority be far strengthen our scientific and technological base we be already world leader in specific area but to continue outmatch our adversary we must stay ahead of the curve in digital datum and emerge scientific field in we say we would invest billion in advanced research and development in fact we be now invest significantly more to stay ahead in the technology prove themselves vital on the battlefield of ukraine such as ai quantum and robotic we be enable culture of innovation across defence pull through those breakthrough to the frontline follow in ukraine footstep we be increasingly source the solution that can stop million threat in their track win both the kinetic and economic exchange of modern warfare of course our ability to do that depend on the quality of our relationship with the industry which be our third priority be push the ministry of defence to form close alliance with our industrial partner genuine partnership to sustain our defence will mean do thing differently ukraine remind we that time wait for no one it be no good hold out for the solution that be obsolete by the time it be launch often be good enough especially if it mean swiftly put kit into the hand of our service personnel capability can be rapidly upgrade spirally develop for the relentless cycle of battlefield adaptation to win the innovation battle instead of stick to acquisition programme that drag on for decade we be set maximum delivery period of five year for hardware and three year for digital programme our fourth priority be productivity and campaigning to face this increasingly contested and volatile world we need to make major change to the machinery of the department and its method we be emphasise an ethos focus ruthlessly on the delivery of real world effect increase the bang for buck in everything we do this approach reach into every part of the defence enterprise from the front line to the back office and involve major redesign of the department we must shift our whole organisational culture away from the previous peacetime mentality to one where we live and operate as we would fight focus more on output than input and achieve well balance between risk and reward that mean empower people to live and operate alongside partner and sometimes to be enable by they when in low threat environment that mean ensure our equipment whether type challenger or typhoons have the infrastructure and supply need to sustain operation more of the time and to deliver real world effect wherever and whenever it be need and it mean work with the relevant regulatory authority for example the military aviation authority to accelerate the experimentation testing and innovating of new technology while remain within legal bound want to emphasise one final aspect of the command paper refresh namely the development of global campaigning approach we start with review of our head office where we break out campaign delivery from policy formation and establish integrated campaign team they have adversary focus not geographic and will drive our endure campaign in the same way operational commander lead our force on deploy operation the indivisibility of operational theatre in today world mean defence must be constantly ready to respond globally to safeguard our interest and those of our ally sometimes it will be to evacuate our citizen in moment of crisis such as in sudan other time it will be to deter an adversary or reassure friend as we have show through our support for ukraine the uk government have the political will but that only matter if it be match by our military agility today we be establish defence global response force ready integrated and lethal it will well cohere exist force from across land sea air space and cyber to get there first in response to unpredictable event around the world crucially today paper also recognise that it be in the interconnected world and that the uk be unlikely to act alone partnership be critical to our security and prosperity in future we will be ally by design and national by exception our support for nato will remain iron clothe but we will continue to prioritise our core relationship we will invest in deepen relationship with our new partner it be why we have invest to expand our global defence network improve communication and co ordinating defence attachés within our intelligence function none of that be headline grab stuff but it be the fine detail that make the difference to our national security to conclude the paper be the result of have several year in the department to understand where it need most attention that continuity in office be improve and be incredibly grateful to the long serve minister for armed forces my right hon friend the member for wells james heappey whose experience in uniform and public office provide the basis for this paper we be grateful to the hundred of individual and group who contribute to the first challenge phase of its drafting from academic to serve personnel and industry representative not to mention the many member of this house most of what we learn from they be encapsulate in the document this be likely to be one of my last appearance at the dispatch box it have be the great privilege to serve as secretary of state for defence for the last four year thank my team civil servant special adviser and members for their support and their challenge all of we here have the common interest of defend this fine country its value and its freedom of all the many function of government defence be the most important and be more important than ever as the next year will be more unstable and insecure the man and woman of our armed force be second to none and britain place in the world be anchor in their professionalism and sacrifice believe we will increasingly call on they in the year ahead we must ensure that they be ready to answer that call wish they and whomever replace well commend the statement to the house bim afolami adam afriyie peter aldous lucy allan stuart anderson
