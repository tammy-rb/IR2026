vocational education and training opportunity in my constituency be harrogate college which be previously promise more than million in combination of loan and grant under the fe capital transformation

child deserve the opportunity to achieve and to thrive but currently far from every child have that chance we have announce that high need funding will increase by almost billion in compare with we will work with the sector to strengthen accountability improve inclusivity through ofsted support professional to increase send expertise and encourage school to set up resource provision or special educational need unit in mainstream school my constituent suzie wait for an education health and care plan for her son harrison for week by law they have to be provide within week so conservative run kent county council take more than twice the amount of time that it should have do when it come it be full of mistake and harrison be now in the wrong school his class size be too big and he do not have the specialist support he require previously kent county council be put in special measure to sort out the problem with ehcp provision would the secretary of state support kcc go back into special measure so that student like harrison get the support that they deserve be sorry to hear about the challenge face by the hon gentleman constituent local authority have be impact by the increase demand for education health and care plan and by workforce capacity issue so more efficient and effective service delivery and communication with school and family be central to turn that around we will work as quickly as possible to ensure more effective response and early identification for child and will take away the particular example he raise devon county council be spend million on private provision for special educational need and disability without enough quality control by the county council state school in mid and east devon want to be able to help provide more send specialist and teaching assistant but ehcp be prescribe one to one care with just which be hardly enough for one to one provision will the government consider set up more send resource basis in devon the hon gentleman raise an important point it be vital for turn around the current situation face by far too many part of the country there be not sufficient mainstream inclusion for child with special educational need there be not enough specialist unit as part of mainstream school inclusion and we do not have the specialist place need so will of course take away the hon gentleman specific example in west sussex ehcp request be run at over per month will the secretary of state send reform include measure that could make it hard to get an ehcp potentially make it hard for child to qualify for special school place the hon lady raise an important point suspect it be on the back of year of let down child who need the education that be clearly want in so many part of the country that explain the number of member raise these issue today she would do well to reflect on the record of the past year we be change the situation as fast as we can but it will take time the previous conservative government leave send family in stratford on avon to fend for themselves want not just additional send place but continue support for child already attend specialist provision far we need proper investment in home to school transport child be leave without transport at the beginning of the academic year deprive they of access to their education what be the government do to ensure not just that budget reflect need but that they do so to address the problem immediately recognise the long list of challenge the hon lady set out which she know her constituent be face child with special educational need and disability be be fail with poor outcome and parent be struggle to get their child the support they need and deserve this government ambition be for all child and young people with special educational need or in alternative provision to get the right support to achieve and succeed in their education and as they move into adult life we be move as fast as we can it be key part of our opportunity mission and we will continue to do so call the chair of the education committee the additional billion in the budget for send support be very welcome but the minister will know that local authority remain anxious about the forthcoming end to the statutory override of dedicated school grant deficit in march what discussion be the minister have with the treasury and the ministry of housing communities and local government on plan to prevent the end of the statutory override from become cliff edge financial calamity for local authority and child with send as my hon friend mention high need funding will increase by almost billion in compare with bring total high need funding to billion that funding will help local authority and school with the increase cost of support child and young people with send we will continue to support local authority to meet those demand and reform our system so we can create inclusive education for every child want to raise the issue of governance there be too many mind control the system which ultimately stymie local authority ability to reform service in order to embed culture of nurture and to ensure that the good interest of child be represent while review the send system will the minister take look at governance and ensure that be there be one control mind and it be that of the local authority my hon friend will be aware of our plan to ensure that all school co operate within their local facility with their local authority when it come to place planning and admission to ensure that we have school system that serve the whole community and to ensure that all child whether or not they have special educational need and disability be properly serve and give the opportunity to thrive within that system apologise for my premature bob at the beginning of this question session mr speaker my constituent have be wait for more than year for conservative run lancashire county council to issue her year old son ehcp in that time he have attempt suicide and have stop eat and my constituent health be suffer as result of the stress how can the minister reassure my constituent that the additional billion for send provision will speed up the issuing of ehcp so that student with special need receive the support that they need be sorry to hear about the experience of my hon friend constituent and she be right to raise it today we know that far too many family and child be wait far too long to receive the support that they need and we be determined to reform the system because child need should be recognise at the early possible stage they should not be wait for ehcp in order to receive that support within our education system that be the change that we want to see but we recognise the demand on ehcp and the process and we recognise that we need to improve that be happen throughout lancashire include chorley the reform put sen right at the heart of the special educational need system but the then government do only half the job fail to honour the resource that they have promise ehcp take too long to access and child be often send out of borough to receive specialist education which be more expensive how will the government provide more sen provision in our mainstream school in town such as mine my hon friend be right to raise the priority of ensure that child with special educational need and disability be accommodate in mainstream school with their friend whenever possible we be ensure that training be available from the early possible stage so that those in the workforce can teach child with send and that educational psychology service be there to help school to make any change that be necessary we want to work in partnership with the sector to secure the good outcome for every child childcare accessibility what step she be take to make childcare more accessible ensure that parent have access to affordable and high quality childcare be priority for this government we will focus on great opportunity for every family to access early education and on great opportunity for child to thrive and develop as an initial step we have announce the bidding round for the first school base nursery from next september many early year provider struggle to meet the need of child with send lack of fund lack of training and lack of specialist staff often mean that those that do provide good or excellent service quickly become over subscribed what step be the department take to reassure parent and carer of child with send that those child will have access to the childcare or early year provision in their area that meet their need we be help member of the workforce to develop the skill and confidence that will enable they to work effectively with child with send and review early year fund arrangement to ensure that they meet the need of those child should be happy to meet my hon friend or visit her constituency to understand the issue that her local provider be face martin lewis have long campaign for change in childcare in particular because the way in which it be set up can damage single parent there be an obvious cliff edge the last government propose consultation on threshold for household be take as one but this government seem to have scrap that in the budget will ministers be speak to the treasury to decide how they will overcome this cliff edge that affect so many single parent thank the hon member for his question we have child centre government and early year be priority for the secretary of state we will focus on reform the childcare system to ensure that it be fit for purpose for the future and of high quality for all young people we be take the sector concern seriously and we want to ensure there be sustainable system go forward send system effectiveness what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the system for support child with special educational need and disability what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the system for support child with special educational need and disability last month the national audit office confirm what many family already know the send system that we inherit from the conservatives be break indeed the number of hon member raise concern on behalf of their constituent show the scale of the challenge that we have inherit we be work as quickly as we can to make the change that family need it be huge complex reform but we be determined to fix the system far too many people in my constituency of hyndburn find the current ehcp process to be adversarial and one that fail to assess their child need adequately as the government work to reform the system how can we be sure that the voice of parent and child will remain at the heart of any policy change recognise what my hon friend be say we engage with child young people parent and carer in the development of policy include through our participation contract next week will meet our national young people group which be diverse group of young people from across england who have special educational need and disability they share their view and experience with we and be look forward to it at the recent send surgery that organise with send socials birmingham one message come through time and again different public body be not work together as the children and families act intend and this be contribute to long delay and distress will the minister agree to receive representation from young people and family in south birmingham so that their negative experience can at least contribute to the important work of reform the send system absolutely we be commit to work with family to deliver an improved send system that work for all we ensure that family have access to free and impartial information advice and support to enable they to participate as fully as possible in the decision that affect they but would welcome suggestion from my hon friend and parent in south birmingham on how to improve the system the minister have just agree that there be crisis of capacity for send provision in the state sector yet the government deeply misguided vat policy on school fee be exaggerate this crisis and the crisis of ehcp assessment surely the right thing to do be grant vat exemption on send child to ease the crisis we be committed to ensure that pupil whose need necessitate place at private school be not impact by this policy where pupil place in private school be fund by local authority in england scotland and wales because the pupil need can not be meet in the state sector the local authority will be able to reclaim the vat it be charge on fee refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests hertfordshire currently receive the third low send funding in the country but since the number of child in the county with educational health and care plan have grow by staggering do the minister agree that funding should reflect the current need high need funding will increase by almost billion in compare with bring the total high need funding to billion the funding will help local authority and school with the increase cost of support child and young people with special educational need on the distribution of funding the national funding formula will be announce later in november skill and employment what step she be take to help ensure that young people have the necessary skill to gain employment this government be about fix the foundation to help do this we have launch an independent curriculum and assessment review which aim to enable all young people to access rigorous and high value qualification and training we will also introduce youth guarantee which will help to year old to access education training and apprenticeship opportunity and to receive employment support the london design and engineering university technical college in my constituency cater for to year old and offer at secondary level the kind of training often only find at further education level do the minister agree that we need to create more opportunity at secondary level for skill base training to ensure that it be embed and last post into the workplace and that it improve employability skill as well appreciate my hon friend thoughtful question this government absolutely value university technical college for help young people to develop technical skill and with employer support to move into technical career the independent curriculum and assessment review aim to broaden the curriculum ensure that young people do not miss out on vocational subject and that they leave education ready for employment eastbourne as the sunny town in the uk be on mission to be solar energy superpower at the heart of that be east sussex college green training hub which be support student young and mature to move into that sector will the minister join in celebrate the hub second birthday and will she come down to eastbourne to visit the hub and its principal rebecca conroy and to soak up some eastbourne sun the sun be obviously shin on eastbourne even though may not be shin everywhere else at the moment because of the weather visit to eastbourne to celebrate the hub sound delightful but this fall to my noble friend baroness smith of malvern so will pass on these comment to she call the shadow minister neil the sun always shin on chorley mr speaker one thing that help young people to gain skill be involvement in the cadet but the department recently confirm decision to cancel support payment to combined cadet force in state school that payment be something that people involve in the cadet and teacher really value what assessment be make beforehand of the impact that this cut would have will the secretary of state reconsider it we respect all our young people who be in the cadet or any other armed force area the hon gentleman raise this point but after year of the previous government failure and the billion black hole there be difficult choice to be make we be absolutely committed to child and young people and to do the good we can do by they young carers school absence what step her department be take to help tackle persistent school absence among young carer the government be commit to break down barrier to opportunity for all young people include young carer who provide critical role in care for their love one we now collect specific absence datum for young carer through the school census and our statutory attendance guidance seek to ensure that they receive holistic support to overcome barrier to attendance one thing that might be drive absence from school for young carer be long term mental health condition the royal college of paediatrics and child health say that as many as one in five young carer could be suffer from long term mental health condition can the minister explain what measure the department be take to ensure that sufficient help be in place for people suffer from those condition we want to ensure that we support young carer in school as well as other child who may be suffer from mental health condition this government be entirely commit to support young

review what recent progress the independent curriculum and assessment review have make what progress the independent curriculum and assessment review have make our independent curriculum and assessment review be launch in july it will support our ambition for high and rise standard for all and for broad curriculum with an excellent foundation in the core subject the review have launch its call for evidence and there be still time to participate the review will publish its interim report in early with final recommendation in autumn research from the university of cambridge show that financial habit be often set by the age of seven yet financial education for young people be still postcode lottery it be not part of the primary curriculum and many teacher at secondary level where it be part of the curriculum lack resource and confidence in teach it can the secretary of state confirm whether such foundational life skill which all young people need in order to thrive will be consider at all key stage in the curriculum and assessment review be grateful to my hon friend for highlight this important area which have be raise by many member in the past be sure the review will carefully consider what financial education young people need to meet that aim and it will of course consider what support we need to provide to enable teacher to teach the reform curriculum successfully think parent will be quite alarmed by the answer give to my hon friend the member for central suffolk and north ipswich patrick spencer as it have very little focus on academic attainment the education secretary appoint becky francis who attack the blair government for their obsession with academic achievement the national education union deny that school accountability should be at the heart of our assessment system which be wrong so will the secretary of state take this opportunity to rule out scrap sat in year rather fear that the hon gentleman and his party have learn nothing from the massive defeat inflict upon they by voter in july can assure this house that the review will be evidence base and will not seek to fix thing that be not break however remind the hon gentleman that his record be send system in crisis one in five child persistently absent from school they can not learn if they be not there fall standard persistent disadvantage gap and over half of disadvantaged pupil in state primary school not leave with the require standard in english and math he might be proud of that record but be not topical questions if she will make statement on her

not work and we know it need reform but commit an extra billion into the system at this crucial time be an important first step we face choice on how to take this system forward and how to make it less adversarial and more focused on well life chance for our child one of the first step take be to refocus the work of the department for education on child with send school be close across inner london and across london more widely for various reason leave premise empty or at risk of be sell off what strategic oversight be the secretary of state take to ensure that we get the good value for our child from these property be grateful to my hon friend for raise that important issue about which there be lack of thinking by the previous government on how we do this properly and seriously

community welcome the right hon gentleman to his place he will make an excellent chair of the select committee on environment food and rural affairs and thank he for the opportunity to talk about this important issue as the minister for food security can assure the house that food security be national security the government commitment to support farmer and rural community be unwavering we have commit billion in the agricultural budget over the next two year the big ever budget for sustainable food production and nature recovery in our country history we be also release million to support farmer whose farm have be devastate by severe flooding and invest million to protect the nation from potential disease outbreak that threaten our farming industry food security and human health however as we be all only too aware the conservatives leave behind billion black hole in our nation yes you do and this government have have to take tough decision on tax welfare and spending to fix the foundation and deliver change include series of decision on tax to protect the payslip of work people that be possible only by make change to other taxis such as agricultural property relief which be previously available to all agricultural property at rate of currently small farm can find themselves face the same level of tax bill as much large farm despite have much small asset twenty per cent of agricultural property relief be claim by the top be claim by the top that be not fair it be not sustainable and sadly it have be use in some case by wealthy landowner to avoid inheritance tax that be why the government have announce plan to reform agricultural property relief the secretary of state meet national farmers union president tom bradshaw this morning we absolutely order dr mullan hear you before and be certainly not put up with it this time if you want to leave do so now because want to be able to hear other do we understand each other indicate assent thank you carry on minister the secretary of state meet tom bradshaw this morning we completely understand farmer anxiety about the change but rural community need well nhs affordable housing and public transport and we can provide that if we make the system fair the reform to agricultural property relief mean that farmer can access relief for the first million and relief thereafter an effective tax rate that mean that an individual can pass up to million and couple up to million between they to direct descendant inheritance tax free currently of agricultural property relief claim order do not know whether you be aware minister but you only have three minute how long will you be now be you come to the end at this minute in second marvellous come on then seventy three per cent of agricultural property relief claim be for less than million the vast majority of farmer will not be affect they will be able to pass the family farm down to their child just as previous generation have always do it be fair and balanced approach that protect family farm while also fix the public service that those same family rely on it be part of budget that will restore economic stability and begin decade of national renewal call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee remind the house of my entry in the register of members financial interests thank you mr speaker for allow this urgent question also thank the minister for his statement but fear that it illustrate rather well some of the lack of understanding that have bring we to this point more than any other industry farming relie on stability and long term planning that be why many people in the industry rely on undertaking give by the secretary of state when in opposition that the labour party in government would not change inheritance tax relief for farming every farming business be capital rich but revenue poor those business also trade in market that have be more heavily influence by government intervention than any other agricultural property relief be not loophole it have be deliberate policy of successive government for the past year design to avoid the sale and break up of family farm be that still goal to which this government adhere as the nfu put it the government have seemingly fail to grasp that family farm be not just small farm and that just because farm be valuable asset it do mean those who work it be wealthy as the minister will be aware some of the figure he have just give the house have be vigorously challenge over the past few day particularly the assertion that only one in four british farm will be affect will the minister and his treasury colleague publish the datum behind those figure in particular do the figure that of farm will not be affect rely on the inclusion of very small holding these change will have ripple effect across the whole rural community will the government publish their impact assessment for other rural business can the minister also explain why the treasury have remove the ringfence around farm support to be spend in scotland wales and northern ireland that ringfence be introduce after the bew review if it need review to introduce it how can it just be abolish now out of the blue the prime minister have say in the past and the minister have repeat today that food security be national security can the minister point to one measure in this budget that make achieve that aim easy rather than hard thank the right hon member for his question which be serious and important as one would expect let start by point out that until this relief do not exist the system have exist before and people have operate differently although accept it have be different for the past year turn to the figure encourage people to reach for the detail to look at the actual figure the only thing we can go on be the claim and the figure come from the treasury on claim for the last year available absolutely reflect that figure the right hon gentleman raise an important point about the ringfence that point be under discussion but have make assurance that the devolve administration will be closely inform about and involve in what happen these be important point and they should be treat seriously do not really care for the high profile voice that we have get attack labour government but do care about the family farm in my constituency know that the minister care for those farm as well as do the prime minister welcome the figure we have be give however those figure do need to be translate to our family farmer they need to see what it be like on the ground would welcome meeting with nfu cymru and the minister to discuss what thing be go to look like for farmer especially in gower and the rest of wales where there be completely different landscape thank my hon friend for her contribution can say how much enjoy visit wales with the welsh minister very early in my tenure it be an important sign from this government that we take farming seriously across the entire united kingdom share my hon friend very strong point about the importance of the family farm what we be do here be protect the family farm have visit right around the country over the past five year and on almost every visit people have tell that they be concerned about people come from outside they often say up london or down lot of money and buy up local farmland over the head of local people not because they care about farming but to use that farmland for tax evasion purpose this policy can be helpful to family farm and protect they the hon gentleman on the opposition front bench say from sedentary position that it will not but it be people from his area who have be tell about these problem they repeat they constantly when we be in opposition and here be labour government do something about it call the shadow minister mr speaker lose farm be not like lose any other business it can come back those be not my word but the word of our prime minister at the national farmers union conference just last year over the weekend we have hear gut wrench story from farmer up and down the nation who feel completely and utterly betray by the measure in this budget ask the minister why do the secretary of state continue to say that he be proud of his family farm tax do the minister realise that the vast majority of farming family be not multimillionaire most be cash poor and many be struggle to break even how do the secretary of state expect farmer in his word to order can just say to the hon member for east thanet ms billington that do not need any chuntering do we understand how do the secretary of state expect farmer to do more with less why be he happy to hand our next generation of farmer an impossible tax bill next the government claim that small family farmer will be protect yet the country land and business association and the nfu have today dispute the government figure will the minister commit to release full assessment of his policy include an impact on national food security while the change to inheritance tax relief have be gain the national headline there be many other negative impact on farming business from the budget increase national insurance contribution couple with low national threshold an accelerated reduction in de link payment rate high taxis on double cab pick up vehicle new taxis on fertiliser could go on but this all beg the question do the right hon member for streatham and croydon north steve reed actually know anything about farming at all more importantly after the secretary of state look british farmer in the eye and specifically promise they that there would be no change to agricultural property relief how on earth can farmer believe single word that his minister be about to say be very grateful to the hon gentleman for promote to secretary of state hope he have similar success in the come hour the hon gentleman raise whole series of question he ask again as other have about other element in the budget the figure be absolutely there they be publish by the treasury and be there for all to read they be the fact on the estate that have make claim on agricultural property relief in the last year available interruption they be there for everyone to see it be not difficult it be not complicated they be there something that perhaps have not be say but which should be be that there be many call to reflect the change way in which farming operate by include environmental land management scheme within the scope of agricultural property relief hear nothing from opposition front benchers about that do they not understand the way in which british farming be change many farmer in my constituency of hastings and rye be feel the impact of year of conservative failure in particular they have face many challenge with flooding can the minister tell what step we have take in the budget to protect small family farm and how we will continue to support farmer face flooding be grateful to my hon friend because she make some important point ahead of the budget there be lot of prediction about what would happen of course what happen be that this government have protect the farming budget indeed raise it and we be absolutely committed to pay out to farmer the million that they deserve for flooding that be million of course that be not really budget for by the conservatives as part of their billion black hole the difference between we and they be that we be take responsible approach which mean that farmer can look forward to stable future as oppose to the chaos of the last decade call the liberal democrat spokesperson farmer across the united kingdom be cop with the linger legacy of betrayal betrayal from the trade deal that happen under the last government which throw they under bus and betrayal from the transition from the old payment scheme to the new one which see many of they go bust or force into make business decision that they would never ever have choose that legacy of betrayal be one that hang heavy and it be why farmer in my constituency and elsewhere feel so utterly disappoint by this government budget last week let we look first at the agricultural property relief change there be farm in cumbria and in my constituency affect by this have the minister do an investigation into the number of farmer who be live on less than the minimum wage each year in term of income but who have property that will be affect by these change particularly give the decrease in farm income under the conservative government over the last five year will he also assess the impact on tenant farmer some of my farmer be tenant and will be affect by the disruption that this change will create would it not be wise for he to implement the rock review of tenant protection before introduce something like this will he also look again at the billion budget and increase it by billion just as the liberal democrats suggest if we do not feed ourselves we be fail country the hon gentleman be well inform thoughtful person and listen closely to what he have to say on these issue but do wonder sometimes about the liberal democrats approach to economic because that billion would have to come from somewhere be afraid that the difference between labour and the opposition side of the house be that we be determined to get the public finance in order because it be upon that basis that future prosperity in the farming sector will come in term of farm income the hon gentleman be absolutely right that many farm be very marginal we know that and it be complicated but would say to everyone in this house that the entire inheritance tax system be complicated must say have read lot over the weekend that be perhaps little short on accuracy he be also right about tenant farmer and we be in close conversation with the tenant farmers association about how the change can perhaps be use to good effect because another element which have not be raise so far interestingly by the conservative party be the generational challenge we face in farming will not be tell farmer how to run their life but it be worth reflect on the fact that sometimes it be difficult to make that transition and we need to get more young people into farming put on record that be an officer of the all party parliamentary group on farming also put on record my thank to farmer who through torrid decade have produce food and sustenance for we in this country we should all recognise that farmer will rightly be anxious after the experience they have have in the past few year do my hon friend the minister agree that that anxiety will only be heighten by the scaremongering from some member of this house and will he commit to work with hon member the national farmers union and farmer to ensure that the positive element around food security in this budget be deliver in the year to come my hon friend and near neighbour be right to pay tribute to our food producer one thing we know for sure be that we be go to need food into the future and farmer be essential to the future of this nation and our economy that be why we will treat they with the utmost respect and seriousness and have serious debate about how we transform farming again while this have not be pick up much in the debate so far the effect of this budget be to speed up still far that transition to an environmentally friendly nature friendly way of farming alongside produce the food that our country need that be really important transition pay tribute to the current opposition who start that process in government but have be unwavere in my support for it for number of year and be determined to see it through to proper conclusion my hon friend be also right that we will work with everyone involve to get good sensible outcome because that be what this government be about the national farmers union tweet in prime minister keir starmer look farmer in the eye and say he know what lose farm mean farmer believe he after today budget they do believe he any more what be the prime minister go to do practically to resolve that when we come to power few month ago the thing be ask most strongly to do be to provide stability for the future through series of intervention over the past few month have try to indicate that that be exactly what we will do whether through the environmental land management scheme or any other issue the government face huge challenge at this budget we all know that decision have to be make however be absolutely convinced that farmer and all those other people who live in rural area want and need exactly the same decent health service housing and transport as other do they will be able to carry on farming as they have do but the difference be that that will be in stable economic system which mean they will not suffer in the way they have over the last decade many farm in my constituency be under water for month after the flood last year what be the minister do to support those farm as they recover from last year horrific storm extreme weather event have clearly become grow challenge for we all which be part of the reason that we be so determined to make the transition to more environmentally friendly form of farming last year scheme be in place to help farmer the then government increase it as say be not sure that they exactly identify where the money be come from but we have identify the money we have honour it and will be pay the million out to farmer in the next couple of week the minister imply early that farmer in my constituency of bridlington and the wolds support this measure can categorically tell he that they do not they be shatter by this announcement the impact on my community will be devastating ask the minister today to do the right thing and withdraw these plan look forward to many more such exchange over the dispatch box with the hon gentleman what say early be that on my many visit around the country people consistently tell that they be concerned about how the system be be abuse and how people be come in and buy up land over their head that be what say and that be what stand by as for these measure be afraid that this be budget that stand in its entirety and the whole country need stability so it will stand few month ago visit my constituent andrew and ada who farm in remote north east corner of cumbria sadly after year under conservative governments they be largely get by on ada pension will the minister set out what support will be available to farmer such as my constituent follow last week budget my hon friend be absolutely right many people in this country and many farmer in particular be struggle to get by that be why it be very important that in this budget we maintain the budget for the support scheme that people be get use to it be interesting to note that they be now be subscribe to in much high number that support will be available to help people to make the transition and to go on supply food for this country which be so important it have now be more than year since devastating flood wreck the somerset level and moor cause untold damage at the time affected community be tell that money be no object when it come to protect the area but now deep in the budget document there be hint that the farming and flood defence budget might be cut can the minister explain to my farmer in glastonbury and somerton who be terrify of more flooding devastation this winter how the government aim to protect they remember those awful time very well money be no object be not something that be say by my party can tell she it be say by the now opposition and perhaps it be not exactly the right way to put it extreme weather event be challenge for all of we across the country my colleague and will work with everyone to find the good way to resolve they but let we not for one moment imagine that this be simple issue to solve the flooding challenge be very real and we be work on they look forward to further discussion with the hon lady the minister know lot of farmer in my constituency he be near neighbour of mine and farmer be grateful for his engagement with they he know that farmer income fall year on year under the conservative government will he outline what measure there be in this budget to support farmer in north west cambridgeshire and help the industry to get back on track thank my hon friend who be another of my near neighbour do not use to have many near neighbour who be anywhere near as friendly as my new near neighbour but cambridgeshire have change cambridgeshire have change for very clear reason cambridgeshire lose trust in the conservative party be determined to build trust across the entire country by maintain over prolonged period the level of support necessary to allow people to farm successfully my answer to my hon friend be to look at the budget where we see an increase in the farming budget we will look to maintain proper support into the future because exactly as have be say these be long term business and long term interest the reason that they be long term be that we be all go to need to eat the minister talk about the transition talk to my farmer in bedale on friday and the only transition they can see be the transition from family farm to the state do he realise that the farming industry be one of the least profitable sector in the country the return on capital employ be be the government own figure and that be around of the typical profit margin in the uk other than by some warped socialist ideology how can he justify take away year of profit for the typical farmer the hon gentleman may wish to remember that the agricultural transition be embark upon by the previous government it be seven year transition process and we be just over halfway through it be important that it be maintain in stable and sensible way and that be exactly what we be do my answer to his question be that the challenge put to be to maintain stability and not to tear up those scheme to maintain they and make they work and that be exactly what we be do meet farmer in my constituency in the day just ahead of the budget the big concern that they raise with be not inheritance tax but the transition from basic payment to elm scheme welcome the fact that the budget not only maintain the agriculture budget but grow it which the conservatives say they would not do there be concern that under the previous government despite have the budget the system be write in such way that the small farm could not easily access that funding that be the single big threat to agricultural business in my area rather think the conservatives be raise smokescreen will the minister comment on what this government will do to ensure that we can draw down that budget and ensure that local farm can take advantage it be strike that under the previous government the agriculture budget be so substantially underspent we be fix that and make it possible for people to access those scheme in the way that my hon friend describe it be interesting that the issue that come up most for he be basic payment the issue that come up time after time on my visit be rural crime that be the thing that have trouble so many people on farm and in the countryside that be why it be so important that this government be set up proper integrate rural crime strategy the minister be see silver lining in the cloud hang over family farm and tenant farm in north dorset but must confess that fail to see they will give ask the minister simple yes or no question yes or no will he come to north dorset to meet farmer in my constituency and explain these wonderful silver lining that he can see in the cloud but none of we on the opposition benches can see love visit farm all over the country and be sure north dorset will feature on my list at some point in the future on this whole question of optimism pessimism and the stress and strain in the countryside my hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes early warn about some of the thing that be be say urge people to be temperate in their language on these issue because people be stress anxious and worried my task be to be calm sensible and reassure to they and to remind they that the vast majority will be able to pass on their farm just as they have before just as press be to tackle those other real issue that they face do not underestimate the challenge that people face of course it be difficult and we know it be hard but this government will do everything we can to support people and to maintain their prosperity into the future many of the farmer in my constituency have regularly raise concern with over protect farm and our food system from animal disease will the minister please outline what step he be take to protect our food and farming system thank my hon friend for raise that important point because among the many many stressful thing for farmer be not just the weather of the past few year but the disease threat whether that threat be avian flu or bluetongue we be committed to help as part of that in the budget we commit more than million to start the process of upgrade the facility at weybridge which be so very important for our future biosecurity biosecurity be so important be stagger that the previous government do not take swifter action to protect our border from african swine fever we have toughen the rule on that indicate assent see the hon gentleman nod he be well verse in that he know order can just say that brevity will be helpful believe that everybody have constituency interest so really want to get everyone in if we can have short answer that would be well also if the minister look at now and again that would help hear what be be say declare my interest as farmer year old farmer email last week and say we work long hour usually alone he say that agriculture have one of the high suicide rate of any industry there be great deal of talk these day about mental health and the need to alleviate stress in the workplace yet last week the chancellor and the secretary of state for agriculture destroy everything have ever work for how would the minister answer that would reassure that farmer be afraid that do not think he be correct on that and we be absolutely determined to ensure that he can hand on his farm as other have do before but let we ensure that he get the proper advice spend about month in this place ask the former government about water management but be always on hiding to nothing do my hon friend recognise that the farmer in my constituency have lot of expertise in water management and land management will he tell we how the budget support farmer to bring that expertise to the fore and work in partnership with we to manage that land and water the good potato be grateful to my hon friend the scheme we have in place will help we to work with farmer on those issue alongside of course the payment of the million that the previous government promise the minister have ask member to be temperate in their language but there be deep anger in scotland and in my constituency about these announcement which the policy director for the nfu in scotland have state will be devastating for farmer and crofter will the minister tell we how these announcement will increase food security and national security once again would say that it be by have stable sensible approach to farming support in the come year clearly in scotland this area be devolve and it be for the scottish government to determine how they operate but we be set the overall context and in stable economy in the future farmer will thrive be proud to represent proud north yorkshire farmer in my constituency will the minister set out the step he will be take to ensure that small family farm will be protect by the government additionally will he endorse polyhalite fantastic crop nutrient fertiliser that be produce in only one place in the world north yorkshire be grateful to my hon friend will always look with keen interest at anything that can help we to make progress in term of how we provide support and reassurance to those small farmer that again be by make sure that we have strong stable economy refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests be the minister surprise by the reaction of the farming community thank my fellow east anglian mp for his contribution be surprised no be not entirely surprised because people be very feed up and depressed and they have be depress for long time understand why it be difficult but my job be to reassure and talk calmly to people and that be what shall continue to do be proud to represent many wonderful farming community the young farmer meet tell that one of their big challenge be access rural mental health service do my hon friend welcome the record billion extra go into the nhs which will support access to rural mental health service my hon friend be absolutely right the core message of the budget be to get our finance stable and on track which will allow we to invest in the public service that everyone need and particularly those in rural area who be struggle with those issue one of many email have receive in the past week be from farmer who have an archetypal family farm of acre of mixed dairy and arable that they be plan on pass on to their son even though they be struggle to make end meet he be typical of farmer in my constituency and he be very concerned we have not see any investment in public transport or any of the other sweetener that the minister mention early can he explain what investment will go into rural transport and why he have set the threshold for apr so low think the hon lady should wait bit long to see transport improvement it have only be week the level have be set by the treasury base on the figure that we have to try to make sure it be fair as say the vast majority will not pay anything hope she will find that reassuring for year farmer in my constituency be let down and betray by the conservative government on thing like the australia and new zealand trade deal and repeat broken promise that see thousand of farm business across the country close do the minister share my assessment that they be betray for those year do not think it be my assessment but that of the voter who make it very clear sam wilson be farmer in ashfield he be not rich man in fact he have not draw wage in the past four year will the minister look in the eye and tell how many farmer he have speak to in the past few month who agree with this hare brain scheme the last farmer speak to over the weekend congratulate on what we be do there appear to be lot of discussion about agricultural property relief on inheritance tax today could the minister confirm what percentage of the farm that claim more than million of agricultural property relief in the past two year actually receive any agricultural income in the past five year will have to go away and get the answer to that and will write to he south shropshire farmer be in touch with over the weekend they be up in arm about change to apr that the labour party tell they would not happen will the minister reverse this rural vandalism and back british farmer we will back british farmer by make sure that they have stable system in which they can flourish it be extraordinary that small number of wealthy landowner have be use agricultural property relief to avoid inheritance tax what be more extraordinary be how the conservatives have defend tax avoidance in the way that they have will my hon friend confirm to the farmer in my constituency and across the country that the budget will benefit family farmer through investment in public service as well as through the agriculture proposal my hon friend make powerful point not only do those people seem to relish find way of creatively run their account but some of they even take money to write column about it declare that my husband be in agriculture and farming and therefore have an indirect financial interest in the topic this government promise that they would not raise national insurance contribution but they have they promise that they would not reduce agricultural property relief but they have they have also add fertiliser tax and tax on pick up truck as way of compound the misery have the minister do an impact assessment on food security and food price follow the budget and will he publish it the hon lady will know that many thing impact food price gently suggest to the conservatives that they might want to look more closely at food price rise over the past few year before give we any lecture on how to manage thing be confident about this because have look at the figure issue by the treasury on the number of claim make in the past few year and our figure stack up have previously raise in departmental question that the farmer speak to are reluctant to sign up for elms due to the complexity and because they do not want to get lock into deal when well one might be around the corner that may account for the million underspend last year in the budget the government commit to maintain the funding at the current level include the underspend but say that it would be review in to ensure it be affordable do the minister agree that that leave farmer even more in the dark about their future at time when they be struggle to get by the hon lady raise an important point suspect that in the month ahead it will come out that actually over the last few month there have be big uptick in the number of people make sustainable farming incentive claim that say to that we be now on track to make these system work for people do not disagree with she that under the previous government it be very long painful process but we be now make progress and we need to make it work do the minister recognise that the change not only break the government previous promise on apr to farmer but that they will add significant burden and cost to family farm and disincentivise food production also wish my fellow east anglian mp the right hon lady good luck in the come hour the reason we can look forward to successful and stable future for farmer across the east of england and the rest of the country be that we have absolutely commit to stability the reason thing have have to be different be that we find find this in my department just as fellow ministers find it in their departments that the situation be far bad than we have be lead to believe we have to tackle that problem diolch mr llefarydd as tenant dairy farmer myself and chair of the farmers union of wales carmarthenshire perhaps understand this issue more than anybody else in the chamber the government be try to portray farming as an industry of super wealthy landowner and that be simply not the case in wales let tell they welsh upland farmer in mountainous and hilly area have an average annual income of yes you hear correctly that be far below the national living wage for hour that be way beyond the average hour week what assessment have the minister make of the impact of the change to apr in wales where wage for farmer be so low the hon lady be absolutely right that farming be very tough right across the country and very difficult in wales it be devolved issue so will not comment on specific scheme in wales but point she back to the treasury figure that show the number of people who make claim for apr it be relatively few and would say it be probably relatively few in wales spend most of the past six year look at treasury figure and have great deal of sympathy for the hon gentleman fear he be victim of hit and run exercise by the treasury on the department for environment food and rural affairs budget he would do well to think about the lesson learn from the pasty tax because if he be not careful this measure will be of similar dimension for this government be very grateful for the right hon gentleman concern but have to say do not agree with he can the minister confirm how many farm in wales will be impact by the change to apr in the budget be grateful to the hon gentleman for his question do not think it be break down by national area at the moment but it be something we can go away and look at draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests farmer and family business be deeply alarmed because an important principle on which they have rely for decade have be breach it be obvious from the red book that the chancellor will have to raise tax again in the future be this the end or can farmer and small business expect yet more demand on death the right hon gentleman say decade think it be in or when the current rule be introduce can absolutely assure he that we be now on track for stable future that will allow farmer in his constituency and across england to flourish family farm be very often cash poor each time the average farm be pass from parent to child the family may have to generate an extra half million pound they may deal with that by try to make each acre produce an additional of profit that could send into reverse the agricultural transition to more nature friendly farming approach if they revert to more agrichemical and intensive method as ask the minister in an adjournment debate last week what do he do ahead of the budget to combat this appalling measure the hon member ask what we do what we do be look at the farming budget and ensure that we protect it to allow his constituent and constituent across the country to take part in the scheme that will support they in that important transition how do the minister reconcile his sensible acceptance of the fact that food security be vital to national security with farmland be split up and sell off probably for development as result of the budget change the right hon gentleman have raise an important point we will be address it through the land use framework which will be deliver in the next couple of month of course there be trade off there be range of pressure on our land in respect of housing food energy and so many other thing we need to have rational way of make those decision and that be exactly what we will introduce be the minister the secretary of state and the chancellor aware that so serious be the consequence of this policy that the head of farming family in their and be seriously consider commit suicide before it come into place hon member shame shame on you interruption order do not need any after comment find it hard to respond to question like that speak early about use language carefully and would just reiterate that point in the rural england that be privileged to represent part of they say that you should live as if you be go to die tomorrow and farm as if you be go to live forever do the government not understand that if we inheritance tax our farm out of existence there will be no forever and there will be no food from what be once the garden of england the right hon gentleman be very knowledgeable about these issue just gently ask he to look closely at the detail and the figure which show that the number be low do not recognise his characterisation of the future accord to statistic publish by defra last thursday an average farm in england measure hectare which be roughly one hectare for every word that labour have to say about farming in its last manifesto what assessment have the minister make of the typical value of farm of that size about hectare think the hon gentleman will know that the definition of farm be actually rather complicated that be what make this quite difficult debate and be not go to comment on individual farm but the overall let return to the point about the treasury figure which show that the number of claim likely to be affect by this change be relatively low before the election farmer in my constituency be very concerned about the environmental land management system which have not work for long time but which they feel be just begin to work will the minister please reassure they that the government will be proceed with it can absolutely give my hon friend that assurance as say early throughout the last five year in opposition be consistent supporter of the agricultural transition and be determined to ensure that it be successful be conscious of the need to use temperate word but one of my constituent say to that the government have leave farmer the choice between sell now in manage way and leave their farm to their heir who would be at the mercy of hmrc and the bank either way family farm would fall the minister have talk extensively today about the challenge of wealthy individual come in to buy up farmland do the government accept that this measure will potentially increase that problem and if it be problem what additional legislative step will they take no do not for the reason that outline early think that it will act as disincentive for people to do that farmer in my constituency have tell that they be struggle owe to the abysmal implementation of transition payment scheme by the last government there have be huge delay in receive payment and they have be catch up in bureaucracy will the minister reassure and those farmer in my constituency that this government be fix those problem and speed up payment to our farmer can give my hon friend that assurance minister keep say that we should not worry about apr because far more people think they will pay it than will actually be catch do he not recognise that that be part of the problem people have to make business decision now for an uncertain future and this policy will have depressive effect on the investment that we need in agriculture do not agree if the right hon member look at number of the more thoughtful commentator in the debate over the last few day he will see that there be some very different view out there on the impact this policy will have thank the minister for his comment about rural crime which be real issue in my constituency of burton and uttoxeter we have hear no apology from the conservative party for cut police across our constituency will the minister say more about the step that this government will take to protect farmer from theft antisocial behaviour and fly tipping my hon friend be absolutely right it seem that the conservative party do not understand that if we raise taxis and invest in the future we can do more to protect people who can not protect themselves it be vital that we tackle rural crime which be top issue that be raise with consistently at the rutland ploughing contest this weekend it be clear that farmer feel devastated they feel that the government do not understand they because farmer do not have liquid wealth they rely on land as their asset to produce food they turn small profit but have very constrain cash flow indeed they have the low return on asset of any business sector an average return of less than lose farm be not like lose any other business it can come back those be the prime minister word as the minister constituency be near neighbour of mine will he come and repeat they to my farmer in rutland and stamford and have that discussion with they have be on an extended farm tour for the last five year and be sure it will continue in my constituency of monmouthshire farmer be anxious and worried will my hon friend seek to reassure small family farmer by spell out the figure last week the exchequer secretary to the treasury say these exemption mean that if someone have no other asset and be pass it on to direct descendant farm or farming business worth up to million can be pass on without pay any inheritance tax at all official report october vol be grateful to my hon friend be very reluctant to offer tax advice to anybody but the advice have be give be that the figure may even be more than that urge people to look closely at the detail rather than jump to the bad conclusion reference have be make to rural crime may suggest that whole new definition of rural crime be the proposal contain in the budget the labour party have yet again show that it do not understand the rural community if family farm close there will be knock on effect for grain merchant farm machinery dealer and so on can the minister explain what assessment have be make of the impact on the total rural economy agree with the hon gentleman that the rural economy be closely integrate and that one thing have an effect on another but the thing that will be most beneficial for the rural economy be strong economy which we be build we be put the foundation in place have farmer in my constituency some farm will be affect by this silly idea not to mention the family their employee and the shopkeeper who rely on our rural economy this policy be insensible irrational and plain wrong in its interpretation of real life in our rural community it will be like the highland clearance hundred of year of tradition will be lose to the taxman before ask the minister to think again can say with absolute certainty that the policy of the conservative and labour party have reaffirm the fact that the liberal democrats be the only true champion of farmer and the countryside order sorry will the minister order sit down please the question be long enough we do not need to start play politic around the chamber do not recognise those figure when look at the figure that the treasury give for the number of claim in the last year available that be very close to the number in the hon lady own constituency which seem unlikely to first should declare an interest as an active farmer of acre secondly represent constituency with some of the most fertile farmland in the country and since the budget have yet to come across anyone who think that this be anything other than terrible decision speak at the country land and business association conference before the election the then shadow secretary of state now the secretary of state be ask whether labour intend to change inheritance tax relief for farmland the response be we have no intention of change apr while feel for the minister in try to defend the indefensible would he like to take the opportunity today to apologise to the british farming community and most importantly commit to the reversal of this cruel assault on british family farm the hon gentleman well know the financial state of the country that we inherit difficult decision have to be make the average farm in aberdeenshire be acre and average value be about an acre for bare land once the farmhouse build machinery and livestock be add that be suddenly well over the inheritance tax threshold and have huge iht bill of hundred of thousand of pound come your way defra figure show that of farm do not make profit and make less than so do the minister suggest that farmer sell the land they use to grow the food sell the machinery they use to harvest the food or sell the building they use to store the food in order to pay this bill the hon lady will know that farming policy be different in scotland but on the tax issue which be uk wide that be absolutely right but would suggest that she get her farmer to look in detail at these proposal and what they will find be the vast when they look at they in detail they will find that the vast majority will be absolutely fine as fellow cambridgeshire mp and have already announce forthcoming ban on neonicotinoid for our sugar beet farmer what message will the minister give to the cambridgeshire farmer so gravely impact by the government family farm tax that will lead to farmland be sell and potentially see more of our good and most versatile land be use for vast solar farm how do the slashing of agricultural property relief help farmer in cambridgeshire it be very good to see my near neighbour what will say to cambridgeshire farmer be that the thing they need most of all be stable economy and they also need sound environment in which they can farm the measure that we be put in place will ensure their prosperity for the future can the minister reassure the house and the people of my constituency and our country that the budget will not add to the cost of produce food and will not result in consumer have to bear the brunt of rise price high inflation and high interest rate the hon gentleman make an important point the people of this country suffer gravely under the last government and we will do nothing to make their situation more difficult in fact this budget protect the pay packet of the vast majority of the british people there be already very low margin on every farm include those in mid buckinghamshire will the addition of between and tonne on the price of fertiliser through the government propose carbon tax increase food price who will shoulder that burden will it be the farmer or will it be the consumer as the hon gentleman know whole range of factor go into food price what be very good news be the establishment of gb energy and move to much more affordable and reliable form of power for farmer as well as our consumer we will all be well off on friday visit an agricultural college in my constituency where hear concern about how the change in this budget will potentially strip an industry of young farmer what discussion do the minister have with farming stakeholder on change to the agricultural property relief prior to the budget the hon gentleman will know that tax discussion during the run up to budget be delicate issue however there be no shortage of discussion in newspaper column across the country so there have clearly be discussion young people who want to go into farming face real obstacle and this change could help indicate dissent the hon gentleman shake his head but if he talk to people who know about these issue they agree with do the minister accept that agricultural relief be introduce to protect family farm from be break up precisely to reflect their role as food producer and custodian of our countryside will he rethink this do what labour originally promise and withdraw this proposal as fellow east anglian mp the hon gentleman will know just how complicated farming be how much it have change over the last year and how much it be likely to change in the future we have to ensure that farming be in the right place to benefit from the change that we be see globally and nationally and most importantly that farming can operate in an environmentally and nature sensitive way without that we will all be in deep trouble in the minister opening answer we sadly hear more government slogan and soundbite than real understanding of the fear that daventry farmer have be tell about can assure he that they have be look at the detail in great detail one of they whose father be sadly come to the end of his life be now actively look to sell off land because they simply can not make the farm work that be the next generation go that be food that feed nhs patient go do the minister not think it be time to reverse this policy think it be time for people to take up the opportunity of the scheme that the previous government introduce and that we be continue which allow they to farm in an environmentally and nature friendly way it will be good for the future and will produce food for this country there be very bright future for british farming give the varied estimate of how many farm will be impact by these change to agricultural property relief will the minister confirm how many farm he think will be impact refer the hon lady to my early answer the figure be in the treasury paper for all to see since wednesday have be contact by devastate farmer from across stockton west their family have farm for generation and they know that as result of this budget they will be the last generation to do so have the minister make any assessment of the impact this apr change this family farm tax will have on the viability of tenant farming yes we have because we have look at the figure again do not recognise the hon gentleman characterisation although give some of the thing that have be say over the last few day understand why people be alarmed south devon have some of the most expensive land in the country which make every farm regardless of its size worth lot of money on paper one farmer in my constituency say over the weekend we may be land rich but we be cash poor and our child will more than likely have to sell the land and maybe building to cover the tax without the land the farm be simply no long farm take valuable land out of food production the minister say he value food security and agricultural property relief give we that food security he say order think the minister have get the point understand the point but first much of this can be avoid through proper planning secondly devon be one of the county where we most often hear it say that people be come in and buy up land for the wrong reason farmer in dumfries and galloway who have be contact over the weekend be not shroud wave let we be clear about that less clear be the figure the nfu say that as many as of farm that be produce food meet environmental target and provide job in remote and rural area could be at risk napoleon know that an army march on its stomach and he also say that good retreat be well than bad stand this government be make bad stand and they have chance to reverse this decision will they not do that could be at risk have very broad definition the figure be absolutely clear and suggest that the hon gentleman look at they unlike in many country that be dominate by vast corporate agribusiness the british rural landscape include that of my stratford on avon constituency be define by small family run farm they be our local food producer and they be part of our community how do the government plan to protect this heritage against the pressure to sell to multinational agribusiness in the face of significant inheritance tax burden we treasure our wide range of farm which be very different in different part of the country the agricultural budget be at its high level ever and it will provide support particularly to small farm the previous government end the five hectare minimum level strongly support that and it will continue to be the case farming family in west suffolk feel deep anxiety in common with those in other constituency as hon member from across the house have explain when those family hear the minister say that they do not understand the detail or that they should listen to commentator who agree with the minister but not they commentator who probably have nothing to do with farming in the first place they will be furious with he will the minister apologise to those people if it be not such big deal will he explain why more than people have already sign the nfu petition tell he to change the policy at no point do say that farming family do not understand the detail what ask be for member on the conservative benches to look at the detail because when they look at the detail they will find the truth family farmer in my constituency of bicester and woodstock be leave confused and angry by this betrayal by the government over apr they want to know whose daft idea it be will the minister clarify whether the measure be propose by defra as part of the stability for farm that he outline or do it come from the treasury there be nothing daft about put this country finance on sound footing say to the hon gentleman constituent if they want decent health service school and transport this budget will deliver that may politely suggest to the minister that the time for his weekend reading be before decide the policy not afterwards farmer in my constituency include jonathan vine hall tell that the change to the relief will make it financially non viable to pass on his very typical acre farm do the minister agree with that the likely outcome of that will be that disintereste investor will buy the farm instead which be exactly what he seek to avoid the likely outcome will be that people will put arrangement in place to pass on their farm at the appropriate time pull more young people into farming which will be good thing my overall message to farmer across britain be this government be on your side we will support you look at the agricultural budget and the money that have be pay out of the flood budget we be with you do listen to these people point of order on point of order mr speaker point of order should come after statement as you well know sir roger unless this be specifically about this point indicate assent well in that case know you know well than be you give any indication as to why the secretary of state be not here to answer the urgent question mr speaker absolutely not grant the urgent question because know how important the issue be include to my good farmer in chorley high education reform before call the secretary of state for education to make statement note that report about the possible increase in high education tuition fee start appear in the medium early this afternoon what surprise very leaky mr holden you do help yourself do you the secretary of state be here to make statement so hon member will have the opportunity to question she if the premature media reporting be due to an unauthorised leak that be great discourtesy to this house hope the secretary of state will be able to identify the guilty party take appropriate action and brief accordingly hope the secretary of state will announce leak inquiry we will get all the detail of how this information could have get out and the house will be inform as that go forward mr speaker may begin by express my deep regret that the content of the statement that be about to make appear in the medium early this afternoon it have always be my intention to come before this house to make the statement first give its significance and importance appreciate that you member across the house and our convention rightly demand and expect that hope that you can accept my deep frustration and regret at what have take place will take whatever step can to keep you update on the matter because do respect the convention of and my responsibility to this house can we take it that there will be full inquiry into how this have happen that everybody will be bring in and question and you will then update we on that full inquiry that be what really want can give you that undertaking mr speaker and will speak to official about the matter as you request thank you with permission would like to make statement about the future of our high education sector and the change that we will be make for student in the upcoming academic year before go far want to make clear the approach that this labour government take to our university and above all to the student whose education be their central purpose because the conservative government do not just talk down university they talk down the aspiration of working class family across our country and they dismiss the ambition of our young people and undermine their opportunity this government take different approach we be determined to break down the barrier to opportunity and high education be central to that mission high education be part of what make our country great it enrich our culture power our economy and sustain intellectual tradition stretch back century it be beacon of opportunity to student not just from this country but from across the world and sector of which everyone in this house ought to be proud but when this government take office in july we find university sector face severe financial challenge with tuition fee freeze for the last seven year university have suffer significant real term decline in their income we also find regulator subject to political whim unable to focus on the challenge our university face succession of conservative ministers face with tough decision have for year after year duck they time and again we inherit in our university as across so much of our public sector the consequence of long year of shameful abdication of responsibility long year in which hear too often from student of the gap between the course they be promise and the experience they have about the trouble they have make end meet as they work hard not merely at their study but often at two or more job on top long year in which see the amazing research our university deliver but how infrequently those triumph drive wide success and long year in which hear from international student who make such an important contribution to our country that the previous government have make they feel neither value nor welcome that be the mess that opposition member leave behind but where the conservatives shirk the hard choice this government have not hesitate to grip the challenge we face and take the tough decision to restore stability to high education to fix the foundation and to deliver change we have accept in full the recommendation of the independent review of the office for students we have also bring new leadership to the office and refocus its work to monitor university finance and to hold leadership to account thank sir david behan for his work both lead the independent review and now as its interim chair we have pause the commencement of the last government freedom of speech legislation while we consider the impact on university student and the regulator because although university must be home to robust discussion and rigorous challenge regulation must also be workable be here today to make two set of announcement on high education reform address the challenge our student and university face and grip these issue as responsible government first we will fix the foundation we will secure the future of high education so that student can benefit from world class education for generation to come that be why be announce that in line with the forecast set out in the budget last week from april we will be increase the maximum cap for tuition fee in line with inflation to an increase of per academic report november vol correction understand that some student may worry about the impact that the increase will have on their loan debt so want to reassure student already at university that when they start repay their loan they will not see high monthly repayment as result of these change to fee and maintenance loan that be because student loan be not like consumer loan monthly repayment depend on earning not simply the amount borrow or interest rate and at the end of any loan term any outstanding loan balance include interest build up will be write off increase the fee cap have not be an easy decision but want to be crystal clear that this will not cost graduate more each month as they start to repay their loan university be responsible for manage their own finance and must act to remain sustainable but member across the house will agree that it be no use keep tuition fee down for future student if the university be not there for they to attend nor if student can not afford to support themselves while they study therefore confirm that we will boost support for student with living cost by increase maximum maintenance loan in line with inflation give they an additional year in report november vol correction also confirm that from the start of the academic year low fee limit of will be introduce for foundation year in classroom base subject such as business social science and humanity the government recognise the importance of foundation year for promote access to high education but they can be deliver more efficiently in classroom base subject at low cost to student the change that the government be bring about must go far so my second set of announcement signal the start of deep change for our student our university and our country today will set out the scale of our ambition to build high education system fit for the challenge not just of today but of tomorrow in the month ahead we will publish our proposal because in university as across our public service investment can come only with the promise of major reform the contribution of high education to our economy our community and our country must grow and strengthen that begin with university do more to spread opportunity to disadvantaged student in both expand access and improve outcome our most recent datum show why the gap between disadvantaged student and their peer in progression to university by age be the high on record will not tolerate that shameful divide any long university can and must do more and they must rise to the huge challenge of technological change support adult with the flexibility that they need to retrain that be why we confirm in the budget that we be press ahead with the lifelong learning entitlement while the uk be home to many world class university it be time that all student in high education in this country feel the benefit it be time to raise the bar far on teaching standard to improve our world lead reputation and drive out poor practice and it be time to ensure that all student get good value for money which if we be honest have not always be the case in the past furthermore university must do more to raise their impact beyond their gate they must do more to drive the growth that this country sorely need by attract talent from around the world join with skills england employer and partner in further education to deliver the skill that people and business need and shape world class research to create good job across the country member across the house will know how important university can be for the area that surround they not just local economy but local community want university to work hard to embed themselves in those local community as civic anchor the beat heart of local life in our town and city not ivory tower far from local concern lie beneath those challenge must be further transformation renew drive for efficiency student and taxpayer support the cost of our university they be right to expect that every penny be spend effectively we will not accept wasteful spending university must rise to the challenge which mean ensure that the pay of their top team be fair and justifiable be determined that our world class high education sector do not merely survive in the year ahead but thrive support student in every corner of our country and at every stage of their life be determined that our university become all that know they can be the scale of our ambition demand new approach root in partnership so look forward to partnering with the sector the office for students and uk research and innovation will work closely with ministers across government in particular the secretary of state for science innovation and technology to deliver reformed and strengthen high education system for our country as today the government look to the future be remind that more than year have pass since the robbins report on high education be present to this house with its famous principle that course of high education should be available for all those who be qualified by ability and attainment to pursue they and who wish to do so that principle drive the expansion of high education over the decade that follow under successive government of both party it be central to the thinking of this government today that be why responsible government must treat university not as political battleground but as public good it be why government member want to see the continued success of our young people and it be why we be determined to ensure the sustainability and success of our high education sector not just in the year ahead but for decade to come commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement the budget last week declare war on business and private sector worker and on farmer as we have just hear it seem that today the secretary of state want to add student to that list not content with push up the cost of live for everyone with an inflationary budget and push down wage with national insurance increase we be now in situation whereby student will suffer from the first inflationary increase in number of year at time when they can least afford it yet again there be no sign of that in the labour manifesto indeed in only the prime minister make scrap university tuition fee centrepiece of his leadership campaign perhaps we should start put sell by date on his statement but it be not just the prime minister in july this year at the time of the king speech the secretary of state say that she have no plan to increase tuition fee and yesterday the chancellor say that there be no need to increase taxis far yet what be happen today apart from hike in the effective tax that graduate have to pay student have not have chance to prepare for that rise they will have fairly expect base on all the statement that have mention that the last thing labour government would do in office be put up tuition fee we have some of the good university in the world here in the uk but we need to do much more to reform the system and make it well and fair for student and university by ensure that course provide student with an economic return help university to harness the growth potential of the innovation that they foster and ensure that student and lecturer be free to express and debate their view we be willing to work with the government on all those thing it be also right that we consider university funding but push up cost for student at short notice in an unreformed system will lead to student up and down the country feel betray how much of the increase will be absorb by the national insurance increase for employee at university do the secretary of state intend to increase fee every year or should student expect this to be the only increase what be the impact of the change on public finance and have the office for budget responsibility be consult why be the change not announce in the budget how much long will it take the average borrower to repay their tuition fee as result of the change and why be labour not up front about the measure in its manifesto in june the title of an article write by the now secretary of state proclaim graduates you will pay less under labour government well it turn out they will pay more more broken promise amid the faux outrage that we just hear from the shadow education secretary do not hear whether she will support the measure she like her party for many month during the election campaign have nothing to say other than do down the ambition and aspiration of young people and their family who want the opportunity to go on to university the conservatives go into the last election determine to ensure that few young people have the chance to go to university that be shameful and it be something that labour will never back young people with talent and ambition and their family want government who recognise it it be little wonder that at the ballot box on july the right hon lady party get clear message it be just shame that in the time since there have be no reflection on why that be the conservatives have learn nothing from their year of failure they duck the tough decision for year make it absolutely clear to the house that do not take any pleasure in this decision it be not one that want to take but be determined to secure the long term financial sustainability of our world lead university she be right to recognise their success they be beacon around the world and that necessitate tough decision decision that she and her colleague in the treasury duck year after year they put conservative peer in to chair what should have be an independent regulator they pick fight with the sector time and again and over the course of year the conservative party never have serious plan to reform the high education sector be determined to bring that reform and in the month to come we will set out further plan to reform efficiency access and participation for our young people to answer the precise question that the right hon lady ask as we lay legislation before the house we will publish an impact assessment alongside it call the chair of the education committee first let put it on the record that be the parent of young person in her first year at university the secretary of state have set out very clearly the case for our university and the justification for her announcement today however as young people who might be apply for university as the announcement be be make might see only the headline what step be she take to ensure that it be communicate effectively so that it do not deter young people from low and middle income background from apply to university in the first place be grateful to my hon friend for her question and look forward to speak with she and her newly constitute select committee about this issue and many other recognise the importance of communicate the message that university should be for all young people who have demonstrate that they have the qualification and talent require this be not an easy decision but as secretary of state need to ensure that we secure the long term financial sustainability of the sector alongside that be absolutely clear with the sector with vice chancellor and other that it must do more to provide well support and to widen access and participation so that more young people especially those from more disadvantaged background have the opportunity to benefit from high education call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for advance sight of her statement it be clear that the current university funding system be break not only be it push many university into financial crisis but the change make by the previous conservative government have leave we with system that be deeply unfair in how it treat student it simply can not be right to raise fee without take step to substantially reform the system to make it fair by abolish maintenance grant for disadvantaged student in the conservatives put up barrier between disadvantaged student and high education the liberal democrats oppose that abolition at the time and we have consistently campaign to restore those grant ever since the previous government also cut the repayment threshold to so today student have to repay hundred of pound more per year than old graduate on the same salary perhaps bad of all they lengthen the repayment period from year to year for those start course from august onwards so today student will still be pay back their loan in do the secretary of state accept that the first priority must be to fully reform the system fix the damage that those change make and create system that be fair for all student that rather than simply put up fee without those much wide reform have to be the good way forward the crisis in funding for university must be address but have the government consider how to support university without raise fee do the secretary of state agree that an important first step would be to recognise the benefit of international student and give university stability in that area of policy do she also agree that any reform must examine how university currently spend their allocation of per student per year so that that money be spend as efficiently as possible thank the hon gentleman for his question gently observe that although it might have be slightly before his time in this house his party have get bit of form on this topic but will address his question in the spirit in which he ask they appreciate the constructive approach that he have take as part of the reform that we want to deliver for our young people and our sector the hon gentleman question about make sure that young people be support to succeed be important one since become secretary of state have also be very clear that our international student play crucial role not just in our community and our country but in the contribution they make to our local economy see that myself as constituency mp as we take forward our programme of reform work with the sector and other will of course be happy to discuss that far with the hon gentleman the last government nearly bankrupt number of university indeed one of the two excellent university in my constituency have to go through significant redundancy programme to stay afloat however recognise the challenge that student in my constituency be face not least because of the high cost of living as part of my right hon friend reform will she also look at the cost of housing student so that they can pay their way when they be study my hon friend make an important point and we will absolutely take that into consideration it be important that we look at student accommodation which be big challenge in many university town include in her constituency believe the sector should be do more to address issue around student accommodation work with local council we will be set clear expectation of how that should work in future the secretary of state mention have pause the higher education freedom of speech act do she accept that give that the act get royal assent in may it remain the law of the land until repeal by this parliament how long do she expect that pause to continue be grateful to the right hon gentleman he be correct in the question he ask what would say about the commencement of the provision and the wide long term future of the act be this believe it be important that our university be place of robust challenge and disagreement and that student should be expose to range of view some of which they may not agree with however alongside that it be important that regulation be workable that be why we be take our time to make sure that we get this right listen to range of voice across the sector who hold differ view that work be under way we will make sure that we act have listen to those view and that will be at the heart of further step we take in this area would not be stand here today be it not for the incredible opportunity of university education be the first in my family to attend and spend the next year as high education lecturer watch culture war break out and the financial system become increasingly broken do the secretary of state agree that we now have an opportunity to restore university as machine of opportunity and economic growth agree with my hon friend who recognise both in his professional life before come to this house and as constituency mp the crucial role that our university play in town and city as well as by provide opportunity for lot of young people alongside that one area where we need to make more progress and in which know that my hon friend have real interest be care experience young people and their opportunity at university there be lot more that the sector must do to support young people come through the care system who want the chance to go on to university to ensure that the additional barrier they face be overcome and would expect it to be do more do the secretary of state accept that it might have be well to hold wide review of the whole system it be break we know that instead of jump immediately to put up tuition fee she say that we all respect and want to protect our world beat university but how do she square that with her government remove the funding for the exascale computer at edinburgh university which would have maintain not only its position but our whole university sector position what be announce today be very much in line with the approach that we take at this budget one year settlement that allow we to fix the foundation give the need to bring financial sustainability to the sector because we recognise the acute financial pressure that many university be face after year of fall income from fee that be not an easy decision but it can not be the entirety of what we do be determined to reform the sector will happily work with the hon member party to look at idea for how we do that but she will know as well as do that the record on progression to university for young people from more disadvantaged background in scotland be not strong one commend my right hon friend for make such bold and difficult decision here when so many of her predecessor shy away from it put the sector on sound financial footing be crucial but also welcome the move on maintenance support can she assure that when she talk about increase efficiency in the sector she be talk not about vice chancellor balance staff and workload but about address the overspend in some capital project that might be view as particularly wasteful so that good money do not follow bad my hon friend have long champion our fantastic university he be right to draw attention to the need for further efficiency but he be also right to identify that efficiency do not mean make staff do more with less or indeed with few staff they do mean reel in needless or excessive spend and waste and he be right to highlight that ten million pensioner almost million worker who the institute for fiscal studies say will now see low wage because of national insurance rise ten of thousand of farmer hundred of thousand of small business see business rate rise and today million of student be there anyone that this government tell before the general election do worry who they have not since shaft remain slightly bewilder by the right hon gentleman approach he have clearly learn nothing from the election campaign we have just be through and clearly be not listen when he hear time and again about the billion black hole his party leave behind and the difficult decision it duck year after year that be the conservatives record and he should reflect on it through year career in the high education sector and now as chair of the all party parliamentary university group two thing have become abundantly clear to first the conservative party leave the sector in utterly dire strait when it leave office and secondly today measure be absolutely necessary for our university to avoid bankruptcy what step be the secretary of state take with university student and campus union to develop new financial model one that deliver excellence and value for student and stability and security for university staff and management my hon friend bring real expertise on these matter to the house while the government ensure that we play our part in secure financial sustainability have be clear with the sector that it too must do more that involve play an expand role in drive economic growth include in town and city across the country the sector ought to be consider how it can do more include work with further education provider to look at different way of deliver provision especially for adult learner who often need different approach in order to upskill retrain and take on new opportunity have see some great example of that and some fantastic practice around the country but there be more that the sector should be do welcome the secretary of state announcement on increase maintenance loan and what that will do for equality of opportunity agree with she that the last government do not properly value the contribution of international student for more than year the much high fee charge to international student have cross subsidise british student to say nothing of what international student do for british soft power will the government remove international student from the net migration figure so that that cross subsidy can continue agree with the hon gentleman on the important contribution that international student make to our country and the reach they give we around the world through soft power influence and the business and trading link that they grow and develop but be afraid can not give he the answer he seek on his wide question keele university and the university of staffordshire two of the wonderful university around my constituency have be warn for long time of the dire financial circumstance they face we often forget that they be also major employer in my constituency so welcome the announcement of this financial support if nothing else to protect job in those institution that currently face desperate budget round share the secretary of state ambition to widen participation in my patch uni connect higher horizons scheme be do lot of work to help disadvantaged student to access high education what be her department do to ensure that that funding be in place so that more young people from place such as stoke on trent can have high education experience my hon friend be right to raise those issue and to highlight the important contribution that university make to employment opportunity and not just for academic and other engage in research and teaching but for wide range of job right across the board from security staff to hospitality staff and library staff there be many job across high education that play crucial role the department be look at how we can work with the sector to deliver an expansion in the civic role of our university it be important that they do more when it come to economic growth but also to widen participation because it be shameful that too few young people from disadvantaged background have the opportunity to go to university welcome the secretary of state announcement that university must be home to robust discussion and rigorous challenge that be very welcome but she must be aware that many student be put off go to university by the already very high fee there be no proposal in her statement to reform university finance there be only proposal to charge student more will that not drive more people away from university education rather than to it university should not be dependent just on student income to survive should we not be move in the direction of lower fee or indeed remove they altogether in order to make high and further education genuinely open to all in our society agree that there be more that university can do to ensure that they have wide source of income that include great work around economic growth around spin off and much more besides will be work with my right hon friend the secretary of state for science innovation and technology on precisely those question the reality be that it be necessary to bring forward this increase next year to stabilise the sector it be difficult decision but necessary one because it be no good encourage young people to go to university if their institution continue to be in financial peril thank the secretary of state for her statement fully understand that something need to be do tuition fee be introduce just before go to university it never sit well with that member of this house go to university free of charge or with grant too and then seemingly pull the drawbridge up behind they be pleased that the secretary of state mention disadvantaged student and her plan to conduct an equality impact assessment but we know that university application have be slowly decline have she any plan to review her action if the equality impact assessment show that there be issue for disadvantaged student we will be set out further plan in the come month around the wide reform that we intend to bring to the sector recognise my hon friend genuine concern about make sure that talented young people who want to expand their mind and benefit from university have the chance to do so there be much more that the sector can and must do to improve outcome for disadvantaged student include around progression sadly it be not just that few disadvantaged young people be think about university but that the progression rate in term of completion be just not good enough more need to happen on that front too university work in collaboration with fe sector institution such as petroc college in my constituency government funding for the fe sector have fall significantly in real term over the past decade lead to fall teacher pay what be the plan to fund the fe sector so that it can remain viable and accessible option particularly in rural area such as mine for people to access university course the hon gentleman raise important point not just about the state of our further education sector but about the important collaboration between further education and high education provider include in community where travel time might be long and about ensure that access to education be available to much wide range of people have see some really great work go on across the country but there be more that the government can encourage high institution to do the government inherit real mess in further education sector that have be ignore for so many year we be determined to put that right that be why in this budget we invest million into further education alongside million capital allocation for the first time in number of year to ensure that we be invest in our further education college which be crucial part of our town and city we have thousand of international student at the university of hertfordshire in hatfield they be most welcome and they make great contribution however when the conservative party be in power the independent office for students conclude that the entire high education model be reliant on international fee income do my right hon friend agree that that be completely unsustainable model another example of the conservative party ignore problem and leave it to we to rescue and reform our high education sector international student play an important role in our community and make an important contribution to our economy but my hon friend be right to draw attention to the fact that there can sometimes be pressure know that can be especially acute where expansion happen and the right level of accommodation do not follow we will be set clear expectation of the sector that it have to work with local council to ensure the availability of high quality accommodation alongside that as government we be legislate to make sure there be high standard in the private rent sector through the renters reform bill because too many student be expect to live in substandard private rent accommodation put on record that be the parent of three student two undergrad and one postgrad who be all pay their fee do the secretary of state agree that course offer just eight hour week of contact time do not represent good value for money will she ensure that that element be fully evaluate in the reform that be come will she advise the sector that if student be get only eight hour of contact time which be effectively part time course they do not need to charge the full fee we be work closely with the office for students on the area that the hon lady identifie she be right that we need to do more on quality particularly teach quality and we will be discuss that far in the month to come would be more than happy to discuss that issue with she and her party university be critical for student of course but also for economic growth town and city regeneration and much more reform and accountability be also important will the secretary of state outline in bit more detail the accountability to which she will hold these university vice chancellor on teach contact time help vulnerable student and ensure that university play huge part in the wide community of the town and city in which they be anchor institution one of the first action take as secretary of state be to refocus the work of the office for student on precisely those area that my hon friend identifie because it be important that we ensure that the student experience at university be strong and that student have the opportunity to take part in wide range of activity be also acutely aware of the financial pressure that many student be experience and that be why we have take the decision to increase maintenance loan at the rate of inflation have set out five priority today for reform of the high education sector we will expect high education provider to play strong role in expand access and improve outcome especially for disadvantaged student such institution should make strong contribution to their community and to economic growth it be not that many year ago that be at who would have think it just before the secretary of state take to her foot check my student loan balance and it be just over for many student at university the elimination of maintenance grant be devastating and the reintroduction of maintenance grant will mean that live cost be not barrier to university for those disadvantaged student will the secretary of state confirm the reintroduction of maintenance grant so that no young people be put off university for fear of the cost can tell the hon gentleman that we will look at this issue as part of wide reform but he will appreciate that after year of conservative failure when it come to our university there be no easy option this be difficult decision and difficult choice but can give he the assurance that want to ensure that university remain an attractive option for all young people who want the chance to learn to expand their mind and to take all the opportunity that come from university education welcome my right hon friend leadership not just on the funding but on the reform that the sector need the previous government approach to regulation put ideology over evidence and one example of that be in the role of the designate quality body it be there to check on quality and standard in high education but it have to give up that role because the regulatory climate that the previous government bring in be non compliant with international standard can the secretary of state assure the house that the regulatory approach that she will take will be different from that of the previous government and ensure that our high education sector continue to be world leading my hon friend bring real experience on these matter to the house he will know it be important that the independent regulator retain the autonomy to act but we will work with it closely on quality student outcome and much more besides as he will know under the last conservative government that regulator be increasingly fixate on political matter and political whim and do not have enough focus on teach quality and student outcome under its new interim chair sir david behan it have change that approach and be focus on ensure not only that our university be sustainable but that they deliver well outcome for student thank the secretary of state for her statement with fee to increase how can we expect student to stay and work within the united kingdom when the field be much green on other shore and it be much cheap to live there as well may make plea about the retention of student and junior doctor have repeatedly ask for bursary or forgiveness of debt against job commitment of perhaps three or four year will she consider that if enact that would mean more student and junior doctor stay which have to be good be grateful to the hon gentleman for many young people the chance to go to university be long term investment in their future prospect which offer not just the chance to study and to learn but the chance to take on new career in the way he describe particularly in our health service of course this matter overlap with the department of health and social care and he can be assure that we keep these matter under review draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests any country that be serious about grow its economy should also be serious about support its university sector in that context welcome the promise that review will be publish soon hope that it will take lesson from scotland where while undergraduate education be free university be grossly underfunde to deliver it the announcement will only widen the gap between scotland and england in that regard also welcome the confirmation that we need our university to be able to attract talent from around the world both the higher education policy institute and my union the university and college union have say that the previous government put block in place to that happen will the secretary of state engage with the sector to ensure that we have the right environment to attract the good student and the good staff to uk university and that the very good international graduate can work here at the point of graduation be grateful to my hon friend who raise number of important point in addition to those he make about the record in scotland he will know well than most of we the shameful record of the snp government when it come to opportunity for university study for our more disadvantaged student the share of first time university entrant from scotland most deprive area fall for the second consecutive year he will also know that the snp government in scotland also cut mental health provision for scottish student would like to put on the record that my husband work for university welcome the announcement that the government plan to reform and strengthen high education go from northern comprehensive school to university and agree it be vital that we expand access so that student from all background can go to university recently meet the vice chancellor of bradford university which have high proportion of student draw from the city but many student fail to progress due to the lack of high quality graduate job invite the secretary of state to come to bradford perhaps meet other bradford mp and see the civic contribution that the university make hopefully we will see more of that from other university in the future would be delighted to visit and meet my hon friend and other colleague in neighbouring constituency to discuss the approach that have be take there she make the wide point that our high education sector be diverse and include range of provider who offer different kind of opportunity training and study for different set of student of course young people be often the focus of our attention in these discussion but the chance to go to university later on in life be also crucial with the opportunity to retrain to upskill and to make change of career many of our new university have drive so much of the excellent work that have see in expand opportunity for adult to go back into education before be elect to this place be university lecturer and researcher work hard to expand access to education for all agree with the secretary of state that university need to do more to ensure that no matter people background they have the opportunity to access university education and the social mobility that come with that do she agree that such opportunity be fantastic route for social mobility whether student choose to study science degree social science degree or one of the fantastic art and humanity degree agree my hon friend will recognise that over many year we hear the conservatives do down young people ambition to go on and study like he will have hear dismissive talk which will not repeat about type of degree and the kind of study that our young people be engage in it be essential for modern economy that people have the chance to study science and technology and much more aside but also subject like art and music not just because they be good in and of themselves but because increasingly they be key part of drive economic growth in our country the dire state of the finance of high education institution such as the university of east anglia be likely to be improve by this announcement but can the secretary of state assure staff and student that mechanism be in place to ensure that increase income from fee translate into few job loss and help encourage more student from low income background into university that be my expectation excessive and wasteful spend in university need to be rein in there must be much great push for efficiency as government we have make the difficult decision to increase fee to provide sustainability for the sector now the sector must play its part have falmouth university in my constituency which be world lead art university unlike the conservatives this government have commit to restore the art as large part of the economy in this country could the secretary of state confirm that art degree will be an important part of the economy in future and will be support by this government go to university be often long term investment in someone earn potential and career opportunity but the chance to study be also good in and of itself that mean that we must value and respect wide range of course and opportunity include subject like music art and much more besides although many well pay great career also result from study such subject when be student at morley high school the university of leeds reach out to and student like to ensure that we consider place at the institution despite the fee at the time do the secretary of state agree that whatever the fee it be crucial that these university expand access to working class student to truly break down the barrier to opportunity agree very strongly it be crucial that our university sector do more to open up opportunity include to working class young people and those who do not have family history of go to university the experience that my hon friend describe be very much my experience too not just the encouragement that receive from my teacher but the opportunity to visit university and see what be available although often there be individual good practice of the type he describe university should do more particularly within their region to collaborate to avoid duplication ensure that they be serve their community and draw on the wide range of talent available they must make sure that university be an attractive option for young people who otherwise might not consider go to high education roadworks regulation motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the regulation of roadwork and for connected purpose introduce very similar ten minute rule bill in the previous parliamentary session which unfortunately run out of time however under the heading of the can the cones campaign be now seek to reintroduce similar legislation to help tackle the issue of overrun roadwork head on one of the great frustration of modern life be queue for age in line of traffic inch forwards to get through set of contraflow traffic light at the scene of some roadwork only to then finally crawl past large hole in the ground heavily con off with absolutely no one work on the site accord to datum highlight by the echo newspaper recent freedom of information request show that during the financial year there be over street and roadwork in my county of essex make it the most dig up county in britain but this be by no mean an issue confine to essex last week we have debate in westminster hall on this same subject ably secure by my hon friend the member for broxbourne lewis cocking who be pleased to say be one of the sponsor of my bill which also have cross party support last week debate be reply to by the roads minister the under secretary of state for transport the hon member for nottingham south lilian greenwood be pleased to note that she be in her place on the front bench listen today as she promise she would be thank the minister for her courtesy roadwork can take place for variety of reason sometimes utility company be carry out repair or maintenance broadband provider lay new fibre or property developer connect new estate to the grid in many case however the common denominator be lack of any palpable sense of urgency whatever to get the job do regardless of the inconvenience cause to the travel public as constituency mp have receive grow tide of complaint about the spiral frequency of roadwork in recent year with the gas utility company cadent be by far the bad serial offender last year in one of my village hockley perfect storm of the above three thing occur and lead to so many concurrent roadwork that the exasperated villager lead by very proactive local councillor adrian eve resort to nickname their village blockley give all that the bill essentially have three key aim first it would give local highway authority such as essex county council much strong power to control the granting of permit to anyone who want to dig up the highway network this be critical weakness in the current arrangement currently highway authority can only really refuse to grant permit on safety ground if those apply for one deem the work to be an emergency the authority ability to refuse be weak still and be sad to report that people sometimes attempt to game the system the bill would allow refusal on the ground of cause unacceptable disruption and would materially strengthen the hand of council to negotiate much tight condition include strict deadline when grant permit so that company would hopefully be prevent from overrun in the first place secondly the bill would mandate highway authority to take all practicable step to deconflict roadwork in their area to prevent multiple work in the same neighbourhood from lead to near gridlock especially during peak period under section of the new roads and street works act local authority be require to co ordinate roadwork to minimise disruption to road user it state that street authority shall use their good endeavour to co ordinate the execution of work of all kind nevertheless few year ago we have near chaos in my home town of rayleigh when several set of roadwork on the main artery in and out of the town be allow to proceed at almost exactly the same time when we subsequently look into why it turn out that the official at county hall who hand out the permit to developer do not communicate with the one who give they to utility company in short the left hand do not know what the right hand be do which lead to utter confusion and some very frustrated constituent the bill seek to rectify that ensure far more join up approach by impose much strict procedure on highway authority that give out the permit it also seek to prevent the same stretch of road from be dig up multiple time in short succession by different company thirdly the bill would materially increase the fine for roadwork that do overrun at present under section of the act local highway authority have the power to fine utility company for unreasonably prolong occupation of the highway the fine to be levy be set out in the snappily entitle street works charge for unreasonably prolonged occupation of the highway england amendment regulations with which be sure the whole house be familiar and which provide for maximum charge in respect of sensitive street of day for the first three day of overrun and day thereafter however for street that fall outside that tightly define category the fine fall away dramatically crucially they have not be update or adjust for inflation since and be hardly likely to be deterrent to major utility company or housing developer some of whom just accept they on the rare occasion on which they be actually levy as cost of do business the bill would significantly increase the penalty for overrun beyond the schedule agree when the permit be first grant persistent offender could be fin up to of their annual corporate turnover which should make even the most high handed company sit up and listen another related solution be lane to be confuse with road company must pay per day to carry out roadwork that give they clear financial incentive to be efficient but at present it apply to only very limited number of select road may suggest to the minister that perhaps there be scope for this solution to be much more widely apply see that she be nod as an experienced constituency mp know that it be rare thing for ten minute rule bill to make it on to the statute book nevertheless hope that the government may yet be minded to grant it time to assist its passage fail that should be very grateful for meeting with the roads minister so that we can seek at last to can the cones either through legislation or at the very least by strengthen government guidance to highway authority to achieve the same effect short of primary legislation itself no one really like roadwork they be sometimes necessary evil of modern life nevertheless the spirit of this bill be to try to ensure that where they be really necessary we expedite they as quickly as practicable with as little disruption as possible promise my constituent when seek re election that if they return to parliament would seek to reintroduce my roadworks regulation bill and be keep my word to they today this be not partisan issue it be something on which hope all member of parliament and even more important their constituent can agree so let we collectively can the cones and keep the traffic flow as much as we practically can commend the bill to the house question put and agree to order that mr mark francois mr richard holden greg smith mrs emma lewell buck sir desmond swayne andrew rosindell sir john whittingdale lewis cocking sir bernard jenkin andrew griffith sir roger gale and jim shannon present the bill mr mark francois accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday july and to be print bill budget resolutions income tax charge debate resume order october question again propose that income tax be charge for the tax year and it be declare that it be expedient in the public interest that this resolution should have statutory effect under the provision of the provisional collection of taxes act the first labour budget in year the first ever budget deliver by woman chancellor show the difference that this labour government be already make we be fix the foundation of the public finance to bring the stability that our economy need put more money into people pocket after the bad parliament for living standard on record begin to turn the corner on our vital public service with more appointment in the nhs and more teacher in our school and make the long term investment in infrastructure and skill that our country need in order to grow our economy and seize the job and opportunity of the future in the department for work and pensions the message from this budget be clear we will tackle the unacceptable level of fraud that we have inherit because every pound of taxpayer money must be wisely spend and go to those who need help the most we will drive up opportunity in every corner of the country with our plan to get britain work because this labour government believe that work be the key to build well life and to grow our economy we have make start on drive down poverty too because unlike conservative members we know that child can not fulfil their potential without food in their belly and roof over their head and our country can not fulfil its potential when the talent of so many bright child and young people be be deny get grip on the public finance be the first step in deliver all these change without strong foundation we can not deliver thriving economy decent public service or sustainable increase in living standard for family and pensioner we do not choose to inherit the mess that we find in the public finance and our public service but we have choose to level with the public about the scale of the challenge and how we intend to deal with they conservative members have still not face up to their responsibility for the state in which they leave the country there be billion black hole in the public finance this year with billion of pound overspent on fail asylum hotel system new hospital road and train station be announce without the money to pay for they vital compensation scheme for infected blood and the horizon scandal be set up without the fund to deliver they the country reserve be spend three time over that be before we even get to the state of our public service million of patient have be leave wait for nhs treatment often in agony and pain victim have be leave waiting month or even year for justice in our court our prison be overflow and our school literally crumble as my right hon friend the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster have say this could have be budget where we look at the state of the country but duck the difficult decision we could have try to kid the voter paper over the crack and then hope that something well somehow come along but we choose not to do that because that be precisely the approach that get we into this mess in the first place and because in politic as in life you do not deal with problem by ignore it duck it or pander to it you deal with problem by face they head on we have choose to get the public finance back on track to protect the payslip of work people to start turn the corner on our public service and to invest in the long term infrastructure our country need in order to deliver that we have make tax change which be never easy to do and ask some business and wealthy people to pay some more hand in hand with this balanced approach however the chancellor have set out tough new productivity efficiency and saving target of this year for every single department under this labour government investment in our public service will always go hand in hand with reform because we can not keep spend taxpayer money on the same problem without change the way we tackle they and because public expectation and development in ai and new technology be transform the way people interact in many aspect of their life and the public sector must respond to those change too the need for reform in our system of employment support and social security be urgent and it be real want to spell out clearly and honestly for the house the fact of the previous government legacy of failure some billion of taxpayer money have be lose to fraud and error since the pandemic now stand at billion year our employment rate be still not back to pre pandemic level make we unique in the group of wealthy country and not in good way we have near record level of people trap out of work due to long term sickness staggering million people with rate far higher in some part of the country such as the midland and the north and more household be predict to claim universal credit health benefit over the next five year increase from third to half of all universal credit claim that be the legacy of the conservatives one in eight of all our young people be not in education employment or training with all the terrible long term consequence we know that bring it be not just the economic cost of this failure that be unacceptable with predict billion increase in sickness and disability benefit over the next five year above all there be the human cost to individual and community when million of people be deny the opportunity to work and earn decent standard of living to make connection to get skill and to build chance for well life with all the benefit that that bring we do not accept that as the future for our country or our fellow citizen instead we choose different path it start with our determination to deliver value for money for every pound of taxpayer money so we will bring forward new plan to drive down fraud and error in the welfare system our new fraud error and debt bill will update the department for work and pensions power for the first time in year so that we can keep up with the new way that fraudster include organised criminal gang be use to take public money and so that our power be bring into line with other public body such as his majesty revenue and customs we will use technology to alert we to people try to scam the system and to prevent error from happen in the first place we will recruit more staff to crack down on fraudster with focus on serious case review and we will bring in new power to recover debt all with independent oversight and guarantee that human being will always take the final decision in any fraud case to give everyone confidence in the system something that the conservatives utterly fail to do many of we understand the need to have more focused fraud law and that be very important but every other week people represent come along to and say that they have be overpay for their employment and support allowance their personal independence payment or their disability living allowance they find themselves in an incredibly difficult position not because they be try to defraud or take money away from anyone it be just simple issue of their get it wrong what will be do to protect those people this be really important we be go to have new fraud law but let we make sure that we protect the innocent people who make mistake absolutely agree with the hon gentleman the technology we will put in place will be precisely so that we drive down not only fraud but error in the system he will know for example that we be trialle new system for carer in which we text they if they be about to go over their allowance so that we do not have the scandalous overpayment that cause such problem under the previous government the second major reform that we will bring in be our plan to get britain work again our white paper which will be publish in the come week will bring forward the big reform to employment support in generation back by an additional million of investment this will help we meet our ambition to achieve an employment rate and to turn what be in reality department for welfare into genuine department for work first we will create new job and career service overhaul our jobcentre so that they no long focus predominantly on monitor and assess benefit but be genuine employment service work with employer college public service and local leader to help people to get work and get on in work secondly we will devolve power to mayors and local area to join up the fragmented patchwork system of employment skill and crucially health support to drive down economic inactivity and drive up employment boost job and growth in every corner of the country because the man or even woman in whitehall do not know what be good in leicester liverpool or leeds last but by no mean least we will bring forward our new youth guarantee so that every young person be earn or learn no ifs no but because we do not accept have generation of young people without the skill or job they need to succeed and we will never write off young people before they have even begin our determination to help people get work and keep work do not stop there know only too well from my constituent and my friend how often woman in their and beyond be now care for elderly and disabled relative but want to work at the same time be proud that we be give family carer the big ever boost to the amount they can earn while still receive carer allowance that will allow they to increase their hour to the equivalent of hour at the national living wage so that they can balance work and family life this come on top of the independent review into the scandalous overpayment of carer allowance that have already announce lead by the former chief executive of disability rights uk liz sayce to ensure that we learn the lesson from what happen so that it never happen again as lifelong champion of family carer be proud that we have make that announcement our plan to get britain work be crucial to drive up opportunity and drive down poverty key priority of this labour government the fact that over million child be now grow up poor with more than live in household force to rely on food bank be stain on our society my right hon friend the education secretary and have already set out the framework for our bold ambitious cross government strategy to tackle child poverty we will publish the result in the spring but we will not wait to act particularly for those face the deep poverty we have extend the household support fund and discretionary housing payment with an additional billion this year so that local authority can help family and pensioner who face the great hardship furthermore we have introduce our new fair repayment rate to cap the level of debt repayment that can be take from universal credit put an average of year into the pocket of million of the poor household which will lift thousand of child and family out of poverty when be chair of feeding leicester food bank tell that debt drive by universal credit deduction be one of the big reason why people have to use food bank which be why know this be such an important change we be also substantially increase the income of pensioner who have work hard all their life and who deserve security in retirement our commitment to the pension triple lock throughout this parliament mean that spending on the state pension be forecast to rise by over billion this include more than rise in the new state pension from next april unlike the previous government who leave over pensioner miss out on the pension credit to which they be entitle we be deliver the big ever drive to increase uptake for the first time we be contact people on housing benefit who may be eligible for pension credit and to guarantee even great uptake we will merge pension credit and housing benefit for new claimant from the conservatives first promise this in but they never deliver that be the difference labour government make there be still much more to do but this budget start to turn the corner fix the foundation of our economy and public service drive up opportunity and drive down poverty in every corner of the land we be honest about the challenge we face and optimistic about the opportunity ahead this be real plan for real change commend this budget to the house call the opposition spokesperson the labour party pledge at the last election to usher in new form of politic base on transparency and integrity when press labour members rule out large number of tax rise one of these taxis as the labour manifesto explicitly state be national insurance we will not increase national insurance yet only few short week later what have happen in this budget employer national insurance contribution have be raise which be direct breach of the labour manifesto do not take my word for it paul johnson the head of the institute for fiscal studies have say exactly the same of course despite be at the scene of the crime the government have since hide behind their alibi that somehow put up employer national insurance contribution will have no impact on work people but that be simply untrue will the right hon gentleman give way will my right hon friend give way my right hon friend be sensible man to give way to and will do so in moment the chief secretary to the treasury recently admit on sky that put up national insurance for employer will directly impact work people of course it will the office for budget responsibility lay out in black and white that the consequence will be over few job with about of the cost of this increase in taxation ultimately be bear by those who work through low wage be these not work people the secretary of state mention her youth guarantee and the importance of youth simply observe that youth unemployment fall by over under the previous government whereas it rise by over under the last labour government that be how successful the labour party be of course because both the rate and the threshold have be increase the national insurance increase will disproportionately impact those on low wage include the young worker warmly congratulate the new shadow chancellor on his appointment it be richly deserve give his tremendous work as secretary of state for work and pensions in get people back to work in open this debate the secretary of state say that she be only attack wealthy people my right hon friend the member for central devon mel stride be talk about work people so will he emphasise that our party stand four square behind work farmer these people with only acre just want to pass on their business to their son but they be be cruelly attack by this government my right hon friend be right that this be another broken promise at the general election the now secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs give an unequivocal guarantee to farmer across the country that there be no question of farm be bring into inheritance tax there be good reason for the exemption and relief because if inheritance tax be levy on family farm that be pass down to another generation those farm will have to be break up with part sell off to pay the tax be glad that my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh mention this because the obr have say that by this measure will raise the princely sum of million which be enough to run the national health service for just one day have more modest sum ever raise so much misery think not the chancellor assure we that she will not fiddle the figure by change the fiscal target yet we have see the fiscal target change to allow this government to borrow an additional billion this be not good time for the secretary of state to talk about pensioner but she mention they at the end of her speech they be so badly let down by the means testing of the winter fuel payment and they be not tell in advance to expect anything like it ten million pensioner across the country will lose up to as consequence of this measure the government claim that only the wealthy only the millionaire will be affect but two third of pensioner below the poverty line will have this benefit remove be grateful to the new shadow chancellor for give way could be wrong but be he not the secretary of state who take through the legislation to suspend the triple lock the one and only time it have be suspend which have since cost pensioner year every year we fight for the triple lock plus in our manifesto which would have spar million of pensioner from be drag into income tax many for the first time under this government arrangement there be as the hon gentleman know particular circumstance in october include inflation surge above what be the broad effect of this budget the tax burden will rise to the high level in the history of our country high than in when we first start to collect the datum we will be borrow staggering billion over the next five year what be the consequence of that apart from pass on debt to future generation who will have to pay it by way of high taxation in the future it be the crowding out of private business investment which this government say they be eager to drive up if we look at obr forecast from the spring budget last year and for inflation in every year under this budget it be high in every single year why because there have be huge fiscal splurge particularly in the first two year of the forecast that will require monetary response so interest rate will stay high for long that will mean the obr estimate an extra on mortgage or over extra for the average family up and down the country accord to the obr forecast wage will stagnate across the period with low real household disposable income than under the spring forecast when the conservative party be in government be surprised that the secretary of state raise the subject of living standard the joseph rowntree foundation estimate the average family will be bad off in real term by october compare with today be also surprised that she raise the issue of poverty when we be in government we face so many lecture from labour members while we be bring poverty down the number of pensioner in absolute poverty fall by what about child the number of child in poverty fall by in total will come to the record of this government in moment but first give way to the secretary of state figure from the department that the right hon gentleman use to be responsible for show clearly that more child now live in relative poverty after housing cost do he accept that yes or no as the right hon lady know full well it be accept that the key measure be absolute poverty after housing cost she can not flit between one measure and another when it suit she the reality be that it be project that more child and more adult will be in poverty as consequence of the budget on that point will the right hon gentleman give way how can finally resist the hon gentleman who be just itch to make some point about integrity the floor be his the shadow chancellor raise the issue of integrity and he talk about poverty many disabled people live in poverty when he be secretary of state for work and pensions he tell the house that there would be no investigation into the department for work and pensions for unlawful treatment of disabled people do he owe this house or do he owe disabled people an apology stand by our record when be secretary of state for work and pensions particularly on the support that the department give to the disabled not least the result that we achieve in encourage and help they into work which be the well possible outcome when there have be such perpetration of deceit there must be the alibi the smokescreen which be of course the fictitious confected black hole of billion labour members rub their hand in glee when the obr say it would be look into the matter it report back on the day of the budget and what do it find it find that it be not able to legitimise that black hole of billion and come up with figure for in year fiscal pressure that be below half that it observe that if it have be focus on that figure at the time of the spring budget conversation would have be hold and it be conceivable that the number would have be small still from our experience in government we know that it be quite normal practice to manage in year fiscal pressure and to net off the underspend against the overspend in reality this black hole be dead parrot it have cease to be if it be not nail to its perch it would be push up the daisy far from be just shag out after prolonged squark madam deputy speaker it be dead the black hole be an ex parrot be grateful to the shadow chancellor for give way base on his performance everyone on the government benches heartily welcome his promotion do he accept that the obr say in the letter he mention that its forecast would have be materially different have just explain exactly what the obr say it say that it do not legitimise the black hole the billion which have be repeat yet again from the government front bench opportunity be miss in this budget not least around drive up productivity we know that labour government spend money we know that labour government tax people lot that be what they do what they do not do be spend the money with any string attach there have be pay rise for train driver and for junior doctor but not one suggestion that there might be improvement in productivity to accompany that spending that be unlike the conservative party when we be in office under my right hon friend the member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt we have very clear fully fund plan for the national health service and long term workforce plan to drive up productivity let come to the issue of welfare it be gratify to hear the secretary of state confirm that the labour party be go ahead with some of the more important reform that we bring forward such as that to the work capability assessment indicate dissent the minister for employment shake her head but my understanding be that while the government may say they will make some change they be quite happy to take the saving that be bake into the obr forecast the secretary of state be right to clamp down on fraud but it be important that she do not misrepresent the fact that the approach she be take be exactly the same as the approach we be bring forward to do that the reality be that some dwp budget be grow to an extent that they need to be arrest in order for we to have successful economy if we be able to hold the number of people of work age with health or disability component to their benefit at the level it be now for the next five year there would be saving of about billion if we be able to get it back to where it be before the pandemic over billion would be save when the conservative party be in government we have clear plan to begin to address that issue we have hear nothing from the government about how they will tackle that fundamental fact what we have have from the government on welfare expenditure be the announcement that the welfare cap will be set at the end of the scorecard period at above the obr forecast for spend on those benefit that be not restraint that be permission an invitation to spend ever more on welfare without hit the cap the government have no plan and the taxpayer will continue to pay for it so what do we have to show for this budget compare with the spring low growth low living standard low wage high taxis high borrowing and increase interest rate and mortgage this be budget of broken promise and when the dust have finally settle and this lot have go as we step over the fallen the former farmer the pensioner the one time businesspeople the poor and the vulnerable there we will find the shattered remain of the work people of this country betray by party that lie to they and they will never forget it rise order member can observe how many people want to speak in the debate so follow the completion of all front bench speech will impose an immediate six minute time limit to start with call gill furniss back in july britain vote to turn the corner on year of failure at the hand of the conservative party year of unfunded tax cut for the wealthy year of austerity that leave work people to pick up the bill and year of our public service crumble this budget be breath of fresh air that deliver on what people vote for with billion to

go on to university and high quality job thriving fe sector be also vital to meet the challenge of the future decarbonisation and new technology like ai be already revolutionise our workforce and the cbi have find that nine in people will need to reskill in this decade alone we be in the midst of skill shortage with business struggle to fill highly skilled position and instead recruit from abroad these be no long the skill of the future but the skill of today and we already have the infrastructure ready to go to meet the challenge with hundred of college fill with thousand of expert teach countless subject my constituency be home to two exemplary fe institution the sheffield college and longley park sixth form pay tribute to all their staff who go above and beyond to give student the

meet the skill need of employer accelerate our green skill strategy and support growth in the local and regional economy the success of the sector be all the more impressive when we consider the funding challenge it have endure on the last government watch spend per college student fall by in real term but this government have show that they understand their value and be so pleased to see in the budget the commitment of an extra million for further education this government be fill with expertise in further education be delighted to see baroness smith of malvern appoint as minister for skills her wealth of knowledge and experience mean that she will be strong voice for the value of further education in the skill agenda also welcome the step that the government be take to deliver on our manifesto commitment to create flexible growth and skill levy the investment of million will help to ensure that apprenticeship with decent employment at the end be available for people of all skillset employer have long call for reform of the apprenticeship levy which many have find to be inflexible and unfit for purpose we need new system that work for employer and worker alike and which

between employer the workforce and further education all work together to build workforce that be fit for the future this government steadfast focus be deliver economic growth in every corner of the country something that have be lack in my constituency for far too long look forward to the establishment of skills england to help upskill the workforce nationwide work alongside our fantastic further education sector to succeed call the liberal democrat spokesperson the fact be that the new government have inherit an economic shamble thank to the previous government the office for budget responsibility identify yawning billion gap in the finance that can not be dispute be proud that we have cradle to grave welfare state but there be couple of area that fear the government fail to tackle in the budget failure to tackle the two child cap will leave million child still in need so hope the government will address that as matter of urgency in respect of the winter fuel allowance be still get dozen of email from resident who be unable to claim support because they be just above the threshold and who be worried as the winter start to kick in again hope that the government will come forward with some amelioration to support those who most need it our pensioner in need one area of the budget particularly welcome be the investment in our health service for we liberal democrats our nhs be cornerstone of society and way of improve great britain clearly we would not have go about it in the same way we would have draw down money from big bank and giant tech and the way it be be do will result in some challenge which will come to later in my constituency torbay hospital remain highly challenge because we do not know where we be as far as the government programme for renew hospital be concern only of the hospital be currently fit for purpose and there be almost sewage leak some which have an impact on clinical area and therefore affect the hospital ability to serve our community can not believe that the secretary of state will allow hospital with regular sewage leak impact resident to continue in its current state so look forward to the confirmation of funding for torbay hospital gps be the service that many resident come up against when reach out to our nhs yet the change to national insurance contribution be set to hit they hard they be small business and it seem that they be the canary in the coalmine for number of other small business across the united kingdom in correspondence with they highlight that there could be cut in service and that their plan to grow their service to the community will be seriously affect as colleague have state the elephant in the room the issue that the budget fail to address be social care be concerned that the government have to date fail to deal with social care but we look forward to work with they we want to work across the party to drive proper way forward for social care the expand earning threshold settlement for carer allowance be extremely welcome but the cliff edge need sort as matter of urgency elsewhere in the social care sector have be contact by company such as bay care which give domiciliary support and be worried about the impact of the change to nic on its ability to support people as well as nursing and other residential care service that be on the edge of viability and be also impact by that change over the weekend reach out to probably business across torbay to gauge the impact of the budget on they they be disappoint that business rate have not receive the reform that we liberal democrats have hop for it need root and branch reform tinker with it be not the answer business have see their utility bill treble number of business be struggle with covid debt that remain outstanding manufacturer we do not have many of those in torbay tell that he be fearful that the business top office elsewhere in the world will ask it to consider offshore to taiwan some of the manufacturing that happen in torbay at the moment be particularly interested to hear from business in the hospitality sector which we have lot of in the west of england hotel and be all really concerned that we will see significant reduction in employment and paignton zoo tell that the national insurance threshold be lower to will hit they hard fear that these national insurance proposal

help on my way be determined to repay that debt it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for huddersfield harpreet uppal who make heartfelt and move maiden speech she will clearly be doughty champion for her constituent in the year to come and wish she well in this house it have be barely five day since the chancellor lay her first budget before the house and it be bad than anyone could have imagine far from protect work people it have punish worker business entrepreneur and investor the very people who help we to prosper as country it have spook the market the cost of borrowing have go up significantly and debt interest will be high as result so much for restore stability the institute of directors describe it as painful budget for business and the obr have downgrade its growth projection for the next five year and say that inflation will creep up again which in turn mean that interest rate will stay high for long as will people mortgage the ifs have warn that labour national insurance hike will hit low pay job the hard and will force firm to cut salary cut hire and raise price so much for protect work people astoundingly for government who claim that they be all about economic growth while private company have see their taxis hike overnight the public sector will be protect and give much more funding public service be important no one would claim otherwise but the wealth of this nation be build not by the government but by private enterprise and entrepreneur it be the innovation ingenuity and enterprise of the private sector that create opportunity growth and prosperity the government should recognise and reward it not stifle and punish it this be budget of broken promise during the election the labour party promise voter time that it would not raise taxis on work people the prime minister promise it the chancellor promise it the entire front bench promise it indeed it be there for all to see in black and white in their manifesto but despite all their promise they have raise taxis by billion to an all time high that have be do on the back of work people on the back of those who own business on the back of those who take risk invest in the uk and create job on the back of those who have work hard and save to own property or share on the back of those who work in agriculture and on the back of those who send their child to independent school the labour party do not think that those people be work people but they be and they will not forget it none of this should come as surprise of course we know give the farcical verbal knot that they have tie themselves in over the past few week that labour front benchers can not even define what work person be the british people have be betray and everyone can see what the labour government have do it be very clear that they have plan all along to jack up our taxis but would not come clean they make all sort of promise during the election they be go to steady the ship and achieve the high sustained growth in the and say that all their policy be fully cost and fully fund however as soon as they get into power they invent the so call black hole which no one believe exist and which even the obr have refuse to legitimise they have waste no time in fiddle the rule so that they can borrow billion more for their lavish spending subject the british people to misery through record tax rise the british people will not forget what be be do to they those high tax high spend policy will not protect work people the prioritisation of trade union donor over small business and pensioner will not protect work people the deliberate punishment of risk taker and job creator will not protect work people but at this stage it be not too late it be not too late to apologise to the british public and rescue they from this disaster it be not too late to listen to people who have experience of the real world those who have set up their own business take risk and employ people and create wealth and growth it be not too late to change course so the government should show some humility and do so call sadik al hassan to make his maiden speech thank you madam deputy speaker congratulate hon friend who have make excellent and move maiden speech so far they have set high bar today and over the past few week but we have as they say save the good until almost last thank the people of north somerset for the trust that they have place in promise they that will not for moment stop fight to fulfil the promise that have make to they as pharmacist campaign on platform of rebuild the nhs

strong commitment from my right hon friend the chancellor to rebuild our nhs with the large increase in funding outside the pandemic since no one on the labour benches doubt the enormity of the task ahead or the challenge that we may encounter along the way but the chancellor have put we on road to renewal with this budget and be sure that many of my colleague in the healthcare sector will be grateful to she for that north somerset be more than just where somerset give up and bristol begin we be the home of the first mass production of penicillin of one of the old cinema in the uk and

birthplace of ribena drink much belove across the country not least by my child another of our gem be pill which despite the name do not have pharmaceutical history at one point pill small footprint boast pub which would no doubt have celebrate the chancellor cut to alcohol duty at the weekend no tour of our green and pleasant land would be complete without tyntesfield which be in my unbiased opinion the great national trust site and that be really say something that beautiful georgian house be delight for all across the south west north somerset boast the unique honour of be home not only to one of the busy airport in the country but to major port those twin pillar of infrastructure in the south west be the foundation of our local economy in recent year bristol airport overtake glasgow

the people of north somerset to bristol and then to the wide country for nearly year now the campaign to reopen the line have rag fiercely in my constituency and want to reassure my constituent that

councillor shortly thereafter now that be an mp dread to think how she will one up this time laughter jest and in reality during the long week of campaign this summer my dad wife and two child prove to be my bedrock provide with an endless source of strength and be and always will be eternally grateful to they thank the house for indulge and the people of north somerset for put their trust in every day will come to this chamber and fight to put north somerset on the map and deliver for all those who call that beautiful green pocket of england home one should never underestimate one wife congratulate the hon member for north somerset sadik al hassan on powerfully deliver maiden speech and wish he well in this house thank he for his kind word about his predecessor dr liam fox who be true champion of this house the budget of broken promise come as hammer blow to community up and down the land but before get into the detail of that and in the interest of balance and fairness would like to thank the chancellor for one of the measure in it follow fairfueluk campaign the sun keep it down campaign and indeed the campaign lead by my hon friend the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti the freeze on fuel duty which the last conservative government implement for so many year will continue it be very apparent to that petrol and diesel be overtax as it be and work people up and down the land absolutely depend on be able to afford tank of fuel to get the kid to school go to work and go about their daily life as request ahead of next year budget ask the chancellor to consider fix double taxation in the system the point at which vat be apply to petrol and diesel at the moment it be apply after fuel duty rather than before we therefore pay vat not just on the petrol and diesel itself but on the fuel duty that have be put on top of it there be so much to dislike in this budget of broken promise begin with the increase in employer national insurance contribution which be direct tax on job it be tax on small and large business alike and it be tax on our general practitioner be sure be not alone in this house in already have correspondence on this issue with many of the gps in my constituency there be the perversity of put bus fare up to scrap the conservatives bus fare cap work people up and down the land rely on bus it be only in labour world that put the bus fare up mean get more people to work the billion tax hike be go to lead to high inflation low wage and increase government debt for my constituency of mid buckinghamshire though the very bad part of this budget be the full frontal attack on our farmer and agricultural community the change to agricultural property relief will cause family farm up and down the land to have to sell such huge proportion of their farm in order to meet that tax bill that those farm themselves may well become unviable commend the hon gentleman on that comment every farmer in northern ireland will be impact by this change the ulster farmers union declare an interest as member have say that the change be universally discredit and universally opposed the threshold for agricultural relief for farm should have be high perhaps million or million not million which bring everybody into the equation as ever the hon gentleman have hit the nail exactly on the head in its briefing which be sure all member have receive the national farmers union point out that the treasury own figure on who will get catch up in the apr change be fundamentally wrong because they include lot of very small scale area perhaps private residence with one or two field or very small number of livestock that be not what any of we would define as work farm in reality when all those family farm be bring into the number the vast majority of our food producer who contribute to food supply chain will get catch up in those change when the chancellor be on the bbc on sunday morning she say that the individual claim for agricultural property relief be now million but if farm be own by two people that allowance could be transfer to the other person some confusion need to be iron out here because unlike the nil rate band and residential nil rate band the policy paper entitle summary of reform to agricultural property relief and business property relief publish on october this year state that any unused allowance will not be transferable between spouse and civil partner perhaps in sum up the minister can clear up that confusion cause by the chancellor on the kuenssberg show the apr change be not the only change that will hammer our farming family and agricultural community be sure there be joke somewhere along the line of when be pick up truck not pick up truck but it be no laugh matter for farmer for they it be just basic bit of equipment that they need to operate but this government be hammer they on the cost of that equipment if it happen to have rear seat as raise early today in this house during the urgent question the government carbon tax will put up the price of fertiliser by between and tonne either that be go to have direct impact on the cost of food or the government be ask farmer already operate on incredibly tight margin often with no profit at all just to swallow that extra cost urge they to reconsider other measure in the budget that be clearly wrong and the government must turn on include vat on private school fee the vast majority of parent talk to in my constituency who choose to send their child to independent school scrimp and save and make sacrifice in order to give their child that opportunity an additional in fee make that unaffordable for those parent and when talk to representative of independent school in my constituency some be say that they can see path to have to close their door know that lot of labour members would probably quite like that outcome but the reality be that it will be deny child opportunity and deny parent choice and it will have the knock on impact of class size in my kid school and be sure every other hon member kid school in the state sector go up that will cause overcrowding and put pressure on our state school this be all before come on to the other problem in this budget not least the cruel attack on our pensioner through the withdrawal of the winter fuel payment lastly just to prove how bizarre and simply unserious the government be about value for money they have choose someone as their new value for money tsar who be inextricably link to one of the most inefficient and wasteful project ever to come out of the british state how on earth can someone so link to that project be consider an arbiter of value for money we now come to another maiden speech call andrew ranger diolch yn fawr madam

service to his constituent in clwyd south finally pay tribute to ian lucas my labour predecessor who serve in this house for year often sit on the benches wear wrexham afc tie serve as minister and shadow minister and on select committees most latterly on an inquiry into disinformation and social medium diolch yn fawr madam deputy speaker rise order after the next speaker at six minute will drop the limit to three minute each what great privilege it be to be sit on the back benches and able to make contribution freely after year on the front bench as parliamentary private secretary or minister pay tribute to the hon member for wrexham andrew ranger for his maiden speech and acknowledge what wonderful experience it be to visit wrexham about month ago as part of the place for growth work that be involve in in the cabinet office hope that can use the freedom now have to speak candidly about some of the experience have in government want to make some remark about that experience and the legacy of the last five year talk about growth enablement make some observation about some of the budget measure relate to that matter and also speak for few moment about unforeseen risk and my concern about whether the budget will give we the space as country to deal with those risk five year ago an election be call with an outcome few week later certainly do not think that three month after that we would be shut down the economy because of covid be in the treasury with my right hon friend the member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak and we quickly have to institute the bounce back loan and the furlough scheme exceptional infusion of cash for public service to keep the economy go consequentially tax level have to rise and of course we have spirited debate this year about those level of taxation those of we who have be through several election recognise that give the politic of election there be trade off between candour and obfuscation observe that after this budget the gap be wide than normal and the assertion about the billion black hole have not be legitimise look forward to address some of those issue on the treasury committee in the come day the government core argument though be that there be level of investment require to secure growth through improvement in productivity and by deal with the lack of investment in recent year wish they well with that because it be in the interest of our whole economy to see great productivity but be profoundly concerned about some of the choice that have be make there seem to be surge of investment in the next two year but serious question about the settlement for non protect departments thereafter be concern about the decision make on public sector wage settlement and the precedent deem to be give for other workforce in subsequent year to seek great settlement without conditionality unless we drive high productivity in the public sector as well as encourage investment in the private sector we will not see the growth that we hope for be also worried about the cost nearly billion of the employment rights bill and about the tax increase for those who employ people in this country but wish the government well the theme of today debate be some of the reform need to look after the interest of work people we have see surge in the number of working age people who be not in gainful employment about year ago we decide in this house rightly to ensure parity of esteem between those experience mental health problem and those with physical health problem but in truth our benefit system have not adequately interrogate how to deal with intermittent mental health problem we will have to work together constructively for the right settlement to get those people back into work we must put the emphasis on what people can do rather than what they can not do and ensure that people who be partially fit for work be encourage back into work finally want to address our capacity far to this budget to deal with shock in february we think we be come out of covid be at meeting in my neighbouring constituency of andover and putin ukraine incursion happen we have massive inflation and have to find billion overnight my concern be that there be not enough capacity to deal with the shock that we could see in very uncertain world the energy shock might occur again want to be as constructive as can be from where now sit that be responsibility of his majesty loyal opposition but be concerned that number of the decision in this budget will not lay the foundation for the more productive high growth economy that be expect and want and be very concerned about there not be enough in reserve for what we may face the theme of today debate be the effect of the budget on work people in the uk it be estimate that million working day be lose each year due to alcohol relate sickness it be not just day lose it be also decrease productivity because alcohol abuse can lead to employee arrive late for work and be absent more often some workplace culture encourage drink think on that point colleague we have to take look at our own workplace as we sit here imagine for moment that every seat in the chamber be full but that instead of see our colleague we could see the face of those lose to alcohol harm that be the reality every week the equivalent of this entire chamber die because of alcohol just before the election be call be inform that as district lancaster have the high rate of alcohol relate death in england that lead to look more into the issue in the hope of find solution to it discover that since death from alcohol across the uk have rise by one of the main reason be that alcohol have become much more affordable due to successive government cut alcohol duty rate short sighted and naive decision making that be out of step with the evidence that have come from expert for year the knock on effect on our public finance and wide economy be clear the institute of alcohol studies recently find that alcohol harm cost our society more than billion year fortunately however there be also abundant evidence about what work to reduce alcohol consumption and harm while raise much need revenue for vital public service the world health organisation identifie tackle alcohol affordability as the most effective and cost effective way of reduce alcohol harm across the world alcohol duty be well place to do that and have the advantage of also raise revenue for the treasury the duty revenue should cover the cost of harm but currently it cover barely half the cost of the harm to society my plea to those on the government front bench be that they stop placate the multi billion pound alcohol industry under the guise of help pub almost every time duty rate have be cut chancellors have proclaim it as victory for pub but that simply be not true it help supermarket far more allow they to maintain much cheap price on alcohol the only time in recent decade that that gap do not grow be under the last labour government which introduce duty escalator increase duty above inflation each year during that period the death rate from alcohol steadily fall although welcome the vast majority of the content of this budget implore those on the government front bench to look again at the cost of alcohol to our society and at how we address death from alcohol be afraid that for those of we who can remember the we appear to have go back in time with labour government increase borrowing increase spending and of course increase our taxis there be little improvement during the tony blair year as he seem at least to recognise that we have to create wealth before we can spend it but this budget clearly indicate that the government have fail that test budget often unravel in four or five day this one unravel in four or five hour many hon member will have read the article in today times by sir james dyson hopefully labour members will take note of his comment it be clear that the government be set on course that will most certainly not deliver on their growth agenda my constituency be very industrial and take in the south bank of the humber contain two oil refinery chemical industry logistic and much more it also contain the large port in the country by tonnage immingham and can not fail to mention the port of grimsby only have one ward of grimsby in my constituency but grimsby be the world large deep sea fishing port and be now still reliant on fish supply as thousand be employ in fish processing grimsby be also major centre for the renewable energy sector as we transition towards clean energy production we have develop network of training and skill institution to prepare the young generation for job in that sector however must offer word of caution minister should have less zeal and more realism in try to meet stretch target we have large rural hinterland where people toil to put food on our table it be constituency where ten of thousand work hard for living today debate be about protect work people the work people represent be resilient and self reliant but they do expect some support and protection from their government what they want be good public service in exchange for their taxis we have have large tax hike on business and we know that many part of the health sector will have to pay enormous increase in employer contribution hon member across the house will have hear from doctor from pensioner from gps and from farmer who be desperately concerned about what be come urge the government to protect job and reverse their damaging proposal only then will they truly be able to say that they be protect work people would like to place on the record my congratulation to my hon friend the members for north somerset sadik al hassan for wrexham andrew ranger and for huddersfield harpreet uppal on their amazing maiden speech today listen on wednesday to the contribution from the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin notify she that be go to quote her speech who say that this be budget of the public sector by the public sector for the public sector official report october vol she say that as though it be bad thing urge the government to reject the false dichotomy be set up by the conservative party in which investment in the public sector be somehow drain on the national expenditure and put money into our public service be somehow inherently bad for our society and our state when speak to business yes they raise with their concern about national insurance increase think business have do so with every member across this house and it would be foolish to suggest otherwise but they also ask question like can you fix the so we can expand and get more thing move down from jcb and can you get some proper mental health support so we can get worker back to work quick when they be struggle with their mental health they tell that they struggle with the supply of skilled young people and be ask desperately for investment in skill to make sure that there be ready pipeline of young people who can do those job it be therefore completely fatuous to suggest that the investment that this government be put into the public sector will be in some way detrimental to the growth of our economy and the success of our private industry will the hon gentleman give way no there be no time be terribly sorry say this as one of those pesky trade unionist the conservative party seem in such opposition to when the conservatives talk about the significant pay for trade union first of all it be not for the trade union but for the member of those trade union all of whom be work people most of they live in conservative members constituency and some of they may have even vote for they sadly not all trade unionist vote labour however their pay go into their pocket and from there it go on to their high street and the shop in their community it be not hoard away as offshore wealth it be not put into some clever accountancy scheme it be use to buy kid school shoe it be use to buy saturday morning breakfast in the local café it go back into the economy in way the conservatives simply seem to misunderstand in the short time have remain say to the government please do not listen to the siren voice that suggest that the investment we be put in be bad for our economy it be not it be good for our state it be good for our country and it be good for our economy want to bring northern ireland point of view on this budget first thank the government for the billion they have allocate for the infected and affected victim of the infected blood scandal but question whether it be enough and whether they will now deliver it at pace it be unfortunate that the right hon member for salisbury john glen be no long in his place because know the work he do on that previously as paymaster general also welcome the money for the postmaster but ask the government why there be still no recognition of or assurance for our waspi woman the women against state pension inequality despite the recommendation of the parliamentary and health service ombudsman and the pre and post election photo opportunity take by both the government and the opposition health be devolve and while welcome the significant funding that health have be give here in england ask the treasury to consider ringfence the barnett consequential that will go to health in northern ireland notice that the parliamentary under secretary of state for northern ireland meet our health trust and health union prior to the budget so it would be interesting to know exactly what the northern ireland office be do in regard to our health service in northern ireland it be also noticeable that our northern ireland office have receive increase in its allocation would question whether that be an indication that the northern ireland office intend to be more hand on and exactly what it be go to fund in northern ireland with those money want to ensure that that be scrutinise by this house and be use in support of strategy that be implement and support by all the party in the northern ireland executive it have be say that the national health service will be exempt from the rise in employer national insurance contribution but seek clarification from the treasury in respect of social care in northern ireland note that the chancellor say that additional money would be deliver to local authority so that the additional cost could be cover by social care provider here in england but social care in northern ireland be pay for by our health service and our health trust ask what contribution and what consideration the treasury have put into that allocation so that there be equity across the piece also support the comment that the hon member for torbay steve darling make about the challenge face our gps our community pharmacy our dentist our social care provider and the voluntary and community sector that support our health service because of the limit on time will mostly keep my comment to one sector of the economy the cultural sector which be very significant in the glasgow north constituency very much welcome the measure in the budget to support the art culture and creative industry by implement the and rate of theatre orchestra museum and gallery tax relief from april next year those measure along with the government recognition of the creative and art sector contribution to the economy be so important that be particularly clear in my constituency give the presence of important venue and institution include scottish opera king tut the national theatre of scotland the royal conservatoire the royal scottish national orchestra the theatre royal the pavilion the king theatre the kelvingrove art gallery the hydro the school of art the mitchell library bbc studioworks the gallery of modern art the glasgow royal concert hall the hunterian museum and the riverside museum to name just some it be very easy to think of the sector in term of performer dancer singer musician those on the stage and those in front of the camera but there be also very many skilled professional employ in the sector the sound technician the costume design team the camera operator the lighting engineer the archivist the conservation expert the prop maker and the stage manager along with the team in front of house facility security and so on the sector add to the rich and diverse cultural life of the city but it also add to the local economy draw visitor to the city employ thousand of people and create customer demand for nearby business the budget present to the house last week deliver the large settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution it be clear and tangible sign of the importance of scotland to this government government commit to deliver for scotland and for all of the uk this be how we deliver for work people with the end of the era of austerity raise much need cash for our under resource public service and deliver pay rise for of the lowest pay scot recognise that much of policy on culture and the art be devolve with the record settlement in this budget it be time for the scottish government to play fair by the sector and to finally end the blame game and end their waste and financial mismanagement they have the power and the resource they need to deliver to ensure that the work people of glasgow and scotland truly benefit from this transformative budget aristotle say that the state exist to advance the wellbeing of its member state that fail to advance its people wellbee be not merely state that act badly but an institution that have fail to achieve its define purpose such positive vision of the state require strong institution that be able to act with government accountable to the people but free to take action drive by what disraeli understand to be the social welfare of the people chancellor who hide behind the supposedly impartial pronouncement of the obr be incapable of deliver real meaningful change restore accountability in practice require two parallel process first political control of decision making must be rebuild secondly and equally importantly great sense that the public have stake in society and by implication the state that serve it must be engender restore political accountability mean remove what the economist and writer dan davies have term accountability sink the mechanism that ensure that nobody be to blame when thing go wrong accountability sink be one of the great bane of modern life from automated call centre to computer that say no to application for loan or other financial service they be matter of design not accident in the private sector they can shield organisation from legal liability as happen in the post office scandal decision make by an individual be much more open to question than one that be the consequence of general policy in the public sphere accountability sink often shield politician and other public servant from genuine accountability for government policy privatisation contract out and private finance initiative have all be use as way of shift responsibility from government to market force the establishment of an independent bank of england with an arbitrary inflation target be classic example of generalised policy that have replace specific individual decision making and responsibility similarly the office for budget responsibility be establish explicitly to protect the treasury from take responsibility for budget forecasting as davy note the role of the court and international body be similar be my right hon friend suggest that we ought to replace those body and have the government re adopt responsibility for economic policy in the round such as by set target for inflation instead of say it all down to an unelected body absolutely restore accountability mean reverse many of the process that have be take as read in recent year democracy be dependent on clear line of accountability but in the past year they have be either dilute or displace be it any wonder that the public feel disillusioned with the exercise of power as result the british economy have suffer more at the hand of neoliberal globalisation than those of most of our competitor foreign ownership of uk public firm have rise from just over in to in ownership have become remote and unaccountable to worker customer and even shareholder credit creation have facilitate the growth of private equity and leveraged buy out private equity firm have be able to take on vast amount of debt in order to take over business our economy be control by oligarchy careless of their customer and their employee the result have be to make all other business objective secondary to the imperative of have enough cash to survive as davy put it the debt burden create an ultimatum if company do not put their effort into make profit they go bust our constituent can see the increase power of unaccountable globalist enterprise and can see the government inability to do anything about it just as farmer can see that the government policy on inheritance be completely belie by the fact that most asset rich farm do not make lot of money it be not about asset it be about income such disillusionment be socially corrosive but it be justifiable when the most important economic decision be take by commercial entity with no regard for the need and value of the people turn the ship around require radical concert action not just platitude we need new economic model one that harness the power of the state to break up the power of renti capitalism and restore an economy that work for society not against it fraternal economic be the mean popular wellbeing be the end must say that be not quite sure how can follow that congratulate my hon friend the members for huddersfield harpreet uppal for north somerset sadik al hassan and for wrexham andrew ranger on their excellent maiden speech be pleased to add my support to the budget that my right hon friend the chancellor put forward last week it provide fresh start for our family in the town village and city that comprise the constituency of buckingham and bletchley give this labour government dire economic inheritance the budget have do great job not only of address the immediate challenge that my constituent face but more importantly of lay the foundation for resilient economy that will spread opportunity and deliver the down payment that we need on the government ambition to tackle child poverty to understand why this budget be so crucial we need to take moment to recognise the scale of the economic and social challenge that we face since the financial crisis the uk productivity have grow at just per year sharp drop from the annual growth rate that we see in the year beforehand while other advanced economy have experience similar slowdown the uk have be hit particularly hard not least as result of the previous government shy away from take the proper long term decision for our economy this have lead to the uk productivity be low than that of the united states and far low than that of our european competitor such as france and germany for many work people across the country and in my constituency the consequence be stark with loss of almost year in potential wage over the past year member across the house will have see how that have manifest itself in rise child poverty and in the routine use of food bank which my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions mention that be why measure such as the fair repayment rate and the extension of the household support fund be so vital as they provide the lifeline that family in my constituency and across the country so desperately need another key issue correctly identify by the chancellor be the low level of public and private investment in the uk compare with our peer for almost my entire lifetime the uk have be laggard in that area we have be at the bottom of the ranking for public and private investment for of the past year be pleased that this budget represent vital first step in correct course with credible package of investment in infrastructure school and hospital that include east west rail in my constituency and my constituent in bletchley and winslow be look forward to the opportunity from that be pleased to support this budget it give work people and their family hand up build strong foundation and ensure that our economy will be competitive in the long run the budget we see last week be the most anti aspirational budget of modern time it be bad budget for growth job and work people first let we consider its impact on small and medium sized business many of which be staff by work people the billion tax bombshell combine with the additional regulation in the employment rights bill will place massive burden on business and we will only see more of they close over the come year whatever industry people be in there be now significantly high taxis and regulatory burden than we have ever see the ludicrous hike in employer national insurance contribution will lead to many business no long employ new people and have to slash job that be not in the interest of work people the last conservative government play crucial role in reduce unemployment throughout the uk the labour government have tear that up just few month into office let we be clear that have few job be not in the interest of work people the left like to portray capital gain tax as tax that only affect the rich in society however that be simply not true ordinary work people who save and invest and make modest profit on small shareholding or who maybe have second home for their pension will see their taxis rise as result of this budget that be not in the interest of work people it be the politic of envy unleash have recently secure westminster hall debate on the pub and hospitality sector which be well attend by member from all part of the house welcome the penny cut to draft beer however that reduction be purely academic if people do not have pub to go to this government have fail to extend the rate relief that the last government put in place for the sector the resident of mid leicestershire be deeply concerned that this government measure will damage the economy rather than create growth finally vat on education be perhaps one of the mean policy that this government have bring in it will not only affect those who have the wealth to send their child to public school but impact those in the state sector put additional burden on our child future to conclude this be not budget for aspiration what be the point in someone set up their own business what be the point in save to pay for their child education what be the point in keep their family run farm today we have government lack in any idea to boost aspiration instead we have the politic of envy at play on july the british people vote decisively for one clear promise the promise of change the budget deliver on that promise we have change from year of short termism unmanaged decline and weak unbalanced economy with anaemic growth to long term plan for the future of britain that invest in the british people our public service and our infrastructure the theme of today debate be protect work people so put on record my strong support for two particular measure first support the substantial increase in the minimum wage for all worker but in particular the massive boost for apprentice that be pay rise of year for an apprentice work hour week have more apprentice in my constituency than most because of our nuclear industry so that minimum wage rise will make considerable difference secondly support the government million investment to tackle the root cause of economic inactivity and to support people back into work the large number of people particularly young man who have fall out of the labour market since the pandemic be an enormous social and economic problem know that the front bench team will grip that problem with the resource that this budget provide will also make wide point about investment and get britain build again the conservative plan be for public investment in this parliament to decline sharply low public investment have be feature of our economic formula for year and the result be well know poor infrastructure low productivity and sluggish growth boost of billion over the next five year will begin to reverse the under investment we have see from the conservatives and act as magnet to attract significantly more private investment the key question be how we put that money to use in generate growth take west cumbria as an example we have coastal railway line that run from carlisle to barrow through my constituency if we upgrade that line we get extra job and billion of gross value add to the uk economy to realise the benefit of high level of public investment and the job that come with it we also need planning reform without that the public investment commitment in the budget will get catch in web of delay diversion and high cost the budget be welcome it be one measure that the government have take and there be series of other include plan reform that will help get britain back on track there be no doubt that the conservative government leave our public service in tatter and the nhs on life support this government be leave with no choice but to make tough decision understand that have lead council that have be conservative run important decision about employee pay be delay there be vanity project and money waste and reserve be slash so badly that the council be on the verge of bankruptcy however to govern be to choose and be shock by the short sightedness of some of the decision make in last week budget it be true that the average worker will not see tax rise on their payslip but their employer will now be calculate whether there will be any pay rise at all next year or whether to issue some of their worker with their shop pub and cafés face increase in national insurance and the national minimum wage be already struggle as household deal with cost of living pressure and from their own rise price for energy and for stock and they be promise full reform of business rate instead their cost will skyrocket as their business rate relief be slash to grant the relief have be make permanent but where be the commercial landowner levy or the charge on the internet giant surely tax the wealthy would be fair rather than hit small business with tax that take no account of profit or purpose say it last week and will say it again now rental auction and compulsory purchase change may in theory get the market move but if business in high street such as wareham in my constituency of mid dorset and north poole can not afford to trade the high street can not redefine its purpose like my colleague have be contact by business public sector organisation and charity share their calculation of the impact of the national insurance change corfe mullen dental practice recently recruit graduate dentist specifically to serve the child nhs population boost capacity in my area the increase in ni for staff have wipe out half her annual salary if we be to stop dentist leave the nhs we need exemption for they now julia house child hospice have calculate that its ni increase be year shockingly tops nursery which have several early year setting in my constituency have calculate an increase of half million pound without any additional increase in childcare funding the lib dems have call for taxis on energy giant and the big bank we agree that those with the broad shoulder should pay more but this budget have mistake whose shoulder be broad so ask the government for urgent consideration of two thing first rethink the national insurance change to exempt organisation ally to the nhs and education such as gps hospice and nursery and instead to get the extra money from big bank and share buyback and secondly to postpone the reduction of retail hospitality and leisure relief until full business rate reform be ready to keep our high street alive congratulate my hon friend the members for huddersfield harpreet uppal for north somerset sadik al hassan and for wrexham andrew ranger on their excellent maiden speech as the first ever labour mp for basingstoke be proud to champion the first labour budget in year deliver by the first ever female chancellor also congratulate the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch on her election as leader of his majesty official opposition as the first black woman to lead major political party she have achieve significant milestone will focus on three key point the first be to recognise that the budget represent crucial shift away from the fail policy of the last year as my hon friend the member for swansea west torsten bell have say the risk in continue down the same path be immense economically socially and politically the previous parliament see living standard decline the low growth and high inflation in the and sky rocket hospital and housing waiting list the new leader of the opposition have claim that the public now expect too much from government but my constituent in basingstoke have lose faith that the state can deliver even the most basic of public service after year of neglect that bring to my second point the budget be about fix our public finance and repair our public service our first fiscal rule ensure that day to day spending be sustainably fund which be essential give the chaos of the conservatives mini budget crucially however our rule allow for increase public investment an approach welcome by the international monetary fund unlike the conservatives who as other have mention plan to cut public investment by third we believe in invest in housing school and infrastructure their opposition to new investment reveal their desire to return we to path of decline that voter reject just few month ago the budget will lead to more nhs appointment and well healthcare more teacher and improved education and more secure affordable housing for all finally the budget protect and deliver for work people in basingstoke just as we promise in our manifesto the increase in the national living wage will mean more for full time worker on the living wage we be address the legacy of poverty leave by the previous government with one in five child in basingstoke live in relative poverty change to the repayment rate of universal credit will make over million of the uk poor household well off from next april the budget signify decisive move towards fair more prosperous future for basingstoke and for britain those on the opposition benches will regret their opposition to the budget be proud to support it start by welcome the fact that this be the first budget present by female chancellor the house should be proud of that also send my thank to the prime minister for acknowledge the former leader of the conservative party and his heritage as second generation indian this place be symbolic not just here but around the world be go to shift tone if may laughter the budget be incredibly punitive for small business come from small business background and applaud those who be brave enough to set up their own business lot of the time those small business be one man band reliant on family member or friend to support they today probably would not set up small business because off the back of this budget we have destroy ambition in our country the budget absolutely feed into support public sector worker but as sir james dyson say in the times today how can we encourage the entrepreneur of tomorrow to start their business today politic be about choice my party spend the summer try to convince the electorate that labour be go to raise their taxis we think that it be and indeed we tell the public that the budget raise taxis on work people on pensioner on wealth creator and on farmer think that farmer and the nfu know there would be an issue when only word of the labour manifesto refer to farming the budget send message that ambition be something not to foster with regard to the tax burden we see an increase in capital gain tax and inheritance tax the removal of stamp duty support for first time buyer and the unfreezing of income tax band this be budget that penalise ambition be conscious of time so want quickly to focus on three local issue in south west herts on defence spending be lucky enough to represent northwood nato base in my constituency while applaud the government investment in defence and support our ukrainian ally gently point out that the budget will actually see decrease in the percentage of gdp spend on defence let alone pathway to spend do my hon friend agree that at this time when the world be more dangerous than it have ever be any reduction in defence spending be the wrong way to go my hon friend be spot on interruption hear comment from government members that it be not reduction my government and my party manifesto commit to look forward to the government commit to that level in future spending review and ideally go high the second local issue be independent school believe that this be policy of envy when the government be burden independent school with vat and increase in business rate they be force family who be just about afford current tuition fee to make the choice to go to the state school sector now if there be capacity in the state school sector would happily applaud that but when shadow minister confirm during the general election campaign that class size would increase that for be warning that the labour party know what it be do unfortunately resident of south west hertfordshire will come to feel that in thing such as send support help those who be most in need which be subsidise by the private sector finally on watford general hospital look forward to the health secretary come back in the spring with his review follow on from my question at prime minister question in october that be critical for my constituent could not have be more pleased to hear the chancellor game change budget last week put an end to the cynical short termism of the previous government and take on the long term challenge of rebuild britain to be the fair more equitable society that we know it can be today what an absolute tonic it be to hear from our secretary of state for work and pensions who be serious about drive up opportunity and drive down poverty and have serious plan to do so no more tinker at the edge and no more blame game with the very people who deserve our support but practical people centre plan to get britain work and to support and empower the most vulnerable for the long term people in my constituency of clwyd north have much to welcome in what the secretary of state say there be the rise this year alone in the state pension through retain the triple lock despite the financial inheritance leave to we by the conservatives the significant increase in the earning threshold for eligibility for carer allowance be welcome news for plus family carer in my constituency as be the valuable consequential fund gain by wales through the extension of the household support fund to support those struggle most with household cost if may would like to celebrate the two measure that resonate most with as result of my journey to this house through teaching in our classroom and work with our community in local government they be the million package to open up opportunity to all those leave behind to get into work and to get on in work and the fair payment rate for universal credit which be rely on so much by those in and out of work deduction will be cap at rather than the crippling which stop too many family from ever get their head above water our child family and community deserve fighting chance only join up person centre approach can achieve that which be why be delighted to see the dawn of the get britain work white paper enable by this budget at last we have government who be put investment front and centre of rebuild our country investment in infrastructure business and crucially in our people it be about time our people be our great asset this be budget order let start with some positive because do not want the government to think that do not recognise the challenge that they face

my constituency be hear through the consultation process later this year welcome the fact that this government acknowledge the importance of economic growth but be concerned that beyond acknowledge it there be nothing really in the budget to deliver it despite the warm word and platitude of the labour party during the election campaign this be deeply socialist budget with an ever increase share of our economy move into the ambit of government only to be distribute by government into area that be unproductive of economic growth my hon friend make an excellent point about growth the elephant in the room be productivity he will know from the house of commons library figure that productivity fall in the past year and we be lag behind many competitive country in both public sector and private sector productivity it be critical that we take further step to develop skill to drive growth agree that productivity be essential and everyone in the house need to focus on it this be dishonest and damaging budget this government promise that they would protect work people instead they have deliver budget that be tough on work and tough on the cause of work this be budget that tax employment with million employer now set to lose out combine with an estimate billion cost of expansive employment right our economy will be less flexible and starve of risk capital job and investment in our community this be job cut budget this be budget that attack our farming family our rural economy and our rural community man and woman work hard day in day out in some of the most challenging economic circumstance at considerable risk and with low margin all to put food on our table three time day we simply would not survive without our farmer it be that simple but this government be choose to hit those very people with family farm tax which will drive asset disposal split up land farm by the same family for generation it will discourage the next generation from take up the mantle and tear apart the community that these farm be integral to last year the now prime minister say every day seem to bring new existential risk to british farming today the existential risk be this socialist government this budget fundamentally attack the heart of economic growth it crowd out private investment and reduce real business investment by billion the obr note by the forecast horizon government spending comprise large part of little change real gdp when the government promise growth the british people might have hop that it would be growth in the wealth of our country not just the size of the state their own word sum that up well the budget say rewarding work with fair wage be the good way to improve living standard this budget achieve none of that instead it deliver low real wage low real household disposable income high inflation and high mortgage rate after the budget the chancellor tell the british public that work people will not face high taxis in their payslip but she know that be not true more than million extra taxpayer will be drag into tax because she have keep the freeze on tax threshold congratulate my right hon friend the chancellor not only on be the first woman ever to deliver budget to this house but on be the first chancellor to deliver join up grow up budget in year represent welsh constituency be proud that this budget provide the large funding billion that wales have receive since devolution that be proof if ever that be need that only two labour governments work together will ever properly listen to understand and fight to meet the need of the people of wales who have be ignore belittle or attack by generation of conservatives we all know that our broken public service would collapse overnight without the selfless dedication of the countless woman and man who day in and day out serve as unpaid carer be particularly pleased that the budget have raise the amount by nearly month that carer can earn before lose out on carer allowance turn to agriculture as co chair of the all party parliamentary group for farming and have grow up on small family farm know there have be much disquiet over the change to agricultural property relief have be in constant communication with our excellent local nfu policy staff since the budget and be listen to their concern and feed they directly back to defra it be unsurprise that farmer be worried give that many journalist and the conservative party have unfortunately be selectively focus on million figure that do not reflect the reality of the policy let seek to reassure small family farmer and repeat the word of the exchequer secretary to the treasury my hon friend the member for ealing north james murray last week who say the total value of farm should not be confuse with the value be pass on at death multiple family member can own part of farm for example if an individual jointly own farm worth million with their partner only million be in their estate at death official report october vol those be wise word which will give comfort to many who have be mislead by selective and mischievous comment on the budget with the additional relief for each partner if there be property on the farm farm worth up to million may still pay zero inheritance tax yes this budget recognise that family farm form part of the backbone of rural community but it also recognise that our rural community rely every bit as much on strong function public service this historic budget call time on austerity and bring stability back call susan murray thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to make my first contribution to uk budget debate refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests congratulate member on the government benches on their excellent maiden speech be pleased to hear the chancellor plan for reparation for the infected blood scandal and the post office horizon scandal but be disappoint that there be no mention of compensation for waspi woman despite the health service ombudsman report which be publish in march trust that will be address in the very near future my constituency of mid dunbartonshire have an age population which be to be celebrate but it bring with it high number of patient with increase frailty and great healthcare need mid dunbartonshire have wealth of charity and community group that support carer offer peer support and support mental health and generally reduce demand on statutory service and prevent cost for the nhs the increase in employer national insurance will inevitably hit they hard and it be vital that they be protect from additional taxis if these service be to continue the same be true for small and medium sized business in mid dunbartonshire which be so vital to our local economy provide job that break the cycle of disadvantage welcome the increase in capital funding for scotland in the budget give the increase it be finally time to see the development of the much need new milngavie health and care centre this project echo the government plan to create community focus health hub which be key to prevent cost for the nhs resident and health professional in bearsden and milngavie desperately need the new health and care centre gps dentist ally health professional and third sector support ensure the health of our community and protect our hospital from avoidable pressure the co operation between the scottish government and the uk government be vital to ensure appropriate funding reach scotland for devolved health and care service work cross party will surely improve the effectiveness of solution urge the government to consider the liberal democrats fully cost plan to increase capital and revenue funding for the nhs and care the people in mid dunbartonshire and the rest of the uk be count on we to save our nhs improve care service be key part of tackle this crisis welcome the budget it begin the change that people vote for at the general election it be move away from laissez faire under the tories to an active government who will be on the side of ordinary people and act in the common good also welcome as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and infect blood the money for compensation in the contaminated blood scandal the billion be very welcome it be remarkable that after all the debate statement and question we have over so many year in this house the previous government never set aside penny for the compensation scheme note from the red book that the billion for contaminate blood be to be spend over five year just say to my hon friend on the government front bench that that be long time for people to wait for justice hope that do not slow down the interim payment and final settlement too many have die along the way we can not let anything get in the way of these people receive justice agree with the change to non dom status and inheritance tax but they do not begin to deal with the imbalance in the growth of wealth between the top who own so much wealth and the ordinary people over the last year the conservatives have do nothing to address that imbalance we must recognise that we do not tax wealth in the way that we tax work which have create intolerable inequality since the the wealth of the rich have rise from three time the national income to almost eight time the top fifth of the country own of the wealth while the bottom fifth have only the top be time rich than anyone else despite that growth in wealth wealth taxis have not increase as share of overall taxation or as share of gdp this be the politic not of envy but logic if we do not invest an appropriate proportion of the wealth create by our nation in our public service and infrastructure our university and research our police and court and much much more we diminish our country surely that downward spiral will also be an incentive for those who we be tell will go overseas if we tax they too much we must ensure that we go where the money be and where it have be go over the past year it be time for we to address the imbalance between how we tax wealth and how we tax work the budget have set we on the right road but we need to go far want to raise two specific issue in relation to the budget but we on the liberal democrat benches be pleased to see the investment in the nhs it do feel however like the government have give with one hand and take away with the other first express my deep disappointment and that of my constituent at the lack of mention of the two child benefit cap the two child limit have trap hundred of thousand of child in poverty this be the government opportunity to end this unfair and regressive policy yet they have choose not to my colleague and will continue to campaign to scrap the policy as it would be one of the quick and most cost effective way to lift child out of poverty and would have enormous long term benefit for child society and our economy secondly join other members in raise an issue relate to business after the long year of conservative government who do not understand business there be genuine optimism from business across my constituency that the new government would be different however the hike to employer national insurance contribution have be deeply unwelcome surprise in the day since the budget have speak to small business owner in my constituency include an independent pharmacy owner and each have share with how the hike will have hugely detrimental impact on their business and will impact their employee in fact this afternoon receive from resident deeply distressing email that illustrate this very issue as of today have be make redundant the primary reason cite in my redundancy interview be the increase financial burden on my employer due to tax rise and national insurance increase impose by labour these measure have directly undermine the ability of my small business employer to sustain full time staff leave and likely many other without employment this sudden and destabilising change have leave not only angry but fearful for the future be concerned that may struggle to find new employment for the very reason that cost my last job this could have be budget of growth and fair taxation that truly protect the most vulnerable instead it be budget of what hope be unintended consequence consequence that it be not too late to prevent if the government be willing to listen work with mps on these benches and rethink element of the budget that can and should be improve never cease to be amazed by conservative mp in particular former ministers it be like the last year never happen they never crash the economy they never put million child into poverty they never devastate our community hear opposition member talk about how the budget destroy aspiration and ambition what about the young people in our constituency whose aspiration and ambition they destroy for year what about the million child they put into poverty what about the work family who for the last year they make use food bank do they not have aspiration and ambition do they wake up one day and decide to go and use food bank the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride have hold very prominent position in this house but today he come out with pure fiction from some parallel universe ask he seriously to consider that have work with he in the past but really do not think that he have do it justice the opposition should have have the decency to apologise for year of failure but we have not hear one acknowledgment of that do we think their constituent really buy that be the people out there suddenly go to forget the year of devastation they bring to our community welcome the budget after year it provide real investment over billion in our nhs so that my constituent and the constituent of all members will not have to wait week on end before they can see gp it provide billion for education so that every child in my constituency will have the good start in education and the good start in life would of course like the budget to go far to address poverty look forward to work with ministers because there be journey still to travel this be just the foundation when the chancellor introduce her budget one thing she say be that change must be feel this budget will be feel but in many instance not in good way my constituency be pepper with small business employ or people they be the victim of this budget because they be now go to be soak with additional tax on job and that will not bring change that will be feel in good way it will diminish employment in my constituency my constituency also have many family farm and they too will not feel this budget in good way because inheritance tax will put many of their future in jeopardy family farm be asset rich but more often than not they be cash poor so how on earth will they ever meet the huge imposition that have be place on they the average farm income in the past year in northern ireland be which do not exactly leave those family farm lot of slack it do not leave they much to live on let alone meet inheritance tax bill that illustrate my point it show how impossible and unfair it be to say to family farm and it do not take lot of acreage to be worth may have the asset you do not have the income but you must pay the inheritance tax to hmrc what do those farmer do they sell off part of the farm and what do that do it diminish the food production and it diminish the viability of the farm that will be how this budget will be feel in many family farm similarly it will be feel in negative way by new homebuyer because of the stamp duty threshold reduction new purchaser will now pay significantly more in tax to buy new home as for the budget allocation for northern ireland back in the government accept national barometer of need through professor holtham it set out what be need in each part of this nation what could buy in public service in england be then translate because other area be small into what it would cost to buy the same amount in the rest of the united kingdom in scotland in wales and in northern ireland yes accord to the block grant transparency document this budget provide for wales per in england but in northern ireland we continue to be just at need why be there that uplift for some part of the united kingdom and not for other we in northern ireland also have no guarantee of meeting need beyond that be not assure in this budget ask for my constituent what have be afford to the constituent of wales an uplift on need so that they can see their public service provide properly order intervention prevent other colleague from contribute so let we be mindful as chair of the transport committee will focus my remark on transport sector that be essential to deliver the labour government mission on growth and decarbonisation and to improve our health on those the conservatives dodge the tough decision and kick the can down the potholed road as the chancellor say just as in and it be up to the labour party to clear up their mess welcome the investment for the tunnel to euston the trans pennine route upgrade east west rail and the marston vale line be delighted that combined authority local council and directly elect mayors will receive funding for supertram and mass transit project the million for transport for london for roll stock on the piccadilly and elizabeth line will be particularly welcome in my constituency and across london but also in derby and goole where the job be be create and protect my committee will take great interest in how those project be deliver we hope that they will be complete on time on budget and in way that will help the uk to catch up and compete with the good transport system around the world colleague on both side of the house have tell about the importance of local bus service whether for work study or shopping and they be lifeline for town centre welcome the billion funding boost and the fact that bus service be be put into the hand of local community be pleased that bus fare cap have be retain and that next month cliff edge have be avoid but hope that the government will soon come up with long term solution for the revenue funding of bus across england outside london motorist will welcome the freezing of fuel duty the previous transport committee however conclude that the government must start an honest conversation with the public on how to maintain funding for road and other essential public service as electric vehicle use increase and the use of fossil fuel vehicle decrease that will mean decline in fuel duty for the exchequer so hope that the front benches will work together on this challenge which will only become ever more urgent as for the role of transport in decarbonisation be pleased that the chancellor be increase air passenger duty on private jet but hope that the government will also address the electricity grid capacity challenge to ensure that there be adequate power when and where it be need to provide among other thing confidence in electric vehicle take up this be major infrastructure issue duck by the last government be pleased that the chancellor have seize the mantle of investment to put our country on strong footing for the future it be an honour to speak in this debate in response to the first ever budget deliver by female chancellor there be no doubt that the government have some tough decision to make after inherit mess cause by the reckless economic mismanagement of the previous government but we be also still reel from the economic disaster into which that government push we with their brexit fantasy yesterday obr report estimate that brexit will cost the uk of gdp per year with import and export down by the predict gdp growth of next year pale in comparison if we be serious about economic growth we absolutely must improve our trading relationship with europe and we in this house need to be brave enough to have that conversation but back to the budget along with my liberal democrat colleague be glad that the chancellor have listen to our call for investment and support for the nhs and promise cash injection to start repair the damage do to local health service also welcome the billion of capital investment my local hospital in torbay represent the ultimate liberal democrat case study of despair with sewage leak inside the hospital more than time at the last count investment to deal with rot and broken building be vital and will ultimately help to put our creak country back on its foot the lack of discussion about social care be gap hole and liberal democrats have be call loudly for cross party conversation free personal care could deliver annual saving for the nhs of up to billion by yes it will cost money but it be this kind of investment that we need to repair our health service in the spirit of offer constructive opposition to the new government want to highlight two issue that will affect my constituency considerably the first be agricultural property relief have see the front page be sure that the chancellor be well aware of the distress and fury that this have cause in rural community such as my constituency it be simply tin eare to say we can not afford farmer to die tax free we can not afford to lose more farm they be the backbone of our rural economy and they be fundamentally important for national food supply the second issue be the tax relief offer to the hospitality leisure and tourism sector those business have struggle to recover since the pandemic while carry the burden of rise energy price interest rate and staff shortage we urge the government to go far on business rate reform by fundamentally overhaul system that be destroy our high street and town centre the liberal democrats believe that there be much fairer way to raise the money need than by hit small business our manifesto set out our call for fair tax system include raise money by reverse the conservatives tax cut for the big bank all by ask the tech company and the oil and gas company to pay more the government could also have go far on capital gain tax for the top congratulate my hon friend the members for huddersfield harpreet uppal for north somerset sadik al hassan and for wrexham andrew ranger on their excellent maiden speech also congratulate my right hon friend the chancellor on deliver what have conclude be one of the most consequential budgets in generation in this budget we have reset the nation finance and wipe the slate clean so that we can deliver the change that we promise in the general election give the dire state of the public finance we have have to take some very difficult decision to balance the book but as we set out in our manifesto we will never play fast and loose with the public finance and we will deliver economic stability unlike the conservative party despite the circumstance we inherit there be so much in this budget that will change our country for the well record investment in the nhs pay rise for million worker fully fund compensation for victim of the post office scandal and the infected blood scandal the big ever increase in carer allowance and so much more it be down payment on the change that we offer the electorate at the general election give the time constraint will focus on education as former math teacher be all too familiar with the problem that plague our state school for long time school staff have be stretch themselves extremely thin to meet the need of their student like butter spread over too much bread have see it at first hand it should not be this hard so welcome with open arm the investment in education the billion increase to the core school budget will increase funding per pupil in real term this budget commit we to recruit thousand of new teacher in key subject every child deserve to be teach by qualified teacher in every subject student also deserve to be teach in school building that will not collapse so the announcement of billion to improve the condition of the school estate be very welcome have meet parent in my constituency from farnley and robin hood to wortley and tingley and have hear about their experience of the special educational need and disability system some of their story be devastating as teacher have see that the system be fail so the billion announce by the chancellor for send provision be big step in the right direction for family across leeds south west and morley every child with send or otherwise deserve the opportunity to succeed in education this budget lay the foundation to rebuild education and to rebuild britain it be budget that unapologetically invest in britain future the people of leeds south west and morley vote for change in july this budget deliver that and then some if there be one phrase that occur repeatedly on the doorstep in bicester and woodstock during the general election it be ve always vote conservative but never do that again voter talk about cost of living crisis high interest rate raise mortgage and rent and stealth taxis hit low income pensioner all of which they blame on conservative ministers who be more interested in hold office than govern well be in no doubt that this new labour government inherit poisoned chalice and have as the chancellor say in her speech face some tough choice today debate be focus on protect work people my constituent in bicester and woodstock have share their view on how well the chancellor choice have meet that goal most prominent in the chancellor tax change be the increase to employer national insurance contribution speak to the owner of small café and leisure business in my constituency they employ small team of staff many of whom have be with the business for year few of they work full time and some be student or school pupil who work one shift give the increase in employer nic and the failure to reform business rate the owner tell that this budget will take they to the edge financially regret that the chancellor do not listen to the liberal democrats recommendation to raise taxis from those with the broad shoulder reverse the tax cut that the conservatives give to the big bank and levy modest tax on social medium company the chancellor say there would be no tax rise for work people but small business owner in my constituency would disagree two week ago the national audit office report that the send system be break in the urgent question on that report speak about zak who live in my constituency and whose young life have be deeply affect by the shortcoming in the send system both of zak parent have have to stop work and move on to universal credit so that they can care for and educate zak at home welcome the billion in new funding to help local authority address send deficit but we need to do more we need much more ambitious approach to improve the support we give young people and their family the liberal democrats support the chancellor commitment to public sector investment after year of neglect under the previous government so welcome her confirmation that she have commit to fund the east west rail project which run through my constituency however the document provide by the treasury and the department for transport do not clarify whether share of that new funding will be ringfence to keep open london road in bicester which connect our town since as county councillor and now as an mp have be press east west rail and ministers to commit to funding that in that time there have be four prime ministers and five rail ministers hope this new government will now commit to find solution that will avoid bicester be cut in two may start by extend huge congratulation to everybody who have give their maiden speech today also congratulate my right hon friend the work and pensions secretary on her opening speech and the chancellor on her budget this be an incredibly progressive budget it recognise the real hardship that family on low income have face over the last year and address they by extend and uplift the living wage and by reduce deduction for those on universal credit and the standard allowance which be significant burden on people on the low income include those in work ultimately what we will do on increase the personal tax allowance will be important for increase people income get britain back to work be an important endeavour and entirely support it we must recognise that we have nearly million people of working age who be not in work education or training because they be not well over the past decade and particularly over the past seven year we have see decline in life expectancy and healthy life expectancy in area like mine particularly for woman that mean that people who be expect to work be not in position to work the investment in the nhs will make massive difference by address our ill health we be poorly nation but it will also mean that we can help to grow our economy want to touch on report that be produce six year ago but be still relevant today indeed the relevance of its analysis have probably increase the health be wealth report by the northern health science alliance argue that in order to improve our productivity and growth we must improve our health those eminent epidemiologist and public health academic bring the evidence together to enable they to make those estimation and they calculate that improve the health of the north to the level of the rest of england would increase productivity by billion year so urge the government to consider update this piece of work and also to consider how we can ensure that our nhs allocation reflect the health need in these area this be budget of broken promise some of my constituency be agricultural land the reform to agricultural property relief and business property relief will effectively be the end of the family farm on back british farming day two month ago labour members proudly stand by the massey ferguson outside the palace but farming be more than photo opportunity careful environmental stewardship that come from long term family ownership be put at risk by this policy the impact also extend to tenant farmer if the availability of land to rent be reduce as result of carve up all our small farm new entrant farmer who will begin their career on let holding be deny their opportunity to start just at the point when we should be encourage they for the future urge hon and right hon member as well as anyone else watch this debate to join the thousand of other who be sign our petition to stop this the village pub be another core pillar of my rural constituency speak recently in westminster hall about the essential importance of these institution to the rural way of life and about how this government should continue the business rate relief so be very disappointed to see that this rate will be cut to particularly at time when many rural pub be struggle to remain viable and all of this be while the chancellor increase employer national insurance contribution cause great distress in the hospitality industry this tax hike will result in job lose small and medium sized business squeeze and enterprise damage the chancellor appear to be punch drunk on labour election victory but the british public be go to suffer the ultimate hangover can also stress one point for caution as the vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on investment fraud and fair financial service appreciate that the chancellor want to ensure that everyone pay what they owe and in timely fashion but urge the government to ensure that any victim of historical pension and investment fraud be protect enforcement action against victim should be suspend and hmrc should be instruct to use its wide discretion in debt forgiveness hmrc should focus on pursue those who orchestrate the scheme and on recover steal fund from the fraudster rather than target the victim the market dislike this budget and my constituent will be penalise by this budget so who want this budget be this really what labour members want ask the many labour members who now represent rural constituency do they stand for election to end the family farm do those who owe their seat to the pensioner who show up in huge number at the polling station stand for election to make they cold this winter we on this side will not relent in our opposition to this catalogue of broken promise first would like to congratulate those who make their maiden speech represent fantastic place right across the uk give today theme of protect work people think it would be worth remind conservative members of the real impact of the last year of failure million people use food bank more than child plunge into poverty mortgage cost nearly double the bad pay rise since the disabled people commit suicide due to reform to their benefit mental health bad than at any time on record more people sleep rough and more family without their own home the conservative party continue to deny to justify and to refuse to apologise to those people right across the country and in my constituency of milton keynes central it be time for new deal for the people of the uk in fact that be what they vote for and just as new deal have historically pull country out of darkness this budget aim to do the same president roosevelt say the test of our progress be not whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much it be whether we provide enough for those who have too little like fdr plan that be what this budget do it immediately give economic relief by increase the minimum wage raise carer allowance threshold make the benefit system more understanding of individual circumstance and allocate billion to those with special educational need it also make sure that we be fund our recovery as well as funding and prioritise science and innovation further education infrastructure affordable housing lower energy cost and expand childcare and it also promise to build back well with reform to our public service after year of failure under the conservative opposite this budget will provide ambition hope and stability for britain and its people last week budget and its investment in the national health service be of course welcome by the liberal democrats just as we welcome the clawing back of money for carer where in many case the government make mistake the raising of the earning limit be also very welcome as my hon friend the member for torbay steve darling make clear in taunton and across somerset we be wait to hear about musgrove park hospital temporary building build for the us army in still serve as its maternity unit in the summer heat cause staff to faint and rain seep through hole in the roof during the rest of the year we be wait to hear whether that project will make it into the billion investment plan as we hope it will the hospital need to know so that it can plan recognise that the government be seek to provide investment certainty and stability of economic policy which be something we have not see in this country in recent year that aim at least be world away from the empty stunt of the previous conservative government who promise taunton whole new hospital which be not found on any kind of reality that be disgrace and we need more stable investment landscape investment be welcome but it have to drive growth and bring in private sector investment the opening of wellington and cullompton station be an absolute priority for my constituency no other project be so close to the end of its detailed design and have such strong benefit cost accord to treasury figure the knock on benefit for housing transport employment and investment be huge sadly however the project be on hold with inflation on million project it have cost we every day since the pause in july the chancellor tell from the dispatch box in july that wellington station will go ahead and hope that will not be disappoint have say

to that it do not matter how cleverly word their manifesto be these tax raise be undoubtedly not in the spirit of the sentiment on which labour entire election campaign be found small business have be leave reel by the measure impose on they duncan blake be gp at the priory fields practice in huntingdon recently visit the practice and discuss some of the challenge it face he warn how the increase in national insurance contribution and the lowering of the threshold will serve only to undermine access and patient care in addition to the significant financial pressure that gp practice already face practice such as priory fields be wed to the nhs and dependent upon it for funding there be no ability to increase price to absorb increase cost gp practice be not eligible for employment

of the labour party on this issue be breathtake at last year country land and business association conference the now environment secretary state that we have no intention of change apr the cla have say that the change could harm uk farm declare it betrayal that put dynamite beneath the livelihood of british farming the prime minister and the environment secretary be more than happy to leverage

life article and photoshoot in september last year in which he say the need for stability now be urgent farmer need to plan for the long term more than ever before doubt farmer be expect that long term planning to include be force to sell of their farm make they unviable or take loan to cover those cost potentially saddle the next generation with debt that farming be not profitable enough to repay only yesterday the chancellor state on the bbc that only very small number of agricultural property will be affect million farm be acre accord to defra agricultural fact summary publish the day after the budget on october the average uk farm size be just over acre how can the chancellor make her claim when the relevant government department have itself contradict her position give the speed and alacrity with which the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have cover the countryside with solar panel it should come as no surprise that the government be so eager to force farmer out of business free up swathe of the countryside to be sell to developer for more of the same the government will be force into row back on this policy whether it be now or after the visual spectacle of demonstrate farmer blockade parliament square with tractor urge the government to do the right thing now rather than be force to do so in few week this weekend hold surgery at great place call the st giles centre in copmanthorpe the day start with coffee morning and end with beer festival thankfully be not misunderstood when request strong brew but sadly hear some sobering story from my constituent meet one constituent stick in housing full of damp another battle for an education health and care plan and sub postmaster yet to receive compensation these be the everyday tragedy that our constituent face after year of failure the budget matter to they because they have be let down for far too long and this historic budget the first ever deliver by woman rise to the challenge work people want the government to give they bang for their buck we say that we would protect work people payslip and that be exactly what we do let start with education know the pressure that school face under the tories not least because my wife be genuinely inspirational teacher so be pleased that we have turn the page with billion increase in the core school budget the recruitment of new teacher and action on the reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete crisis constituent recently write to about their child who have be unable to attend full school full time since the start of due to insufficient funding to support their additional need due to the crisis in special educational need and disability funding as every day go by that child lose crucial opportunity to develop key social skill but the extra billion of funding real term increase that we have commit to will change that our school will get the support they need under this labour government my right hon friend the secretary of state for work and pensions open today debate and know that the labour government as they do from to will do everything in their power to bring down poverty be also delighted that extra resource will be dedicate to tackle fraudster after the crown prosecution service recently prosecute an advanced organise crime group that defraud taxpayer in an industrial scale benefit fraud welcome the anti fraud funding announcement be proud that the government be make the most of tough economic inheritance and meet the need of my constituent do however welcome the previous comment of the right hon member for north west essex mrs badenoch on budgets she praise fuel duty freeze back build more home welcome extra pothole funding and support increase the national living wage so presume that during her first appearance at the dispatch box as leader of the opposition on wednesday she will welcome this budget our budget be downpayment to get our future back it will protect work people and we should be proud of it this year in bath alone more than patient wait over hour in get see quickly can be matter of life and death and with lot of extra funding now come forward my constituent in bath must see tangible change quickly welcome the extra investment in the nhs but would have like to have hear direct mention of eat disorder service in the budget eat disorder be national emergency they have the high mortality rate among mental health disorder and there be over million sufferer in the uk the illness have see an alarming rise especially since covid yet the current service and funding be fraction of what be require between and for example eat disorder account for just of the uk mental health research funding charity be become completely overwhelmed amid nhs capacity issue the charity sweda in my constituency see increase in people seek support in compare to pre pandemic figure we can not depend on charity to plug the gap it be unforgivable that since the urgent referral waiting time target for child and adolescent eat disorder service be set in they have never be achieve at the end of more than child have enter treatment for an eat disorder but of they be wait over three month three time the target for routine referral even more alarmingly an access and waiting time standard do not even exist for adult delay to eat disorder treatment can be fatal some sufferer be now be tell that they be too ill to be treat and the only treatment offer be palliative care this be tragic and totally unacceptable eat disorder be treatable and sufferer can make full recovery it be shameful beyond word to give up on they urge the government to take eat disorder seriously and ensure that service be meet the need of sufferer and that the funding that be so desperately need be make available would like to say more about care provider but do not have time urge the government to look at they in the round not just to make exemption for public service provider congratulate the new leader of the opposition on her election she say that she will be honest about what her party get wrong over the last year but listen to she on tv yesterday and all that she would admit be that under her party standard have start to slip standard have start to slip that be the understatement of the decade seven million people on nhs waiting list taxis at year high and mortgage shoot up by hundred of pound overnight that be not standard slip that be take wreck ball to our public service and our economy that be why people vote for change this labour budget start to deliver that change instead of austerity we be choose investment in public service instead of economic chaos we be choose growth and to pay for it because clear up the conservatives mess have to be pay for we be choose to protect work people pay packet with no increase in national insurance or income tax in work people pay packet in fact all of the people in ealing southall who be on the national minimum wage will receive more money in their pay packet because of this labour budget raise the youth rate to an hour be great first step towards achieve equality for young worker in ealing southall and hundred of carer in ealing southall will be able to earn more money and still get their allowance last month visit west ealing jobcentre which be the big in west london more than staff work there but when ask what help disabled person could get to go back to work they do not have an answer as trade unionist represent disabled worker for many year so many of they want to work but be push out of their job because there be no support there be million people off work on long term sickness absence many would love to work but the health service be not set up to support they and jobcentre do not have the right tool to help that be why welcome this labour budget investment of million to get britian work many of my constituent in ealing southall want job but they need help with english and with their cv and they need mental health support so the secretary of state plan to bring jobcentre career service skill provider and health service together will make huge difference today debate be about work people but litter and fly tipping be so important to my resident and well run council such as ealing be face severe budget pressure the spring comprehensive spending review be an opportunity to ensure that ealing have the resource to deliver for resident from clean the street to social care austerity and economic chaos be the choice of the previous conservative government if the opposition would like to make different choice this be their chance to put those choice forward we have hear nothing today this labour government be proudly and purposely choose growth choose investment in public service and choose to protect work people pay packet the chancellor budget last week be shocking demonstration of economic illiteracy the government often speak about growth but all the budget show be disdain for wealth creator and it betray family business and farmer reminiscent of the damage that the labour party cause in the conservative members know that we can not tax our way to growth my constituent in meriden and solihull east be particularly dismay by the trail of broken manifesto commitment and the high debt burden and tax burden with taxis be put up by billion they be particularly angry about the disdain show for our rural community and small business the government often talk about they be the lifeblood of our community but that be more than just slogan will focus on farming in the limited time have as the proud representative of number of family farm speak on behalf of many constituent who be appal by the budget our farmer work seven day week day year to keep food on our table and they nurture our green and pleasant land they work no matter the weather and be vulnerable to it like no other worker in any other industry in the country the chancellor argue that the tax on family farm be necessary to support our public service but she clearly fail to recognise that those farm also provide public service they put food on our table ensure our food security and protect our rural heritage the chancellor betrayal of our rural community through the family farm tax will have damaging consequence for farmer and everyone in the country welcome the intervention from jeremy clarkson and the nfu president tim bradshaw who today make argument about the deepen mental health crisis in our rural community the chancellor must recognise that farming be not hobby or pastime for the land class it be an engine that drive our food security and sustain our rural community farmer do not have huge bank account to pay death tax bill the budget will lead to an exodus of farmer undermine our food security and make everyone more vulnerable to global instability we should not be surprise by the measure the labour party include only word on the farming industry in its manifesto which think be particularly disrespectful would talk about the billion that our small business contribute to our high street but will talk instead about fuel duty my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith be very kind to mention early but there be conservative members of parliament who write to the chancellor and people sign the petition just two week ago government briefing reveal that they be go to raise fuel duty by we be able to force turn and protect the freeze on fuel duty what do this labour party stand for it do not stand for small business on the high street it do not stand for our farm or rural community it do not stand for hard work family and it certainly do not stand for work people congratulate hon friend who have make maiden speech today be proud to stand in support of this labour budget the first labour budget in year and the first ever budget present by female chancellor the budget deliver the large settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution it mean an additional billion for the scottish government to spend in this financial year and an additional billion next year the uk labour government be deliver total of billion for scotland budget in it be notable that on yet another day of debate on the budget not single scottish national party member have choose to grace these green benches the budget keep our promise to the people of scotland end the era of austerity and provide billion for investment in our public service it be truly redistributive budget that ensure that those who have the least benefit the most the word redistribution will not be welcome for some opposition members but the vast majority of my paisley and renfrewshire south constituent do not have the luxury of private jet travel they would be happy with an improvement to the bus service between johnstone and paisley which of course the scottish government at holyrood might be able to deliver if they choose to invest this record break settlement in our public service welcome the increase in the national living wage massive improvement deliver in the budget that mean an extra on average for full time worker and be significant move towards deliver genuine living wage one that will directly benefit over people across renfrewshire the snp must now ensure that the additional funding be provide directly to our local public service and reach the frontline to bring down the waiting list in our nhs raise attainment in our school and bridge the million budget gap face our local council in scotland commend the budget to the house while welcome aspect of the budget include investment in the nhs and the review of carer allowance want to express my deep concern about the negative impact that this budget will have on family farm and rural community farmer in my constituency be already navigate immense financial challenge from the rise cost of machinery and equipment to punish weather pattern repeat heatwave and flooding and now face increase in national insurance contribution and change to agricultural property relief for derek wilkinson one of the hard work farmer in my constituency the increase to national insurance contribution could mean in extra cost this year alone reduce the amount of money available for investment in the farm with the change to agricultural property relief the government risk impose family farm tax that could sound the death knell for countless small family own farm across the uk farming be way of life often pass on from generation to generation but the next generation of farmer face tax bill just to be able to continue to farm these change be not only unfair but deeply short sighted without support family farm will increasingly fall into the hand of large multinational corporation erode our rural community and threaten our domestic food security for example as one of my family farming constituent write to today land value be much high than the earning capacity it hold if my constituent be to sell part of their land or another asset to pay the tax bill that would render their business unviable farmer be not only custodian of the land they be the backbone of our rural economy yet under this budget they will be force to make painful cut or in the bad case sell their land the government should focus on reverse tax cut for the big bank and ask large corporation such as the social medium giant to pay their fair share rather than place the burden on hard work farmer and rural business if we truly value our farmer we must protect not only their ability to continue to farm and plan for succession but britain proud tradition of small independent family farm farm with root stretch back generation farm land be not merely financial asset it be legacy of community stewardship sustainability and high standard of food production we must stand by our rural community and ensure family farm have the support they need to thrive for generation to come so urge the government to review their policy so that family farm be not penalise this be budget for change budget that recognise the need to fix the foundation of our economy for too long million of people across the country have be deny opportunity to work and build well life too many child be grow up in poverty harm their life chance in warrington south there be now more child in poverty than there be in and more than of those child come from home where parent work sadly in some part of my constituency child poverty rate be as high as but poverty be not just statistic behind every number be person poverty be barrier that stand between potential and reality between dream and opportunity and it be unacceptable that there be parent and carer in warrington south who go hungry just to ensure their child can have an evening meal poverty affect every aspect of person life from their average life expectancy to their general health their social wellbeing what grade they can achieve at school and their ability to contribute to society across warrington south and across the country people be badly let down by the last government with their legacy of economic chaos fall living standard and break public service therefore welcome this government plan to tackle these issue drive down poverty and rebuild our public service this be budget that protect the payslip of work people and will boost pay for over million of the lowest pay worker with an increase to the minimum wage it be plan to get britain work again with trailblaze devolution agreement in work and skill and more than billion of additional funding for the nhs to cut waiting time increase appointment and help to get people back to work look forward to meet with the health secretary to discuss warrington hospital we will employ more teacher to support the next generation to achieve their full potential and roll out breakfast club across the country because no child should go to school hungry we be support people across warrington south by preserve the pension triple lock and increase pension reduce the cap on deduction from universal credit increase carer allowance and provide more than billion in household support funding allocate an additional billion to expand childcare and allocate additional funding to transform the apprenticeship levy into growth and skill levy in july this country vote for change we vote to treat people with dignity and respect to lift up the vulnerable and to offer hope and opportunity for all this budget mark the first step in new direction we will fix the foundation and rebuild our public service this be an old labour budget it increase spending by billion year fund by an extra billion in taxis and billion in borrowing be sure the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn be very proud of the chancellor this will lead to high inflation high interest rate and high national debt not my word but the view of the office for budget responsibility if the british people have vote for such budget would not like it but would not complain in its manifesto the labour party say it would increase spending by billion it say its proposal be fully cost and fully fund that be the mandate on which it be elect so where do the figure of billion come from even if we believe the fairy story of the black hole plus do not equal when my party say that labour plan would mean tax rise worth for every work family the chancellor call we liar in fairness we be wrong the actual figure turn out to be ever since the election the chancellor have repeat the canard that her poor economic inheritance justify these enormous tax and spending increase but we know that labour always intend to increase taxis and borrow by far more than it admit to the british public this be budget of broken promise that will hit my constituency hard bridgwater be home to many small and medium sized business those sme be run by people who work hard generate wealth and provide employment for other in their community their reward from labour be tax rise that will cost they year to employ someone earn the new minimum wage that will reduce the number of people employ it will reduce private investment labour increase in inheritance tax be spiteful attack on those with family business and farm it be an attack on aspiration and enterprise this government have little understanding that even modest farm require great deal of capital in the form of land building and machinery if this be tax at on the death of the owner that will lead to family farm be break up which will damage our rural community and undermine britain food security labour policy will damage britain and make we all the poor it be clear that lot of tories do not like this budget but that be not because it raise taxis because after all they themselves raise taxis to post war high why do they not like it they do not like it because this budget expose their model of low pay low investment economy model that have totally fail it fail to produce anything other than anaemic growth dire productivity and broken public service among the few mea culpa utter by those on the opposition benches in the last few day be the admission that the last government have indeed waste huge amount of money but just as damn be the huge amount of talent and potential that they waste under this budget people who want to work will get the work the pay and the dignity they deserve the tories let down parent who have be hold back by lack of affordable costed childcare they let down young people on the minimum wage be delighted that the minimum wage be now rise to an hour for to year old they let down people in work on universal credit people struggle to feed their family in rochdale the number of child in relative poverty rise from in to staggering in most damn of all however be the spiral economic inactivity that the conservatives preside over record million people lock out of work due to long term sickness that be just one reason why the billion this budget direct to the nhs be desperately need by grind down our public service the last government pile cost upon cost for ordinary people think of the number of people force to spend thousand of pound go private for hip or knee op an operation they should have have for free on the nhs think of the thousand of pound worth of damage to car cause by pothole on road leave to rot think of those force to fork out for taxi to get to work to the shop or to hospital because their local bus have not turn up or the train have be cancel think of all the experienced talent leave the nhs our school and our police force because their pay be cut in real term and they face crippling staff shortage on daily basis those be the people to whom we owe debt of gratitude and investment the new leader of the opposition claim yesterday that partygate have be overblown yet the define image of partygate be low pay cleaner and security staff in no have to clean up the vomit the broken bottle and the wine stain leave behind by an entitle few this government now have to clean up the financial mess that the tories have leave behind and fix the public service that they break this budget be strongly promote as blueprint for growth so it have come as considerable surprise to find that the growth forecast for the second half of this parliament have actually go down somewhere hide here be much well budget try to get out the government have try to target what be suppose to be bastion of wealth and privilege but catch in the crossfire be all kind of people they never mean to touch the winter fuel payment cut be suppose to fall on wealthy pensioner who do not really need the money but it will also hit vulnerable people on basic state pension vat on private schooling be suppose to tax the etons and harrows of the world but it also hit hundred of small school such as pennthorpe preparatory school in my constituency which play key role in provide for send child and christ hospital remarkable school that take of its pupil from disadvantaged background the change in inheritance tax be aim at wealthy farmer but also threaten to wipe out fantastic tradition of family farming that have literally shape our countryside over generation wherever we look there be just too much collateral damage but the big rise the one that be do all the heavy lifting be the jump in employer national insurance surely it be not the chancellor intention to undermine gp surgery hospice independent care home and grow business yet that be exactly what be set to happen realise that the last government leave so many public service in crisis that it would be impossible to fix everything at once they raid vital investment fund for day to day spending they never understand that strong public service be just as essential to economic growth as business friendly regulation the last chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash jeremy hunt behave recklessly when he twice cut employee national insurance rate in the tooth of warning from the international monetary fund he dig the hole and now the country have slide gently into it however swing from one ideological extreme to another be not the solution this budget feel suspiciously like labour circa but at that time the country be in well shape and the same plan will not work twice this budget be serious attempt to deal with the crisis in public service and respect that but the original vision have be lose in translation this be growth budget but without the growth urge the chancellor to refocus around her original first principle growth this budget set out the first step in the work and pensions secretary plan to drive up opportunity and drive down poverty in every corner of the land the choice make in this house have real and lasting consequence the state of our country today be direct result of the action of the conservative party over the past year in my short time as an mp have receive thousand of piece of correspondence from constituent young man who recently write to be thrilled to have pass his drive theory test yet the system simply can not accommodate he the early appointment for practical test be six month away have hear from father who have be try for two year to find an nhs dentist who will register his young daughter as patient have have an email from woman with severe mobility issue who be trap in her front room while stick on waiting list for suitable social housing even if house become available she will have to compete with other resident because there simply be not enough affordable home those example paint picture of life in britain after year of conservative failing now under this labour government and with this new budget there be at last glimpse of hope be delighted that the budget will bring billion into our nhs together with my fellow bolton members of parliament be determined to fight for local dentist service and to secure development at royal bolton hospital especially in the maternity unit where raac have be detect also highlight the billion for house building and billion for the warm home plan

by billion spend by billion and borrow by billion there be no mandate whatever for this budget agree with one claim make by the chancellor our economy do need investment to grow the pity be that her budget will fail to do it the red book say that the capital budget for the department for transport will be cut by by the chancellor say that she want to crowd in private investment but the obr say that her budget crowd it out we know that much of the public investment will be waste on the energy secretary scheme the chancellor be give he borrow billion to guarantee return to investor for technology that the market do not back because the chancellor have change the accounting rule something that in opposition she say she would not do we know that the cost of fail investment will be hide and they will be present as asset with fictional value this be where the chancellor be lead we into dangerous territory she have already make government borrow more expensive and the bond market be tricky than they be british pension fund now own only about quarter of outstanding gilt demand be fall as define benefit scheme have close and exist scheme mature the value of gilt need to be sell each year be about billion which be of gdp and gilt yield have rise since the budget even if interest rate be cut this week they will stay high for long because of her decision and for what the chancellor admit that growth in gdp per capita will average only year for the rest of the decade she be tax family farm she be tax business and gps she be tax job and business be already plan to reduce headcount we know she will be back for more because she will not cut departmental budget as she forecast from we know that the priority be not growth if it be the chancellor would not have announce such relentlessly anti business budget instead the priority be labour own vested interest because if public sector productivity be the goal why hose money at the union without link pay to reform and why make it easy to strike where be the supply side plan to reduce the cost of build infrastructure there be no sign that the government want to strip back the layer of regulation when its beneficiary be labour support vested interest such as environmental and administrative lawyer this budget do not fail because of its dishonesty and absence of mandate but because it fail in its own term it tax and borrow and spend and its own small print say that it will fail to improve growth wage public service and the public finance every child deserve access to quality tailor education and

transform dudley into hub where tradition meet innovation through these investment dudley can become central player in the uk journey to sustainable growth bolster our economy and create high pay job that attract talent after year of stagnant growth it be time to push forward with this budget my constituent will have be listen to the chancellor last week and hop for some specific on new money for

photo with of light fitting that fall from the ceiling in the delivery suite during active labour only minute before the baby arrive we be disappoint to get letter from the minister for secondary care the hon member for bristol south karin smyth in the past couple of week to say that the government be unable to commit the funding need to fix the problem we have have some encouraging indication from the chancellor about funding but there be lack of clarity on what this budget mean for stepping hill our health and social care system be in crisis we need to ensure that everyone can see gp within seven day and that we support our hospice and fund dental service and we should not subject gps hospice and dentist to substantial tax rise as the budget have do we need to prevent people from need to go into hospital in the first place and enable they to leave when they be medically fit to do so rather than have they wait on ward for far too long for social care placement to be sort for they real action on social care be essential because without it the nhs crisis will not end encourage the government to urgently start cross party talk to make social care sustainable as the lib dem home affair spokesperson be hop to hear more about proper community and neighbourhood policing if have have another couple of minute would have make an incisive point about bus fare the budget be strong first step in deliver well future for our country for town such as westhoughton horwich blackrod and bolton and for restore the trust that be so vital for our democratic system after all this be budget that will increase the national living wage by for full time worker and invest billion in the nhs so that my constituent can access health service when and where they need they instead of wait hour on end as well as crack down on fraud tax avoidance and waste so that every penny of taxpayer money be put to good use fully fund the electrification of the bolton to wigan train line will make tremendous difference to the rail network for those travel to work and to see love one in my constituency commend the government for commit to invest in public infrastructure across the bolton borough parent teacher and school staff across my constituency have tell time and again that current funding for education be simply inadequate that be why be so pleased to see an extra billion for special educational need the breakfast club budget triple and billion increase in the core school budget particularly welcome the additional billion allocate to rebuild school note that st bernard roman catholic primary school in my constituency be find to contain aerate concrete the conservative party increase taxis to their high rate for work people in more than year so welcome the raising of much

the record my sheer admiration for constituent of mine clive smith who be chair of the haemophilia society and have long fight for compensation follow the infected blood scandal this have be long and

potentially the one who close the farm gate for the very last time after generation of put investment innovation love blood sweat and tear into business well know how that feel because my brother be in exactly that position have listen to my farming friend and neighbour who be desperately anxious that this could be the final nail in the coffin for their cherished business the labour party be not the natural party of farmer fear that its misunderstanding of agricultural community have be reflect in its policy apr play significant role in the economic viability and continuity of family farm it exist to provide confidence to family who rely on their farm as their main income source so that the next generation could continue to provide for both their family and the nation some farmer who be near retirement if they have the time the money or the foresight may be able to swallow some of the government new family farm tax with careful succession planning say some farmer because many will not make it to retirement it be their family that be most worried about agriculture be the most dangerous industry in britian farmer be time more likely to have fatal accident than those who be work

and across this country and commend it to the house if have time would focus on the increase in whisky duty and the impact on our farmer and small business but will focus on the oil and gas sector which be so crucial to the north east of scotland and my constituency as expect the oil and gas sector be target for tax in the budget welcome that first year allowance be retain but other measure be announce that although well trail will severely damage the energy sector whether it be increase the energy profit levy by which will lead to tax rate on our oil and gas business extend the windfall tax to or remove investment allowance each will compound the investment difficulty face the sector and will impact investment and future job the change to the windfall tax and allowance will see the treasury receive of cashflow from oil and gas with company take home just that be the high share of any government compare to other comparable offshore mature basin globally the punitive taxation on our oil and gas sector put current real job and career opportunity in the north east of scotland at risk work people who be the same people with the skill and expertise that we need for our energy transition be not be protect by the budget the windfall tax and the removal of investment allowance also hit homegrown uk base company the hard the one that have emerge and grow in north east scotland and the one that usually have an almost exclusively uk base workforce all their profit be subject to the windfall tax because their investment be all in the north sea that be unlike multinational which can buffer the bad impact of the windfall taxis with their overseas investment so the change be mostly hurt our homegrown business which we should all want to protect the most the budget have deliver long overdue increase in the living wage welcome measure to tackle tax avoidance and money for public service however the reality be that there be widespread fear that the investment be not on the scale need and that be before we consider the further cut on departments now be impose we need complete re set introduce wealth tax could have be one way of begin to deliver have already have lot of representation from constituent raise concern about today topic of social security for example the choice to cut social security in real term give that the uplift do not match forecasted inflation the continuation of the conservatives freeze on personal tax allowance to and the reintroduction of the freeze on local housing allowance the sad reality be that million will still be leave unable to cover essential in east london we know this very well we have some of the high rate of child poverty in the entire country last year the safe neighbourhood team in my borough find that the most shoplift item be calpol that be an utterly devastating statistic reflect heartbreaking desperation in that light ask the government to rethink the measure to scrap immunity for low value shoplifting the budget be an opportunity to deliver the change that be so needed but disappointingly punitive measure such as the two child limit the benefit cap and the sanction regime remain in the short time have remain want to say something about disability benefit the commitment to deliver the previously plan saving be more than alarming the truth be that the way disabled people have be treat by the department for work and pensions since will go down in history as terrible and inexcusable crime there be extensive evidence about the serious harm cause to people subject to dehumanising assessment and sanction include report of death directly relate to the social security regime we need long term overhaul of the social security system it be not fit for purpose urge the government to really look at that in detail go forward thank you madam deputy speaker for save the good till last as cheltenham be always because be liberal of generous spirit will begin by thank ministers thank they for listen to the many appeal have make since my election that they study the case study for investment in cheltenham cyber security industry after lot of talk and be lead merry dance by the previous

weekend local authority fee they tell be expect to rise by less than below the minimum wage increase and that be before national insurance rise be account for one chief executive tell that provider will close down and reduce residential and nursing capacity at time when we need exactly the opposite to happen there be also concern from the primary care sector hear this weekend from dr bob hodges the chair of the gloucestershire local medical committee who say that the most likely result of the budget change to national insurance be that the money to fund increase national insurance cost be likely to come straight out of the pot from which gps be pay he say that risk burn good will with knock on impact on morale and working practice and he fear that over time it would reduce the number of work gps start with thank let end by urge ministers to reconsider some of those point call the shadow minister it be privilege to close this debate on behalf of his majesty loyal opposition it have be about protect work people give that many labour members again forget to mention the pandemic and the war on our continent have have to meet some of their remark with degree of incredulity this budget consist purely of broken promise show that this new government have transparently leave their integrity in tatter as we hear from my hon friend the member for keighley and ilkley robbie moore

very loyal speech and rightly welcome new money for scotland she champion redistribution but if we tax our way to diminish growth there be nothing to share or invest we should all be remind of that my

who regularly bemoan the lack of representation of working class and progressive movement and their history in this palace in business question in he say certain element in our constitution be well represent in the palace of westminster with statue portrait and stain glass window but there be almost total absence of memorial to progressive group such as the chartists that do so much to shape all that be good in our modern democracy official report july vol perhaps we might take the opportunity of the anniversary of the newport rise to ensure that lesser celebrate part of our heritage be reflect among the many wonder across the parliamentary estate thank the hon member for bring forward tonight debate so that we can pay special tribute to the role that wales have play in form our democracy over the year but be she not concerned that the propose new system for election in wales whereby one vote will return six senedd members threaten to undermine the spirit of democracy as the chartists understand it be sure that it do not will not be draw into talk about the welsh election in tonight debate but it be system that have be devise by the welsh senedd and vote on and be sure that it be one in which people will be able to participate fully when the election come in the message of the chartists be more important than ever especially today on the eve of the us election and amid global turmoil we have witness russia invasion of ukraine electoral uncertainty in moldova increase threat to taiwan from china and more threat to democracy globally be manifest in different way but all combine to make people feel that politic and democracy can not fix anything yet have our say from vote to engage with our politician take part in public consultation or demonstrating matter and make difference we live in world where more people than at any time in history be able to have say in who make the rule as all of we who sit in this place say every vote count and can make difference know that the foreign secretary and his fellow ministers will hold to account and take action against those who seek to cynically undermine and degrade the integrity of democracy around the world include our own and support those fighting to protect they close to home year after the newport rise work people use those same hard win right this summer to return majority of labour mp in each nation and region of great britain deliver government determine to change our country for the first time in year be proud to be part of labour government in westminster who will over the course of the next five year deliver on our manifesto promise to double down on the chartist legacy to strengthen our democracy in the interest of work people and to restore public trust in politic as force for good the hon lady epitomise the very thing that the newport chartists stand for and congratulate she on that what she refer to affect everywhere in the united kingdom the people of northern ireland realise that they should also try to achieve working class right so what people do in newport mean the same for we in northern ireland agree and thank the hon member for make that point this government will respond to the struggle of work people and will not duck the necessary but difficult decision for fear of be unpopular we will follow the example set by our welsh labour government by extend the right to vote in all election to and year old if someone can leave school work full time and join the army they can be trust to have their say in the country future this government have already introduce the house of lords hereditary peers bill to remove hereditary peer because power should not be the inherent right of select and aristocratic few this government will establish an independent ethic and integrity commission strengthen the role of the independent adviser on ministerial standard update the ministerial code modernise and reform house of commons procedure ban mps second job address the inconsistency in voter id rule that prevent people from voting and introduce an election bill be proud that the previous labour government bring in devolution to wales and scotland it be significant that for the first time in year we have uk prime minister commit not to the fail tory experiment of muscular unionism but to return power to those with skin in the game so that we be more directly answerable and intimately connect to local people and their need and to labour government in westminster work with rather than against our welsh labour government to deliver for the people of wales that be big change if the chartists teach we anything it be that westminster do not always know good warmly welcome the private member bill of my hon friend the member for edinburgh north and leith tracy gilbert which would bring consistency in voter registration by enable the welsh and scottish governments to allow online application for proxy and postal vote in local election it would be good if the minister give more detail on the government plan to strengthen the integrity of election and encourage wide participation our constituent would expect no less from the united kingdom than for national and regional leader to work together to change our country and build well future the establishment of the council of the nations and regions be welcome step to ensure that while we be deliver on our commitment to push power out of westminster we do not repeat the mistake of devolve and forget can the minister reassure that that new engagement framework will be regular and reliable and will not fade with time on this anniversary of the newport rise let we remember the legacy that those involve in it leave we vote voice and more than that vision vision for the future that challenge we to protect those freedom and use they powerfully to confront injustice build unity and keep hope alive for all let we ensure that the new labour government carry forward
