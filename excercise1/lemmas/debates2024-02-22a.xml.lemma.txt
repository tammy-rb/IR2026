member productiivity digital tools with permission madam deputy speaker would like to update the house on the conflict in ukraine as we prepare to mark two year since the start of the full scale russian invasion like many in this house remember exactly where be on february just before sunrise be wake by phone call to be tell that russia have illegally invade ukraine and that car would be outside at am head for cobra after that meeting ministers be all ask to speak to their respective ukrainian counterpart at the time be transport secretary and my arrangement be to speak via zoom with my then opposite number oleksandr kubrakov oleksandr who have subsequently get to know very well be stand in the middle of field outside kyiv ask he about the situation and he tell that quite frankly he do not know how much long the city would last the russian army be understand to be just kilometre away the wolf or in this case the russian bear be literally at the door and expert opinion suggest that kyiv would be take in perhaps three day however as this war drag into its third year far from win russia have be push back since those early day putin have achieve none of his strategic objective his invade force have suffer staggering casualty and ukraine have destroy or damage about of the russian black sea fleet and retake of the territory that russia steal from it meanwhile oleksandr kubrakov be now the deputy prime minister and his job be the restoration of ukraine when this be over putin arrogantly assume that this conflict would be over in day and he be wrong he reckon without the strength of the international support that would rally to ukraine cause be proud that over the course of the past day britain have be at the forefront of that global response our effort always step ahead of our ally have make genuine difference from the outset we declassify intelligence specifically to scupper russian false flag our nlaw anti tank missile provide in advance of the full scale invasion and our javelins help brave ukrainians devastate putin menacing mile armoured convoy which be head directly at kyiv we be the first to send main battle tank with our challenger squadron plus armoured vehicle and anti armour weapon all of this help to degrade russia once formidable fighting force with putin loss amount to main battle tank armoured vehicle and artillery piece throughout this conflict our million round of small arm ammunition have allow ukraine to maintain rate of fire and recently help keep the russians at bay during their winter offensive meanwhile the kremlin have be unable to achieve the air superiority that it assume it would have in part thank to our donation of air defence missile and over british drone have be send to date this conflict have indeed demonstrate that drone be change the face of modern warfare and we be already learn the lesson from that that be why early today my hon friend the minister for defence procurement launch the uk defence drone strategy to stay ahead on this new frontier of technology back by at least million announce by the prime minister recently make the uk the big drone partner for ukraine yet it be actually at sea where the ally contribution to ukraine cause have be most keenly feel our mighty storm shadows and our uncrewed sea system have help ukraine achieve breakthrough in the black sea not only have russia fleet lose seven different surface ship plus submarine but black sea corridor have open up for trade allow ukraine to export million tonne of cargo include million tonne of agricultural produce at the end of last month ukrainian agricultural export from its black sea port reach the high level since the war begin far exceed what happen under putin black sea grain initiative as president zelensky say to when visit the uk contribution have be monumental he point out that since the start of the conflict the uk have send almost different type of capability to ukraine together we have show that when ukraine get what it need it can win which be why the uk be continue to step up our support last month the prime minister announce that we will be invest furth billion in military support for ukraine take our total military package so far to over billion and our total support to over billion account for humanitarian and economic support as well in that spirit today can announce new package of brimstone anti tank missile in further boost to defend ukraine these missile have previously have significant impact on the battlefield in one instance force russian force to abandon and to retreat from an attempt crossing of river member will recall that few day ago president zelensky tell the munich security conference that an artificial deficit of weapon will only help russia and he be right so today we be give ukraine more of the help it need inflate its capability so that it can defend freedom frontline other capability will also be come its way our uk found and administer international fund for ukraine have pledge more than million to help ukraine plug gap in its capability deliver cutting edge drone along with electronic warfare and mine clearance capability with million of pound of kit to come we be invest not just in weapon but in the brave personnel who serve so far britain have put more than ukrainians through their pace here in the uk but operation interflex our main training effort be go to expand even far be delighted to announce that kosovo and estonia have join we australia canada denmark new zealand norway the netherlands sweden finland lithuania and romania in all train ukrainian troop here in britain together we will train further in the first half of meanwhile we be build capability coalition alongside norway we be lead maritime capability coalition and we have be join by dozen other country in this enterprise this be about mine detection drone raid craft and sea king helicopter which have already be send its way so that ukraine can build its navy and defend its sovereign water last week meet my nato counterpart in brussels and announce that together with latvia we would lead the drone coalition that will allow we to scale up and streamline the west provision of miniature first person view fpv drone to ukraine while support the establishment of drone school for ukrainian operator and test range as well as develop ai swarm drone technology which will surely be critical in the next phase of this war britain have earmark some million to procure and produce long range strike and sea drone and become ukraine large supplier of drone yet this be far from the summit of our ambition in december we set up new taskforce to build strong defence industrial partnership with ukraine ensure that ukraine can sustain the fight for year to come in january the prime minister sign the historic security co operation agreement this be the start of year alliance that we be build with our ukrainian friend once again it be the united kingdom that have sign the first such agreement with welcome signing from france and germany have follow the ukrainians have the will and they have the skill and they have show that if they be give the tool they can do the job but their need today remain particularly urgent russia be continue to attack along almost the entire frontline only recently decimate and then capture the eastern town of avdiivka the kremlin continue to callously strike at civilian target most recently hit hospital in selydove putin be make no secret whatsoever of be in this for the long term russia economy have indeed shift on to full time war footing spend some of its federal expenditure on its defence nominal increase of almost just on last year alone if the cruel death of the remarkable brave russian opposition leader alexei navalny have teach we anything it be that putin victory be something that none of we can afford the tyrant of the kremlin be determine simply to wait out the west he believe that we lack the stomach for the fight and we must show he that we be wrong this house may not be unite on all matter as we have see in the past hour but we be unite on one thing our support for ukraine so the uk will continue to double down on that support and all freedom love country must be compel to do the same this year will be make or break for ukraine so it be time for the west and all civilised nation to step up and give ukraine the backing it need two year ago when speak to an anxious oleksandr kubrakov who have retreat to that field outside kyiv he do not know what would happen to ukraine now enter the third year of this conflict it be remarkable to see that ukrainians remain in full fight know that the whole house will join in say that the uk will not stop support the brave ukrainians our friend until they have win and have victory do not entirely agree with the right hon member characterisation of the uk response in term of deindustrialisation do agree that it be difficult overall to suddenly ramp up from whatever level we be produce at on non war footing but it be hearten to know think this be right but it be off the top of my head will correct the figure if have get it wrong that our munition and missile production be now eight time the level it be before the war so we have certainly step up in addition we be carry out round of procurement through the international fund for ukraine which we establish and which be still receive new contribution be delighted that australia have just donate million to that fund think again this be off the top of my head there have be round of contract procurement so far be not familiar with the particular case that the right hon member cite so will write back to he on the detail but it be encouraging that we have be able to set up mechanism so that other country that have not have our scale of ambition and footprint on ukraine can put in their own money so that we can buy in coalition on their behalf we will continue to do that
