will be brief but be very pleased to be able to speak in this debate as chair of the all party parliamentary group on the chagos island which last week have its meeting it have be ably support by david snoxell the former british high commissioner to mauritius who have do incredible work with his knowledge of and empathy for the chagossian people there be two former chair of the group in the committee at the moment the hon member for romford andrew rosindell and for wythenshawe and sale east mike the former member for crawley be also chair of the group at one time we found that group long time ago to listen to and take action in support of the chagos islander who be angry that they have be forcibly remove from their home angry at the way they have be treat by successive british government and very angry at the initial decision that be take and the sheer brutality that go with it to give member brief example in year old chagossian woman liseby elysé while carry her unborn child be forcibly remove from the chagos island of peros banhos she lose her unborn child soon after her traumatic upheaval and the journey and she and her husband survive with considerable uncertainty and in very precarious living condition like all other chagossians however year later in she represent her community at the hague when she speak about her life and her loss her story be compelling and memorable like those of so many other chagos islander because of the personal horror trauma and abuse that they suffer they have always demand and fight for their right of return and that be the central core of what the all party parliamentary group on the chagos island have do realise there be now different opinion in the group about the sovereignty or otherwise of the island but there have always be fundamental agreement on the right of return that lead to massive legal action which be bravely fight by the chagos islander with very little support there be few people such as richard gifford their solicitor who be fantastic in their support eventually we gather wide support and we get favourable decision at all level of justice around the world include at the united nations general assembly it be worth recall as many member have do the decision make by harold wilson then prime minister in offer mauritius its independence he come to this extraordinarily complicated deal which essentially involve the united states get base on diego garcia and in return mauritius get its independence somewhere along the line as the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger point out there would either be discount on the next generation of nuclear weapon or free delivery of weapon at some point in the future lot of this be shroud in mystery in the private conversation between wilson and prime minister ramgoolam at the time so there be lot of confusion surround that somewhere at that time the idea be to set up the british indian ocean territory and somewhere at that time the decision be make that the archipelago include peros banhos which be considerable distance from diego garcia would be separate from mauritius as well and that it would have to be depopulate hence the utter brutality of the removal of the entire population from the island so the question that many member have bring up be this should the chagos island be separate from mauritius or part of mauritius interestingly during the discussion mauritius never accept the separation it never accept that the chagos island should be separate either constitutionally or in any other way from mauritius as we know the decision be basically force on the mauritians in return for their independence we now have situation in which we have finally get treaty it have its imperfection of that everyone be agree personally be less than happy about the idea of massive military base on diego garcia and even less happy that it might be there in year time however treaty have be agree that will ensure the right of chagos islander to return to the chagos island but unfortunately only limited right of return to diego garcia itself be look forward to the minister speech and would be grateful if be able to say bit more about the right of access to diego garcia for chagos islander their right to visit the church and the graf of their ancestor and whether there be some possibility of degree of residence on diego garcia there be no other place in the world where military base be surround by an entirely depopulated area in this case an island and would be grateful if the minister be able to say something about that we have fight for the right of return fully understand that chagos islander some resident here some in the seychelles many in mauritius and other in diaspora all around the world in france and many other place probably all have different view and different memory but in the survey that be do when this issue be discuss at great length about year ago they be all in favour of the right of return the issue of sovereignty under mauritius be not really great feature of those discussion although it appear to be now we should listen to the chagos refugees group base in mauritius and lead brilliantly by olivier bancoult who have be through every court case indeed he start the whole process of demand the right of return which have eventually be successfully achieve the statement that the chagos refugees group make last week say the agreement therefore meet the aim of our community to be reunite with our islands it have be conclude after nearly year of negotiation between mauritius and the uk and extensive consultation unless therefore the agreement be approve and implement our exile will continue with no hope of restore our fundamental human right to return it be the creation of biot on june year ago which lead to our exile we be see another page in the dramatic history of the indian ocean surely we should recognise the human right of the people who be so disgracefully treat by britain and by the united states but principally by britain they at last will see some degree of justice and the ability to return to their island hope when the minister reply that he will be able to give some hope and comfort on the question of access to diego garcia and also explain why it be necessary to have these incredibly long lease for the us to continue its operation on diego garcia it seem to that we should be work towards the indian ocean be an ocean of peace not an ocean of conflict between rival power
