oral answers to questions health and social care the secretary of state be ask nhs treatment waiting times what step her department be take to reduce waiting time for nhs treatment happy st george day mr speaker cut waiting list be one of the prime minister top priority we be spend more than billion on additional elective activity and investing in additional capacity include community diagnostic centre one such centre be in the hon gentleman constituency since september overall waiting list have fall by almost the big five month fall in over year outside of the pandemic nhs waiting list have rise threefold since the tories come to power and the prime minister pledge to cut waiting list be in tatter rather than take responsibility the tories first blame nhs staff who be try to get well pay and now they have open up new round of medium attack on the sick and the disabled why do not the government instead go after the tax dodger as labour plan to do to raise fund and help resolve the crisis in our nhs once again the hon gentleman do not condemn the strike would gently say that while we be get waiting list down in england welsh labour have the long hospital wait in great britain put patient at risk because it do not have plan to clear the backlog in december the welsh labour government have the high number of patient in great britain wait over two year for treatment it be an outrage yet that be the blueprint for what the labour party say it will implement here in england see increase number of woman come to my constituency surgery about chronic urinary tract infection not for themselves but for their daughter unfortunately there seem to be no treatment pathway for chronic utis among girl do my right hon friend have any thought about that and would he agree to meet to discuss the issue far would be very happy to meet my hon friend to discuss the issue call the shadow secretary of state happy st george day mr speaker westminster be awash with rumour that the prime minister will call july general election presumably to avoid give his rwanda gimmick the time to fail have very simple question for the minister will he repeat the pledge that the prime minister make last year and promise that nhs waiting list will be low at the time of the general election than when the prime minister come to office the prime minister have be very clear that get waiting list down be one of his top priority but he have also be clear that performance have be disappointing one reason be that million procedure have have to be reschedule because of industrial action would gently ask the shadow secretary of state whether he condemn those strike general medical council oversight mechanism what assessment she have make of the adequacy of oversight mechanism for the general medical council the general medical council have be constitute by parliament to ensure that decision about individual doctor be independent of both the profession and the government of the day the professional standards authority oversee the work of all united kingdom professional regulator and report to parliament on their operational performance parliament continue to set and oversee the principle and scope of the regulator power good governance mean ensure transparency and one concern of my constituent be whether gmc decision can be appeal will the minister reassure that we can have well transparency in the gmc on the decision that it make the gmc and other professional regulator have statutory duty to investigate any concern about the fitness to practice of one of their registrant and to take appropriate action to protect the public when that be need the regulator be oversee by the professional standards authority for health and social care which have the power to appeal case where in its view sanction impose by regulator be insufficient to protect the public the gmc have seven principle of decision making and consent how will the minister ensure that gps can fulfil their obligation when time constraint on appointment mean that they do not have time to listen to every complaint people have to book double appointment to talk about more than one issue what further support can the government give gps to enable they to fulfil their gmc order standard of care as the hon gentleman know the government have commit to deliver million more gp appointment and to make it easy throughout the country to see doctor in england in december we deliver million gp appointment compare with million in december an increase of million appointment each month we need to continue to work with programme such as pharmacy first and we be take other step to reduce the pressure on gps so that they have more time to spend with their patient gp retention what recent progress she have make on retain gps general practitioner be rock they be the underpinning force of primary care want to take the opportunity to pay tribute to they for all they do for the health of the nation my right hon friend be right to raise the issue of gp retention during covid and since gps have be exhaust and the return to primary care provision have be difficult the government be do lot such as improve digital telephony and reduce the administrative workload be about to launch future of general practice taskforce to look at what more we can do to provide more support to this critical part of our primary care chelmsford be grow city and it be very good that compare with pre covid time we have more clinician in our gp surgery but we need more surgery as well one new surgery be be build have be tell that the limit that local district valuer impose on nhs lease cost make it increasingly difficult for developer to deliver new surgery building not only in chelmsford but in other part of the country will my right hon friend meet and other affect mp to see whether we can resolve that issue and help grow area where there be more house to deliver the new surgery that we need of course would be delighted to meet my right hon friend to discuss that issue which several colleague across the house have raise with she will appreciate that the district valuer services be crucial in ensure value for taxpayer money from the rent that be charge for gp practice nevertheless the department be work hard to support well primary care facility understand the point and would be happy to meet she there be few fully qualified gps in somerset now than there be in december so it be no surprise that my constituent in wincanton feel that they can never access one how will the minister support general practice to enable it to continue to provide the vital service that our community deserve it be fantastic that hard work gps have deliver million more appointment year than in that be credit to their effort the government have undertake wide range of approach to try to reduce the administrative burden we be focus on try to deal with some of the issue that gps have raise with about the primary and secondary care interface so that they do not have to write all the fit note and liaise with consultant we have also spend more than million on digital telephony importantly the additional role reimbursement scheme have add more than more professional staff from physio to pharmacist to those in gp practice to try to support patient access call the shadow minister at the last general election the government promise to deliver more gps by but there be still few gps than in part of the problem be that morale have plummet in the past decade mean that experience family doctor and newly qualified gps be hang up their stethoscope what do the minister say after scrap two gp retention scheme last month will she come clean today about another broken manifesto promise the hon lady be choose number out of the air she will be aware that there be almost more gps now than in and very importantly the long term workforce plan be schedule to introduce new training place by in we have the great number ever of new trainee gps that be great news for gp practice as they be crucial to primary care hospital repairs what step she be take to ensure adequate funding for hospital repair may wish you happy george day mr speaker also wish the hon member for bristol south karin smyth speedy recovery hope to see she across the dispatch box soon the government have invest significant sum to maintain and modernise nhs building include billion for integrated care board this financial year this be on top of the expect billion for the new hospital programme we have invest furth billion for over hospital upgrade across england include in mid and south essex thank the secretary of state very much for the government commitment to deliver the million in capital funding for south essex hospital and for her recent visit to southend hospital where she see in our emergency village how much million can do in the hand of southend hospital inspirational nhs staff however our aged building do also need urgent maintenance so what can she also do to deliver the million in maintenance funding also need for southend hospital thank my hon friend and also wish she the very good of luck as she be due to abseil down the hospital next month for its radiotherapy appeal very much hope she land safely and do not trouble southend hospital be delighted to visit the hospital at her invitation early this month and be very much impressed by the immediate improvement that the million funding have mean in the dowsett ward and for discharge and treatment time through accident and emergency this be part of our plan both through the urgent and emergency care plan and through our recovery plan for elective and the new hospital programme to rebuild hospital and provide that investment so that clinician can use it to treat their local patient last month meet the chief executive of stepping hill hospital in stockport she inform that the primary out patient building which provide of out patient capacity be recently condemn while funding have be secure to build two additional ward they will not be ready for at least month cause huge disruption in the interim fourteen year of underinvestment have leave stepping hill hospital quite literally crumble will the government provide urgent capital investment for stepping hill so that my constituent and our brilliant nhs staff can have the facility they need very much hope that the hon gentleman have already speak to his integrate care board because he will know that responsibility for local investment decision rightly rest at local level can say that as government we have very much invest in hospital upgrade include billion go to integrate care board this financial year hear the timetable he cite but encourage he to go to his integrate care board to ask what more it be do type diabetes medicine shortages what step she be take to tackle medicine shortage for type diabete it be vital that people have access to the medicine they need the department have be work with the supplier of medicine use in the treatment of type diabete to seek commitment from they to address the issue expedite delivery and boost supply as result the position be now much improve compare with few month ago with new patient now able to receive these critical medicine we continue to work with industry to address remain issue as quickly as possible we know that obesity in this country be cost the nhs about billion year and it be major contributory factor to type diabete which be preventable in lot of case by have healthy lifestyle what more can we do encourage people to eat healthily and therefore save cost in the nhs the hon member raise very important point obesity be link to many health condition include type diabetes we be deliver an ambitious programme of work to create healthy environment to support people in achieve and maintain healthy weight this include restrict the placement of less healthy product in shop and online calorie labelling on food sell in restaurant and tax on the sugary drink industry which have remove the equivalent of tonne of sugar from soft drink call the scottish national party spokesperson recent nuffield trust report show that medicine shortage be new normal in the uk the minister might claim that this be global issue but as the report highlight shortage be be make bad by brexit for example the creation of requirement for custom check at the border and leave the european medicines agency have disrupt the previously smooth supply of medicine what urgent action will the minister take to help to tackle the disastrous effect of brexit on uk medicine supply the snp as usual be broken record we all know that diabete medicine shortage be global issue affect country not just across the whole of the european union but across the whole world medicine supply chain be highly regulated complex and global issue can occur for multiple reason include manufacture difficulty regulatory non compliance surge in demand availability of raw material sudden spike in demand and issue relate to the distribution of the product but once again as always the grievance culture of the snp be blame everything on brexit nurse recruitment and retention gp practice what step she be take to increase level of nurse recruitment and retention in gp practice we hugely appreciate the work that general practice nurse do know that the hon lady be nurse in her previous life and absolutely pay tribute to she for her service she will be aware that last year the government provide additional funding for the general practice contract to uplift pay by in line with the pay review body recommendation we be very much aware of the need to try to ensure that general practice nurse feel appreciated and be keen to be retain in gp practice which be one of the reason have launch taskforce on the future of general practice as she will know it be for gp practice themselves to determine the pay uplift for their nurse be look closely at that because we know that sometimes the pay rise provide by the government be not pass on we have all see image of people queue around the block for an appointment at their gp surgery and in my local integrate care board there have be decline in general practice nurse since june it currently take month to train nurse wish to move into general practice will the minister tell and my constituent in erdington kingstanding and castle vale what she be do to ensure that the retention of experienced nurse and the training of new nurse do not add to the pressure that gps be already face the hon lady raise an important point the long term workforce plan commit to increase the number of general practice nurse by more than by in her area the number of doctor in general practice in the nhs birmingham and solihull icb increase by full time equivalent between and but the number of nurse decrease slightly by full time equivalent however over the same period direct patient care staff increase by full time equivalent think that demonstrate to the hon lady that the actual resource in gp practice be increase with specialism such as physiotherapy and pharmacy as well as nurse prescriber to provide patient more access to good healthcare community and district nurses recruitment and retention what step she be take to support the recruitment and retention of community and district nurse as the hon member may know in september we meet our commitment to deliver more nurse work in the nhs compare with september as of january there be over full time equivalent community nurse work in nhs trust and other core organisation across england which be over more than year ago however we want to go far which be why the nhs long term workforce plan set an ambition to increase training place for district nurse by to nearly it also commit to improve retention in the nhs in scotland the vacancy rate for register nursing post in the community be and for register district nurse it be england the situation be actually bad in most part however these post be fundamental not just to care in community and to our community themselves but to address bed block it be obviously for the scottish government to address term and condition of employment but their overall funding package be dictate by the block grant and barnett consequential be it not time that the department stand up for the nhs when there be money for weapon abroad why can we not provide care at home we be tell during the referendum that we would be well together and that the nhs would be protect instead it be be undermine we hear from opposition members who love nothing more than to crow and criticise as their health system decline around they despite record funding from the uk government scotland have sadly some of the bad health outcome in the western world early this year when the uk government step in to offer support the snp health minister reject the offer reiterate that if the scottish government need help to reduce their waiting list we stand ready to provide such support health inequalities what step she be take to tackle health inequality we be commit to level up health narrow the gap in healthy life expectancy by and increase healthy life expectancy by five year by that align with our mission to reform our health and care system to be fast simple and fairer in january professor sir michael marmot publish health inequalities live cut short which confirm that between and drive by political choice million people in of area in england live short life than they should the inequality be amplify by covid these life cut short be match by short life in good health do the secretary of state believe in evidence base health if so do she accept the overwhelming evidence that current level of ill health reflect year of escalate poverty service that have be run into the ground include the nhs and the government failure to do what they promise in level up no do not and would point to the legislation that the government bring forward last week which be the large and most significant public health reform that we can make to help the hon member constituent and those in other part of the country who face inequality we know that smoking rate be disproportionately high in poor community which be one of the many reason why we introduce such landmark legislation it be just shame that the labour party feel that they have to whip their member to get they to vote for it will the secretary of state support breast cancer now campaign to improve the uptake of breast cancer screening especially among woman in minority ethnic community because that be good way to tackle health inequality completely agree far on ethnicity and inequality have not only prioritise woman health as secretary of state but announce million of research into maternity disparity for woman of colour give the worrying statistic associate with that have also respond to call from brave constituent put forward by hon member on both side of the house for further research into lobular breast cancer because although it be responsible for of diagnosis we do not have the research or evidence to help woman who be affect by it the reality be that someone live in the inner city in the bradford district be likely to live year less than those live in the more affluent part of the region that have not just happen it be result of year of underinvestment in and cut to not only our nhs but our community service will the secretary of state just admit that the government frankly could not care less about people from place such as bradford because otherwise they would have accept my levelling up bid which would have address this injustice at its core be so glad that the hon gentleman have mention level up because presumably he will know from his bid that the levelling up mission be mutually reinforce conservative members take the approach that in order to help people with their the hon gentleman be shout at think that this answer would be important to his constituent level up be not just about health it be about the impact of education housing and other matter in our environment which be why in the forthcoming major condition strategy we will tie together the condition that have the most impact on healthy life we will draw together cross government strategy to help people who be live with those condition to live long but also healthy life the health secretary will know about the health inequality across the east of england include in maldon district which will only be make bad if the nhs plan to close st peter hospital in maldon procee do she agree that the levelling up funding that have be make available to maldon district council should be prioritise to facilitate investment in new localise health service so that those inequality can be tackle my right hon friend make an important point the purpose of the levelling up fund be to help local area to address what they need locally rather than respond to diktat from central london encourage she to work closely as know she will with local agency the council and other make those important decision so that their levelling up announcement include health as an integral part of her mission to improve the life of her constituent call the shadow minister back in the real world the record of the last labour government be that we increase life expectancy by three year under this government it have stall for the first time in century with people in blackpool for example expect to live four and half year less than the national average be the secretary of state proud of this shocking record or will people have to wait to elect chris webb in blackpool south and labour government at westminster to finally turn the tide on health inequality as someone who be proud to have go to school in blackpool do not need lecture from the hon gentleman about what labour have do to the town centre or about the important work that conservative in lancashire be do to help community such as blackpool on labour record gently point out as try to do at every oral that the record of the labour run nhs in wales be lamentable people be almost twice as likely to be wait for treatment in the labour run nhs in wales that be not record of which to be proud bowel care people with spinal injuries what step she be take to improve bowel care for people with spinal injury the hon member raise an important issue it be vital that people with spinal injury receive care in the most appropriate environment to support their care and rehabilitation the nhs have develop range of guidance on the subject include nhs england excellent incontinence care guidance in addition guideline from the national institute for health and care excellence set out the care that patient with spinal injury should receive include through neurological bowel management programme there be clear need for national policy on bowel care in nhs setting for people with spinal injury have listen to patient who have be leave feel abandon and trap in hospital bed without the basic dignity of be able to use the toilet all because of lack of training for nurse in provide the necessary support will the minister meet and representative of the spinal injuries association to discuss how we can make the situation well and ensure that nobody be deny this basic level of care pay tribute to the hon lady for the work that she and the all party parliamentary group on spinal cord injury have do on the issue would be more than happy to meet they waiting times east lancashire what step her department be take to improve accident and emergency waiting time in east lancashire just over year ago we set out plan to improve urgent and emergency care the plan be work at east lancashire hospitals nhs trust of patient in march be see within four hour that be percentage point well than last year the big year on year improvement outside the pandemic since we know that there be more to do that be why we be work with the nhs on year of the urgent and emergency care recovery plan be grateful to the minister for that response and grateful to she for agree to meet and other local mp to discuss the emergency care situation in east lancashire could ask she to go one step far perhaps she and even the secretary of state could visit burnley general teaching hospital in my constituency meet the trust and see what more we can do there partly to reverse the disastrous decision of the last labour government to close the there commend my hon friend and other east lancashire colleague for their campaigning on this matter look forward to the meeting we be go to have to discuss the performance of his local and thank he very much for the invitation to visit share an integrate care board with the hon member for burnley antony higginbotham in lancashire and south cumbria do the minister agree that one reason why there be such problem with waiting time be the congestion in our hospital overall because of the number of people who be healthy and fit to leave hospital but can not have health and care plan when they return home some of all bed in the morecambe bay hospital be occupy by people who be fit to leave but have no care package what plan do the minister have to address the social care crisis in cumbria that will include increase the amount of affordable housing so that people can afford to live in the area pay carer more and have more intelligent visa rule the hon gentleman make the point that the performance of depend on the flow of patient through hospital and our ability to discharge they that be why as part of our work on urgent and emergency care we have invest in support hospital to discharge patient and have be support social care we have see an increase number of discharge across the country over the last year which have enable hospital to treat more people and support the improved performance in that mention we continue to work on that and of course we be support social care with up to extra billion funding over two year mental health support for nhs staff what assessment she have make of the adequacy of mental health support for nhs staff every day nhs staff do an extraordinary job for their patient and it be vital that the nhs support they in maintain their mental health the long term workforce plan commit the nhs to support staff health and wellbeing and ask integrate care system to develop plan to support they be pleased that nhs england be review mental health service for all staff to ensure that all staff in the nhs have the support that they need fight to save die child life tell family that their love one will not make it through the night and work desperately in substandard condition it will come as little shock to hear that all that take toll last year million mental health sick day be take across the nhs instead of receive support our nhs hero have tory government who treat they with disdain and kick they to the kerb will the minister commit to fund the nhs practitioner health service beyond the next month or will the government just try to shut it down again as an nhs community first responder who serve on the frontline during the pandemic who have to see people say goodbye to their love one for the last time before be admit to hospital and who have deal with cardiac arrest know the mental toll that work for or volunteer with the nhs can take on our workforce and therefore we do give very high priority to the subject the nhs people plan set out range of action to build more modern compassionate and inclusive culture and include much strong focus on the availability of quality health and wellbeing support it be right that we keep service under review so will not make commitment today to continue to fund something that we have agree to fund for another year while those service be review woman healthcare what step she be take to improve healthcare for woman we be focus on deliver our woman health priority for recent success include new woman health hub opening across the country with million of investment the investment of nearly million over three year in improve maternity safety on top of the extra million already be invest each year the success of the hormone replacement therapy prepayment certificate and research into the important issue of maternity disparity which have already mention house of commons library figure reveal that one in four woman with suspect breast cancer be wait more than two week to see specialist the waiting list for gynaecological treatment have rise by in year which mean that there be now almost woman wait which be up by third over two year labour have pledge to tackle that backlog so that more woman be see fast how much pain misery or bad do woman have to endure before this government start prioritise their health as the hon lady will know she see the statistic publish very recently we be in fact treat more people at early stage of their cancer want to take on her point about gynaecological wait because that be important we be spend more than billion in this spending review period on additional elective activity and invest in additional capacity include community diagnostic centre and surgical hub many of which provide gynaecological test and procedure she may have miss it but the late publish management information for march show that the long wait for gynaecology service have reduce by nearly since their peak in september of course there be more to do but we be make progress thank all the doctor and team who be involve in that important work call the shadow minister today we have see alarming figure point to the systematic de prioritisation of woman health with woman in england wait for gynaecological treatment woman wait more than year and under two third of eligible woman screen for breast cancer in the last three year will the secretary of state come clean and admit that under this government woman health have become an afterthought that be absolute nonsense as say have prioritise woman health be pretty sure that invite the hon lady to the woman health summit early this year indicate assent she be very graciously say that do the point be that want woman to receive the sort of care that we would all hope and expect they to have have prioritise that precisely because there be condition include gynaecological condition that have historically not receive the attention they deserve as our woman health ambassador dame lesley regan say the nhs be create by man for man be the health secretary who be sort that out primary care patient access what step she be take to improve patient access to primary care what step she be take to improve patient access to primary care what step she be take to improve patient access to primary care we be enormously grateful for the work of gps in deliver million more appointment nationally than in our primary care recovery plan enhance gp access by expand community pharmacy service nationwide some of community pharmacy have sign up to the pharmacy first offer with over consultation claim in the first month across bedfordshire we suffer from patient to gp ratio that be well in excess of the national average high housing growth be simply not match by gp capacity at wixams we have be able to break through year of deadlock by put stakeholder together but issue still remain across the county from shefford to stondon heartbreaking story be commonplace the issue be not icb specific it affect people right across the country what more can we do to ensure that area with high housing growth have the gp capacity that resident deserve the hon gentleman raise really important point he may be aware that the bedfordshire luton and milton keynes icb receive million for its operational capital budget in with over million for this spending review period that operational capital be core funding provide to icb for deliver primary care among other thing in addition he will be aware that icb be able to provide input to planning permission to ensure that primary care be deliver where there be new housing development have work with other hon member across the house to tackle this issue and be very happy to meet he to discuss it far when speak to my constituent in brislington they tell they have to wait an inordinate time to get through on the phone to their gps at the brooklea health centre and wait over two week for appointment constituent in fishponds have be tell that it be over an hour wait for prescription medication at the local pharmacy and we all know the situation with dentist the other thing my constituent be wait for be general election do the minister agree that that be the only way we will sort out these problem in the nhs certainly do not agree if labour be in government we would see significantly bad outcome covid be once year pandemic and we have pull out all the stop to recover from that it be huge tribute to all those work in primary care that they have do so well in the hon lady icb bristol north north somerset and south gloucestershire of all appointment be deliver on the same day they be book in february this year and be deliver within two week of booking with of they face to face these be extremely positive number for the appointment deliver in february what be really important be that the number of patient care staff have increase by full time equivalent since have listen to the minister comment but the number of patient per gp in the bedfordshire luton and milton keynes area be nearly high than the national average will the minister explain why her government think it be good idea to cut the proportion of doctor be train as gps from around one in three to around one in four the hon lady be simply wrong she will be aware that in fact our long term workforce plan be intend to raise the number of training place for gps to by in we have over new gps apply to take training place an absolute record there be much more to do and be work with gps on future for gp practice taskforce to make sure that we do everything we can include hire the additional professional now work in gp practice in order to relieve the pressure on gps and deliver much well patient access last week constituent contact to say that her tooth crumble during pregnancy and she be unable to get dentist appointment another constituent who be in agony desperately plead for help to find dentist my own son clifford have be wait two year for tooth extraction and have receive hundred of email about similar issue it be simply not good enough what plan do the government have to sort this out once and for all and what advice do the minister have for my constituent my hon friend raise an incredibly important point we know that because all dentist be lock down during covid the recovery in access to nhs care have not be as fast as we would like that be why we announce our dentistry recovery plan include new patient premium which since it be launch on march have already see hundred of thousand of new nhs patient who have not see dentist in two year some dentist will receive golden hello to encourage they to work in underserved area we also have our new smile for life prevention programme which will ensure that baby receive an early dental check for their milk tooth in family hub and that pregnant mum receive well dental care and advice we be now try to work with dentist to look at reform of the unit of dental activity contract but follow the first meeting of the group yesterday it seem that dentist feel that all the parameter be in place what we now need to do be ensure that the incentive be there and that we see thing change rapidly my gps be work extraordinarily hard to increase access in the face of ever increase public demand be alarm by the labour party talk about scrap the gp partnership model as find in the stroud district that gp practice be some of the most efficient part of our nhs service they need support the removal of bureaucracy and the opening up of fund pot rather than dismantle will my right hon friend explain how access to primary care would not be help by remove the partnership model and what be the government do to help icb create more flexible partnership fund pot my hon friend make fantastic point and say again that gps absolutely underpin our primary care we all absolutely rely on they and our measure to create additional role in gp practice will provide they with the additional capacity they need so that they can serve their patient well that be good for patient good for primary care and incredibly good value for the taxpayer it be ludicrous that labour be propose to undermine the gp partnership model that would be disaster for primary care topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility we know that people in work lead happy healthy life however over million not fit for work fit note be issue last year most be repeat fit note issue without any advice so we be miss golden opportunity to give million of people the support they need to remain in work that be why we be launch reform of the fit note process to create new system in which fit note conversation focus on what people can do not what they can not do as part of this the government will consider shift the responsibility for issue fit note away from gps to reduce the pressure they face and to free up million of appointment thank everyone who have deliver this vital work and very much look forward to hear the result of the call for evidence in due course so that we can reform our welfare system for the sake of our constituent and our gps accord to the association of british healthtech industries it take on average year for lifesaving and life enhance technology to be adopt in the nhs what step be my right hon friend take to speed up the adoption of new technology so that the nhs can save more life and improve patient outcome dispute the year figure as it can vary across innovation the figure be contest but my hon friend raise an important point we have plan to prioritise the acceleration of patient access thereby ensure safe effective and innovative medical technology for patient and the nhs our ambition be back by funding and we be reform the medical technology regulatory framework introduce the innovative device access pathway pilot and launch framework to increase the availability of innovative product for the sake of patient across england and the united kingdom call the shadow secretary of state the health secretary have promise that the government will provide an extra million dental appointment this year but the dentistry minister the right hon member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom say the figure have high likelihood of not be reliable which one of they be wrong be delighted to be able to tell the hon gentleman that we have model down the ambition so the figure we initially provide be high than million appointment that be because we be focus on deliver the dental recovery plan rather than overpromise the hon gentleman find it easy to call our child short and fat but he shy away from welfare reform call it shameless and irresponsible he say he be ready to stand up to middle class lefty but labour have never put patient first by condemn the union that strike he make glossy promise about reform the nhs in england yet labour have fail completely order gently say that we need to get lot of back benchers in and be sure both side want to do that the last labour government deliver the short waiting time and the high patient satisfaction in history which be record that the right hon lady government can not begin to touch back to dentistry the chief dental officer say the announcement be nowhere near enough the british dental association say this recovery plan be not worthy of the title it also say that the recovery plan will not stop the exodus of dentist and will not meet the government target who should the public trust and why should they trust the health secretary to deliver when her own adviser her own minister and crucially dentist all say that she be brush the truth under the carpet again let we bring ourselves back up to date know the labour party like look back to the last time it find favour with the british public but wales be the up to date record of today labour lamentable record of run the nhs in wales speak for itself if the hon gentleman be so set on reform why on earth be he not help his labour colleague in wales to do exactly as he be promise it be because they be empty promise and because the hon gentleman and be afraid the labour party will step back from reform rather than grapple with the issue as we be do with our recovery plan finally on the dental recovery plan within month of the new patient premium be switch on hundred of surgery have open to new patient which mean that patient in the hon gentleman constituency and elsewhere be get the care they need as my right hon friend have already hear from my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel the mid and south essex icb have publish proposal to close st peter hospital in maldon and to relocate medical service elsewhere despite the huge growth take place in the town have to say to the secretary of state that my constituent have little confidence in the consultation will she therefore look closely at the outcome and if necessary intervene to ensure that my constituent be still able to access vital health service within the town thank my right hon friend for raise that matter understand that consultation be conduct locally and that more than local people and staff respond their feedback will be analyse by an independent research agency which will produce report for the mid and south essex icb and meeting be due to take place in public in july will of course continue to take an interest in this matter call the scottish national party spokesperson the recent announcement on fit note reform be just the late in long string of attack on the most vulnerable people in society sick and disabled people be be vilify when as the joseph

infected blood inquiry urgent question to ask the minister for the cabinet office to make statement on the evidence uncover of experiment on child and the contaminate blood scandal and update the house on the action that the government be take on the second interim report from sir brian langstaff let start by state that the story report in the recent bbc news article and indeed the sunday times report by caroline wheeler demonstrate the unimaginable suffering of all those impact by this dreadful scandal as the house will know in the government establish an independent public statutory inquiry chair by sir brian langstaff to give those impact and their family the answer that they deserve since it be establish the inquiry have take evidence from range of source and the testimony be indicative of the bravery of every individual who have come forward the infected blood inquiry final report be due to be publish within month on may and we expect the inquiry finding to cover set of extremely challenging issue it would not be right for the government to pre empt the finding of this long prepared and carefully consider report but the government have commit to update parliament through an oral statement on next step within sit day follow may it be our intention to make that statement as soon as possible the day stipulation be deadline and certainly not target in january this year appoint an expert group to provide technical advice to the cabinet office in respond to the infected blood inquiry recommendation on compensation that work be well under way and will build on the recommendation of the infected blood inquiry to inform the government substantive response to the inquiry recommendation on compensation the government understand the need to move quickly to provide compensation to victim of infected blood most recently we table amendment just last wednesday to the victims and prisoners bill to impose duty on the government to establish an infected blood compensation scheme it also establish new arm length body name the infected blood compensation authority to deliver the compensation scheme it will operate on uk wide basis to ensure parity and consistency that demonstrate our absolute commitment to deliver long overdue justice to victim of infected blood we understand that for many there be an urgent need for compensation as the house will know in october the government pay more than million in interim compensation to help to ease the short term need of those infect the government amendment also include statutory duty to make interim payment of to the estate of the deceased infected people who be register with exist or former support scheme where previous interim payment have not already be make to infect individual or their bereaved partner that be an important step forward to get substantial compensation into the hand of family and victim of infected blood should that government amendment be support in the other place it will return to this house for debate in the usual process of commons consideration of lords amendment we know that more than people have already die in the bad treatment disaster in the history of the nhs another have die since the public inquiry start in with two people die on average every week people have die since sir brian make his final recommendation on pay compensation in april he say that wrong be do at individual collective and systemic level he also say that in all conscience he could not wait until his final report be publish to tell the government to start pay compensation last week hugh pym of the bbc produce shocking evidence about child even baby be experiment on in the and without their parent consent these disturbing revelation raise serious criminal and ethical issue for the nhs and the medical profession there be possible breach of the nuremberg code alongside that the sunday times and caroline wheeler in particular launch campaign at the weekend for compensation to be pay now to those infect and affect by the contaminated blood scandal so far more than mp have back the campaign and party be represent include six leader last week the government finally lay those amendment to the victims and prisoners bill in the other place after this house force the government to act in december last year this weekend ministers confirm that even when sir brian produce his final report on may the government may not respond until as late as july meanwhile there have be no announcement on compensation funding or on any compensation scheme despite the government have accept the moral case for compensation what action be the government take follow last week bbc story on the experiment on child when will sir brian recommendation on compensation be implement in full on what date will payment be make to those infected and affected why have the interim payment not be make as sir brian recommend last april how will those infect and affect be involve in the whole scheme why be minister reject the three month timeframe for set up compensation body that this house agree to in december last year and sir brian recommendation that it should be judge lead on all side of the house members know that when people be die justice delay be justice deny the time to act be now thank the right hon lady for her question and initial comment nobody in this house have do more than she to advance the interest of the infected and affected community as have say consistently since take office on november recognise her frustration and be do everything can to address they last week meet she and other chairs across party as do just before the easter recess and will continue to update she as regularly as can the right hon lady draw attention to commentary from hugh pym and other journalist about speculation and allegation which believe sir brian langstaff report when it be publish on may should give substantive airing to draw on the evidence collect it would be reasonable for the government to wait for that authoritative statement on what information and evidence they have gather before we respond but that do not mean that since take office have be do anything other than move forward everything can on compensation as quickly as possible the right hon lady be quite right to say that over death have occur since include last year recognise that the challenge of urgently secure interim payment in term of the mechanic of how it be do be not concern of the infected and affected community she quite reasonably stand up and urge speed on that and be do what can the statutory duty to make an interim payment of to the estate of the deceased infected people be the first time that we have put in legislation duty to pay compensation before the ad hoc scheme which over the past or year have never admit culpability have also put into legislation with the consent of both houses the need to set up the arm length body and make it as operational as soon as possible as discuss with the right hon lady last week my concern be to get that arm length body up and run as quickly as possible and there be legal obligation to do so when royal assent be gain there be no statutory deadline but there be responsibility to do that recognise the concern around judge lead body indeed sir brian langstaff report suggest that judge lead body would be desirable do not rule that out but at this stage it seem reasonable not to confine it in legislation in case another candidate become available clearly however gain the confidence of the affected and infected community be absolutely integral to this process work as say be do everything can to bring forward the government substantive response on the wide issue of compensation as near as can to the may and will update the house as often as can indeed have make time available tomorrow for an open surgery for any mp who want to bring case to call the father of the house may follow the tribute to the great dame the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson for what she have be do have be actively involve in this in one way or another for year we all know that the justification for have the langstaff inquiry have be the information that have now come out in public which be conceal or not know over the decade we also know that this be different from most of the discussion in the pearson report on whether there should be compensation when thing go wrong in medical treatment this report be likely to show how since the war people have not pay enough attention to the warning give by those in the field with the update of caroline wheeler book and the bbc programme we now know that as well as the haemophilia trial publish in the the trial show massive defect by the standard of those day let alone by up to date standard join the right hon lady in ask the minister when it will be possible for people to register their name background and circumstance for compensation do we have to wait until month time for that to happen and how will it be deal with obviously as the cabinet office minister he follow his predecessor in carry this responsibility but how far will the department of health and social care be involve and will other departments be involve my hon friend make wise observation do not mean not to pay tribute to he in similar way his commitment to this cause probably over my lifetime be extraordinary in respect of the payment announce through the government amendment table last wednesday we will be work with the exist support scheme to expedite they as quickly as possible for the estate of the deceased infected on the substantive response on the wide complete compensation through last week intervention and build on the amendment of the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson we have establish the delivery vehicle for compensation on the challenge that we be somehow delay compensation which be reasonably make think that what have say to the house this afternoon make it clear that we be commit in legislation to deliver that compensation but that the term of how we do so and how we respond to translate those recommendation into reality be ongoing work that will seek to address substantively as soon as possible by may call the shadow minister congratulate my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson on secure an urgent question on this vital issue nobody could fail to be move by the scale of the horror and injustice of this scandal the late revelation about apparent experiment on child to which the urgent question relate be truly appalling and show yet again how badly the victim have be let down pay tribute to all those who have campaign so hard on the issue as part of deliver the justice that be so long overdue the government must now deliver on the compensation scheme time be of the essence every week that pass without further government action matter those who be infect with contaminate blood be die at rate of one every four day minister have repeatedly accept the moral case for compensation but victim understandably have little faith and want to see firm action that be why labour be very disturbed to hear that the government have table an amendment to undo the cross party change to the victims and prisoners bill pass by this house in december last year the change that the government want would have the effect of remove clear commitment to deliver on the compensation scheme within three month of the bill pass yet another miss opportunity yet another delay would be grateful if the minister answer the follow question will the government now consider accept the cross party consensus of establish clear three month limit for the setting up of the scheme can the minister confirm when victim can expect to receive final compensation payment follow the publication of sir brian langstaff review thank the hon lady for her question respectfully the amendment table by the right hon member for kingston upon hull north be dependent on royal assent have try to make it effective by put an obligation on the set up as soon as royal assent be grant which will speed it up be work on operational matter around how such body would work the hon lady ask as everyone do about the government substantive response on compensation more broadly as have indicate appoint the expert group in january to examine some of the issue in the recommendation such as the need for redress for those live with chronic hepatitis when that chronic infection definition do not exist have be seek professional advice on the operationalisation of the recommendation the conclusion of those deliberation and the quantification and discernment of compensation will be matter for the government when the final report have be publish like other have case that have be wait decade for resolution and which be pursue by my predecessor when will those affect be able to start apply for compensation refer my hon friend to my reply few moment ago about the payment to the estate of deceased infected person the ultimate compensation will depend on what be arrange through conversation across whitehall as soon as possible after may we be make good progress and want to bring that forward as quickly as can after may give the will of the house and the letter sign by so many mp it be pretty clear that it be on the government to deliver and that be what be seek to do as quickly as can call the scottish national party spokesperson pay tribute to the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson who have do so much and to journalist such as caroline wheeler of the sunday times and all those who have campaign for decade despite their own very deep trauma they include jan smith the mother of colin one of the young victim who be infect at only month old and who die aged only seven she say in the sunday times at the weekend when we find out little colin be go to be treat by world renowne haematologist we be over the moon professor bloom be like god to we and we do question he we think our son be be give the good possible treatment but we will feel forever guilty that we have in fact hand our son over to his killer these parent should not be burden with this guilt an estimated child be infect in massive breach of trust and medical ethic it be every parent bad nightmare what do the minister say to the parent of child who be use as guinea pig in an utterly despicable practice that be make bad by the lack of redress for those family when will all those infected and affect receive the compensation they be due and an apology from this government can reassure the hon lady that be do everything can to bring that forward as quickly as possible recognise that the distress be widespread and be feel by individual and family across the united kingdom be work across the devolved administration to ensure that there be uk wide arm length body my official be work with prominent charity organisation and support group be reach out to they to share progress reassure the community that have hear their concern and seek their view in advance of may be do that out of deep respect for the suffering that they have experience on the substantive matter the hon lady ask about refer she to my reply few moment ago when be health secretary commit the government to ensure that the compensation recommend by sir brian be pay and make the moral case that the uk government must address this wrong the story from caroline wheeler and hugh pym have make that moral case strong still can push the minister to move as fast as possible but hold in his mind the critical nature of get the response right as well commend his official who have work so hard on this matter for so long entirely understand the need for urgency but he must get it right at the same time he be diligent and deeply honourable man and hope he will hold that in his heart as he address the issue in the week to come thank my right hon friend for his remark and for what he have do on this matter he be right feel responsibility both to get the substantive announcement agree as quickly as possible and to ensure clear communication with the infected and affected community so that they have clear expectation of what will happen follow that announcement from all have read and all that my official have brief on recognise that this be likely to be one of the big scandal in the nhs that this country have see respect sir brian langstaff and his extensive work over several year wait respectfully for his final report on the wide issue on may my constituent contact again yesterday his father and uncle be all infect with contaminate blood and all but two of the uncle have now die he say to have to grow up in care due to my father be too ill to look after we have be fight for many many year for justice he think that the government be drag their foot on compensate victim he be right be he all can do be account for what have do since november can not really comment on the several decade previous to that as the hon lady will know we have have series of ad hoc scheme but the government accept culpability for what happen many year ago and the subsequent failure to respond will need to be address fully after may the government amendment in the house of lords be the first time that we will have put in legislation duty to pay compensation that be the start of more comprehensive response that be work on to secure collective agreement across government and want to bring that forward as quickly as be able to do so the langstaff recommendation for interim payment be because of the need for speed because people be so ill how many people do the government believe to be still live who be infect in this scandal how many of they apply for the interim payment what proportion of those who apply have receive the payment if my right hon friend do not have the figure with he today will he undertake to write to and place copy of the letter in the house of commons library my right hon friend customarily ask precise and penetrate question do not want to quote the few figure that think know so will write he consider reply which will make available far too many people have suffer and far too many have die we need to put this right as quickly as possible congratulate the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson on her work to date when engage with my constituent it be clear that not only have they lose love one to preventable and painful death but the stigma that those love one live with during their life be part of the issue member across the house rightly want answer about the interim payment because those family have receive no compensation and no apology to date if the minister can not give date that people can expect payment can he at least give some clarity on how they will be able to apply first agree entirely with the hon lady with respect to the stigma one can not fail to be move by the account of people in the when they contract hiv the stigma in society be very different from where we be today that have cause damage to relationship to life and obviously to health many people case have be terminal the statutory duty to make interim payment of to the estate of deceased infected people will be carry out through the exist scheme we be work with those scheme to work out how good to do that that be different from recommendation in that the government take the view that we do not want to overwhelm the will of the estate rather than divide it up among family member which could be problematic and would cause delay while can not give an authoritative date now urgent work be ongoing to give clarity on the process for those people to register and to receive those payment the infected blood scandal be one of the big stain on the history of the nhs be pleased to hear that we be get interim payment out as quickly as possible but the minister have talk about give payment to deceased people estate rather than name individual could he outline his reasoning we want to make sure that compensation go to the correct people quickly my hon friend make very good point one of the challenge be that some cohort of people be not register but have be part of scheme that do not now exist how do we well expedite the process across that affected community those be the sort of practical issue that be work through with official so that we can reach the good possible solution when we give our comprehensive response in due course cheap than chimpanzee be how former pupil of treloar school describe themselves when they give evidence to the inquiry my constituent lee moorey be one of the pupil of that school and have describe to how he feel that he be experiment on all those year ago we have set up the brian langstaff inquiry what more can the government possibly want to know than what that inquiry be go to uncover and why be they delay compensation will the minister confirm that nothing have be prevent the government from pay compensation since the date that brian langstaff publish his interim report last april there be challenge in translate recommendation into number and into the reality of transmission mechanism as well as in the quantification and agreement across whitehall the work on the first part be under way that be why we have engage the expert to work out how to quantify the payment that will be due across different head of loss quite reasonably those number be not in the report it would not be for sir brian langstaff to put number on every single individual but that work be under way we be now work to agree the substantive response as soon as we can after the final report be publish this week will be use the mechanism of this house to do something that in year as an mp have never before feel the need to do present petition at the top of that petition will be the name of my constituent andrew evans one of the child who be infect with hepatitis and hiv by miracle he survive to set up and help run the tainted blood campaign like many of my affected and infected constituent he feel that this process have already go on for too long so be very grateful to the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson for secure this urgent question be also grateful to my right hon friend the minister for the update he have give particularly about support for the estate of the deceased however urge he to continue to meet group such as tainted blood and make sure that the communication on this issue be as clear and open as possible so that those group be engage and can support their member as the process move forward and to do so as fast as possible thank my hon friend both for what he have say today and for his engagement privately in recent week agree with everything he have say and have hear his challenge to be clear about communication to prominent charity organisation and support group letter be send by my official yesterday evening to set up those meeting have talk to cross party representative of the all party parliamentary group on haemophilia and contaminate blood seek input on the name of group be try to respect their confidence while also meet as many representative group as possible and to do that well before may this be surely the bad health scandal that we have see with government after government kick the can down the road we need to accept that there be need for change include change in speed and urgency the continue delay and prevarication regret to say that it feel like we have see some more of that today exacerbate the suffering we know that two people be die every week the minister must know that the delay on this issue be indefensible and he must know its impact do he appreciate why such large number of member be push for action now and do he understand that that be what we need he to deliver yes do understand that deeply respect the view of colleague who have make strong representation on this matter and be do everything can to move it forward as urgently as can will not repeat myself regard the thing have say with respect to step take last week or the spirit in which be engage and the reason why be do it but agree with the hon lady that speed be absolutely of the essence there have be lot of speculation in article in recent day and most prominently in caroline wheeler book about the wide issue what go wrong and why these thing happen those matter will need to be address but through the lens of sir brian langstaff report which will be publish finally on may commend my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson not just for secure this urgent question but for all the work that she and other in this place have do on this important matter sir brian langstaff make his final recommendation on compensation early whole year ago and recommend that the compensatory body make payment by last december he do so because he be worried about the effect of delay on the affected and infect we have miss all of those deadline be this what sir brian bad fear look like sincerely hope not what have say with respect to the interim payment be response to the dialogue have have with member across both chambers of the house work with earl howe in the other place have be pretty clear that in be do everything can to put preparation in place for give legal entity the obligation to pay compensation and to minimise delay in advance of the final determination of the government response so that that response can be operationalise as soon as the decision be finally make every time we have these urgent question we get well intentione minister give helpful but frustrating update about what be happen this minister be one of the most well intentione and today statement have be one of the most helpful but what we want to hear as the house have say clearly today be clear timeline for when application for compensation can be make and when those payment will be make he have come really close to tell we that today can encourage he to get over the line tell we when it be go to happen and satisfy all of we who be stand here on behalf of our constituent the hon gentleman make very fair and reasonable point would wish to say more than be say today but we have not quite get to that point be do everything can to get there on the hon gentleman specific point about the mechanic of engagement with community be very seized of the need to have clear narrative for each different cohort so that we can be crystal clear when those decision be make recognise how frustrating this be obviously agree quantify and make provision for those thing be collective process across government and be do everything can use my experience from several year in the treasury it be helpful that the chancellor of the exchequer be health secretary when the public inquiry be set up and be work with colleague across whitehall to deliver this as quickly as can one of the most upsetting aspect of this whole tragedy be the thought of those pupil at treloar school be experiment on like lab rat as one of the pupil say they include brother michael and bill payne and meet their widow cath and margaret over the easter recess in bristol accept that the minister be try to give detailed answer and that there be complexity but what it really come down to be the deep deep wrong that be do to those little boy at treloar and compensation and apology be owe to those people can ask what the minister be do to communicate as clearly and effectively as possible with the family of those affect so that they feel they be not be swamp by bureaucracy and that answer be close at hand have reach out to prominent charity organisation and support group to share the progress that have be make have to respect the fact that we need to do that through the parliamentary process last wednesday and to seek their view but not to replicate the considerable trauma that they go through give evidence in an incredibly painful fashion through sir brian langstaff inquiry be meet those charity organisation and support group obviously can not meet every single individual but be try to use those meeting to inform the response of the government and to make representation to my colleague about what need to be do so that we can land this in the most effective place as soon as we can from may do the minister recognise that many people feel that the state with all its delay in deliver justice to the victim of this scandal and their family have utterly fail to recognise adequately the egregious harm that have be inflict and continue to be inflict on those impact leave ten of thousand of victim and their family in great suffering as they continue to wait for compensation yes recognise that all delay be painful and frustrating and cause distress that be why be do everything can to move this forward as quickly as can be sorry that that be repetitious but it be the truth think have update the house meaningfully today on the legislation know what we need to do which be to get to may and as soon as possible come up with comprehensive response on behalf of all those who have lose their life and the family who have be ruin by this absolute scandal that have happen over year may also give my thank to my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson for secure this urgent question it give the opportunity to raise the case of my constituent mark fox who contract hepatitis from infected blood when he be give transfusion he be just four year of age at the time he be give contaminate factor viii for his haemophilia he be unaware of his hepatitis diagnosis until he be when he be in care he have be live with the health consequence of this scandal for over year he lose his job and we have mention the stigma say with all due respect to the minister because know he be do his good that interim payment will offer way of bring relief to some of the survivor mark have ask to ask the minister how many more year he will have to wait before he receive either an interim payment or full and fair compensation for the suffering that he have endure thank the hon gentleman for his heartfelt representation on behalf of his constituent mark fox and be sincerely sorry for what he have experience be do everything can to bring as much clarity as possible but can not give the hon gentleman definitive timetable today be work towards hope give definitive timetable at the point of or very soon after the publication of this final report will do everything can to bring clarity to all group involve it have be seven year and we have have four prime ministers since this public inquiry be set up and there have be many decade wait before then surely the minister will agree that the story of child be impact be tantamount to state sponsor abuse abuse similar to that suffer by my constituent linda cannon whose husband die after contaminated blood transfusion and vera gaskin who have stage cirrhosis of the liver sir brian langstaff say that it would clearly take political will to act quickly and the circumstance here warrant that when will the victim our constituent and their family get compensation and justice surely the minister recognise that issue such as these whether it be primodos the post office scandal or contaminate blood be take decade and re traumatising our constituent while they wait and often die before get justice it be not good enough very much recognise what the hon lady be say with respect to the impact of time on suffering and want to bring this forward as quickly as can be do that work and sponsor work to gain the advice we need to make informed decision that will allow we to make the wide possible decision in few week time too be speak on behalf of constituent who lose brother and sister in law and whose nephew be leave to be bring up by the family want to raise the urgency of this appreciate the minister sincerity about what he be try to do and the fact that he have be in post for only few month but it be over year now since sir brian langstaff bring forward his report and say that interim payment be absolutely essential be try to understand exactly where the block be if this be priority for the government it would have be do in that year so where be the block there be not block last year there be process of look at how we could work out the cost and the way of translate and operationalise the recommendation that work be well under way and professor sir jonathan montgomery and his team be help with that as say hope that in few week time we can get to point where we will be able to make substantive assertion of the government position build trust and confidence require the support of the infected and affected community can the minister confirm that the independent body executive will include representation from infected and affected people group who can make decision on process eligibility and decision making in order to build trust and confidence thank the hon gentleman for his question and for his engagement with last week as one of the co chair of the appg when he make similar point be reflect carefully on what it take to satisfy the recommendation to have body independent of government while also secure as much authority and as much confidence among the different community involve as possible will update the house on that in due course my caseworker paula be leave bereave as teenager after her father be kill by hiv and hepatitis from infected blood product she have suffer enormously since include be bully at school as result of the stigma around hiv she be now in her and battle cancer but despite the recommendation from sir brian langstaff inquiry year ago in april that the child who lose parent should be award interim compensation she have yet to receive penny how much long will the government keep victim such as paula wait very much hope that we will be able to make clear assessment of what we be go to do in matter of week be do everything can to be clear about depict for each different group include some go back or year what the process will be go forward we owe that to all the victim and their family and will try and be as comprehensive as can in that response when it come do the minister think that the prime minister and senior ministers will be attend the launch of the report on may do not know have not have those conversation yet if representative of the government be ask to be there be absolutely sure that that will be the case if it be will be very happy to attend thank the minister for his answer and for his clear commitment to deliver for all those with severe health problem do he not agree that read some of the information supply by the bbc feel more like read about national regime atrocity than read about action by our own healthcare professional in the it be quite distressing how do the minister believe that we can ever restore confidence in process and procedure that allow this to happen and what assurance can the general public have that it could never happen again when sir brian langstaff publish his report and have absolute confidence in the authority of the report that he will publish that will be the time for response from the government on the wide implication of what go on and what evidence sir brian have gather as say at the start of my response we may have see some element of that in recent day but want to ensure that the government respond authoritatively and as fully as possible when the moment of publication come childcare entitlements with permission mr speaker will make statement on the successful first stage of the large ever expansion of childcare in england history achieve by this government the government have strong track record of help parent with the cost of childcare support disadvantaged child and ensure that childcare be of high quality with of early year setting rat as good or outstanding by ofsted in we extend the three and four year old entitlement commonly take as hour week for week of the year in we introduce hour of free early education week for disadvantaged two year old in the three and four year old entitlement be double to hour per week for work parent and in march recognise that childcare be one of the big cost face work family today my right hon friend the chancellor announce the big investment in childcare by uk government in history so that by september work parent will be able to access hour of free childcare week from when their child be nine month old until they start school by the time this expansion be complete parent use the full hour can expect to save an average of year hugely significant saving for their family finance we be stagger the expansion to ensure that there be the staff and place available to meet parental demand and this month mark the first stage of the roll out with eligible work parent now able to receive hour of government fund childcare for their two year old for the first time last month my right hon friend the secretary of state for education tell the house that we expect child to benefit from the expansion from the beginning of this month as we say in our official statistical report parent be already benefit from it on april and we have subsequently break the mark we will publish further official statistical report in due course as member will know the system involve parent apply for code that they take to provider to be validate in order to obtain place the first phase of the roll out be show trajectory similar to that of our last expansion of childcare in on september of code have be validate as of april this year have be validate and we have break as of this week with every roll out some eligibility code go unused for variety of reason such as parent change their mind about formal childcare or be issue with code automatically although they do not need one in the case of our well establish offer for three and four year old about of code have not be validate but as with previous roll out we expect the number of child benefit from this new entitlement and the number of code validate to grow in the come week and month as be the case in no local authority be report that they do not have enough place to meet demand pay tribute to early year provider local authority membership body and other key stakeholder who have work closely with we to ensure that the first phase of the roll out be successful and parent could access place and we will continue to work closely with they for the next phase of the roll out the first of those will begin in september but parent will be able to start apply for hour of childcare for their nine month old from may be also delighted to announce that parent on parental leave and those who be start new job in september will be able to apply for childcare place from may instead of have to wait until day before their first day of work as have be the case until now deliver such large expansion require more staff and more childcare place we estimate that we will need more place and more staff by september and that for september which be the large phase of the roll out further place and staff will be need last year the number of childcare place increase by about and the number of staff by about even before the roll out begin and before the significant step that the government be take begin with rate to increase capacity in the sector the institute for fiscal studies have independently confirm that funding for the new two year old entitlement be significantly high than average parent pay fee accord to the government provider pulse survey publish last week the large barrier identify by the sector by of respondent to expansion of its provision be future funding certainty message that have hear clearly from the many provider have visit in recent month in his budget the chancellor commit himself to ensure that funding rate for all entitlement would increase in the and financial year by the measure use last year that estimate million of additional funding over those two year will provide level of certainty that we be confident will help to unlock ten of million of pound in private sector investment ensure that rate keep up with provider cost pressure and give provider great opportunity to increase staff pay this year to support recruitment to the sector we launch million recruitment campaign entitle do something big work with small child and thousand of people be visit the campaign website every week to find out more about the great early year and childcare career that be available in january we introduce change to the early year foundation stage to give provider great flexibility to attract and retain staff and yesterday we launch technical consultation set out the department proposal for how new experience base route could work for early year staff who have relevant experience from other sector but do not have the full and relevant qualification that we require owe to the fall birth rate over recent year some primary school have space that they be no long use and some have close entirely in order to support our expansion of childcare we have launch pilot to explore how some of the unused school space could be repurpose to enable childcare setting to offer more place if the pilot be success the government will roll that out more widely our progress in deliver this transformative expansion in early education and childcare underscore this government unwavere dedication to empower family support the childcare sector and build prosperous future look forward to labour members welcome this month news finally tell we what their plan for childcare be and commend my statement to the house thank the minister for advance sight of his statement but with red light flash across the board this be weak attempt by the government to defend their bungle expansion of childcare provision the opposition be absolutely clear in our commitment to build modern childcare and early year education system and be put quality at the heart of our vision we support the expand entitlement but there be serious question about whether the government plan be deliverable ever since the chancellor announcement in the budget parent and the early year sector have be cry out for detailed and credible plan for the roll out of the expansion but the government have consistently dismiss concern and act as if there be no problem when the problem be clear to see today statement be yet another desperate attempt by the government to avoid scrutiny of their childcare plan it come just hour before what we understand to be highly critical report from the national audit office it would have be far well if the minister have come to the house follow the publication of the nao report so that hon member could properly scrutinise his response to it the department own modelling suggest that an extra childcare place and additional full time equivalent staff will be need by september that be huge challenge when provider across the country be already struggle to recruit the skilled staff that they need many be on the brink of closure the department recently publish pulse survey which the minister be quote in aid find that two third of all group base provider and staff of school base provider continue to experience staffing problem with little change since nine in provider respond to the survey have either reduce the number of place that they offer last year or keep the same number of place similarly datum from ofsted show that in the six month follow the chancellor original announcement childcare place fall by more than how can the minister credibly claim that everything be on track when that be the feedback from the sector coram annual survey of childcare provider be also clear about the government failure just of local authority be confident that they will have enough place for the expansion to child from the age of nine month that be almost three quarter of community where parent will not be able to access the childcare that the government have promise across every age group and category coram find fall in the number of local authority able to deliver sufficient childcare in their area some of area see the workforce crisis as the big barrier to the expansion but there be still no detailed workforce plan from the government just of area be confident that they will have sufficient childcare for disabled child which be truly shameful failure we need serious plan to ensure childcare expansion be success for child parent and provider the opposition be clear that we will be lead by the evidence that be why we have commission sir david bell to review the challenge face the sector and inform our plan for future reform how many of the code that the minister department issue in the april expansion have translate into provision of childcare place where be the additional million of investment announce in the budget be fund from and what be be cut to provide that funding what urgent discussion be he have with the early year sector about the impact of the april expansion on its financial sustainability will he guarantee today that every family will be able to access childcare place follow the plan further expansion in september yes or no child voice be not hear often enough in this place so on their behalf warn ministers childcare and early education be too important to be put at risk by the mess they be make the issue today be not simply about place the staff in our nursery or even work choice for parent but life chance for our child minister must for the sake of all our child get plan in place now well do not hear plan there madam deputy speaker it not our job the shadow spokesperson say it be not her job with general election later this year it be not her job to have plan staffing have go up by people before we even start the expansion our winter survey show that at the end of last year application for vacancy at group base provider go up from two for each vacancy to five for each vacancy do not entirely hear the question ask by the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes but think she ask how many child have receive something as result of the expansion if that be not her question will write to she the answer be and counting we expect the number to go up in the come week and month as it have with other expansion the funding for and increase to rate will come from day to day spending the april expansion be the point at which provider will see significant increase in their rate by the way that increase be more per hour than parent be currently pay for under twos provision that be significant increase in the rate that be be provide just as be confident about the april roll out which have now be deliver despite all the noise and snip from the opposition benches be confident about the september roll out the shadow secretary of state have say that the hour model have fail and that we should move away from it she say that she would have childcare plan that would be like the creation of the nhs nobody know what that mean and month later it seem that neither do she because she have have to ask somebody to write plan for she instead the truth be that while this conservative government have just successfully deliver the first stage of their childcare expansion which parent be benefit from labour still have no plan no policy and no idea how to help family with childcare call the chair of the education committee there be much in this statement to be welcome the education committee welcome the expansion of childcare broaden the offer and the increase in funding for the fund hour and this deliver on some of that it be an early success story but as the opposition have say there be clearly serious risk as the plan expand exponentially over the come year in order to address those risk the minister need to secure more funding and more place the place be welcome start and more staff in the sector be vital but can he assure that on top of the very welcome half billion pound that be secure in the spending review he will keep make the case and keep listen to the provider about the funding they need to keep move this forward can he ensure that the same quantum of increase be there for the under two year old as it be for the two year old compare to what be currently pay in the private sector thank my hon friend for raise some important issue he be right that certainty and increase those rate have be some of the most important thing that the sector have ask for it be very warmly receive that we be provide that certainty for and which we think will help the sector accord to various report that have be carry out it will help they to unlock private sector investment and capital to help they expand because that be the big thing they feel might be hold that back it be part of doubling of the amount that we be spend on childcare from billion to billion will continue to work with my hon friend in ensure we address the sector need start by declare an interest as parent of two year old child what all of we parent be talk about be the cost of childcare and the minister do not address the cost the survey clearly show that over half of all nursery and pre school say that the funding do not cover the cost of provide the service in the way that the government be ask they to provide it it do not take rocket scientist to work out that somebody get to pick up the bill toddler could do it the estimate before the government announce the new hour be that fee would rise by every single parent of child in nursery in my local community who have come to have say that their fee have go up as direct result of this policy because that be how nursery be try to stay open and make end meet will the minister prove wrong will the minister commit to publish the datum on the fee that parent of all child under five in nursery and pre school be pay in this country prior to and post the change in hour we have survey of parent and provider to set our rate base on exactly what they be pay the hon lady must have miss my saying that our rate for under two be over more per hour than that pay by parent privately know that she do not like these fact because they be at odd with her narrative she ask to prove she wrong this month we have just do so the expansion of government fund childcare be go to be major benefit to many family in my chelmsford constituency so on the first day of the expansion go to visit scallywags nursery one of the many outstanding childcare provider in my constituency be overwhelm by how happy and love the child be they would like to expand but they rent premise from the local council which be run by the lib dems who write to last night say the council will not give more space to expand this amazing nursery be there any capital funding available to help nursery expand that sound like typical behaviour from lib dem council at the end of last year we allocate million in capital funding every local authority get some of it precisely to help provider like the one my right hon friend describe to expand upgrade their building and so on would take that answer and see what the council be do with that money last year childminder leave the sector with the early years alliance estimate that the current offer for three and four year old be underfunde by billion that be impact hard work parent particularly in rural area such as the one represent amelia provider in cullompton let know that devon get just of funding per hour for the care of three to four year old which be way below the rate in some urban area westminster for example get rate of per hour what will the minister do to address that imbalance and ensure that people struggle with the cost of childcare in rural area be not short change in september we put in more than million to increase rate and in april we have put in furth million to increase rate in part to help provider meet the cost of the increase in the national living wage that the government have make so rate be go up specifically on childminder we have be do few thing we have childminder grant scheme to try to encourage more childminder into the sector and we have also be consult on thing that would make their life easy and more flexible and allow they to be part of more network so that we can grow what be an important part of the childcare market to listen to the gloomster on the opposition benches anyone would think that childcare policy be triumph under the last labour government in widespread fund childcare be just not thing and where the labour government do provide subsidy they be in school latch on to nursery in direct competition to independent provider among the expansion which very much welcome what be be do to help workplace provider particularly in place such as hospital where we have public service worker in short supply who be work irregular hour and can not necessarily use mainstream nursery what be the minister do to try to encourage more man into the profession too my hon friend be absolutely right we inherit some family be able to get hour of childcare thank to the government expansion they will now be able to get hour each week from when their child be nine month old until they start school my hon friend raise two other important issue first on people who work irregular pattern it be important to say that we do not require the childcare pattern to be to we want that flexibility for people work awkward hour and to make it easy to have that provision in other setting he be also entirely right about try to encourage more man into the sector in addition to our big recruitment campaign just to get more people into the sector we have specific focus on try to encourage more man for all the minister glib response he have fail to address the fact that the child organisation coram have report that just of local area have sufficient childcare place for child with special educational need and disability what be he do to ensure that all child with additional need in constituency such as mine can access childcare and that provider have the staff the resource and the space they need to do so do not think the hon lady have listen to the content of any of the answer have give we work with every local authority in the country local authority have statutory duty to ensure that there be number of place available and we work with every local authority to ensure that they have sufficient place include for child with special educational need not single local authority be report that it do not have sufficient place very much welcome my hon friend statement particularly because in basingstoke two in three parent of two year old be already use childcare so they can apply for and benefit from this extra support will he talk little more about how this will help give more parent the opportunity to get back into employment which can be particularly important for we when we be look to address the gender pay gap my right hon friend be absolutely right one of the thing that might happen with this expansion be that parent will for the first time have childcare for their two year old the other thing be that because they can claim hour they might increase the hour they be already pay for to relieve the pressure on their finance so she be absolutely right about the labour market impact the office for budget responsibility say that it expect people to enter the workforce and million to increase their hour as result of be able to access this childcare which will be huge benefit to the economy childcare in northern ireland be in critical condition and we be not even receive these new change flaw as they may be on saturday join thousand of parent on march in belfast demand immediate intervention because child per year be far from unusual the northern ireland executive promise that that would be day one priority but they have not deliver more than warm word one interim solution could be raise the tax free limit even just in line with inflationary pressure as apply to other benefit certainly for northern ireland parent who miss out on what the minister have just outline will he commit to explore that with the treasury in order to in his word empower parent the precise parameter for that be set by the treasury but we would like more people to claim that tax free childcare because many people could claim it but do not do so at that level and of course it be double for child with send people can have that with the exist entitlement in england which can far boost their finance we be keen to encourage people to do that to declare an interest my young son rupert who be two enjoy his first day at pre school last week under this scheme know from talk to many other parent across my constituency just how transformational this expansion of the childcare offer be however with buckinghamshire which be the natural and obvious place where people want to move to bring up their family fear that demand may well outstrip supply soon we also have compete cost pressure from border london where when it come to recruitment the challenge of move to an outer london borough to get london weighting at work be real as my hon friend continue his superb work in ensure that we have that expansion in childcare provision will he ensure that county such as buckinghamshire and other across the south east be give special consideration give those cost pressure be delighted to hear that rupert have be able to take advantage of the offer my hon friend be right that in different part of the country we see different rate require by provider base on the cost they be face that be why our rate be different in different part of the country local authority have to pass through of what we give they to ensure that as much of that go to the provider as possible but we will continue to ensure that they be set accord to what provider tell we they be have to pay so that they have the money that they need an increase number of constituent be come to because they be struggle to access childcare when they need it which be partly exacerbate by staff shortage and sickness and overstretched provider however want to press the minister on this point he say in his statement that the estimate million of additional funding will ensure that rate keep up with provider cost pressure what modelling have be do to ensure that that be the case particularly with reference to place such as bristol where we know that lot of overhead will be high than in many other place outside london do not expect he to have the figure at his disposal today but will he promise to write to to give an assessment of what have be do in relation to bristol yes will the projection for the year and be base partly on economic condition at the time few factor go into they will determine those rate but will write to the hon lady about specifically what have be happen in bristol to date as parent of month old know that this new entitlement will be very much welcome by many parent across stoke on trent and staffordshire and will make massive impact on many work family in particular however also know there be challenge in get the right place for child with the minister look at what more can be do to ensure we support the sector as much as possible and expand those place in stoke on trent and staffordshire my hon friend be right our key focus be on ensure that place and staff be available in every area of the country as we have show in april with benefit from the new entitlement we be pull every lever in time for the roll out next september and the september after to up recruitment up rate encourage more people into the sector and help expansion to ensure that provision be there will start on consensual point it be not bad thing that the government want to extend early year childcare provision we all want to see that and we want it to work in answer to my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen the minister say however that not single local authority be tell he that there be not sufficient place yet coram say that of local authority decrease of since last year report that there be sufficient childcare for child under two both statement can not be correct so why do coram think that in some local authority there be insufficient place have see those figure many of these survey be base on measure of confidence take at some point before the roll out all can tell the hon gentleman be that we work with those local authority all the way up to that roll out to ensure that they have those place sometimes when people say they be not confident they turn out to be able to provide all those place my point to the hon member for luton north sarah owen and now to the hon gentleman be that since the expansion for april no local authority be report that it do not have sufficient place we will now work with they on the next stage of that expansion for september the first hour for nine month old and upwards to ensure that that be the case again point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker last friday the prime minister make speech not to this house but to the press describe what he refer to as sick note culture and imply that people who be economically inactive due to ill health or disability be not genuine but malingerer that be grossly offensive not only to people who be unable to work because of ill health but to the clinician care for they as it question their professional integrity it ignore the overwhelming evidence from epidemiologist such as professor sir michael marmot which show that over the last year we have become sick nation live short life and less of our life in good health it be certainly not the compassionate approach that the prime minister say he be go to preside over fundamentally though it ignore the sovereignty of parliament when can we expect the government to bring the matter to the house so that we can question the prime minister on his assertion thank the hon lady for her point of order and for give notice of it the speaker have no power to compel the prime minister to come to the house however it be an important principle set out in the ministerial code that when parliament be in session the most important announcement of government policy should be make in the first instance in parliament the speaker have be clear about that be sure those on the treasury bench will have note the hon lady remark can see they focus on and will feed that back on point of order madam deputy speaker may seek your counsel my business and trade committee now have oversight of arm control and be step up to its duty by hold tomorrow its first hearing on arm export to israel some day ago we request that ministers from the department for business and trade and the foreign office come and give evidence they do not reply they have to be chase last week and on friday tell we they be not prepared to attend this be topic of importance to the house and it be also important that ministers in fulfil their legal responsibility be politically accountable what advice can you give at this late stage to try to ensure that we have ministers in front of the select committee tomorrow morning thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order and for give notice of it again attendance by ministers before select committee be not matter for or for the speaker but it be certainly true that select committees be entitle to expect timely reply from ministers to invitation again very much hope that those on the treasury bench have note the point that the right hon gentleman have raise and will feed they back my other advice would be perhaps to raise the matter with the leader of the house who might be able to assist suggest he pursue the matter that way neurodivergent conditions screening and teacher training motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about screen for neurodivergent condition in primary school to make provision about teacher training relate to neurodivergent condition and for connected purpose stand here in this parliament to represent all those who need different type of support because their brain work differently the bill be present be one important step in get everyone the education they deserve we have principle in this country and have have for more than century of universal education system ensure that we have proper tailor provision for child with neurodivergent condition be critical part of that education society now recognise neurodiversity more than it ever have and we certainly have much more positive debate about neurodiversity than at any point in my lifetime we have more recognition in society broadly of the strength that neurodiversity can bring and of the support that people with neurodivergent condition need to thrive think that attitude over generation have shift notice that myself be dyslexic but for over year hide my dyslexia and feel sense of shame about it now see that as wrong but that be how feel that impact of society attitude have reduce however be one of the lucky one because be good at math could get through school well and get into an amazing university where my dyslexia be identify still today only one in five dyslexic child have their dyslexia identify in school parliament and the law have not yet catch up with the change in society and there be furth to go that be why present this bill the bill will make provision for essentially two thing the first be the early identification in primary school preferably in the first year of primary school of neurodivergent condition include not only dyslexia but broad spectrum of neurodivergent condition only if we measure such thing and find out how each individual child brain work can we well get tailor support for they the second be the strengthening of teacher training recognise the work of the minister and his predecessor to introduce specific requirement for neurodivergent condition to be part of the teacher training syllabus but much more still need to be do also recognise his work in the green paper publish last year on the early identification of those condition but still far too little happen turn policy from consultative green paper into action on the ground be critical neurodivergent people often have the skill that be increasingly need in the world the straight line thinking can be do by computer artificial intelligence be accelerate that change yet more but future job will need skill such as creativity lateral thinking and enhance communication that be often more prevalent among those who be neurodiverse it be great to see some employer such as gchq deloitte ubs and universal music proactively hire neurodivergent people but if people do not know that they have condition they will not be empower to do what be necessary to make the most of those extra skill it be great to talk about the positive benefit that neurodivergent condition can bring but the stark reality be that child with such condition be far more likely to be exclude from school and end up in the criminal justice system academic describe that as the school to prison pipeline shockingly of child exclude from primary school have special educational need and of child caution or sentence in the youth justice system have special educational they be nearly all teenager if their condition could be identify early when they be five or six then they could get the support they need the impact on the nation finance let alone the impact on those individual would be significantly improve research consistently demonstrate the efficacy of early intervention to support neurodivergent child for example research by the education endowment fund reveal that those who receive the nuffield early language intervention programme make on average the equivalent of four month additional progress in language skill compare with pupil who do not get access to neli the department have fund access to neli in many primary school but not all welcome that but there be more to do that show the cost effective nature of early intervention technology be make early intervention more and more possible through the power of ai screening of all child will allow we to understand how their brain work and teacher well to help they identify those who need formal diagnosis at an early stage that be critical accord to london school of economics report publish last november of child with special educational need and disability live in the most affluent decile while only live in the most deprived those statistic be important because they show that the distribution of access to formal diagnosis be clearly unfair it can not be true that of child with send come from the most affluent decile while only come from the least affluent obviously parent in the most affluent area be more likely to be able to pay for diagnosis so there be an issue of social

for his crime against the club which almost take it out of existence under the ownership of the chesterfield fc trust chesterfield be now back where they belong in the football league after become champion of the national league this year be it not the case that what our football club really need be to be run by people with commitment to those club and passion for they rather than by people who be try to make quick bob to address the point about the bill be long overdue the labour party say for some time that it would do something about this issue but do absolutely nothing since have be secretary of state we have have white paper and response to it and we have draft bill at speed we have introduce the bill and be delighted that it be have its second reading today recognise that the

last week to get rid of fa cup replay which be lifeline for many club by provide opportunity to get big draw at anfield old trafford or even tottenham hotspur stadium obviously this bill will not touch on that but do the secretary of state have any comment on this issue my hon friend be absolutely right because those david and goliath fixture be part of the magic of football know that replay

stuart andrew have do tremendous amount as have many member from across the house but pay particular tribute to my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch without whom we would not be in this position today be respond to point about the delay those on the opposition benches might criticise we for the delay but the truth of the matter be that they can not legitimately do so because they have an opportunity to take action and fail to take it that be why we have take the action that we have agree with the right hon member for walsall south valerie vaz that we should recognise that many people have play considerable part in bring this bill to fruition because many people have champion these reform would like to mention again my hon friend the member for chatham

relevant all party parliamentary group the football authority the football supporters association the fa the premier league and the efl everybody have play their part in make sure that this bill be in the shape that it be as we bring it forward today everybody know it take village to develop bill of this size and scope and credit be due to party across the house across football across academia and across business hundred of people have give we their time and their insight to help get the regulator right and for that be extremely grateful as member will know the centrepiece of this bill be new independent regulator with clear and unambiguous purpose to protect the game that we all love the way to do that be by get football house in order to that end the regulator will not interfere with matter on the pitch instead it will be focus tightly on governance finance ownership and fan it will help club to build their resilience while prevent team from fall into the wrong hand to begin with the mighty bristol street motors trophy winner peterborough united contact today to express their support for this bill but they suggest that it be vital that the independent regulator have the power and the ability to intervene on financial model arrangement can the secretary of state guarantee that the independent regulator will have those power the regulator will have significant power in relation to individual club and when trigger by either the premier league or the efl to the league themselves it will have backstop power in order to look at the pyramid as whole be always delighted to hear conversation about football take place here or anywhere else the secretary of state talk about club get their house in order do she agree that an important part of that would involve club look at who their shirt sponsor be do she agree that shirt sponsorship by disposable vape company be wholly unacceptable have no part in modern football and set really bad example to all our child we want they to love the game that matter so much to all of we be sure that over the course of this debate many member will raise issue of concern to they and their constituent emphasise that the bill be about financial regulation although be very pleased that the premier league have take action on gambling advertising on the front of shirt which be something we look at very closely and that the government be take action on vaping and smoke more broadly the bill be tightly define and address financial regulation and be very pleased that we have introduce this legislation the secretary of state be exactly right about the financial aspect of this bill but we have to make sure that we get the balance right we do not want to kill the golden goose that be the premier league and we want to make sure that we have growth in the sport through the championship and the efl we have to consider the crowded calendar of european match too do she believe that the regulator will have the ability to chart that very fine line between uefa fifa and her proposal that be go to be pretty tough we do not want to do anything that damage the world lead premier league which be worth billion people across the world look to the premier league and we have work very closely with the premier league the efl and other to try to get the balance right have meet the executive extensively during this period and have meet all the club in the premier league and the efl to try to get the balance right we be try to get light touch regime that allow the league to do what they be already do but with regulator the bill be all about financial regulation the secretary of state will understand that many of my constituent who support everton be greatly concerned about the eight point deduction apply by the premier league for breach of its profit and financial sustainability rule nottingham forest face two point deduction for similar breach and other club have yet to face any sanction can the secretary of state reassure my constituent and many other football fan that her commitment to support the premier league do not mean that the bill will not have sufficient strength do she share my concern that my constituent and many other be worried about lack of transparency consistency and fairness in the case of everton and other club will she give reassurance on that point as be make clear the bill be about financial regulation know that many fan be concern about issue within the game itself the bill will not regulate how football be play which be matter for the footballe authority this be about ensure that club up and down the pyramid be financially sustainable under regulator if no deal be agree on distribution the regulator can step in this will protect the pyramid overall be grateful to the secretary of state for mention early do she accept that one of the big driver of financial stability be the parachute payment in the championship do she think it be flaw that the bill exclude parachute payment from the regulator power we understand that parachute payment have role to play there be provision in the bill to deal with parachute payment but that provision relate to the consideration on club by club basis in the licensing regime itself when club like norwich city be promote to the premier league those parachute payment give they the confidence to invest which drive competition in football be they not good thing that we should be support we believe that parachute payment have role to play although know people have concern about distortion under the bill if there be any issue relate to the finance of particular club particularly by reference to the parachute payment it might have receive the regulator have an ability to look at that within the licensing regime as whole have read the bill but wonder whether the secretary of state have read it under clause the regulator be not allow to deal with revenue that the specify competition organiser distribute to club by virtue of team operate by the club be relegate from competition organise by the specify competition organiser in other word parachute payment be deliberately exclude from the remit of the regulator why have that be do when it be one of the most distortive element of the current arrangement have be very intimately involve in this bill have put together all the policy recommendation and have discussion with all the party encourage the hon member to read all aspect of the bill not just the provision in relation to the backstop which he quote know many member feel that parachute payment be very important so let try to explain again know that many stakeholder have concern about the impact of parachute payment on financial stability sustainability and resilience and know that parachute payment can play an important role in soften the financial blow of relegation at all level of the football pyramid give the complexity of the issue the regulator will need to undertake an holistic evidence base assessment of the system of financial distribution as part of its state of the game report and this will include an assessment of parachute payment parachute payment have be specifically exclude from the backstop mechanism to ensure that the two final proposal from the premier league and the efl be easily comparable the impact of parachute payment on financial sustainability and resilience could be relevant factor in both the decision to trigger the backstop and the final choice in relation to proposal more generally the regulator can look at the impact of parachute payment on particular club when it come to the licensing regime will the secretary of state give way will press on as have now answer five time on parachute payment we will achieve our goal through the new licensing regime under which all club in the top five tier of english man football will need licence to operate as professional football club the regulator will have power to monitor and enforce requirement on financial regulation club ownership fan engagement and club heritage protection as well as set corporate governance code of practice and have the power to prohibit club from join breakaway competition it be fantastic that the top five league will have to have licence will the secretary of state comment on the resource that will be necessary to put that in place for the season this be big undertaking and considerable resource will be need to monitor what be go on order know that some colleague who be intervene might not be seek to catch my eye later remind colleague that if they do intervene it be customary for they to stay for the entire speech the government be very conscious of the impact on club which be why we be give they time to prepare for the measure we be bring into play on top of the new licensing system the regulator will introduce new strengthen owner and director test to make sure that club custodian be suitable and to protect fan from irresponsible owner this respond directly to grow concern about financial mismanagement in football particularly illicit finance as well as to fan fight back against owner at club like blackpool and charlton athletic the regulator will also bring in new robust financial regulation to improve the financial resilience of club across the football pyramid as member of this house will be all too aware lack of financial resilience be one of the key risk to club future give the regulator power to oversee financial plan and to step in to require club to beef up their financial resilience where it have concern will prevent club from face cliff edge situation like we recently see at southend united that will not mean that all club have to break even we know that strive for success can come at cost and that this ambition make the game so exciting so we welcome sustainable sensible investment what we can not have be reckless overspending irresponsible risk taking and inadequate funding that be why the regulator will look at each club plan and how they be fund and ensure that club have the resource to manage their risk take no long can we have short term action jeopardise club long term sustainability the secretary of state have mention fan engagement couple of time fan increasingly feel as though they be not be listen to by their club the fan lead review which she have also refer to make series of recommendation in to give fan real say in how their club be run will she be clear as to how the bill will ensure that club be effectively and properly engage with their fan and that fan voice be not be ignore the bill identify number of thing that we know be important to fan include heritage asset such as the colour of shirt badge and the location of club stadium we know that those be the thing fan care about the bill ensure proportionate approach because we know that engagement with different fan at different club which have very different measure in place will require we to take proportionate case by case approach the regulator must ensure level of engagement with fan particularly on the issue that be identify but we also want to ensure that it work for the club therefore it will be for the regulator to ensure that proportionate approach be take be about to go on to discuss that aspect because we will be set minimum standard of fan engagement and require club to seek the approval of their fan for change to those thing mention in order to comply with the strong exist protection for club name we know that most club have strong relationship with their fan consciously engage they in decision about the club heritage however there have be some notable exception as we have see at cardiff city and hull city whose fan have have to battle to bring back or keep their club colour badge and name as say the regulator will also protect fan interest with the requirement for club to seek its approval for any sale or relocation of their home ground the stadium club play in be not only of significant value to fan it can be the club most valuable asset and it be only right that club seek to relocate have to demonstrate that such move would not significantly harm the heritage of the club the regulator be ask to balance the financial sustainability of the club with heritage concern and to make an either or decision under its purpose in that scenario could the regulator decide to allow club to move if it feel it be good for the club future sustainability even if the fan object yes that be right the regulator have to take into account the view of fan and look at the proposal if it consider the proposal to be good that change can take place under the new regulator fan will no long face the prospect of see their club sign up to ill thought out proposal such as the european super league which several premier league club try to join in the house be unite in recognise that those proposal for the new competition be fundamentally uncompetitive and would have undermine the football pyramid against the wish of fan this regulator will prevent that kind of closed shop league from ever get off the ground respect what the secretary of state be try to do but there be huge inequality of arm between billionaire owner of club and fan organisation have be the mp for queens park rangers for nearly year but my small borough also contain chelsea and fulham and in my political lifetime all three of those club have face either be fold up by greedy owner or lose their ground in perpetuity do not see what in the bill be go to prevent that from happen in the future all the measure in the bill cumulatively will ensure that club be well manage and run therefore they will be there and will not go into financial insolvency and administration which decimate community all the measure we have set out be it the owner and director test or the measure to ensure that club have financial plan will ensure that club be properly run we be introduce the bill to ensure that the situation whereby we have have administration since the premier league be found in be not continue we be not say that club be never go to get into financial difficulty but we be say that we be go to put strong framework in place to ensure that all constituent can be confident that their club will have certain level to which their business be run that they will be run well leyton orient in my constituency with which the secretary of state be familiar now have owner who be genuinely dedicated to their welfare previously they be own by somebody on whom the fit and proper person test have no effect and that person nearly destroy the second old club in london be she confident that the bill will ensure that such people will not get their hand on club such as orient in the future yes this bill be all about ensure that the owner and director of club be fit and proper people so that what happen to the hon gentleman club which be at just few week ago do not happen again will support this legislation because many of the step it take be very necessary hope it will mean that worcester city will never leave worcester again much of what be hear about the need to protect the financial sustainability of club and league also apply in the small but still important world of rugby union as the secretary of state will know and as the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew who be sit next to she know very well worcester warriors be currently without place in professional rugby if this legislation succeed will she consider apply it to other sport or introduce legislation for other sport where that be require to sustain opportunity in the professional game as my hon friend know the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew and have spend time look at the issue in rugby and continue to do so we be set out what we hope will be strong financial framework for football this be be watch closely by other country that be look into what they will do in football of course if other sport want to look into this they can move on to the backstop power obviously broadcast revenue be hugely important source of income for club up and down our top tier football league but the current distribution of revenue across the top five division be not sufficient and football have not be able to come to suitable new arrangement not only do that contribute to problem of financial sustainability but it can have destabilising effect on the sport to avoid that in future the regulator will have new target backstop power to help ensure sufficient flow of money however those power be intend only as last resort and can be trigger only if certain condition be meet the backstop mechanism have be design with the industry and lead expert to give football incentive to reach timely compromise thereby deliver the right outcome while minimise costly regulatory involvement the final part of the regulator job be improve the corporate governance of club we will establish football club corporate governance code and will require club to report regularly on their corporate governance set out how they have apply the code and why that be suitable for their circumstance the language in the bill reflect the language on corporate governance in the companies act but there corporate governance include the relationship that board of director have with not only the component part of the business but the employee should it not be inherent in the bill that the corporate governance code should suggest how club can maintain high player welfare standard we look closely at precedent elsewhere particularly in regulatory field when form the basis of the bill we have always be conscious that we be regulate in commercial space and that football club be business the premier league be world lead we be regulate because football club have fail to solve these issue themselves what we do not want to do through this bill be over regulate include in area in which we would not be regulate but for this bill we be try to strike the right balance that be why the bill notwithstanding question that have be put to in this house focus on financial regulation importantly it do not interfere with the game or with how player be look after the league have role to play and they should be primarily responsible for run the game do the regulator have sufficient power to intervene if some of the owner be service debt in other area of their company the regulator will have strong power to look at owner and director test and at financial plan they will have power that be design to ensure the financial sustainability of football the question that would arise suspect in the right hon member case be whether that issue be interfere with particular football club the secretary of state be be very generous with her time thank she for mention cardiff city hope to catch madam deputy speaker eye later and talk some more about they one reason why the government regulate in the commercial space and in business be to promote competition in the white paper the government say that the scale of parachute payment can distort competition in the championship and encourage great financial risk taking by club not in receipt of they if the regulator have no power in this sphere how will we ensure that the pyramid be reality rather than it become ever more difficult to climb recognise the concern raise about parachute payment and the distortion of competition on the backstop power parachute payment have be include because of the way that the backstop mechanism work two offer be make by the premier league or by the english football league however that be not to say that parachute payment be completely ignore the regulator will look at the state of the game in holistic way also it be not to say that if the parachute payment affect the running and finance of club the regulator have no ability to look at those payment the secretary of state say something very important about look at precedent for regulation in other area certainly one reason why be in the chamber today be my love of the game although recognise that there be financial matter that need regulation that be not the whole of the issue my concern and that of many of my constituent be about the matter be treat simplistically as if there be just one set of financially relate problem without consideration for community tie the involvement of fan and so on when she look at other example do she find anything that manage to crack that nut or that capture that nuance there do not need to be nuance the whole point of this legislation be to protect fan community and club at the heart of that be make sure that club be financially sustainable none the less in the legislation we also have measure to ensure fan engagement on the thing that fan care deeply about the heritage for example can not overstate the point that although we want to protect the premier league which be an important world lead asset we also want to protect fan and community and that be what this legislation be all about take together the new measure and the carefully consider remit of the regulator will help we to safeguard club protect the interest of our fan and avoid unnecessary and excessive regulation the vast majority of our club be run well and live within their mean be confident that those club and their owner will recognise that the bill and the new regulator will allow we to put football on solid basis for year to come the bill will preserve and enhance all the thing that we love about our national game and commend it to the house may start by say how good it be to see the bill receive its second reading many people have be campaign for it for many year and as the secretary of state have acknowledge it have strong cross party support lot of people both inside and outside the chamber have put in lot of work sadly week month and be afraid secretaries of state have go by but be glad to see it here at last since be give the honour of serve in this role have meet fan club representative league govern body and special interest group and want to thank they all for their time and expertise know that they be follow our proceeding closely also thank the civil servant at the department who know will have put in painstaking work to get we to this point they deserve our appreciation and hear that same point be make by those on the government benches this new law will not fix all of football problem nor be it design to believe that it can be transformative if thing be do right both during its passage through parliament and in the crucial implementation phase the prize could be great financial sustainability across the whole football pyramid and crucially fan have great say in how their club be run it could be those thing but it be up to we to make sure that it be that be what fan deserve and what labour have call for in our last three election manifesto we opposition members be therefore absolutely committed to pass this bill into law and to make it work it be once in generation chance to change the game that this country love for the well we must all realise the responsibility that we have to make success of it football be part of what it mean to be british it reach across border it be part of our global brand it bring we together yes it sometimes bring crush disappointment but it also bring we joy we watch with our family and friend at the local in the stand or in our living room we cheer and chant with stranger in stadium and together we sit on the edge of our seat with nervousness labour will never take the magic of football for grant it deserve our attention and our hard work football be also an economic powerhouse as my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition have clearly set out labour no mission be to go for growth the premier league and its club contribute more than billion in tax in and support more than job the english football league club contribute so much to our country finance to job and also to joy the next labour government want to invest in hospital in school in repair the damage do by the last year and in make sure that every child get great experience of sport and physical activity at school that be why football contribution to public fund be so important to we and it be why we will focus on economic growth labour will support football up and down the pyramid to grow sustainably and to create even more job as well as joy say sustainably because labour believe it be important that the whole football pyramid share in the success of the game england lead the world in its system for football the english pyramid be build on competition the fan love of the game be never more clearly demonstrate than when they overwhelmingly reject the close competition model of the propose european super league that set in train the fan lead review by the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch and lead to where we be today but there be so much more work to do my hon friend mention the fan lead review do she agree with that the woman game which be out of scope of the bill be grow exponentially and that there be scope for the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch in new role to look at the woman game and see whether we could have some regulation there thank my right hon friend for that intervention she rightly pay tribute to the hon member for chatham and aylesford although karen carney have also make substantial contribution in lead the carney review read the review with interest it be great and believe my right hon friend may be aware of it it be certainly worth member give it detailed read it deserve all of our attention be really proud of the fact that the english woman game be grow so strongly and so well and that it be inspire so many woman and girl to get active and get fit the work of the hon member for chatham and aylesford combine with the carney review set in train exactly what my right hon friend be look for strength in our woman game which deserve it and deserve our admiration it be bring in new audience all the time which think be fantastic thirty year ago english football league revenue be of the premier league today they be just the gap then be million it be now billion it be not that that income be not distribute from the premier league it be it be because increase amount be spend on parachute payment which be make to club relegate from the premier league for up to three season respectfully remind the ministerial team that it be the government own white paper that recognise the scale of these payment and that they can have unintended consequence my hon friend refer to parachute payment do she feel that the inclusion of the clause that prohibit the parachute payment as relevant revenue be already prejudge the outcome of the state of the game review it be exclude they to start with rather than leave the question open until the review be do my hon friend raise really important point it be so important that the state of the game report lead the way and that the regulator be allow to look at the evidence and have the scope to intervene where that be necessary fear that the secretary of state may inadvertently have confuse the issue in her early remark although think she begin to clarify it would be grateful if the minister could far clarify it in his sum up as there be some remain confusion certainly think that if we do not sort this issue out today we must at least have some time in committee to try to untangle what clause actually mean think the secretary of state say that the parachute payment be in play in the discussion about distribution of fund within football until it get to the backstop when they be take off the table it be almost be say that if the premier league do not reach an agreement with the efl until the point of the backstop the premier league will in effect have veto over parachute payment be change that be what be be say and think that position really need to be change when we be in committee thank my hon friend for that intervention like other colleague he be so knowledgeable about the detail of this bill urge the government to consider what have be say in constructive spirit everybody present want to get to the bottom of this confusion we want to make sure that football and the regulator have the tool they need to grow sustainability key word which the government have themselves use the confusion about parachute payment be worthy of further attention because there be so much money involve they also have the distort effect that the government white paper rightly identify if we do not look at this issue we risk distort competition in the championship by encourage great financial risk take by the club that do not receive those payment we know that that can result in an over reliance on owner funding which again be simply not always sustainable as my hon friend have mention clause exclude parachute payment from any order by the regulator on revenue distribution gently say to the government that as there seem to be some contradiction or possible confusion we would like that clear up would be grateful if the minister could say more in his summing up about how the money currently use for parachute payment could make more impact and perhaps be share more widely whether he have examine that in detail and to what extent he feel the current term of the bill be satisfactory part of the problem be that football be inherently risky the very nature of what club do be in order to get promote if in try to engineer some sustainability from the point of view of people invest in club derby county have be promote the model would have be deem to have work but it fail and so do the club how would labour facilitate individual from across the globe invest in the good league in the world while make sure that club such as derby county be protect gently point the hon gentleman to his government white paper because the bill come from there yes of course the game be inherently risky that be part of what make it thrill but we need to be think about whether that be calculated risk that be part of the thrill of the game or an unintended consequence of possible market failure we really need to look at whether there be distort competition gently suggest that if the hon gentleman have not read his government white paper he should have then we really need further discussion in committee on this issue it be worthy of such consideration on calculated risk taking we need to be clear about when we be take unnecessary risk and when there be unintended consequence of the way finance be distribute surely football club owner should be able to spend the money they have to take such risk however if they be spend money from the future as derby county and glasgow rangers do and the risk fail in the current year they will inevitably go bust glasgow rangers disappear altogether and derby county almost disappear football fan do not want club to take that risk and surely the regulator should be prevent that my hon friend raise the most important point which be about how fan feel there should be no taking of reckless risk and there should be no jeopardising of club future and that be important any business owner the hon member for bosworth dr evans mention business know that they have to think about what level of risk they be go to take fan be at the heart of football which be one of the thing that make football special and unique and what fan want be such an important feature of our discussion will ask the same question that ask the secretary of state because the hon lady could be the secretary of state this year do not know whether she go to watch football perhaps she go to watch bristol rovers in her own city but she will know that early this year bristol rovers have the mighty norwich city at its stadium it have fan for mid week fa cup replay which be really important to the club bristol rovers have call on the fa to reverse its decision to scrap fa cup replay this bill be about financial resilience and viability throughout the pyramid so what be the opposition view of the fa decision last week be grateful to the hon gentleman who say that the bill be about financial resilience obviously bristol rovers be my local club and listen to what it have to say but also listen to what fan across the country have to say and they be clearly very upset about that decision my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition have make his view on this extremely clear because we really think that replay be part of the game hon member hear hear he have say that replay be an important part of our game and we can hear that in the reaction of my right hon and hon friend behind however as the hon gentleman say replay be not part of this bill and we be focus on financial resilience he will know how much have enjoy be at bristol rovers be on the terrace only the other week watch they lose to reading but that be part of the joy of football that and the pie be it want to talk about how revenue be distribute throughout the football pyramid because that be an important consideration of this bill one of the many way the bill set out future for the regulator be on financial distribution it be down to the league themselves to reach deal on broadcast revenue distribution but it sadden we all that at the moment deal still seem long way off it seem that there have be something of breakdown in communication have meet many of the interested party and listen to concern and appreciate that this be complex and not easy but urge both side to come to an agreement however if those negotiation can not result in deal once the bill be enact and the regulator be in operation the regulator will have the power to select one of the two option put forward by the party that important backstop power should be use as last resort but it be clearly important that such power exist give how important the backstop be will the minister say what work have be undertake to ensure that that specific part of the bill work in practice be it legally watertight be there question that still have to be answer from my engagement with stakeholder there seem to be many important question that still need to be answer and we will be explore they far in committee but will the minister give we bit more of an indication at this stage regard what work have be do and what that will mean in reality proportionality will be key for we all as many member across the house have say we want the game to succeed and to continue in the great future that it have for the whole country proportionality be important with all legislation and regulation we must strike the right balance and nowhere more so than with the licensing scheme for club that be the mechanism through which majority of the regulation and enforcement will be deliver and it be right that the regulator will be able to tailor club obligation proportionately especially when it come to club in the national league many hon member represent constituency in which there be national league team we support an appropriate transition period to enable club to prepare for this process we must bring club of all size into the system in an appropriate way colleague have also mention sanction as the bill stand the regulator will not be able to impose point deduction on club that break the rule labour back that decision but know how much this issue matter to colleague across the house and to fan up and down the country who be understandably devastate when their club be hit with point deduction as result of decision that the fan have no power over after the formation of the regulator the league will continue to have their own financial rule and there be nothing to suggest that point deduction for breach of the league own rule will not continue nobody want to see point deduction for corporate or financial mismanagement least of all fan hope and know fan hope that the regulator and licensing scheme will mean that club be more financially sustainable and that breach of league rule and the associated point deduction be much less likely again if the minister would like to address that when sum up the debate that would be helpful football club be the pride of our town and city they be an important part of our civic identity and the heart of our community new owner often bring important investment but know from speak with club that it be about more than that it be big responsibility and honour to be the custodian of football club and owner should take that seriously know that be how it feel for the owner of my local club bristol rovers my hon friend be make very good speech one other thing that club do through their community arm in the case of qpr that be qpr in the community trust be regenerate an area in one of the poor community in the country we have andy evans and his team it be big business and they make massive contribution to the local community however they and the club fear that the poor governance and financial inequality of football put all that at risk be that what be at stake in the bill my hon friend be exactly right so many thing be at stake in the bill which be why it be so important we get it right know fulham well and the important work do by football community trust supporter club and so many people involve in the game who help to regenerate their community however they can not do that on their own or if their club be not sustain financially that be what be at stake my hon friend be absolutely right indeed have see that for myself in what bristol rovers do for our local community meet the owner of my local club recently it be pleasure to meet he and to hear from he and fan about the importance of grow the club sustainably and invest in the local community be impressed to hear the number of way that the owner management and fan have engage with each other and learn from each other there be always more to do be sure all club would acknowledge that there be always more they can do to hear what fan have to say and what their community trust be do as well as how they can be enable and support to do more of what they do so well although the vast majority of owner act in the good interest of their club some do not that be why labour have be call for new check on owner and director the bill stipulate that those check will look into whether prospective new owner have sufficient financial resource to be suitable owner review their finance to ensure they be sound check whether prospective owner behave with honesty and integrity and assess officer competence and whether an owner source of wealth be connect to serious criminal conduct again will the minister address those point when sum up the debate what do all that mean in practice the bill be not clear whether the test will be objective or subjective in nature and some of they appear to be distinctly subjective how will the test be conduct and what will the criterion be will that issue be address in government guidance or the regulation do the minister expect it to be address in the code would be grateful if he clarify that the bill be reasonably clear that the regulator consider not only those rule but any other rule that it wish to write into the rulebook this will give we for the first time ever subjective test set by the regulator which can be enforce with statute back it up the hon gentleman seem to be say that it be subjective test be ask whether there be any objective test because think that be important in term of fairness where be they objective where be they subjective concept such as competency can be interpret both objectively and subjectively and would appreciate the minister clarification of what he view as the government position one issue we come across in the huge difficulty that worcester warriors go through be that it have director who be approve on the basis that he have be approve by the footballe authority he be approve because he be practise solicitor but it turn out he be disbarred practise solicitor be it vital that regulator have the ability to check information give to it so that even if people provide mislead information to regulator it have the ability to intervene and strike those people off as appropriate director where necessary the hon gentleman explain exactly why it be so important that the owner and director test will work that be why be address these remark to the government it be after all their bill would like to know substantially more from the minister in answer to the question that and other have raise fan engagement be crucial and we back fan have great say in how their club be run therefore it be right that the bill require that if club propose change to club crest or colour it have take reasonable step to ensure that those change be support by majority of fan fan engagement should not be reduce to box tick exercise and neither should it be one size fit all engagement must be meaningful and appropriate and suitable for each club the woman game be not explicitly mention in the bill but we would all agree that it have have stellar few year it be grow quickly bring new crowd to stadium and introduce lot of girl to the joy of physical activity be determined to see the woman game grow even more have already mention that proportionality be key principle that must be consider during the passage of this bill have listen to what representative of the woman have to say do not think it wise to introduce regulation to the woman game before it be ready or unless it be necessary it be right that there be power in the bill to introduce regulation to league designate by the secretary of state that could if necessary in future include the woman game will be monitor that closely in collaboration with representative from woman football the governance of english football be in position of uncertainty and on this government watch that uncertainty have be allow to carry on far too long that have be and continue to be to the detriment of club and their finance after the passage of this long await bill and the establishment of the regulator hope that football will be able to enter new period of governance stability as the bill progress that be what member across the house should be aim for and what fan across the country deserve rise unsurprisingly in support of the bill be pleased to see you in the chair madam deputy speaker because know you take keen interest in doncaster rovers and although you be not able to speak in the chamber on these matter you have be fine advocate for its view during this process may congratulate the hon member for bristol west thangam debbonaire not just on complete the marathon on sunday but for stand up and sit down without an audible oof two day after that be pretty commendable thank the ministerial team and the long suffer official at the department for culture media and sport who have work exceptionally hard on bring forward this bill this detailed piece of legislation have be well work through to ensure that it move smoothly through parliament and be in place as soon as possible also pay tribute to those who have campaign on this issue for many year may have chair the fan lead review but the truth be that blueprint for reform be create long before go down hansard rabbit hole thank to james in the official report team and read some fabulous reference from day past include glorious contribution from the much miss alan keen in that highlight the premier league and the football association govern themselves with no appeal beyond their confine official report june vol give last week furore over fa cup replay that still seem apt there be too many to list but the like of richard caborn andy burnham my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins kevin miles and his team at the football supporters association david bernstein gary neville henry winter and peter crouch no relation have be vocal campaigner for change the truth be that for many year sports ministers include have stand at the dispatch box with crisis after football crisis and plead with the authority reform yourself or parliament will and here we finally find ourselves the secretary of state have already set out the context of this bill it be always important to remember that the premier league ask the government to intervene when six club seek to join the european super league the plea lead to the then prime minister boris johnson promise legislative bomb that come on the back of high profile financial problem in the football pyramid include the demise of bury which my hon friend the member for bury north james daly have speak about many time in this chamber the fan lead review be the outcome of the request from the premier league and the regulatory failing to prevent club from disappear from our football landscape and the subsequent massacre of the community ecosystem that support they the review be deep dive into the issue and shall remain forever grateful to those who participate in it in preparation for this speech re read some of the submission to the review it be interesting to read in its submission that the premier league think that there could be use for an institution with step in power and capacity to intervene should it manifestly have fail to uphold rule the submission go on to say that such body could also set the general principle require for standard for governance and transparency include for financial regulation strengthen the independent operation of the oadt support the principle of standard for owner responsibility as custodian and protect decision make over key issue for fan the same paragraph continue provide it operate in proportionate way that respect the benefit of permit well run club and league to be nimble in their decision making and encourage to innovate and take properly assess risk then this could make an important and positive contribution to maintain and enhance what be the world most dynamic and attractive football environment this bill be all those thing shape brilliantly to reflect the word of the premier league itself about what great regulator could look like it leave many of we scratch our head as to why the premier league have spend the past few week lobby to stop the bill progress will say few thing about some of the specific clause in the bill clause set out to define an ultimate owner of club that be important as part of the challenge in the past have be that that have not be as clear as it should clause to set out the objective and principle of regulation make clear that the regulator should be nimble in its approach and can oblige good governance and real time intervention but be not oblige to guarantee zero failure however the bill make it clear that the regulator will be time efficient consistent and transparent that be departure some might argue from the current regulation clause and be key to how the regulator will evolve good guidance will be essential to its success as we have hear in contribution and intervention already foresee strong guidance require on the role of fan advisory board and on fan engagement such as that set out in schedule and along with certain technical challenge such as pitch ownership if that be different from club ownership timely but think through guidance do in consultation with key party will be much need if the regulator be to hit the ground run equally important be the need not to overload on guidance and create regulation by proxy the whole point of the regulator be to improve governance and to be open and transparent yet agile in relation to change clause and in particular subsection and which refer to in my note as the martin samuel measure martin be journalist but he would regularly ask whether the honesty and integrity test would prevent boris johnson from run football club clarify that the test be define by crime under the serious crime act offence cover by fix penalty notice be therefore not relevant which will be relief to those involve in football who might have be issue with speed fine or other such fine clause relate to the regulator have regard to foreign and trade policy objective that have become slight distraction from the argument on the independence of the regulator with that in mind suggest an amendment to the clause to change the word must to may it be boringly technical to the outside world but incredibly important if we be to impress on it the value of the regulator independence part of the bill be an important aspect for the domestic fan base cover prohibit competition and the protection of club heritage include ground disposal for the fan it be the soul of the bill when we publish the review explain that its order be craft like good album we put all the chapter about governance first before we get to the redistribution of revenue the way see it be that the premier league give substantial amount of money to the wide pyramid but without the necessary structure of good governance it be akin to have the heating on with the window open put in proper regulatory structure should give the premier league and its club confidence that its money be go to good owner with proper business plan in place and real time financial monitoring that give significant protection the bill follow that same mindset we get the structure right then we distribute the finance and that be what part of the bill do on part have some key point to make first there be an argument to be have on whether the regulator should have the ability in principle to trigger the backstop be sympathetic to that but it need to be do carefully secondly although colleague have focus on parachute payment clause be draft so broadly that both domestic and international broadcast revenue could be deem relevant revenue and available for distribution that be not the case at the moment be slightly surprised that the premier league have not include that in its list of thing that it want to amend it be important that we seek to clarify precisely what be consider relevant revenue at the early opportunity thirdly it be essential that we define either on the face of the bill or at some point in parliamentary proceeding the definition of material change what might seem material to the efl might not seem material to the premier league fourthly the power of the regulator will extend to the national league as presumably will the redistribution of funding however note that the national league have say that it oppose the regulator it be in the gift of the secretary of state to define the reach of the regulator so she could if she feel it necessary remove the national league from the bill and in so do remove it from the redistribution of finance and instead allow it to continue its exist arrangement via the football association it be right that we put these power in the bill but it be disappointing that two year on from the review the football authority have not do deal on distribution the solid recommendation in the review would have move this debate much far forward than it be now but they be ignore so here we be with the regulator require power to intervene that be promise over and over again clause mean that all fine receive be pay into the consolidated fund although it may not be popular with the chancellor propose that in order to ensure that the regulator be deem independent of government that clause be amend so that money raise above and beyond the regulator cost be divert directly back into grassroots football which be sure would be much appreciated as we look to continue the growth in participation and investment in facility in the run up to and long after the euros in do not wish to test the tolerance of the house madam deputy speaker so shall wind up love football and although the premier league continue to cast and other who support the bill as the enemy of success investment growth and international competitiveness would argue that quite the opposite be true the premier league be one of our fine export and nothing in my review or in the bill change that instead the bill protect the pyramid from the vulnerability and fragility that have challenge football over the year it protect football club from owner who forget that they be merely custodian of something great than trinket it serve to protect fan club and entire community from lose their heart and soul for those reason hope that the whole of parliament will come together to support the bill and get it into statute as quickly as possible rise order thank the hon lady for her kind word about doncaster rovers get the feeling that speak for the whole house in say how pleased we be that her work in this area have be recognise appropriately hon member hear hear before call the next speaker great many right hon and hon member wish to contribute so my first advice to members be to try to confine their remark to about seven minute call kevin brennan thank you madam deputy speaker also broadly welcome the bill may add the member of the culture media and sport committee to the list of people whom the secretary of state praise be member of that committee until the end of last year and be glad to see several of its member in the chamber for second reading it be pleasure to speak directly after my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch think can call she friend after all these year commend she for her work in this area and the terrific speech that she have just deliver find myself agree with pretty much everything that she say know that we be in favour of replay but it would perhaps be wise of not to repeat everything she say so will try not to although commend she for what she have to say there be still some who question whether parliament should be regulate in this area at all why should we legislate to regulate football after all we do not do that in every sport although as the hon member for worcester mr walker point out there be perhaps strong case for do so in rugby union after what happen to his local club and other english premiership rugby club however in reality parliament have long record of legislate specifically in lot of different area of football in fact my private member bill the unauthorised entry to football matches bill will have its committee stage on may and will hope give its widespread support make its way into law if we have time before general election be call there be long record of football specific legislation so this be not that unusual football play such huge part in our culture let say as the member of parliament represent cardiff west that although we talk about the english football pyramid it include welsh club of course and have do for well over century football be huge part of our culture in wales in fact lot of hon member will not know that it be the most popular sport in wales more popular even that rugby help greatly by the success of our welsh man national football team in recent year include their reach the semi final of the euros of course as hon member have point out we would not be legislate if football have demonstrate the ability to regulate itself which many of we include the late alan keen whom be glad get mention in the speech of the hon member for chatham and aylesford have call on it to do for many many year it be tell that the bill be now widely welcome in almost all tier of football except as have be mention the vanarama national league and the high echelon of the premier league completely acknowledge not only that the premier league be the world most successful club competition but that its existence have bring benefit down the football pyramid in the first year of the premier league existence its revenue grow thirtyfold while revenue in the second third and fourth tier grow more than tenfold that be the nub of the issue if we go on as we be without effective redistributive method the inevitable consequence be that that the gap between the top and low tier would gradually make the pyramid untenable and unworkable without long term viable pyramid football at the top will become even more of cartel than it currently be the premier league chief executive tell the culture media and sport committee early this year that he be totally accept of the bill and the regulator come in after that bill as the bill progress we should bear that comment in mind which he say on the record to the select committee we should hold the premier league to that as we have hear during the debate football should be about competition business should be about competition and regulation be about help to promote fair competition that be the role of parliament government and the state in this sphere in the absence of an agreement between the premier league and the english football league the backstop power of the regulator be an essential tool to ensure fair competition and so that small business be not ultimately wipe out by the gradual concentration of resource at the top of the game and the impossibility of make progress in the game without take the sort of risk that undermine local club and ultimately lead to number of situation that we have hear about do not see how ministers will be able to convince right hon and hon member that that be possible without the regulator have any power to deal with pyramid payment as we have hear the government own white paper acknowledge the distort impact that they have on competition if the bill be about fair competition that have to be deal with want to mention my own club cardiff city hon member would not expect anyone not to mention their own club its stadium be locate in my constituency and its recent history have contribute to some of the clause in the bill particularly around fan right cardiff city have be very successful during my year in parliament it have be in the premier league twice reach the fa cup final and lose to liverpool on penalty in the league cup final but as be well know some year ago new owner vincent tan decide to change the club colour from the traditional blue to red believe it to be colour that bring good fortune if hon member can imagine for football club universally know as the bluebirds the switch to red be somewhat problematic for the fan welcome the fact that the owner change his mind and that the bill would not allow that sort of thing to happen without the involvement of the fan can confirm that cardiff city football club welcome the bill thank the club director steve borley who write to about the bill he say that the game fractured governance model and the inequitable distribution of finance be increasingly put the game at risk that be why the bill be so important the bill do not make any reference to the player that be missing part the player union the professional footballers association write to hon member about that to say as draft there be currently no reference to player within the bill we think this be significant omission would like to hear from the minister why that be the case whether the government would consider the representation from the player union to ensure appropriate reference to they in the bill and reassurance about some of the exist structure that protect the right of player which the union be concerned about no one here want to damage the premier league simply want my club cardiff city to have fair chance of play in the premier league again hope that the bill will go some way hopefully improve strengthen and amend to ensure healthy future for football call the chair of the culture media and sport committee also rise to welcome the bill and congratulate the government on bring it forward have to admit that we on the culture media and sport committee be wonder whether this day would ever come but the government appear to have be inspire by the mighty portsmouth football club who last week secure victory and promotion to the championship with last minute goal it be edge of the seat sporting drama like that that make british football the good in the world right from the very bottom to the top from the millionaire at the top of the premier league to grassroots club such as gosport borough who have treat fan to romp season they play in the southern football league and sit tantalisingly in the promotion zone of course there be also fleetlands fc who be push for promotion in division of the wessex league here in parliament we have also be keep on the edge of our seat eagerly await this bill that could potentially reshape the landscape of football governance over the past few year instability off the pitch not the action on it have increasingly grab the headline soar level of debt have lead to the collapse of club such as bury and macclesfield an experience share by so many fan in community up and down the country devastate by the demise of their beloved club the debt problem be get bad premier league club have report staggering loss of over billion over the past month alone and the figure in the championship be look just as shocking with leicester lose million in fan of club such as everton and reading be sick of see they mismanage through the reckless decision making of irresponsible owner just last week the house hear of the pain of torquay united fan whose club have enter into administration follow year of flawed business plan unreliable owner who do not have the interest of their club or its fan at heart and be prepared to play fast and loose with their finance and their future should be hold accountable as lifelong pompey fan feel their pain after series of disastrous owner it take fan lead buy out in to save our club demonstrate that our fan be literally prepared to pay up in order to stay up or in fact to stay afloat such be their dedication and commitment the failure of english football wealthy club those in the premier league to agree financial distribution deal be put the fabric of our national game at risk this situation have drag on for far too long and it have be especially disappointing to see the premier league spending time and money lobby mp and peer against the bill rather than lobby its club to secure fair deal for english football decision be repeatedly be make in the interest of the top of the football pyramid without thought for the vital ecosystem that generate its lifeblood scrap fa cup replay may be welcome in some quarter but once again it be characteristically messy number deny low league side that all important financial boost we need change of tactic so know that fan across the country will welcome these plan to introduce regulator and attempt to bring some stability to the game of course that be not to say that the new independent regulator will be the silver bullet that the government have sometimes present it as the problem face by football be extensive and complex and there be still some area where would like to see more clarification and further work as the bill progress will talk through couple of those now widen financial distribution across the football pyramid will be the ultimate test of the bill last year our committee urge the premier league and the efl to urgently agree new deal to redistribute high proportion of revenue throughout the football pyramid we recommend that in the absence of such deal the government should expedite their plan to establish regulator with the power to mandate solution be pleased to see that the bill aim to address this issue by give the independent regulator the backstop power to intervene in the distribution of broadcast revenue but that power be subject to certain threshold be meet and it exclude the controversial parachute payment within the pot that we have already hear about we need reassurance that the regulator have the tooth to trigger its own backstop power and impose fair settlement when and where it deem necessary and without any undue delay we also need an indication from the government of how the regulator will curb the reckless spending of club try to keep up with those in receipt of parachute payment enhance financial regulation across the football pyramid be really welcome it will improve the resilience of club encourage sensible financial decision and ensure that risk be mitigate however give that the regulator will not oversee regulation such as the premier league profitability and sustainability rule or the squad cost control that be set to replace those rule the government need to provide clarity on how both system will work alongside each other and reassurance as to why they deem it unsuitable for the regulator to take on this responsibility when it come to owner be really pleased to see that the regulator will establish new strengthened owner and director test to ensure that club custodian be suitable for the role welcome the fact that the bill confer enforcement power on the independent regulator to protect club from any harm that an irresponsible owner or officer might cause and to be able to remove they but we need further detail on what precisely will happen to those club that have an unsuitable owner remove we need to understand how the regulator would remove another potential dai yongge from read without compromise the future of the club and ultimately punish its fan would be grateful if the minister could explain how the bill will safeguard club that find themselves in the position of have no owner no financial safety net to keep they go and potentially no prospective buyer on the horizon we have already hear from member that football be nothing without its fan and be pleased to see the bill place fan engagement requirement on the club as well as require they to comply with heritage protection and to seek approval for the sale or relocation of their home ground but the bill do not go quite so far as require fan to have golden share as recommend in the excellent fan lead review lead by my hon friend and real life friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch at this point it would be terribly remiss of not to add my congratulation to she and the whole team who have put an enormous amount of brilliant work into get the bill to this stage as the bill progress want to be sure that it provide way for fan to share their concern about their club with the regulator and to know that they will not be dismiss the culture media and sport committee have agree to hold pre appointment hearing with the chair of the independent regulator once the government have preferred candidate and expect that this will be one of the first question we will be ask they ultimately there be two main question that want to see answer by this legislation first do it deliver for football and its fan secondly to what extent will it prevent some of the distressing time that club like reading be currently undergo there be more to be do on the bill and indeed the guidance that go alongside it to ensure that it fully meet those aim we can not overlook the huge economic value the sense of community cohesion and the moment of both local and national pride that football give we nor can we ignore the vital importance of football pyramid that deliver at every single level know that some include the premier league have concern about unintended consequence so the select committee have write to they to give they chance to set out exactly what they would change because there have be plenty of chance for the sceptic to prove that this bill be not need give that this be one of the big overhaul in the history of english football we must do it right congratulate ministers particularly the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew on get the bill to this stage look forward to his response and to hear what more can be do to secure clear win and just like pompey can we do it well before the end of the season be put in place seven minute time limit to ensure that everybody get as equal chance to speak as possible it be pleasure to follow the chair of the committee the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage follow the fan lead review by the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch in speak in westminster hall debate on petition on this issue say in that debate and reiterate today that the current disparity between the rich and poor and the selfish nature of the elite club need remedy this bill do not do justice to some of the issue that the hon member for chatham and aylesford raise in her report particularly with regard to grassroots football woman football anti discrimination and equal opportunity but be sure that those issue will be cover by later legislation in due course football in this country have become story of the have and have not and regulation be desperately need to ensure the health and prosperity of the game at all level not just in the premier league therefore welcome the bill and support the creation of single independent football regulator at time when the game have become an international sporting juggernaut and global commodity with revenue great than ever before the financial and long term sustainability of the football pyramid have never be more at risk too many historic club be on cliff edge about to fall off it and face the fate of historic club like bury which have disappear and bolton and wigan which have struggle since this be why new legislation be crucial fan need great voice in the running of their club and there need to be well mean test for owner and director to ensure fiscal sustainability and to root out the financial mismanagement that have plague too many club through the action of foreign investor or those of domestic owner who have do the same thing an independent football regulator should ensure that english football continue to serve the interest of regulated club while also contribute to the economic and social wellbeing of the local community associate with those club however regulator should also be watchdog and watchdog without any tooth will not be much of regulator which be why it be essential for this regulator to have the power to do its job properly the financial gap between the premier league and the english football league have reach critical point thirty year ago efl revenue be of the premier league but today the proportion be just the gap then be million it be now billion at this pace the football pyramid be untenable and the financial gulf between the two league and across all level continue to worsen but there be no doubt that there be enough money in the collective pot to achieve sustainability at all level if the game revenue be distribute in the right and fair way couple with proper governance and organisation as it stand the premier league continue to rule the roost when it come to english football but some top flight club have show that they be incapable of self regulation we need only look at some recent financial breach to see that the premier league be nowadays not in position to self govern and regulate the sport when it struggle to keep its own house in order some have reap the financial reward without show any concern or desire to preserve the health of the sport outside their own need and ecosystem only an independent regulator will be able to provide proper oversight regulate club behaviour and intervene when necessary to ensure that they act responsibly the bill also provide targeted backstop power to allow the regulator to step in when it come to the allocation of broadcast revenue between the premier league and the rest of the football pyramid if need on the face of it that be fine but clause require the specify competition organiser the premier league and the english football league to enter into period of mediation in connection with the distribution of relevant revenue receive by one of they and if they be unable to reach agreement the independent regulator may make an order as to the distribution of that revenue however in the bill as draft that do not apply to certain circumstance in which the relevant revenue refer to in clause do not include parachute payment which be define as payment make directly to newly relegate club as be mention early this can not be fair and it deliberately exclude the english football league from make its case that the parachute payment be disadvantage and distort the revenue of championship club as whole the payment be not just parachute mean for soft landing they be ladder lead back to the premier league for most of the club that have already be relegate that be clear from the current position of the championship division leicester city leeds united southampton and norwich city occupy four of the top six spot incidentally norwich have be relegate from the premier league six time since its formation in this expose the fact that the payment be ladder back to the premier league to the disadvantage of other elsewhere in the championship division preston north end my constituency club which have its own place in history as found member of the football league join in believe that regulator be the only option to underpin both sustainability and competitiveness within the financial distribution of the football pyramid as we speak preston be sit in place in the championship table they have never play in the premier league the only former top flight first division champion never to have do so they have wage bill in the region of million how can they compete against the like of southampton club that be relegate in with wage bill of approximately million which be six or seven time that of preston north end as lifelong football fan believe that this house not only have the opportunity but more importantly the obligation to create much need reform in the game through transformative bill that safeguard all club for decade to come rise to support the government plan although until fairly recently have considerable reservation about they it take some time for to come round and accept the fact that we should have regulator on balance think that be the right thing to do as long as it be do in limited and careful way have ask myself if we really want government appoint regulator to oversee our national sport or indeed any sport will other regulator follow will there be mission creep very probably will the government of the day get the blame for the decision of the regulator almost certainly that say we must ensure that our club which be much value part of many of our local community continue it be undeniable to fan who have love football for as long as have that the game have change since it become truly commercialise in the and particularly the with the arrival of the premier league the scale particularly when consider the money involve be difficult to comprehend give this trend the type of individual and organisation we see take ownership of club have change dramatically as the game have become truly global phenomenon some owner have become somewhat detached to say the least from their club supporter as fan know that be one of the big mistake any owner can make we see that with the proposal for the euro super league not that that concern grimsby town fan such as we need to preserve the pyramid that ensure the grimsby town of this world whose blundell park ground be in my cleethorpes constituency be allow to continue will break off from talk about the bill to have my say on the replay issue it would be remiss of not to to the magic of the fa cup go back many year can remember as be sure one or two other member can when the draw be always at lunchtime on monday the bbc football correspondent bryon butler would speak in hushed voice and we would hear the rattle of the ball as the number come out replay be part of the same magic as the draw we have hear much about the game between coventry and man united on sunday that it be decide on penalty be rather sad would it not be great if they be play again on wednesday evening or whenever perverse incentive in modern football structure can lead to poor governance and unstable club many club be now make regular loss and borrow at debt level that they can not afford these be not the indicator of healthy sport and only serve to make club financially vulnerable worsen the environment they operate in and create uncertainty for fan as kevin miles the football supporters association chief executive say the government proposal represent once in generation opportunity to reset the finance and regulation of football as mention at the start of my comment approach the issue with some reservation but have study the government proposal think they have strike fine balance between the benefit and potential cost of introduce such regulator mind you be sure that there will be some perhaps minor change as the bill go through committee but now support the main thrust of the bill on balance the government have be careful in their approach to how they intend to regulate ensure that it will be proportionate to the club individual circumstance accord to factor such as league club size and financial health by empower the regulator with narrow focus we can prevent overreach while ensure that club remain financially stable welcome the fact that the regulator power to ensure financial sustainability through redistribution of broadcast revenue for example will apply only in extremis fan be highly attach to their club image whether that be the name the badge or the colour it be therefore welcome that owner will have to consult on such change we hear early about the incident at hull city few year ago when the owner try to change the name and so on which certainly do not go down well with fan that be just one controversial element of the allam family ownership of the club with frequent trend be the owner inability to understand tradition which be so important to fan the secretary of state actually come to blundell park in cleethorpes to launch the policy which be only right give the true status of grimsby town who thankfully have be save from relegation to the national league yet again as she rightly note football be nothing without its fan applaud her determination and that of the sports minister my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew to put fan back at the heart of the game the government propose regulator will ensure the sustainability of our nation favourite sport and that the connection to fan be maintain while not change the fundamental of the game itself on that basis be happy to support the bill there be much to welcome in the bill which build on the excellent fan lead review conduct by the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch it will give fan more of say in how club be run and the wide premier league redistribution of broadcast revenue what be not to like the core of the bill be financial stability we do need an independent regulator to stand up for the interest of small club and the efl against globalisation which be see in not just americanisation but oligarchs and sportswashing welcome the bill but of the crouch recommendation the government have regrettably opt out of action on equality diversity and inclusion against backdrop of bury go under pandemic that no one predict and the spectre of the european super league thwart for now it be notable that since club have go into administration how much will the bill address it be too late for bury will reading on the brink of extinction be next we need regulator with appropriate tooth to take away licence from rogue owner those venture capitalist who think about balance sheet profit margin asset strip and destroy club because football club be so much more than simply business know that from the work do locally by qpr and brentford and the email that get from professor david gilbert of ealing he describe how his family have be read fan since and tell how dai yongge be not co operate with the fan and have destroy club in china and belgium after the pitch invasion against port vale he say be at the game and the protest that lead to the abandonment be watch from the seat that my late mother and brother watch from until they die my grandfather support from the have be go since that experience be not atypical of supporter in many town and community across the country who have little or no say in the fate of their club the club may be save think there be an american bid at the moment but that be perfect case study or textbook example in the future of why we need more protection because of the collective social and cultural heritage of our club however the relationship between the english premier league and the efl and the distort effect of parachute payment which have massively unbalanced the beautiful game be not address in the bill although there be clause on regulatory power to force financial redistribution of revenue the bill seem to think only of broadcast revenue it would be easy to knock the premier league for its hospitality towards mps it be in here late last night wining and dining people and its attempt to push the free market but in recent year our club have do we proud in europe in all england final in and and in they have change football reputation from how first remember it in the when it be synonymous with fan behave badly racism hooliganism and violence they have clean up their act football bring soft power and tourism but worry that the value of the fa cup which use to be such big thing be be lose with all these european competition we need some sort of transparency and consistency and clear system on point deduction why be everton fall foul repeatedly and not man city why the mismatch between different system and different league welcome the focus in this bill on the football pyramid which often seem as diana ross would say upside down my son give figure of million day generate by man united but that be not find its way down to the bottom of the pyramid as the hon member for chatham and aylesford say in chapter of her review football need to improve equality diversity and inclusion in club with committed edi action plan regularly address by the regulator but that be completely miss from this bill we know there be gap in leadership ownership and management and who would benefit from reform player parent and referee would benefit the figure speak for themselves the high up we go the boardroom become almost white male preserve we know woman football be increasingly expand we could also look at the issue of social class as well how else will we kick it out as the name of the racism charity demand even from business point of view in every other sector civil service local government bank wherever we go edi be central it should not be see as an add on with this patchwork of different system and plan we need level playing field kick it out figure show that racism and misogyny offline and online be all up we need proper regulatory framework for deal with those and feel we have miss trick the word fan appear only time in this page bill the bill stop short of the golden share veto power that the hon member for chatham and aylesford recommend this legislation be fundamentally about finance but we have hear about the ending of fa cup replay brentford local team do well out of they few year ago yet now that they be in the premier league they be all for ban replay that need address because it be big financial incentive to the small club there be also the problem of top team in tournament and it be problem let we not kid ourselves that the fifa club world cup expansion do not have super league style motif at its heart although that be go think it be try to come back in disguise like the propose champion league reform those have be reject for now but let we be wary of all these thing there will be resistance to change but we need truly independent regulator as the football supporters association tell we welcome this bill but when we have joey barton say woman pundit should be ban from itv and the awful thing that john yems say such as the word and curry muncher there be bit missing the sports minister be excellent on this issue he go to qatar with rainbow armband so perhaps he could tell we in his summing up what he will do to address it refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests want to put on record how proud be of how hard the minister have work on this bill he be an absolute credit to this government with what he have do here the recent event around change to the fa cup show just how press this football governance bill and the establishment of the independent regulator be as we consider the implication and potential of this legislation it be crucial that we approach the task with urgency recognise how important it be for football club up and down our country football be not just game in our country it be weave into the fabric of all of our community the club that dot our landscape from the grand stadium of the premier league to the intimate ground of the low division serve not just as team to support but as community hub and source of local pride yet despite the critical role that these club play the sustainability of the football pyramid be under significant threat the crux of the issue lie in the financial disparity that have grow ever starker over the decade the premier league while global success have see its financial might grow exponentially far outpace the rest of the pyramid that imbalance be not merely matter of elite success but structural issue that endanger the viability of club across all level today efl club operate at massive loss collectively lose million during the season alone the establishment of an independent regulator as propose in the bill be measure long overdue the regulator would have the authority not just to oversee but to intervene and correct the course ensure that financial sustainability be not mere aspiration but reality it would have power to impose financial solution that ensure the viability of club reflect the need of community club across england we must also address the need for fair distribution of revenue as it stand the financial gulf between the premier league and the efl have become chasm reform in revenue sharing and financial regulation be necessary to prevent small club from financial catastrophe when they fall from the premier league or attempt to compete without adequate support in support the bill we be act to preserve the soul of football in england this be about more than business it be about ensure that the joy excitement and community spirit that football bring be not lose to financial mismanagement and unchecked commercial appetite the bill present an opportunity to reform our football pyramid to be both competitive and sustainable it ensure that club can continue to thrive for the benefit of their fan local community and our national game it align with the recommendation of the fan lead review and respond to the clear need for great fairness and foresight in our approach to football governance it would be remiss of if do not mention my local club accrington stanley which be one of the found member of the football league although it be famous for the milk advert what people also remember be that in it have to resign its position from the football league and subsequently go into liquidation in that be not common then unfortunately we be now see it happen with many of our club have speak with the owner of my club andy holt about this legislation more time than can remember he be clear as be that if we be to protect club lower down the league we need not only to give they level playing field but to provide they with the space to invest in their community whether through investment in facility or work with child and young people this legislation be require want to talk briefly about the suggestion from my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch on redistribute fine to grassroots community think that be very good idea have see the impact accrington stanley have locally it really be the heart of the community it bring the community together and would hate to think of the counterfactual where it be no long viable for the club to continue serve my constituency in the way it do therefore urge my fellow member to support the bill and to stand for fairness sustainability and the long term health of english football let we ensure that the game we love be protect for future generation not just as spectacle of sport but as cornerstone of the community we serve it be pleasure to speak today thank the secretary of state the minister the hon member for bracknell james sunderland who have be superb campaigner for read football club and other member from across the house broadly speak welcome the bill but at the outset would like to pay tribute to our wonderful club read football club its player and its fan the man and woman team be both relegate last year as be refer to early that be through no fault of their own the crisis at the club be due entirely to financial mismanagement by the current owner mr dai yongge despite be relegate and with the risk of further relegation hang over they player and fan have battle through and we hope they have sustain the future of the club thankfully dai yongge now appear to be sell the club and we hope that bright future lie ahead hope that this bill will ensure that other club do not have to face what reading have be through and that football can move on to bright future when reading be in the championship dai yongge start his period as the owner of the club by invest in their future however his behaviour change over time and the story we face be one of failure to pay wage and indeed national insurance this lead to series of wind up petition from his majesty revenue and customs and ultimately to point be deduct that rather than anything that happen on the pitch determine the situation at reading this season the financial problem have continue unfortunately further point deduction have be make although we be grateful to the efl for its decision that they be suspend in an incredible effort the player have battle hard and avoid relegation from league one and we hope they have secure the future of the club however the pressure on player fan and the whole town have be absolutely awful we have be through and be still go through the bad crisis in our club history read football club be found in and be one of the old member of the football league and their proud history include get the high number of point in the have three season in the premiership and go on glorious series of cup run include win the simod cup in the and several impressive fa cup run during this period of great difficulty emotion have run high some people include the hon member for bracknell and join march to the stadium in october and there have be numerous other protest fan simply want their reading back and would encourage dai yongge to speed up the sale as say we must ensure that what happen at reading never happen again we need well test for owner and well assessment of club finance as mention early above all we need to ensure that club player and fan be not penalise for the action of owner however irresponsible they be have some point to make to the minister and the secretary of state although welcome the bill would like far more detail on number of key area that hope we will explore in committee particularly the test for owner and director the assessment of financial resilience the oversight of financial plan and the protection of ground and training ground which be another problem we might face in reading case the sale might separate the training ground from the ground which have cause great deal of concern and have hope now be resolve hope the minister will address some of those issue and that they will be explore more fully in committee believe that the bill be real opportunity for english football and indeed for football in wales and hope that we can all look forward to bright future for all our football club particularly read it be pleasure to follow the hon member for reading east matt rodda as have be watch reading since and the last two year have be as miserable time as any even if support reading be often through thick and quite lot of thin like everyone else in the house welcome the eventual arrival of the bill pay tribute to ministers for finally get to this point and thank my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch for her work on the fan lead review much of the bill be welcome and necessary but it be worth put it into historical context as say grow up watch football in the and when it be terrible it be describe at the time as slum game in slum facility ground be crumble the fan experience be terrible and there be huge amount of violence because some football fan behave like animal all fan be treat like animal and it be altogether miserable today however the top end of football be regard around the world as one of the good thing about this country remember former tourism minister tell that the three thing that make people like britain and want to come here be the royal family the bbc and premier league football so it be important to put the various legitimate criticism of thing that happen in football into that context the premier league have do some great thing for english football but this bill come from fan lead review and every proposal should be assess as to whether it serve the interest of fan at all level of the game we need an independent regulator because the league and therefore the club can not be trust to regulate themselves my right hon friend and be both there in when reading win the championship put four past derby what moment that be do not know whether he agree but think the current player and manager be do crack job just to keep the club alive echo that the fan the player and the staff have form bond of survival against dai yongge which show the strength of feeling that all football fan have for their club that be what we want to enhance there have be debacle such as the european super league and the increase number of club whose fan have suffer it be not just read although reading have feature lot in this debate because it be the late example we hope that no more fan will have to suffer in the way that we have suffer the question be whether the bill will be effective in practice one issue at the heart of the bill be financial distribution how do we distribute the enormous sum generate by the premier league without kill that golden goose it be difficult balancing act the regulator can not be panacea and it will have to be both tough and smart there be specific question that need answer first be the backstop power sufficient in the end the regulator have to choose between premier league offer and an efl demand and there be certainly an argument to be have about whether the regulator should have power to make its own settlement possibly involve other body in decide on what the settlement should be we have debate parachute payment and confess that be still slightly confuse as to the government attitude and desire towards parachute payment which be the key to why the championship be very skewed league have be look at the figure provide by fair game very good lobbying group currently for every of the broadcasting deal go to each premier league club go to championship club in receipt of parachute payment and go to championship club not in receipt of parachute payment more than twice as much go to the club with parachute payment as go to the club without parachute payment that be how we get skewed league the great disparity between the premier league payment which people might say be fair enough because it attract the broadcasting money and the championship payment do not reflect attendance for every people who attend football match in the season attend premier league match and attend championship match championship crowd be just under half of premiership crowd but the distribution of money to premier league club be more than time as much so it do not reflect what fan be do the next question be how we solve the problem of people like reading owner he be reckless owner who be immune to sanction because he be not in this country he spend money break rule incur penalty lose interest and go away the only penalty leave because he be ignore the financial penalty be point deduction agree with the efl on parachute payment but frankly it have be bit of chocolate teapot on protect reading interest all the efl have do be deduct point which just punish the fan what in the bill will help that think the licensing regime will help because competent regulator clearly would not let someone like dai yongge own football club in the first place even though the efl do the question still remain of what happen if an owner circumstance change such as if they lose huge sum of money and can not afford to support their club any more or if they just lose interest they might die and their family or business associate who take over might not care about the club what happen then would make one suggestion to ministers which would involve only small tweak to the bill clause allow the regulator to levy money from every licensed club so why should some of that levy money not be use to set up survival fund where completely reckless owner be walk away and leave club to go out of business as dai yongge have do in two other country such fund would allow the regulator over the few month when club need to find new owner to pay thing such as the national insurance that have not be pay at reading or the wage that be not pay for couple of month accept that would not be long term solution but have short term solution would make huge difference as the bill already set up the possibility of levy suggest extend its possible us to set up this survival fund so that if something like this happen again the new system of regulation will explicitly be able to cope with it the introduction of the bill mark big step forward and hope that it survive largely intact as like other have say there be improvement to be make and urge ministers at all time to keep the interest of fan at the front of their consideration because without the fan there be no point to professional sport declare an interest as lifelong blackburn rovers fan and supporter of kendal town who be in the north west counties football league be begin to fear that one day we might end up play each other at this rate to prove that football be more about unite we than divide we have accidentally wear claret and blue today as nod to our dear friend burnley laughter be at grange church of england primary school last week where bright year lad ask tim what sport do you enjoy the most nearly say football but then realise that do not enjoy football at all it make completely frustrated and miserable but it do rule my life and occupy most of my wake moment it be hugely important thing as it bind and create community it create share experience and it help to build what it be to be english and to be british so be thoroughly proud football fan love the game and want to stand in solidarity with all other football fan even those of team do not approve of pay tribute to the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch who be back in her place and the fan lead review which have underpin the bill my party and welcome the principle behind it and the independent regulator we acknowledge that football be integral to our culture and that the whole pyramid be vital to the game michael the chairman of kendal town his be an unpaid role at wonderful club that be do incredibly well at the moment have say that the top of the pyramid would not exist without the foundation he be absolutely right about that but the foundation include not just the club lower down the pyramid but the youth game and the westmorland county fa and what it do for young people support mental health build resilience and teamwork and create community be supportive of part of the bill on licensing although it be an important moment to do some redistribution take proportionate share from each of the club to ensure that we fund the additional requirement of meet the licensing part of the bill as we have hear be about owner and director express my solidarity with the supporter of reading we think of dai yongge and what he have do to that club and community not yet so awful but watch this space be what have happen with venky who own the rovers blackburn rovers be club in limbo and the question be whether or not we be go concern because of the owner plight in the indian court we have to ask ourselves the extent to which part will give the regulator power to deal with the dai yongges and venkys of this world and make they put up pay up or sell up nothing more underline the powerlessness of the fan than situation such as those and fan of bury bolton hull city and cardiff city would concur part deal with the duty on club and competition organiser be go to table an amendment if be permit to do so to bring back the replay in the fa cup and to restructure thing so that all compete team get an equal vote in decide the organisation and rule of that cup this situation be an outrage and nothing more underline the arrogance and complacency of the premier league than its thinking it can dictate to the rest of the league and the non league how that glorious and almost ancient competition will be if my amendment be successful the premier league might get away with one year of no replay but we will get they back the year after when the whole of the footballe establishment actually get vote my main concern be on part will not go through every part of the bill and the power of last resort be deeply concerned that we have only partial financial oversight this be where football fan feel sense of disappointment and the government have be little weak in this regard it feel like they have listen to the powerful few rather than the club the fan or the volunteer the financial power seem to be restrict to simply be mediator between the premier league and the english football league and actually the premier league and the championship when all say and do the right hon member for ashford damian green have talk about some of the financial division and let we look at the allocation of every receive in broadcast revenue go to premier league club and to championship club that be about enough for blackburn rovers to buy another pair of goalkeeping glove and by golly we could do with they if you go down far go to national league north club and fat zero to anything below the national league if the pyramid be important then the foundation be important want the regulator to have the power to make sure that the premier league and the championship do not hog all the money and that they distribute properly and effectively down the division want to pay tribute to kendal town the mighty mintcakes as we be know because they speak for and represent so many other non league club five hundred people week watch the great team manage by jimmy marshall everybody at that club be volunteer what good could be do by relatively small amount of redistribution of that money down to that level kendal town have host cup final of various kind at the parkside road ground this year it cost they to maintain that ground and they get nothing for it fairer deal be absolutely essential and so far this bill be the weak on that fair financial flow it be important that the government get that right beyond second reading at time when the division between the division have never be great think it be worth pay bit of attention to the parachute payment there be widening not just in quality but in resource between the premier league and the championship between the championship and league one between league one and league two and between league two and the national league that reduce competition entrench privilege and squash ambition one key driver perhaps the key driver to this division certainly at the top end of the table be the parachute payment which be completely unjustifiable disgrace it be the great financial distortion in the game this bill duck that distortion every football fan have notice that the government have duck that distortion therefore people be deeply sceptical about whether the government be serious about fairness in the game rise be happy to give way to north ender the government have not only duck this issue but the bill itself contain something explicit that preclude discussion of parachute payment when it come to the regulator power the hon gentleman make an important point and agree with he that explicitly need to be mention in the bill and we need to recognise that that be one way to allay the fear of those people who be sceptical about whether the government be serious about this as serious as the hon member for chatham and aylesford clearly be have the government get the interest of the fan at heart will they do stuff that be difficult and challenging for those people at the top of the game or will they have just listen to lobbyist rather than the fan in closing blackburn rovers be own by jack walker the great owner of any football club ever we say that we do not want billionaire in the game but we will have people like that any day of the week not just at rovers but anywhere else he love his club love his town and make massive massive difference today we be own by venky it be allege that when it take on blackburn rovers venky believe that it be impossible to lose premier league status it do not realise that club could go down gutted though be that we go down and get relegate be nevertheless glad that venky be wrong there should be movement between the division there should be competition and there should be fairness football be for the fan not just for the powerful few let we make sure that this regulator in its financial oversight be able to ensure that there be genuine fairness from the top to the bottom this debate about football regulator be quite interesting for because in all honesty when first hear about it do not really want one do not believe in one from an ideological perspective or see why we need to regulate sport at all always think the football association should be do that but think we have see certainly in recent week but really over quite sustained period of time that it simply have not do its job and that also true of the premier league the efl and so on that be why think we now have some proposal can certainly support and think they actually strike very good balance pay tribute to the minister for his work and to my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch who do such fantastic report in the first place be another one of those who be very angry that fa cup replay have be scrap grow up we always use to dream of lift the fa cup at wembley we would watch the team in the morning with the bus arrive and it be whole day event we would have the terrible cup final song and the story of the non league club in the early round and that be really what it be all about the diminish pull of the fa cup for many of the team at the top have be very sad over the year but it be still very special for many of our small club we have just hear about kendal town and we have worksop town in my constituency which make the first round of the fa cup this season for the first time in very long time we play stockport county in the first round and do manage to get an equaliser although we let few more goal in after that unfortunately and never get the replay that be special moment and something many people will remember for the rest of their life will mention the other football club in my constituency so that do not get some stick or lot of angry email we also very proud to have retford united retford fc harworth colliery and sjr worksop as well be hop that license agreement for club be not too onerous and do not place too much of an unfair burden particularly on small club and it be the small club be think of they be the one who maybe can not afford to employ extra member of staff or will struggle with some of the extra bureaucracy think we should give they some time and make sure we do not make any unreasonable demand of they we do not want mission creep with the almost public sector style equality and diversity target requirement and endless thing that we do not actually need in football be very much in favour of light touch regulation and do not want to be put our team at competitive disadvantage to other team in europe as have be say the premier league do do lot of wonderful thing have be one of its harsh critic over the year be notts county fan can not see we ever win the premier league as it stand now in fairness we never win the old first division either in fact think we be founder member of the premier league when it first come to fruition so we be the only founder club since luton town get back there that have never be member of the premier league so be hearten to hear what the secretary of state say today we have have the situation with gateshead this week which very sadly have not be able to take part in the national league play off if we look at some of the requirement of the efl this have be go on for many year remember when we have champion of the conference that be tell they could not get promote sutton united which go up not too long ago have very sustainable business model with pitch but it be not allow to go up with that and think it spend about getting rid of it it be second from bottom at the moment and it may go back there yet at the same time we all have team play on artificial pitch and think there be bit of competition issue worksop town have one of these pitch and it have really help locally in make the club sustainable think where we can actually help here be that we actually talk about that competition issue we could have well relationship between the premier league the efl and the national league and that be something to which think regulator can really make good contribution this would not be the first time government have step in remember the taylor report and what we do with stadium at the time there have be huge improvement in safety attendance have go up and people can bring their family without some of the fear that use to be there in the as notts county fan suppose do have bit of an interest in the three up three down from the national league as we do spend four year there so will declare bit of interest likewise on the fit and proper test we have also be victim in the past where the fit and proper test simply have not be fit and proper itself and we end up with owner that have not have the good wish of the club at heart thankfully we have excellent owner now and this be the kind of thing we can help they to get right we do not want mission creep or to be interfere with var or thing to do with player or fiddle with the club we be not there to be micromanager and it would be terrible shame if that happen be glad the secretary of state mention try to avoid excessive cost and ensure that we be focus on the mission of the bill think the balance be absolutely right and congratulate the department on its work football be not the banking industry know there be some thing that we could take as lesson but the bill be about football we need to keep it about football and realise the unique position of football in our society likewise we be not germany our league be much deep and we have more of they and the ownership structure be difficult it would be wrong to copy another model on involve fan be member of supporter trust and the supporter trust run notts county and stockport be another great example of supporter trust supporter generally do not have the finance which can sometimes cause its own problem will finish with one of ronald reagan most famous quote when he say that the most terrifying word in the english language be from the government and here to help in this case we do not need to be terrify these be sensible proposal be look forward to the bill progressing and to hear bit more about it but from what can see this be positive for the game and congratulate the minister on that rise to do something be unaccustomed to do which be warmly welcome piece of government legislation at the outset declare an interest as season ticket holder at and lifelong supporter of manchester city the world champion not for the first time congratulate the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch not just on her excellent speech agree with every word but because as the secretary of state say she lay the foundation for the bill we be all grateful to she football bring community together but for too long decision affect our game have be make without reference to those community and to the fan without whom football would be nothing and without regard to the long term interest of individual club and the wide game indeed some historic club have collapse because of the owner reckless action and the perverse incentive create by the pyramid finance the long we have wait for change the more club have be bring to the brink football have be in need of reform for some time labour have commit to that reform so we be glad that this much delay bill have the potential to address that be pleased it be here the bill be mostly well think through and the licensing regime and regulated power be mostly well frame tightly draw and positive congratulate the minister on his hard work we have hear lot in recent week about unintended threat to the premier league but not single one of we in the chamber want to threaten the sporting and economic success of the premier league love watch premier league football watch too much of it it be the most exciting high quality league in the world it be one of our great export and cultural strength nothing in the bill will jeopardise that success we have hear fair amount of scaremongere in recent week about the bill unintended consequence but without any evidence frankly more concerned about the unintended consequence of the premier league financial success and consequent financial dominance club be spend unsustainably to get into and stay in the premier league as we have hear efl club lose million collectively during the season efl club be gamble everything to get into the premier league fail and face financial crisis as result all that put the sustainability of our team and game into jeopardy those be the unintended consequence we should be worry about and which the bill can help to address in warmly welcome the bill wish to make few comment about area where it can be improve and strengthen the regulator objective rightly think be to protect the financial soundness of club to protect and promote the financial resilience of english football and to safeguard the heritage of english football excellent there be reference in the white paper specifically to protect and promote the financial resilience of the pyramid it might be that the phrase financial resilience of english football be enough but perhaps the minister will explain why that reference which be in the white paper do not make it into the bill on the propose financial redistribution power it be obviously important that the regulator have backstop power to intervene in financial distribution between league where necessary it be right that the regulator will be able to step in in circumstance where the premier league and the efl can not agree deal for that to happen one of those party have to initiate the process and the regulator make the decision base on the proposal put forward by each party that seem reasonable enough system but agree that there be question about whether the regulator should also have the power to put forward its own proposal if they be deem to be beneficial to the football pyramid as whole do not understand why parachute payment be specifically exclude from the scope of the regulator as appear to be the case in the bill we have hear lot in the past few week about the money that the premier league give to the rest of the efl accord to the fsa between and the premier league share million in what be term core funding but million of that go to relegate club via parachute payment as understand it of the tv income go to club those in the premier league and those in receipt of parachute payment the other club get just it be obvious that parachute payment be significant distort element of the system if we be to have dispute resolution mechanism between the two body it be difficult to see how that will work effectively when such large chunk of the money for redistribution be exclude from scope finally on redistribution would be pleased to see more opportunity for the regulator to step in to determine further redistribution to grassroots football community spending woman football youth development player pension and those sort of thing that be not to be do without careful consideration but as backstop provision for potential problem in the future be run out of time but will mention football fan engagement and decision make power it be good to see the setting of strong minimum standard for fan engagement as part of the threshold for club get licence the original fan lead review go far with the requirement for golden share be not suggest that we must have that but urge the minister to look again at those area of the bill to ensure meaningful fan consent whether we be talk about regulated colour of home shirt or the ground club should demonstrate that the fan have significant say finally there be some element miss from the regulator remit that be recommend by the fan lead review it be miss opportunity that the government have not take on board the recommendation for transfer levy to help redistribute resource it be also disappointing that the requirement for club equality diversity and inclusion action plan have not be progress the government will say that that should be part of the annual licensing process but would welcome ministerial assurance on that probably specify during the bill passage would have like to see some reference to environmental sustainability we all need to play our part for the future of the planet also wonder whether the bill would benefit from further clarification on what support be available if club look to be at risk of be unable to meet the condition of permanent licence have run out of time look forward to the bill passage and hope that the minister will take on board the comment make today this be an opportunity to put our football pyramid on sustainable footing for year to come look forward to support it this evening it be great to be able to contribute to this debate because although they say the black country be build on coal and metal we be also build on football straddle the two club at the heart of the black country derby namely west bromwich albion and wolverhampton wanderers this be pertinent bill and pertinent debate for my community in the black country we go through absolute hell with the financially precarious situation surround west bromwich albion at one point the club be have to borrow million just to keep the light on an independent regulator step in to ensure ultimately that fan of football club cherish part of the community can keep that club and that entity there can enable that sustainability and can put these people who be often behind the scene under the cosh and under scrutiny be absolutely the right way forward commend the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew for his work on the bill and my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch who have be an absolute champion in this space she should be so proud of what she have achieve the bill be real testament to her work we have cover plethora of issue in the debate not least the football pyramid what perceive at time be the inequity of the system we have get deal lot with fantastic grassroot football club which many member have talk about sometimes the narrative and discourse about the need for regulation involve top down approach and of course we must highlight the important work that our premier league club do but let we not forget that the pipeline to many of those club be first and foremost through grassroots football which lot of the player we talk about those star and talent come through my fantastic local football club such as tipton town football club in my constituency constantly share their frustration that they be ignore leave out or put under ridiculous burden that they often have to meet without resource everyone have touch on the replay issue say to my right hon friend the minister that it be complete kick in the tooth particularly for club that be far down the pyramid and rely on the revenue from get people through the gate again it just seem that the fa be only listen in its echo chamber quite frankly the government have tricky line to tread in ensure that football be independent and adhere to uefa and fifa rule on government interference on fa cup replay do my hon friend believe that there be role for reconsideration mechanism so that government can bounce the decision back to the regulator and ask have you potentially get this wrong and will you think again my hon friend be almost ask for replay of the replay that be sort of where the question be get the point that he be try to make about balance and the fine line argument on government interference the point have be make quite strongly as we have all see the fa own survey find that of fan want to retain replay and with that level of public pressure there be role for the government in facilitate the pressure on the fa think that that be the point that he be hammer down on although obviously the fa must ultimately be independent represent gillingham which have an amazing football club the gills the club be in administration in and be buy for by the then chairman paul scally now it be do exceptionally well and go up the league but it be small club and it rely on fa cup replay if we be really passionate about support small club in the community and about ensure that the fa do the right thing by support they we need the government to work with the fa to ensure that we get this right just like my hon friend club tipton town in my constituency get through on fa cup replay and benefit from that opportunity the fact that so many member have voice that concern as he have do so eloquently highlight the strength of feeling about it let move away from that issue to look at the bill operationally welcome the licensing regime the provisional and permanent licence be pragmatic way to do thing will be interested in see in committee and in the secondary legislation that follow the bill the detail of the regime appreciate that there be quite often flexibility and gap in primary legislation to allow for more pragmatic approach but it be important to ensure that we build structure for fan consent and support so that club be do thing properly particularly when it come to move stadium and ground that will be really important thing for we to work on to ensure that when the legislation be implement it be do in such way that people can not circumvent and dodge its intention as so often happen with such legislation in support the bill want to touch on the important community impact that many member have highlight at the core of this second read debate be the principle behind the bill and the importance of what it seek to achieve my near club west bromwich albion do fantastic community work through the albion foundation it be pleasure to meet its representative only few week ago and to see that the legend that be blind dave heeley receive an award at the efl awards dave have raise million on his own for the albion foundation to support vulnerable people in our community to get into sport be proud to support the albion foundation six town strategy in sandwell to reach out to community that often be disconnect and ensure that they benefit from the positive of football without that important financial stability which the bill try to ensure through its regulatory structure and regime organisation like the albion foundation would not be able to do their work want to touch on the issue of west bromwich albion to be quite frank the previous owner use the club as piggybank borrow money from the club to take it elsewhere that be not on it be an example of someone who do not love their football club and have no understanding of the emotional attachment that community such as mine have to it the bill transparency provision try to stop that we must also ensure that the corporate structure surround that work too we can not have shady or opaque ownership structure such as what we see with west bromwich albion be glad to say no more which enable situation like that to occur pay tribute to the fantastic action for albion group which do amazing work to highlight the club issue and fight tooth and nail for the club down to its work we be able to save the club and ensure its future longevity no politician can take credit for the work of action for albion it be truly community lead campaign to safeguard our club be conscious of the time have remain and do not want to be too repetitive have few ask of the minister which be sure he will really appreciate we talk of the pyramid model which like to refer to as aspirational can he ensure that as we build out some of the requirement club far up the pyramid will not have in build advantage over club far down particularly give some of the disclosure and paperwork requirement the club high up can afford savvy lawyer who can try to get around those requirement but the club far down can not necessarily do that particularly if they be have meteoric rise up through the league as some have in recent year we need to ensure that there be no disparity appreciate that financial provision be in place for that but we need to ensure that the requirement be not too onerous highlight to the minister the need to ensure that consultation be meaningful not just for the sake of it and that the relevant structure be build in support this bill it be the right thing it be what community like mine in the black country football be at the heart of who they be have be call for it be now imperative that as we build out the bill we get it right operationally commend the minister for his work on it the measure be necessary but woefully insufficient the regulator be vitally necessary but the idea that the danger be over regulation be wholly misconceive the danger be that the regulator will not have the power or the ambition to take on board even the excellent proposal bring forward in the fan lead inquiry lead by the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch many time during the early part of the debate it be say that football be business but to paraphrase bill shankly it be much more important than that be sit in the house of commons celtic supporter club surprisingly large and august institution in this place when the club then chairman repeatedly refer to we as customer point out at the end of the meeting with all respect sir we be not customer customer shop around if they do not like what be on your shelf they will go across the road and try someone else we be here because our father be here and our son and now thank god our daughter will be here for the very same reason speaker after speaker have adumbrate the local case of their football club and the centrality of those club to their community recently rochdale football club which sadly be now in the national league run into real danger of hit the wall commend the hon gentleman on the point he be put forward the consensus of opinion in this chamber seem to be that every mp support their club and their fan and want to see difference do the hon gentleman agree that the bill that will have its second reading today will be to the benefit of all the club the fan and their mp do he also agree that northern ireland should also have some of the improvement and guideline that be in the bill so that we in northern ireland can have the same guideline and the same way forward if the hon gentleman will forgive as supporter of united ireland will not follow he down that path look forward to he thrive in an irish football environment and ask the taoiseach for the necessary support rather than mr deputy speaker want to make point about the gall of the premier league lobby we yesterday say that all these matter should be leave to the free market what kind of free market be it when at least three premiership team be own by foreign country some be more thinly veil than other but there be three foreign country in the premier league right now and what country they be not country that would be allow to buy the daily telegraph but they be allow to buy top blue chip football club in england what be local about that why would we allow foreign state to buy piece of our national treasure that be also of extraordinary importance to local community be just talk about the funereal atmosphere there be when it look like rochdale afc have fall out of the league into the national league might go out of business altogether hopefully that problem have be at least partially resolve remember many great match between the wonderful team of rochdale and gillingham in the low league in gillingham be play manchester city in the wembley play off for the second division and now manchester city be in the premiership the hon gentleman point be absolutely right the success of football club should not be down to the investment of foreign country it should be about regulated investment in small club such as gillingham and rochdale enable they to go up rather than rely on the investment of international sovereign wealth fund in our football league he be absolutely right that the premier league have role and responsibility to support small club be grateful to the hon gentleman who have make very important point as member can imagine we in the workers party want to save football for the worker for the work class who give it birth and be its mainstay for many many decade for century before the premiership even exist and who be now price out of the game it now cost to attend premiership match for man and wife go it cost woman and her son with burger and cup of bovril throw in be spend to go to football match all to fund the fantastic profit that be be make in the premiership declare an interest have three son in youth football all of whom think have the capacity to make it will be their agent so that be future pecuniary interest my son be play not on plastic pitch which be disparagingly refer to early but on grass that have not be cut all year with hump and bump and hill and hollow by definition pyramid have very very large bottom and that bottom be where we need to filter the money not to agent not to premiership player on half million pound week be not make that number up some player get half million pound week for play look at manchester united at the weekend not very well or even very energetically at all football be in terrible state the workers party have policy do not have time to discuss it but commend it to the house our policy on football be this we believe not in fan have golden share though that would be big step forward but in fan ownership of football see some scoff and to those who scoff say that german football be fan own the great bayern munich the next champion of europe who have win the championship of europe time think be supporter own borussia dortmund another power in germany be fan own would not that solution end the problem of foreign state or these rum foreigner buy our top club johnny foreigner have be mention several time they live outside our border can not be reach by sanction and walk away from fine would not this solve that problem of course we also have our own rum owner from our own land who own football club and run they into the ground if the fan own the team would not that be well solution someone say that parliament should not be regulate whether there be replay on wednesday why not if it be the people game and we be the people representative we be absolutely entitle to have view on the cheating of low division supporter of the chance to take big premiership club to lucrative replay we have every right to be outrage by that if the football association be listen to this debate we should tell it that it will be force to reinstate replay if not now then soon my final point concern the two team with which be most closely associate glasgow celtic in scotland and manchester united in england manchester united have foreign owner who have loot the club of billion of pound they do not even buy the club they buy it then borrow against the club asset to cover the money that they pay to buy it and they have pay themselves king ransom in dividend the glazers must go that be the feeling of of manchester united supporter but how can we make they go well we get rid of celtic board be one of the proud member of the sack the board campaign and my good friend brian dempsey lead it we sack the board by popular pressure and popular pressure will have to be maintain on the robber baron from new york the glazers before they destroy manchester united altogether it be huge privilege to speak on the long await football governance bill not only be this matter of great importance to sport fan across the uk and beyond it be also personal passion and commend everybody that have be involve in get the bill this far locally in berkshire we have proud football pedigree read fc be the only league club in berkshire it have proud history and have do brilliantly this season to survive in league one against all the odd in my constituency bracknell town and sandhurst town have also enjoy strong season and across the border in hampshire aldershot town be back on the map after their most exciting season for year well do to tommy widdrington and his player be at the dagenham game on saturday which be brilliant it be pity that dagenham do not quite make the national league play off but next season will be even well as the father of two young son who play to decent level know that well regulation of the game be essential to their future and to the future of all our club this be the beautiful game and it do need well regulation to ensure that football always come home we know what the bill do it seek to establish an independent football regulator and include provision that seek to protect and promote the sustainability of english football for the benefit of fan and local community that be very important but say to the minister that regulation must be light touch give the pre eminence of football in the uk we must not throw the baby out with the bathwater by inadvertently make the premier league the english football league or the national league less attractive to owner potential investor the medium or the fan as we know the premier league be also the world lead football brand and be worth billion to the uk if it ai break please do fix it regulation then must be just enough it must be balance to protect club and fan from rogue owner but without jeopardise the game recent history be litter with example where it have go badly wrong southend united wigan portsmouth bury colchester sheffield wednesday hull derby and several other but most recently and perhaps most spectacularly of all read for fan such as the last few year have be gall we have see freefall from the premier league point of deduction huge fine player not be pay bill not be settle and fan in despair and feel their pain let put this on the record personally commend every single read fan they have be magnificent and they have support the club through thick and thin should also mention the brilliant sell before we dai group which have be so instrumental in this regard do lobbying work absolutely yes and give credit to member as well my right hon friend the members for read west sir alok sharma and for ashford damian green my right hon and learn friend the member for north east hertfordshire sir oliver heald and in particular the hon member for reading east matt rodda with whom have work very closely in connection with read football club member have leant in in respect of reading and many other club pressure have be bring to bear on owner and cross party approach really do work politic be always at its good when mp work together as for the question of pilot for the new regulator can not think of well example than read the new regulator must cut his or her tooth on that particular club and the bill itself must have tooth because regulator without power be of no use whatsoever let say to the minister that look forward to see the term of reference for the initial incumbent the aim of the bill be to put fan back at the heart of the game it be about run club and put they back on their foot and about heritage and future direction as we have hear it be also about sustainability and about ensure that we lay the foundation for club as we go forward in english football it must apply across the whole pyramid and not just to the top five league it be right that new owner and director will face strong test to stop club fall into the wrong hand and will face the possibility of be remove and strike off from own football club if they be find to be unsuitable and much more but the devil will be in the detail as for read football club have learn several lesson this year first fan do matter and fan power do work fan have voice and they have use their voice this year and before in relation to read fc secondly read borough council decision to list the select car leasing stadium as an asset of community value under the localism act be masterstroke dai yongge be unable to sell the stadium and rightly so lastly give full credit to wokingham borough council for little deed for the bearwood park training centre if club can not legally sell its asset to another club that club live on once again these measure have effectively stop further asset strip by dai yongge and will lead to the successful future of read fc reading be now move in the right direction bill be be pay for march april and may new owner be believe to be interested in the club and we could yet survive thank everyone at read fc and all the fan for make this happen so what be not in the bill first punitive action for owner who fail the test say to the minister that they need not just to be ban from football but to be ban full stop they need to be ban from be director or ban by hmrc the bill do not address welfare provision for player what be club do to soften the blow for player who get reject or suffer mental health issue the bill affect the top five league only it need to affect national league south north and below because they be all worthy the woman game have be mention but feel strongly that the bill need to go far on the woman game in due course lastly the fa cup decision on replay be stop from round one be outrageous it be nothing less than cultural vandalism of the world great cup competition if the large club have to play replay with the huge resource they have get so what have no sympathy whatsoever have watch so many fa cup exploit over the year not least at sutton united and woking do not buy the fa logic these cup tie be the stuff of legend magic do exist in sport admittedly no government can regulate this but if fa official be watch urge they to rethink that appalling decision there be large point about fa cup replay those lucrative replay be once in lifetime opportunity but the fact that there be club that be rely on those lucrative replay demonstrate why we have problem with finance in the football pyramid although my hon friend say that the government can not regulate on the matter the bill give the secretary of state some amazing power to bring the fa cup into conversation do my hon friend agree that while it be not something that particularly favour it be something that can be do agree wholeheartedly anything that we can do in term of the regulation be worth pursue be at the aldershot west brom game early this year which be an incredible day out that could have be third round replay the money raise from such occasion be extraordinary while club can not depend upon that lifeline it be fantastic bonus when it happen certainly it help aldershot massively with its finance this year to conclude strongly support the bill commend the dcms the minister the author of the bill and my fantastic hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch the bill be long overdue but it be here now be also reassure that the conservative government have do this it will make huge difference to all club and fan let bring it on like many across this chamber thank those from across the political sphere those within the footballe community and those who lead the fan base review because their work be finally come to fruition with the second reading debate of the bill the referee in the shape of the independent football regulator will finally be on the pitch we be begin that journey it be particularly fitting that this take place on st george day as the english nation give the world the beautiful game that nation now need to put its house in order for the many and not the few to ensure that the pyramid effectively work for league across the beautiful english game as have be echo across the chamber by member of all political persuasion we be only in this space because the premier league and those who govern our beautiful game have not get their house in order that hand off the pitch and that laissez faire approach certainly have not work for our fan our club and importantly our community that have be mention in reference to bury fc one of our old football club in the country certainly in the north west of england where represent they be expel from the football league amid rise debt and financial problem there have be other notable and document example at club like bolton wanderers derby county and recently read football club these and other club we reckon there be around such club have number of common factor unfit owner greed asset selling poor governance and long stand alienation of the fan base there be total disregard for history identity emotion and community this laissez faire anything go approach the wild west of football must be bring to full stop to drive that the new independent football regulator must have tooth with strong rule to ensure that our great footballe club have fit and proper owner would certainly like to see more club own and control by their fanbase we have great example of that in my constituency include northwich and runcorn linnets who only this weekend see beat our rival widnes we want to see sustainable financial plan with fan at the heart and soul of those club to protect asset such as stadium and historical identity people have reference that it be certainly in the bill in regard to kit and badge those thing be vital be long stand manchester united fan so be familiar with problem of ownership the glazers who have already be reference buy the club on the never never they be one of the rich football club in the world they be now one of the most indebted and that really have affect our performance on the pitch which have be pretty woeful this year include in the fa cup semi final pay credit to coventry who play incredibly well while we play incredibly badly but the problem on the pitch come down to some problem with the ownership give up my manchester united season ticket long ago it be difficult decision to make because of the glazers echo the clarion call do so at the time with my protest scarf and all the rest of it that the glazer really must go perhaps we be on the start of that journey with some new ownership be cheshire and merseyside mp and quite number of my constituent be everton fan who have be aggrieve by recent point deduction some of those have be on financial issue the purchasing of stadium and certainly player but fairness be real bone of contention everton have be deduct point high number that have go to appeal and so forth yet they look at other club across britain such as the manchester cities and chelseas of this world by the way manchester city have have breach and see that those who have incredibly deep pocket finance by sovereign wealth fund seem to get away with it because they can afford the litigation of course manchester city be not the only one have reference chelsea and there be certainly other we have mention fit and proper ownership for our club how can it be right that sovereign wealth fund of foreign state with woeful human right record own great british english football club such as newcastle united it have be fairly well document that one such nation state have manage to execute more of its citizen than striker for newcastle united have put ball in the back of the net that be horrendous the hon member as he know be from the same part of the world as he be make some excellent point he touch on bury fc in my constituency be interested in fairness in football in the fa cup semi final at the weekend we see manchester united the winner as result of about mm in video call get million while coventry city get for all that we in the chamber talk about fairness in general way do he believe that that be fair share of the money in the circumstance clearly not and think that there be space for the regulator to intervene as have be reference the fa cup can be lifesaver for grassroot club the hon member for gillingham and rainham rehman chishti who be no long in his place mention gillingham and think that bristol rovers be also mention again the issue be financial sustainability the regulator should intervene to ensure that the fa make the right decision for all our club right across the pyramid like many member across the chamber think the bill be great for the football community and credit all those who have be involve it be very important that we have the fan at the heart of this there be some issue which hon member on both side of the house have mention to do with competition and the parachute payment which be distort the footballe community but overall very much welcome and support this bill it be pleasure to follow the hon member for weaver vale mike amesbury who touch on the important issue in this debate particularly appreciate the way he very gently touch on the cost of the kit and of the badge which think follow on from his campaign to make school uniform affordable that be such an important issue also appreciate how the hon member for rochdale george galloway capture that sense that football fan be not just customer who can go to one supermarket or another there be so much more about football it be not just about strong fan base the acquisition of the right player have good management and other thing that we would associate perhaps with corporation it be about the family the next generation that sense of community and wellbeing and people go to the stadium walk together in solidarity to see their club that be what football be about for so many community up and down the country when bolton fall into very difficult time recently and look not too far away when bury go into administration in it be traumatic experience for many football fan even those watch an oppose team bolton come very close to be in that position but since then we have regain our strength and improve our position at the moment we be third in league one we be in the play off and if peterborough and derby do the right thing and lose very badly with huge goal difference we might be in the automatic play off position my hon friend make sensible point which not many people will know bury and bolton be in essentially the same financial situation both have go into administration at the same time the regulator decide to expel bury from the efl and keep bolton in the league the suspicion be that with bolton be big club than bury the regulator do not want to get rid of they but poor little bury could be use as an example think that be an example of why regulation be need in this sphere share my hon friend concern the idea of one club of the status of bury tumble out of the english football league be pretty grim but to have two club do so would have be catastrophic for the efl welcome the fact that the government have listen to fan and club and bring forward this bill to secure the game future in england the game fractured governance model and the inequitable distribution of finance be increasingly put the future of the sport in england at risk in the come debate on the passage of this bill parliament have the opportunity to give the new independent football regulator the right power to ensure the game sustainability for the good of the football pyramid from the grassroot to the height of the premiership any attempt to weaken the ifr power or to make it passive and ineffective entity should be strongly resist particular concern bring to my attention by ian bridge of bolton wanderers supporters trust relate to part of the bill on financial distribution where question over parachute payment have not be rule out and to whether the bill in its current form can deliver on its objective of protect the financial sustainability of english football look forward to support this bill throughout all its stage think the debate have be incredibly constructive the bill may need little further refinement but welcome the work and effort of my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch and of the minister my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew first of all we be here today because football have fail to regulate itself over many year it be our job as parliamentarian to ensure that in the end we regulate on the behalf of football fan for now and for the future and for the community where our football club be base that be our job will just begin by thank those who have get we to this position the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch certainly the minister for stick with it and bring the bill before the house today and the efl the pfa the football supporters association and fair game for their advice even have conversation with the premier league but let we say that that conversation do not lead to as much agreement as other conversation have have with other football organisation this be not bill to destroy the premier league as some have try to present it include the premier league itself the premier league have be massively successful organisation it have bring unimaginable wealth into football and into this country the legislation be not here to destroy the premier league but to ensure that its great strength its financial resource can be use as basis on which to strengthen the whole of the football pyramid it be just pity that the premier league itself do not see it like that it do not see its responsibility to the wide football game but instead so often seem intent on narrowly focus its attention on support the handful of club that be within the premier league we just have to look at the other successful brand in english football the pyramid there be no other football pyramid like it in the world the championship have the fifth high attendance of any league in europe where else could you go on sunday afternoon to second tier relegation game and get fan not in the home end but in the away end sheffield wednesday do that at blackburn on sunday and win hasten to add give ourselves hope of salvation that be the strength there but the incredible power of the premier league resource be slowly begin to corrode and erode the basis of the whole football pyramid that be what we have to stop and what we have to act on in very simple figure club not just the club in the premier league but the other five that be in and out of it on regular basis get of the distribute resource within football the other club in the efl get that simply be not sustainable and we have see that gap grow and grow over the year it be not just static problem it be an increase problem that undermine the whole of the football pyramid do the bill as it stand deal with that fundamental challenge the process for review of football finance be far too bureaucratic why not give the regulator the up front power to come to decision about the distribution of football resource that make individual club sustainable and competition within and between the league sustainable that be simple remit let they get on with it rather than go through this process right the way through to backstop know that the league have already have chance to reach an agreement which they have signally fail to do the premier league never make single offer right through the process from the very beginning with the parachute payment exclude from the backstop the minister risk destroy his own bill if the bill remain as it stand we will not achieve sensible and appropriate redistribution of revenue think that have be say right across the house and we simply have to change it be happy to table an amendment in committee hope the minister might think about how the government might accept such an amendment because it will be need to strengthen the bill be the distribution of resource simply matter for the efl and the premier league or do the fan player and grassroot not have view should there not be wide process at least consultation so that the regulator have the up front power and also consult those group in reach final conclusion it be just strange that something that begin with fan lead review do not mention fan in that very important part welcome the general approach of the licensing system as have be point out we have have too many bad owner and director in football and we still have some around be very interested in what the hon gentleman say there be some very important point regard redistribution but there be also very important point about the competent management of football club the derby county situation be an example because the owner have million in clear fund when the club be buy what happen to derby be result of how badly it be manage after the initial test that be real challenge for this bill my understanding be that it will be test of the licensing system it be about ensure sustainability and not just when an owner come along and say they want to buy club they need to show that they can actually sustain that ownership go forward that be the difference between the current rule and the rule that be be propose which we can test far in committee can the regulator really regulate sovereign wealth fund that own club have ask the minister about that before and it be something else that we have to look at because it be challenge to the system welcome the fact that fan will have veto over their club change its colour or name but there be nothing in the bill that say that fan have to be consult about change of ground the regulator have to approve it but there be no right for fan to be consult we need to have look at that come back to my own club sheffield wednesday have mention they once and will mention they again they welcome the proposal and the efl approach to the review and they recognise the need for change in the distribution of resource be not sure that the owner will be that enthusiastic about the change to require he to consult the fan properly many owner be like that they want to go through the motion be they really go to engage in meaningful way that will be real challenge for the regulator at number of club understand why the form of consultation be not specify but it will still be challenge go forward and we need to keep an eye on it finally come back to the fa cup the minister say it be not our job to get involve in football competition but the fan lead review be trigger by some club want to change the competition they play in by go to the european super league that involve handful of rich club decide that they could be well off there we now have handful of rich club decide that european game be more important than fa cup replay that be what be happen when arsenal win the fa cup in they have five replay four of which be against sheffield wednesday in one round remember it all these year later because it be great achievement three of those replay be at the old filbert street ground we remember those thing as football fan and we should not take they away from the game say to the minister that one of the requirement of the regulator be to ensure that the heritage of english football be safeguard will the regulator have the power to do that under the bill rule and be the fa cup and its replay not part of the heritage it be great pleasure to follow the hon member for sheffield south east mr betts who have do much work on this issue and to follow the wonderful speech early from my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch who have do such fantastic work on the important fan lead review it build on work do over many year by member and committees of this house when be new mp take part in the football governance review undertake by the culture media and sport committee which be chair by my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale and this issue have be recur theme of interest for the house the reason be that when club get into distress it become evident very quickly that the competition primary interest be protect the competition not individual club when club go into administration it can be too late to solve the problem the action of the league be to protect the integrity of the competition and to complete the season rather than to save the individual club because the league be effectively govern by the collective view of the chair of those club they be often not very sympathetic when one of their own get into trouble particularly if they think the club have get into financial trouble because they have be overspend or as the league would see it cheat in some way as we see with bolton and bury bury fail financially and be expel from the league and bolton very nearly be and as we have see with club like derby have there be an intervention and have it be make clear that the club be already play and trade in breach of league rule as they stand the situation could have be avoid there could have be an early intervention rather than wait until the last minute when nothing more could be do it be in response to those concern that the fan lead review be trigger and this bill have come forward today we have see numerous case of bad ownership massimo cellino acquire leeds united few year ago and the football league do not think he be fit and proper person which demonstrate that there be no fit and proper person test if person be qualified to be company director in the uk they have as much right to be director of football club as any other entity and he defeat the football league in the court we desperately need test in which somebody could stand up and say we be not convince by this person track record they can not own the club coventry city be own by an investment fund at one point and nobody know who the investor be leeds united be own by somebody we do not know and sheffield wednesday be almost buy by somebody who do not exist it be the wild west and the bill seek to address this by have regulator that be require to license club and have the power to say to potential owner as ofcom do to broadcaster when it be not happy with how they execute their licence we be not convinced that you have meet the test so you can be the owner of this club or you must demonstrate and prove who you be if you be invest in this club and we must have robust business plan that demonstrate that you can run the club sustainably meet its requirement for this season and future season that do not require the regulator to invent new rule for football it simply require an independent body to enforce the competition rule that already exist if we have that transparency and that ability to tackle rogue owner many of the game problem would be resolve do not believe that this form of effective regulation will deter people from invest in english football if anything it will encourage they if someone be look to buy club in the championship or league one with the hope of invest in that club and get it into the premier league have proper governance and enforcement of the rule will attract well owner into english football which will be good for everyone seek the minister advice on few specific point as say to the secretary of state the bill structure be very interesting the primary purpose of the regulator be to ensure sustainability alongside which it have three objective to consider soundness resilience and heritage in make determination the regulator should always act in way that be sustainable and that support at least one of the three objective this raise question where say club do not own its own ground the ground might be own by private third party entity that be seek to push up the rent by an extortionate amount that the club can not afford to pay so it have to move to new ground the fan might be against the move and the heritage test might say that the club should not move but the soundness and resilience test would say that no the club should move the secretary of state say early that the regulator could set aside heritage concern and make that decision the regulator need to establish some guideline and principle that it will follow in make such decision so that there be proper consideration and so that it do not always defer to the financial case but consider the other point in the round it be important that the test for director be subjective and that the regulator can say when it be not satisfied rather than the test simply be tick box exercise in which people may own club if they can demonstrate that they do not have live conviction for particular offence the regulator should have robust power to say no the licensing condition say that club have to produce corporate governance report and the companies act set out the sort of criterion that company have to include in its report and the bill explanatory note say that corporate governance report should cover the nature constitution or function of different part organ of the club the manner in which those part conduct themselves the requirement impose upon they and the relationship between they that would exclude the player and any relationship responsibility or obligation that the club have to they agree with ministers that the regulator should not be write welfare standard and policy for football but it could act as guardian in make sure they be be properly enforce it could use its investigatory power if it feel that there be ground to investigate to make sure that welfare standard be be properly maintain this be important because where this idea have fail in football and other sport in the past it have be because of the power structure within sporting organisation whereby the coach and team doctor often have huge influence over the athlete and it be difficult for people to know where they can safely blow the whistle backstop guardian through the regulator on welfare standard would be totally consistent with the requirement on the club to produce corporate governance statement to the regulator every year urge the minister to consider that rise order so as to accommodate everybody be go to have to reduce the time limit after the next speaker to six minute call charlotte nichols it be pleasure to speak in this debate although warrington be know primarily as rugby league town we also have many thousand of football fan those of our nearby premier league club everton liverpool manchester city and manchester united those of our fantastic non league club warrington rylands and warrington town and those involve in our vibrant and diverse grassroot amateur and sunday league scene across the board there be deep concern that the beautiful game be become ever more distant from the community it should be root in and that decision making be make in the vested interest of the big club with the most resource and be not about fairness and strengthen the sport right through the football pyramid there be the obvious indicator of that extortionate price of season ticket and replica kit and lack of rigour in fit and proper person test for director and owner even before this weekend controversy have hear from many constituent about how the use of var be kill the game that the decision to abolish replay after the first round of the fa cup will mean few moment of magic like those we see at marine afc versus tottenham will make it less financially viable for small club to participate and risk undermine the fa cup reputation as the most egalitarian competition in world football that there be concern lack of transparency about point deduction decision something that have receive much correspondence on from everton fan in my constituency but which have also affect number of other club in recent year and of course about the disaster that be the propose european super league in whose interest be those decision be make it be certainly not those of the fan therefore welcome the establishment of the independent football regulator although there be some area think it can be strengthen through which will address first want to see regulatory structure that not only act in the interest of supporter and protect their club but acknowledge and prioritise the role of player and staff at the club when we think about footballer and their working practice it be easy to think about some of the huge salary and transfer fee in the premier league but most player be not on anything like that kind of money and can be in very precarious and short live employment career end injury that take place on the pitch or illness that leave they unable to compete can leave they cut completely adrift and in many case without some of the skill and qualification they need to find alternative employment easily because they invest everything into footballing future that do not pan out just as football be nothing without its fan it be nothing without its player either the professional footballers association have point out that nowhere in the bill as draft be there any reference to player and that that be significant and serious omission as they be the primary employee of the industry there be potential direct impact on they from decision take by the ifr with no mechanism for consultation with they there be no mention in the ifr regulatory principle of the need for the ifr decision making to recognise exist and successful mechanism that have be develop to encourage co operation between stakeholder include the professional football negotiating and consultative committee crucial backstop that have be effective in ensure that substantive change to player contract and condition can not be make unilaterally that be straightforward thing to fix and do so would strengthen the bill and ensure that there be no unintended consequence of its implementation the bill should acknowledge the existence and validity of these non ifr mechanism within the new regulatory ecosystem and formalise the responsibility of the ifr to work in way that recognise they secondly and vitally the bill currently give the ifr only partial oversight of financial sustainability with no authority or oversight of profit and sustainability rule the ifr should therefore have full authority for financial sustainability include the oversight of profit and financial sustainability rule in line with the recommendation of the fan lead review this should include full authority in apply sanction publish guideline on how sanction will be apply guide principle that sanction do not unfairly impact fan but instead target club ownership leadership and management and full consideration and involvement of fan representation as part of any sanction process hopefully this would help to prevent the scene that we have see at everton this season which have cause real distress to many fan in my constituency and in the wide region and which have also mean that have not have moment peace since from my everton support family member as say in open my remark we be town that have much to be proud about with our football club something that the brilliant warrington football podcast do so much to highlight with more than just rugby town warrington town have just secure their high ever league finish in the club history in the national league north while fan be have to fundraise to make the costly improvement to meet onerous fa ground grade criterion to allow they to continue play at this level that do not feel right when we see how much money there be swirl around the game at club just few mile up the road the premier league domestic tv deal alone be worth over billion and it be shame that the recommendation of transfer levy from the fan lead review have not be take up the well redistribution of some of these fund throughout the rest of the football pyramid be crucial for the financial sustainability of the wide game warrington rylands have make it into the northern premier league play off this weekend after successful few year include lift the fa vase at wembley and have just launch their first deaf football team make the game ever more accessible to more player and fan and woman football in warrington be come on enormously there be plenty to be optimistic about for the future but we know that we need regulatory framework for the game that put more power and resource into the hand of supporter and club see fairer distribution of wealth across the game and increase sustainability transparency and accountability to get there hope that the government will commit to constructive cross party engagement as the bill make its way through the house and on to the statute book declare an interest as norwich city supporter and king lynn town fc fan as have be mention it be fitting that on st george day we be talk about our national game which be love by million of people in our country as we have hear the premier league be also the most watch league in the world and last year the efl have the high attendance for more than year with over million supporter pass through turnstile so football be great success story it be in that context that we consider the bill and the proposal to create new regulatory structure for the game as the explanatory note set out football be previously not regulate by statutory provision and the measure be unique and unprecedented my first point be the one that make year ago when the government publish their response we need to ensure that this be truly proportionate regime and be mindful of the success of the game that mean have light touch regulator which ministers have commit themselves to the government response set out that the regulator would operate an advocacy first approach to regulation mean that it would use constructive engagement rather than formal intervention wherever possible however that could be well reflect on the face of the bill in the objective and duty of the new regulator otherwise the risk of mission creep be more likely to materialise we have hear number of contribution already this afternoon in which the regulator be be actively encourage to expand its scope even before it have be set up support the objective of financial soundness and resilience as well as safeguard the heritage of football the ground the crest the shirt colour and the name of club be all part of its dna incidentally norwich city can boast the old song in world football on the ball city will not sing it football be competitive it be about promotion play off and passion so the regulator must also understand the essence of the game and not reduce it to dry technical analysis of profit and loss and impose banking style straitjacket on club as member of the regulatory reform group see the chairman my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland enter the chamber as speak welcome the principle set out in clause however they can certainly be strengthen to deliver that light touch regime that be so important the scale of the task that we will be ask the regulator to undertake will be considerable it will have to review detailed business plan of club and reach agreement on they in addition to the mandatory licence condition the regulator can impose discretionary requirement on any or all of those club such requirement would have to be bespoke and they would then have to be monitor clearly that come at cost which have not really be discuss in the debate so far the impact assessment estimate that the new regime could cost million over year admittedly there be lot of uncertainty because we do not know precisely what condition the regulator will put in place that be money spend by club on football that in future will be spend on the cost of regulation the national league be not the only one that have warn about the risk of the burden on small club on licensing the regulator must avoid duplicate exist requirement and ensure that it adopt proportionate approach to the levy clearly key driver of the legislation be money and how revenue be distribute through the pyramid that be so essential to the health of the game this have be agree on voluntary basis to date and it would be well if football come forward with its own solution however if that do not happen there be part of the bill which set out the backstop mechanism either the premier league or the efl can trigger it and if mediation do not work committee of expert draw from the regulator panel will consider final proposal from both have to confess to find the decision process curious at that point as rather than look at each proposal and then adjudicate and determine what be the good overall approach which could be between the two proposal put forward the regulator can only opt for one of they in any negotiation if both side feel bit disappointed with the deal reach it be likely to be fair in this scenario however only one side will win so ask the minister why create an expert panel and regulator if they be not able to apply their own judgment give the importance of that provision hope the minister will outline the government thinking what consideration have be give to how that could be game and will he look again at those provision as the bill go forward on revenue will briefly focus on parachute payment which be important element in enable club promote to invest and yes to take calculated risk so that they can compete if parachute payment be remove club like norwich city that be run sustainably and can get promote be optimistic for the play off this year would not have the confidence to invest know that if they go down this path and get relegate there would be no smoothing of their income therefore support the approach in clause finally return to where we begin with the fan lead review during covid club be not able to let fan in and king lynn town and other have to take sport survival million of they be issue and their repayment threaten the viability of some club as we look at financial resilience encourage the minister to consider allow club to convert say up to of the loan they have take out and give they to supporter trust as share that would create legacy of community ownership which would be very worthwhile and would reduce the burden on club to conclude football be an important part of our national character and as the bill proceed it be essential that the regulator work with the game the club and the league to ensure that football continue to flourish start by place on record my congratulation on the success of my local club stockport county football club in its elevation to league one on top of that it have top the table in league two use this opportunity shamelessly one might argue to encourage member on both side of the house to sign my early day motion celebrate the success of stockport county football club in recent month this be the first efl title that stockport county have win since and it be an important occasion for as the mp who represent the club in the house of commons before go into the main point of my speech join other member on both side in thank the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch for the work she have do as well as the member of the select committee and the minister who have return to his place have do some work with he on grassroots cricket and know he take time to engage with opposition mp and mps from his own party he have long stand record of work hard on this issue so want to place those word on the record premier league team need to pay fair share of the revenue to ensure that all fan can continue to enjoy the sport of football club like stockport county football club in my constituency make valuable contribution to the life of supporter and countless other in the local community however as many have highlight the game fractured governance model and the inequitable distribution of finance be increasingly put that risk stockport county football club and many other club be an important part of england and britain sporting culture and we must do lot more to ensure that the model be sustainable currently english football be nowhere near meet its objective with efl club lose million during the season with the shortfall have to be meet by club owner those be serious number football have fail to take the collective action need to protect club due to the number of vested interest in its governance model that have be echo by representative across the house the english football league want local club to prosper as beacon of community pride in town and city throughout the country know that many fan of all football team and other sporting team take lot of pride in and cherish the history and culture of their local team be glad that the english football league welcome the bill and this parliamentary scrutiny and discussion this be good opportunity to reform the football pyramid lot of mp have make point about that so will not repeat they labour have long support football reform our last three manifesto commit to review football governance give fan great say in the way their club be run and call for the premier league to redistribute more of its television right revenue to the wide game labour also support the implementation of an independent regulator and we urgently need to bring in new law to prevent further club from go bust or be use as plaything for the wealthy sadly since more than club have go into administration although the bill be welcome it be likely to be too little too late for several club that have to witness their structure collapse with fan leave disappointed and angry the fan lead review be publish in why have it take the government so long finally to act labour welcome the bill but several issue need to be address and be critical of the time it have take the government to come forward rise order make no criticism of the fact that member be use the time make available to they but we will have to reduce the time limit again be afraid after the next speaker it will go down to five minute may add to the many thank already offer to the minister and my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch for the considerable work that have go into this issue many other have rightly be mention but time do not allow to say anything more stand in support of the bill despite as my hon friend the member for cleethorpes martin vickers say have come to it with degree of reluctance say that because stand for the love of the game this have be fascinating debate but in one sense it have be characterise by the many different perspective that people have offer and with the great respect they have all be partial perspective no one person have hold complete and perfect view of football in this country or the impact of this regulation and that be vital those listen who may be question our right as mps to be talk about the game they love should be reassure that we be just like they this be game that we love too be terrible fan and make no claim to stand here as fan have never hold season ticket in my life but do stand here as player from my early day at bangor juniors many of my school friend will remember play then through to play in the suffolk league in sporting football club join it when there be about of we fella from across east anglia kick ball around and leave it when there be more than member many of they youth player and we have win couple of suffolk fair play award now play my colleague might say that be loose description of the word on friday afternoon for the dyffryn conwy amateurs in llanrwst that be different kind of club it start for people just to have fun kick ball around to work through some of the thing that we pick up during the week such as issue of mental wellbeing and for build friendship in the community have be very appreciative of that support in particular the work of ian in set up the club it would be remiss of not to mention that chair the all party football club group and know that hon member be sit here wonder how we get on today against the lobby well suffice it to say that at half time it be it be closely fight game play well but think run out of finger towards the end congratulation to the lobby on that one we will be back again next time to even the score the aim of this bill be worthy and put the fan voice at the heart of football be vital grow up in bangor in see the club fall from the heady height of when it play in the cup winner cup against atletico madrid to see its farrar road ground turn into an asda supermarket through mismanagement and many other episode bangor city supporters association form breakaway club in what it state at the time capture the essence of the bill it say we want fan to reconnect with each other and restore the pride and feeling of be supporter of our historic club the new club be creative and positive solution for an ever change and precarious situation we be not disown bangor city fc or its history the club be ours it belong to the fan and local community owner will come and go but the people remain keep the faith there be much in there and much more history than know have be away from the area for many year so be not familiar with all the step in that journey but it speak to the concern that people have feel and that constituent have write to about stress that those be constituent of the hon member for arfon hywel williams but that be my home and they have write and speak of those concern importantly this bill recognise that community tie sustainability and ethical governance be right at the heart of thing and be essential would argue that those thing resonate with the very conservative value of heritage community and sustainability have describe rather unfortunate episode in the history of bangor city can contrast that with the lesson have learn from watch llandudno football club the seasiders where the work of doz and her family over the year have make sure that the club be viable rod dave guinn and other on the board at present be seek to take the club forward this bill make the point again as my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford say that structure be important we have to put in place these structure so that the money can flow argue that the bill send signal that the era of opaque and unchecked ownership be over football be no long just plaything for those who see it only as an investment class it be important that the backstop be in place it be essential that the potential to fine club be retain so that the regulator have some tooth question the scalability and applicability that be mention in the bill feel chill when hear some speak with an ambition to interfere with matter of football and apply preferred political agenda or even create game in which everyone win prize that be not the sport know or love urge the minister to give time at late stage to clarify some of the point be make and to make sure that while the bill will deal with bad actor and bad management it will not remove element of bad luck first welcome the bill as other have encapsulate our football club in this country be unique they be institution at the heart of their community with long long history that far outlast whoever might be the chairman the manager or the player in any period of time that be why this regulator be overdue and very much welcome the work do to get we to this stage the regulator have an unenviable job the number of thing that people want to see address in football be huge be sure there will be all kind of call for the regulator to take action on thing that fall outside its remit the secretary of state be at pain to clarify the regulator limited role around football it be not about new organisation run football it be about ensure that football be sustainable in the future as my colleague have say this legislation have be introduce because football have be unable to break the logjam itself it will be important for some of the remain uncertainty in the bill to be work out in committee football be business generally privately own one but it be also an institution as we have hear from many speaker one of the main reason for that be that the fan remain however it be also different kind of institution because of the reward available to those who be successful and the appalling failure that happen when gamble go wrong many of we remember the aston villa versus derby county play off final it be widely believe that whoever lose that game would end up go bust derby county as we know go into administration and be now in league one while aston villa be fourth in the premier league with untold rich for the sake of minute those be the difference on the line that day we can not have situation where one person gamble lead to that kind of success and another person gamble lead to the club almost cease to exist we need the regulator to balance an individual businessperson have go and the endangering of the cultural institution that be football club so that it be do not mean disaster if those have go fail the success of the premier league have be speak about many time my hon friend the member for sheffield south east mr betts be right to say that the championship be the fifth big division in europe in addition league one be the tenth most watch league anywhere in europe right down the pyramid this country have thing of unique strength my club chesterfield which be in the fifth tier attract fan on saturday its history be informative darren brown almost bankrupt the club and end up in jail because of the way he conduct himself as the head of chesterfield the fan have to step forward and save the club back in then we have dave allen as chairman he get the new ground build and get the club to the edge of league one but find that with every further league the club go into the loss grow it be unique business in that loss grow as the club move from league two to league one and from league one to the championship so there be perverse incentive until the club reach the promise land of the premier league the loss grow all the time look at some of the loss that championship club be experience it be just appalling dave allen lose interest and the club be on the verge of bankruptcy again the chesterfield fc community trust step forward and the passion commitment and professionalism that the trust board member have introduce get chesterfield back into the football league now with the help of the kirk brother local fan who have their heart in the club the club be look much bright the truth be that almost all our premier league club be own not by people with that kind of history and passion for the club but by foreign own institution and foreign government who do not have the same understanding of and commitment to what football be about welcome the fact that the government have introduce the bill which enjoy cross party support now we need to ensure that it work congratulate the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew and pay tribute to my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch for her tremendous work in this area football be vital part of our community bring people together in support of their much love club since darlington have be home to darlington football club know as the quakers or simply darlo it be the team that arthur wharton the world first black professional footballer play for declare my interest as an individual shareholder of that fan own club as fan own club darlington profit be reinveste back into the club follow the financial collapse of the club some year ago it be build back and have ambitious plan to secure its own ground to far sustain its financial future an ambition that be proud to support club with close link to the community have the potential to develop deep long term partnership community own club offer great protection and transparency within their constitution which appeal to partner funder and sponsor give people the chance to have stake in their club can increase their connection with it people can share the responsibility of sustain their club unlock more volunteer and participation if supporter know that the money they spend will be reinveste in the club they be more likely to spend and donate more welcome that in the face of the gap get big the bill seek to overhaul the football finance system to protect and promote the sustainability of english football for fan and community like those in darlington want to put on the record my thank to david johnston at darlington football club for his engagement on the bill in recent week the bill put fan back at the heart of the game with no fan there be no game sadly darlington football club have suffer in the past and its future have hang in the balance cause uncertainty for the club and the community at large that be why applaud the strong test in the bill for prospective owner finding from the report by fair game show the disparity in the distribution of tv income for every in the broadcast deal premier league club get whereas darlington fc as national league north club get merely that be simply not right and focus on protect the big wealthy club as oppose to the small one that be so integral to their community must recognise the wonderful work of the darlington fc foundation which do so much good in my constituency take this opportunity to thank the government for their support of sport more generally in the community darlington have receive over for new pitch run track and change pavilion at eastbourne sport complex firthmoor community centre receive over for its multi use game area and there have be much need investment in football across darlington all that help inspire people and ensure that child can stay fit and healthy yet again it be an example of the government invest in football in our community for people of all age and ability finally the bill recognise that major change must occur to keep our grassroots sport alive welcome the bill which be much need for our fantastic football club to ensure that fan be put first and our club can not only survive but thrive for those who have oppose the bill particularly the premier league it be worth point out few fact that the english football league have provide in the four year that the deal between the premier league and the football league be negotiate wage in the premier league have go up by million from billion to billion in premier league club spend billion on player transfer and in the premier league spend million on agent fee anyone who say that the bill will damage the viability of the premier league need to look at those figure we must remind ourselves of why we be here as everyone have rightly pay tribute to the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch but the argument from the fan go back many year know that because write labour manifesto on football back in and we speak powerfully about the need for fan to have say fan be of the community where the club be situate they have sustain those club through generation and they be an early warning system when there be problem in those club one of my criticism of the bill be that it do not say enough about consult and empower fan it could go far in those area the legislation on the regulator be defective in two way it do not give the regulator step in right to settle deal between the various organisation in the football pyramid more importantly the regulator be not empower to deal with the issue of parachute payment we be tell that that issue be go to be deal with through the licensing system would like to know how that be go to work because that be about individual club the impact of club have parachute payment be that other club be entice to try to compete with they financially be we go to say to club that be receive parachute payment under the licensing scheme you can spend that money that just do not make sense so how will we be able to deal with this inequality of arm for club with parachute payment under the licensing system we be also tell that through the licensing system club that be overspend and perhaps overstretch themselves will be deal with by the regulator that seem to put the disparity in wealth and resource into legislation actually to legislate to keep those club in abeyance way behind the club that receive parachute payment we know that parachute payment be the drive force behind many of the problem that exist in the financial arrangement of many club in the football league that have lead to difficulty so how can we possibly have regulator to deal with the issue of football finance that do not have the right to step in and deal with parachute payment that have to change it can not be accept on the issue of asset charlton athletic do not own their ground and they do not own their training ground the training ground be in my constituency it be metropolitan open land the former owner have keep the right to and ownership of the stadium and the training ground can only assume that he have do so out of spite or perhaps he think there be go to be payday down the road where he can develop those asset as say the training ground in my constituency be metropolitan open land he will develop that over my dead body perhaps he be go to arrange that do not know but the stadium will not be give planning permission for development by the local authority in any case so think the former owner need to think again he should deal with charlton even handedly and hand over the right to that ground lastly as other member have say there be the issue of sovereign wealth fund own football club the regulator must be give power to get to grip with that because the current situation be unacceptable support the bill and hope will get on the bill committee this be unique regulatory bill in that it regulate the preservation of football club in my view it be regulation to save something rather than regulation regard competition it be illogical to suggest that anything could level the competition between bury football club and manchester city in term of their asset or in term of anything else when bury fc be reject from the efl at the heart of the matter be the serious concern that jonathan taylor kc raise in his review the owner and director role that be be enforce by the football league especially in relation to league one and two in that report he say that there be no doubt that the efl apply the oad owner and director test properly in relation to mr day and mr dale the two owner of bury football club the question be whether the test as currently write be fit for purpose in particular it only look at narrow list of objective criterion and do not take into account various other factor that speak to whether new owner or director be fit and proper person to own run member club when mr dale buy the club for the fact that he have numerous previous fail business be not take into account the owner and director test do not require that mr dale provide proof of fund proof that he be able to sustainably run the football club prior to purchase that be utterly ludicrous and something that have to change so hope the minister will touch on how the bill will ensure that the regulation and the fit and proper person test be robust enough to keep people such as steve dale out of the ownership of club find myself ask time and again how regulator will be able to intervene in the running of football club unless they have huge amount of support staff accept fully that business plan be put in place but business plan can change the situation at bury be virtually criminal on the car park at gigg lane which be build in the previous owner sell car parking space in ponzi scheme some of they to poor bury fan these be essentially sell as financial product that people would get return from he be sell these thing to people around the world and when the money run out the whole thing go boom nobody do anything about that that be unique situation but would the regulator have the power the understanding and the knowledge to be able to intervene in act of complete criminality such as that hope that it will and would very much welcome the minister response to that speak of my experience of bury football club be at ramsbottom united on saturday and people be there it be north west counties premier league match between ramsbottom and bury bury bring the good part of people with they give ramsbottom united of their total annual income when we look at what it be about club that matter the history the heritage and everything else that we have talk about we have to get to the heart of how club be run after somebody get through the fit and proper person test after the first business plan fail and after the ambition come in how be the regulator go to be able to control that unless they have massive amount of staff in my view football club throughout the pyramid system be incredibly badly run most of they be subsidise by multimillionaire and in any other way shape or form they would not be business they would be insolvent they exist off largesse we have see some really great example of club come through the football pyramid that be completely and utterly reliant on one person million if that one person million disappear there be no football club how do we regulate that in way that allow for sustainability bury be badly run it be badly let down by the efl think and hope that if this legislation have be in place when the club be expel from the league in it would have put the club in well place will put question mark after that and look forward to hear my right hon friend the minister comment first place on the record my thank to the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch who have always listen to supporter and will be sorely miss much of this legislation come from the effort of the fan lead review also pay tribute to the fsa to kev miles and to the minister who bear the scar of get we here today this legislation have come about because football supporter have lose trust and faith in the current custodian of the game to protect football for the people who really matter whose loyalty be often take for grant football supporter along with the working class community the game originate from be too often now an afterthought if indeed they be consider at all at the bottom of the pyramid there be shocking criminal lack of investment in the grassroots game which should be accessible to all this be something that the wonderful stalwart campaigner kenny saunders do so much to highlight via his save grassroots football campaign at the top of the pyramid club continue to price out working class supporter and the next generation of their own support this pose an existential threat to the very strand of the game that give english football its authenticity passion and worldwide popularity football must therefore be very careful not to kill off the golden goose that provide these rich the loyal supporter it be worry to see significant price rise again for next season at many club amid the cost of living crisis some lesson be not be learn and the club must take heed the premier league have do much good for the beautiful game with stadium now world away from those in the and early where in some case horrific tragedy take place english football be now see as world lead and the premier league community work be beyond reproach and actually world leading have work with the team at the premier league on the issue of tragedy chanting and would like to put on record my thank to richard masters and his team the lfc foundation the manchester united foundation my hon friend the member for weaver vale mike amesbury and joe blott represent the fsa however despite its perceive success the premier league be powerless to prevent the attempt european super league breakaway in april with six of the club come from its rank the action of those six club that attempt to end football as we know it and place the entire football pyramid in peril in their rush to form european super league show exactly why we need football regulator to protect the interest of all shamefully my own club liverpool be part of that but the collective fightback from supporter halt it in its track from the flame of that chaos liverpool fan then create what we hope be an exemplar model of fan engagement and influence to prevent club from make the same mistake again be delighted that element of this structure appear in the bill that be tribute to the action of spirit of shankly and the associate fan group and to the engagement of the uk base element of liverpool board fan engagement and influence must be in the heart of the bill because fan be the true custodian of the game not the rogue club owner who will destroy the fertile ground that nurture its root that be surely more of commercial threat than bill that seek as the premier league admit only to embed normal business practice within the game good footballe organisation should not fear regulation rather it should welcome it the bill currently give the independent football regulator only partial oversight of financial sustainability with no authority or oversight in respect of profit and sustainability rule football supporter be rightly demand transparent proportionate fair and timely system the chaos and confusion cause by the premier league handling of psr have prove that it have not meet these requirement many supporter include dave kelly of everton fan advisory board be now call for the football regulator to have full authority in relation to financial sustainability in line with the recommendation of the fan lead review they believe and share their view that trust matter the vast majority of this legislation will believe begin to restore that trust but it must go far worryingly give the importance of fan engagement it be notable that the word fan appear only time in the entire page bill the interest of supporter must be adequately factor into governance and strategic decision making at the high level of the game and the bill must reflect that would like to see independently elect fan representative on the regulator board the expert panel and the premier league board the expertise and experience of supporter must be hardwire into the decision making of the regulator and the premier league it be greatly miss and it need to be add to the bill in committee let we never forget what the great jock stein once say which have resonate through the chamber today football without fan be nothing welcome the bill and thank the whole ministerial team particularly the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my right hon friend the member for pudsey stuart andrew also thank my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch their commitment have be fantastic in respect of the fan lead review and all the other work that have be do would love to say more about that but time do not permit it occasionally people ask whether this job be stressful and my reply be always the same it be nowhere near as stressful as minute on the terrace at roots hall although southend united always give we thunder performance it be often not until the second half that they show their full skill and dominance of the game however the stress of be shrimper have be take to whole new level in the last two year which be why welcome the bill for too long football club like my own southend united have be leave at the mercy of unscrupulous owner who be either unwilling or unable to fulfil their obligation to the club and the fan for too long fan have suffer the making of vital decision on their heritage with little or no consultation for too long there have be no focus on sustainability and future planning which have leave many club just one season away from insolvency while would normally be completely against the regulation of successful industry like football in this case welcome the proposal for an independent regulator which be absolutely necessary to put fan back where they belong at the heart of english football to date have mention the plight of southend united no few than time in this place have it not be for the heroic action of those at the club the chief executive tom lawrence the manager kevin maher the player themselves who have somehow deliver week after week the fan who clean and repair the stadium so that we secure our health and safety certificate to start the season we could well have lose year of history against the instability of that background and the background of an outgoing owner who have be subject to wind up petition in year welcome the strengthen owner and director test particularly welcome clause and the fact that the bill remove any minimum number of bankruptcy event to disqualify future owner however instead of just punish poor owner hope that the regulator will have mechanism to reward the good owner who be make positive and tangible difference to their club and community southend united community and educational trust social value to the city of southend and south east essex community be measure at over million year it give back and encourage so if there be way for that to be reward that would be good improvement southend united have remarkable fanbase so of course welcome the detail in the bill about engage more with fan and hear their voice would also mention supporter trust almost every club will have fantastic supporter trust we have the shrimpers trust ably lead by paul fitzgerald and james schooley understand why supporter trust be not name specifically in the bill but it would be nice if there be way for such trust to be recognise because of all their hard work and the engagement they have have with the ministerial team to make the bill as good as it be hope the regulator will be give the power it require to mediate in all matter between the premier league the efl and the national league not just financial one of course refer to last week concern news regard the unscrupulous scrapping of fa cup replay everybody know the magic of the fa cup every single person hear those word will have memory for southend united the magic of the fa cup be well show in when spectator cram into roots hall to witness their hero take on european champion liverpool to put that into context more than of the entire city of southend be engage on that day that be why it be so important we preserve the replay appreciate the bill have its sceptic but say there be not moment to lose let get on with it let bring this bill home be very pleased to finally be able to speak in today historic debate new independent football regulator be an important development come as result of dysfunction in the game thank those who have work hard to improve how football function include the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch for produce the fan lead review the football supporters association and fair game thank luton town chief executive gary sweet for share his view on number of occasion and importantly thank member of luton town supporters trust and loyal luton who have always be willing to meet and tell their view because ultimately football be about the fan however the status quo be fail fan across the country while the premier league be arguably the most globally popular and commercially successful sporting competition more than club throughout the english league system have go bust since it be establish in the financial power at the top of the english game have distort competition and powered unsustainable business practice as club scramble to be one of the elite club at all cost we all agree that the future sustainability of the pyramid be heavily reliant on secure fair financial distribution deal between the premier league and the pyramid system not to mention prevent any potential re emergence of the european super league plan we also have multitude of example that demonstrate the owner and director test have not stop dubious owner buy club and run they into the ground we lutonians sadly know the ugly side of the beautiful game well than most back in in response to luton fan want to save their club the previous luton town chairman john gurney disgracefully say if they expect to walk away from luton with nothing make very sure there nothing to walk away from this be from person who have already recklessly suggest rename the club push for merger with milton keynes bind wimbledon fc and wait for it attach formula circuit to new seat stadium on stilt my personal favourite which do see the light of day be suggest select the club next manager through manager idol with text cost that be all in the face of clear and vocal opposition from the fan thankfully due to the work of group of fan create trust in luton include one of its found member gary sweet who be now luton town chief executive control of the club be wrestle away from that disastrous ownership however that be not the last time that fan have to step up to protect the club as the fan lead consortium buy they out from yet further mismanagement after they go into administrative receivership in unfortunately the previous mismanagement lead to huge point deduction and ultimately relegation to the national league while it have not always be plain sailing success on and off the pitch since have enable luton town now to compete at the pinnacle of english football from non league to the premier league how do luton town do it they ensure that they be unified club from top to bottom with clear vision root in our luton community mr deputy speaker if may will take the opportunity to celebrate significant part of our luton football heritage through the period by wish alison taylor the landlady of the bricklayers arms well earn and relax retirement at the end of the season after year of service fully support the creation of the new independent football regulator to protect and promote the sustainability of english football and particularly to safeguard the traditional feature that matter most to fan and community will put on the record few initial concern with the functioning of the regulator as set out in the bill first the regulator will have the backstop power to intervene in the distribution of broadcast revenue between the premier league and the wide pyramid if need it be important that we explore that to ensure that the regulator can facilitate just and fair financial distribution deal include parachute payment and include the ability to initiate any regulation the regulatory principle in clause do not make reference to fan or fan group or indeed player or employee as group that the regulator should proactively and constructively engage with when work for regulator in the health sector we directly engage with patient so why would the regulator not directly engage with fan who be the beneficiary of football also have reservation about whether the bill be sufficiently free from any vested interest further clarity may be need to ensure that person with conflict of interest can not be on the expert panel board the bill be support by so many of we on both side of the house and this be historic moment the game be not just business but one with deep root in the nation identity and community which be central to our global appeal look forward to support the opposition front bench team in take the bill forward we come to the front bench speaker be pleased to be here to welcome the football governance bill football club sit at the heart of community up and down the country family friend and neighbour come together to watch game win or lose while provide role model as well as infrastructure football club also inspire the next generation of footballe talent across every town village and city at the same time english football be world lead english club have fan on every continent and the player and manager they attract be admire from all corner of the world that combination of local togetherness and global acclaim be the envy of many as the shadow secretary of state set out the premier league and its club have contribute billion to the economy and support more than job this worldwide success have see big revenue than ever come into the game but despite that the financial sustainability of the english football pyramid be at risk as my hon friend the member for luton south rachel hopkins member for luton south just outline along with my hon friend the member for preston sir mark hendrick and many other too many fan be have their attention force away from the pitch and into the trouble of malicious ownership mishandle finance and poor management that could be bury fan who witness their club be expel from the football league almost five year ago or more recently read fan who share with their deep concern over the future of their club when meet they just few month ago pay tribute to my hon friend the member for reading east matt rodda and indeed the hon member for bracknell james sunderland for their campaigning work on this issue there be clearly structural issue in the pyramid that must be address indeed the fan lead review shine clear light on the issue within the game and pay tribute and thank to the hon member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch for all her work as my hon friend the member for weaver vale mike amesbury note the debate be take place on st george day so take the opportunity to wish the whole house happy st george day be supportive of the bill and the principle of an independent regulator for football with strict and focused remit on the financial sustainability of the game and the ability to act with proportionality labour support give fan great say in their club ensure that owner and director be stringently test on their integrity competence and financial soundness as my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins speak about it be also important to prevent any further attempt at breakaway league which put financial gain before the all important principle of competition and qualification base on merit in preparation for the bill have meet representative from across the industry from the premier league and its club the english football league the national league and the fa to the football supporters association and supporter group include the barnsley fc supporters trust know how important barnsley football club be to my town and be pleased to watch they at oakwell just few week ago while not everyone agree on every detail of the bill or with the shape that the regulator will take there be lot of agreement that english football offer something world beat and special that must be protect for year to come that be what believe the bill seek to do and look forward to help to shape it with careful scrutiny the regulator do not address all the issue face football today nor be it mean to but some of those issue have understandably be speak about in the debate for example my hon friend the member for cardiff west kevin brennan give thoughtful speech and have bring forward private member bill on unauthorised entry to match his unauthorised entry to football matches bill be proportionate intervention design to ensure the safety of fan by create specific offence for those attempt to enter stadium without ticket and it have my support over the weekend we all see the news that fa cup replay will be scrap that have understandably feature in this debate with number of member raise their concern believe it be the wrong choice and fan will rightly have question about how decision be make that affect club all the way down the pyramid the magic of the fa cup be that club from right down the football league and indeed some non league club can compete with those at the very top at the moment however grassroot club across the country be face difficulty while contribute so much to community as the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron say the hon member for west bromwich west shaun bailey highlight how important they be to the football pipeline the club in my barnsley east constituency wombwell town worsbrough bridge afc and wombwell main all contribute so much to the community hundred of young people and adult play there every week but the latter two face flooding issue at their facility in the case of wombwell main which visit few week ago flooding be cause multiple game cancellation that be sadly typical of grassroots football across the country which provide the foundation for both player and fan it be right that the regulator be strict in scope cover the financial sustainability of the top five league but big part of that be to give fan meaningful say in their club would therefore like to hear from the minister on the strength of the measure for fan within the bill there have be lot of rhetoric about how football must be for the fan but be the minister confident that the bill provision will live up to expectation and give fan the voice they deserve welcome the contribution from the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage the chair of the culture media and sport committee thank the committee for its work and the fact that it have agree to hold pre appointment hearing with the new chair of the independent regulator once there be preferred candidate in place my hon friend the members for sheffield south east mr betts and for eltham clive efford both speak about this issue and pay tribute to both of they for all the work in this area as well as to my hon friend the member for liverpool west derby ian byrne know there have be keen interest in the issue of the so call backstop power and the ability of the regulator to intervene in the distribution of broadcast revenue throughout the pyramid that be an unprecedented power and must be carefully craft in order to achieve its aim can the minister assure members across the house that the regulator will be give all the target power it need to secure the sustainability of the pyramid as per its primary purpose give that player and staff at club be often the first to notice that the club be experience financial difficulty and that their livelihood will be directly impact it seem odd that they be not mention once in the bill as my hon friend the member for warrington north charlotte nichols point out can the minister explain why that be the hon member for folkestone and hythe damian collins also make some important point on that subject ask for little more detail on some of the work be undertake to ensure that the regulator hit the ground run for example what progress have be make on the shadow regulator and be there any more detail on how the expert panel which will be responsible for much of the regulator decision making will be appoint my hon friend the members for ealing central and acton dr huq and for manchester withington jeff smith bring up the issue of equality diversity and inclusion in football club it will be for the regulator to decide what be contain within the corporate governance code of practice but that be one of the issue that would expect it to consider before conclude would like to touch on woman football there be widespread agreement that place the woman game in scope of the regulator would not be right at this stage the carney review reveal number of press issue in the woman game include poor pay professional standard mental health support and union representation it be important that we take they seriously it be crucial that we ensure the financial sustainability of the man game but that should not result in resource be strip from the woman game would therefore welcome an update from the minister today on what progress have be make on implement the recommendation of the carney review and on the department plan for protect the future of woman football as part of the bill to conclude thank all those involve in the bill my opposite number the under secretary of state for culture media and sport the right hon member for pudsey stuart andrew the civil servant the club and of course the fan labour have long commit to review football governance this be once in generation opportunity to preserve the future of our nation favourite sport we can and must get it right thank all member for their thoughtful and wide range contribution and be grateful for learn about the first black professional footballer arthur wharton from my hon friend the member for darlington peter gibson be pleased to hear the broad support for what the government be propose and be grateful for it be also grateful for the continue engagement with colleague as we have prepare for the bill my right hon and learn friend the secretary of state rightly point out the success of english football and the contribution it make to our economy and the pride of our nation but it be important to remember why we be here today my very first meeting when be appoint as minister be with fan group hear at first hand their experience of when it all go horribly wrong even to the point of have to boycott their own club for five year in one instance the fan feel unheard we know that club be more than just football club when they go into administration and be run down the fan be obviously in despair but that also have significant impact on the wide community because they be more than football club they be community asset that be why we commit to the fan lead review like everyone else want to put on record my thank to my hon friend the member for chatham and aylesford dame tracey crouch and to the people who help she include kevin miles from the football supporters association the review be the foundation for the white paper and now we have the bill today thank all those who engage with we for all they have do the fa the premier league the efl the national league the fsa and the select committee also want to put my particular thank on the record to the official in the department can not tell the house how many hour they have put in they have be first rate and thank they great deal want to focus in the short time have leave on some of the point that be raise many issue be raise and will try to get through as many of they as can but be happy to engage with colleague afterwards if need be when construct the bill we have be careful to ensure that it be carefully draft consider and proportionate and that it provide an advocacy first approach and that there be focus on the club where it be need and we make sure it be proportionate to their place in the pyramid number of member raise the owner and director test too many club have be bring to the brink with unsuitable owner take over strip they of asset and refuse to adequately fund they that be why we be bring in strong statutory test to help prevent unsuitable owner at the point of entry before they can do harm to club prospective individual will be prohibit from become club owner unless the regulator have determine beforehand that they be suitable they must pass fitness test which mean they have the requisite honesty and integrity be financially sound have pass the source of wealth test to ensure that their wealth be not connect to illicit finance and have plan and the resource to run the club even once an owner be in place at club the regulator will still be able to make sure that they continue to be suitable if it have ground for concern about their suitability it can test they on their fitness and their source of wealth if it find they unsuitable they will have to sell the club to prevent further harm be do to the club during the sale process the regulator will have the power to limit the owner involvement in the club and if the unsuitable owner ultimately refuse to sell the club the regulator will have the power to step in and force sale as last resort strengthened test and robust power to remove unsuitable owner will mean that fan have the suitable owner that they deserve hon member ask about what would happen if club owner be force to divest let be clear we hope that such circumstance will be incredibly rare the regulator objective be to promote club financial sustainability and it will introduce test on governance and financial oversight which will greatly reduce the likelihood of financial distress and make football more resilient in the long term for example we will ensure that the regulator be able to look at liquidity buffer which could provide the club with time to seek new owner and the regulator will have the power to test an incumbent owner where it have ground for concern about their suitability almost every member mention the backstop and repeat that we want football to come up with deal itself it be the good option and this delay serve no one we need to remember that we be talk about commercial arrangement business give business money which be why we believe it be good that football do it but we recognise that there be no deal at the moment that be precisely why we have put provision in the bill for backstop something to fall back on so that they can consider the relevant revenue do my right hon friend agree with my interpretation of clause which be that international broadcast income be include in the relevant revenue for redistribution that be currently not the case for solidarity payment if it be the case have this issue come up in his discussion with the premier league my hon friend raise an interesting point have have dozen of meeting with the premier league but as far as can recall do not think that it have raise carve out international broadcast revenue in those discussion which have always revolve around the net medium revenue and the aggregate revenue receive by both the premier league and the efl she raise very interesting point some say that the regulator should be able to trigger the backstop right at the outset frankly that would just be frontstop and it may hinder deal be strike by football itself but the bill provide that if there be no deal because one have not be offer or one side can not sign it because it be not good deal that side can ask the regulator to trigger the backstop member have mention parachute payment and be always happy to meet colleague to discuss and look at that matter far particularly in committee be also happy to organise briefing if that would be helpful because it be quite complex issue parachute payment play an important role in the sustainability of the system by soften the financial blow of relegation and remove they could have adverse effect look at bradford city when they be relegate from the premier league in there be no parachute payment and the follow season they go into administration will the minister give way literally have two minute have offer briefing and we can have this debate afterwards we realise that parachute payment can have distortive impact particularly in the championship which be why the regulator have the power to address any structural or systemic issue through its licensing regime any distortion create by parachute payment also have the potential to be address through distribution to non parachute payment club that be exactly what the regulator will be able to look at as part of the backstop lead expert have advise we to keep the backstop targeted and simple which we have do and to design it so that it may never need to be trigger which we have also do as such we do not think it be appropriate to include parachute payment in the backstop nor we do think it be necessary to do so as we have ensure that the regulator will be able to address any distortive effect that they cause via the licensing regime be run out of time to answer more question this be landmark bill for football it have be carefully design to celebrate the sport success and encourage investment but it be about provide stability for club sustain the pyramid and put fan at the heart we recognise that there be many success but it be important that we tackle the issue the ifr will be focus on football focus on financial stability and focus on fan close by play on the iconic word of too many fan have see their club on the brink and they think it all over well it not now question put and agree to

service that people in our county receive have diminish so much and although the minister and his department must take their share of the blame it be also important to have an opportunity to detail the way in which the county council leadership have add to their problem since the government come to power here in westminster derbyshire county council budget have be slash by million in real term in its budget be about billion which be billion in today money but derbyshire county council current budget be million therefore it be less than half of what it be year ago in real term at time of great financial hardship not least because of the runaway inflation unleash by the conservative party it be disgraceful and heartbreaking situation these cut have material effect on the provision of service and on people life next week the council will decide whether to go ahead with its proposal to close child centre across the region not only deny essential service to the child and family of derbyshire but potentially cost people their livelihood centre at risk of closure include holme hall and old whittington in my constituency and those in alfreton ironville langley mill bolsover hadfield gamesley matlock and charnos in ilkeston commend the hon gentleman for bring this debate forward be try to understand this derbyshire county council have have its money reduce at the same time as its population have grow and so the demand on the money it have have grow be there not something illogical unfair and immoral with that happen in this case to derbyshire council it would not be an adjournment debate without the hon gentleman contribution and be grateful to he for it because his point be well make the budget cut we have see in derbyshire have come alongside an increase in the population and there be an argument which many of we in derbyshire have make that the authority have be particularly badly treat on the finance the point he make be very valid one when the uk and derbyshire be both run by labour administration there be of these child centre but after year if these plan be approve there will be just the centre provide essential service such as health visit speech and language development healthy eating parenting school readiness family support parenting group and help to improve family relationship we know that the work do by the staff in the centre have massive benefit to the child and family that they help be first elect to this place in during the election campaign the issue of whether sure start be safe if the conservatives be elect be key plank of the labour party campaign the conservative furiously deny gordon brown claim that one in five sure start centre would be endanger if the conservatives be elect well in derbyshire gordon brown be indeed wrong we have see not one in five of these child centre close but four in five now the government wonder why they be spend more than ever on the cost of failure but they have fail to invest in the early year when the minister respond can he tell we whether he believe that the loss of of derbyshire child centre during the past year of conservative government be primarily down to elect conservative government or down to elect conservative council we will come on in due course to the authority failing in special need education but at every school visit experienced headteacher say to that they have never see so many child with serious special need have anyone in the government consider whether the strip away of these early year service may be contribute to the huge increase in the number of child present on their first day at school without be school ready and often in need of support with speech and language dress and toileting the authority get in touch with and with other derbyshire mp to ask we to lobby ministers for more money which and many other mp do as the authority be be charge excessive amount by private provider of child service derbyshire have embark on savage programme of privatisation of service and so would be vulnerable to private sector overcharging because it have cripple the strong publicly provide service that it inherit one feature of this administration approach have be the unfortunate habit of marry serial incompetence with careless arrogance and indifference to public opinion the closure of these building be case in point jon pearce labour parliamentary candidate in high peak have team up with local labour councillor to support the community plan to create community hub and preserve the centre at gamesley which house youth club and box club in one of derbyshire most deprived community those club be shock to receive call out of the blue from dcc to say that they have matter of week to find another venue because the decision have already be make to close the building the community be attempt to form constituted community organisation and have secure three month extension but it be engage in race against time we have also recently hear that derbyshire county council be look to close two third of the care home that it manage as well as eight old people day centre the right to dignity in old age be sacred covenant in this country old people should know that when they work hard for their entire life and make contribution to society they should be able to retire with degree of comfort and security feel that the covenant be now disintegrate before our eye the governor from school in brampton be in such despair at the situation that she attend the most recent full meeting of derbyshire county council to set out that to meet budgetary constraint while continue to deliver the require level of care the school be be force to cut teaching hour week the cost of living crisis spiral rent and ever increase mortgage rate be destroy the social contract in real time and the inability of council to provide service that facilitate for the most in need be damn indictment of year of tory rule and local mismanagement this situation could mean vulnerable resident be turf out on to the street the council be now close its own centre and use the private sector more it be spend more and get less spend on private care home have increase by since at time when the authority have have to close seven of its own care home lose bed it have also close bed in its remain care home and have around vacancy where be the county duty of care to those live in its care home it be not as if the council be efficient while labour run chesterfield continue to enjoy the low council tax in the country the tory administration on the council have raise council tax by almost the need for social care for adult be only go to grow and grow as people live long life be sure we can all agree that this be good problem to have but more funding be need from government if council be to be able to provide essential service such as this can the minister set out the guidance he have provide to county council and authority to plan for the delivery of service in the context of demographic change and real term cut to budget the child of derbyshire be suffer massively under the current council leadership too spend on private school for child with special need have increase from million in to million in accord to the school forum report while investment in council provision falter at almost every single one of my weekly surgery have parent in attendance who have child with special need who be unable to get into dedicated special need establishment often these child be exclude from their mainstream school these child be miss month or in some case year of their schooling and be unable to make mainstream placement work but unable to access specialist provision it can now be reveal that throughout this period of hardship derbyshire county council have receive around million of capital funding from the department for education since for additional special school place but have spend paltry million that mean million or of the budget it have receive be sit in derbyshire county council coffer while parent of special need child lose sleep every night at the lack of provision in our county it be nothing short of betrayal of those parent and their child what can the minister do to work with colleague in the department for education to get this dysfunctional authority to deliver special need placement for derbyshire child the case of brampton primary school which refer to early encapsulate all that be wrong with derbyshire county council budget allocation and service delivery the school have an excellent special need unit but also have tremendous reputation for how it have support special need child within its mainstream provision as result of this reputation many parent from well outside the brampton catchment area who have special need child will choose it for their child however this reputation for inclusivity come at tremendous cost to brampton the primary school have child on its roll with of these child have sen it be proud of its reputation for create supportive environment for child who have additional need but each child who have an education health and care plan have the first of their extra cost cover by the school before any central funding come in on top of that dozen of child be wait for special need assessment from the overwhelmed county council education service while the child and their family wait for their assessment to be hear the school receive no additional funding for these pupil at all school that have go out of its way to support those who have the great need be crush into the rock of an inadequate funding mechanism and county education service that be fail to support those child can the minister explain how we can ensure that school such as brampton be not penalise for their own success in support special need child congratulate the hon member on secure this important debate agree with the point he be make about the need for derbyshire county council to get ehcp assessment do much more quickly and much more accurately than they be currently pay tribute to the three special school in my constituency especially alfreton park which be brand new rebuilt school that be open last year which be sign that there have be some investment do the hon member agree with about the importance of keep respite care centre open that be not least to provide parent with bit of break but also because if they close there be real risk that some parent will not be able to cope and we will end up with the cost of have those kid in full time residential care and cost the county council more it be also the last thing parent want to happen join the hon member in pay tribute to the special educational need placement he talk about their work be outstanding be intend to be at ashgate croft school on monday but unfortunately be unable to make it and will be return there soon he be right about the importance of respite care and the perverse impact that cut those service end up have on the amount of money the authority spend agree with he on both those point although the council budget have be dramatically reduce by the government since its use of the precious available fund have be nothing short of appal budgetary constraint have produce an atmosphere of pressure within public sector delivery body and have profound respect and pride for worker do their utmost in try circumstance but the leadership of the council can and must do well derbyshire enjoy the dubious honour of be the pothole capital of the uk the beatles may have sing about hole in blackburn lancashire but research by mac truck rental find that derbyshire be home to over pothole and be pretty sure have be over they all pothole be serious problem with profound consequence for road user and public safety at the behest of constituent recently drive from ashgate avenue along old road towards old brampton and then to loundsley green the number of pothole see on that stretch alone be staggering have have to replace two tyre and spring this winter and the state of our road be the no local issue raise by my constituent when we be out speak to they on the doorstep while pothole be danger for driver they be lethal for cyclist have not yet find the courage to tell the enraged motorist of chesterfield that the conservative leader of derbyshire county council claim that the council be one of the good in the country at pothole repair but have see how penny pinch approach create even more work for the council often return to the same hole over and over again some of derbyshire principal road need repair compare with the second bad county council kent and sussex at way below the leader of the county council mr lewis be close to the mark when he admit that his authority adopt patch up and stick plaster approach to improve our road when the figure be investigate it all become clear derbyshire spend just per head on road repair the low in the country with an average spend across council of derbyshire be allocate less than the average council per head on road repair no wonder pothole be so omnipresent across our county the council have no plan for co ordinating disruption to road service from different organisation so why do the government not adopt labour plan to have oversight of those contractor so that motorist do not go through the inconvenience of road be dig up and patch up by one contractor only for someone else to dig it up again the next week have benefit from support throughout covid instead of invest extra money in its service the council choose to award tory councillor by create additional cabinet post and lift its spend while cut back on service it also scrap the chief executive role only to create the post of manage director who at princely be pay more than the prime minister and be increase on the previous incumbent be afraid the answer for derbyshire lie at its own door the service provide by derbyshire bear no relationship to those that exist in when derbyshire and britain be run by labour administrations we can not go on like this on may the voter of derbyshire have an opportunity to send message to those who have let our county down so badly vote for labour mayor and police and crime commissioner and start the process of rebuild our shattered public service in our beautiful county thank the hon gentleman for secure this debate competition of try to judge the difference between he and ray of sunshine would not be difficult to engage in because if one listen to he one would think all be doom and gloom and bleakness in derbyshire let assure he and my hon friend the members for amber valley nigel mills and for derbyshire dales miss dines who be in the chamber this evening that in no way shape or form be derbyshire county council on any red list or radar flash screen in my department that be good news for the resident and service user of derbyshire at this juncture let also put on record my thank as we all should to all those officer and councillor irrespective of party who turn up day in day out to serve their community and to try to make thing little well for people in derbyshire they deserve our thank the hon gentleman reference in some detail understandably so as be not seek to dismiss his concern in any way child centre and other service provide to young people those as he will know be properly and in great respect in the domain of the department for education will not intrude upon other ministers portfolio but undertake to the hon gentleman hope this will serve as sort of hold reply to ensure that my colleague in the dfe be aware of his remark and concern and respond accordingly and appropriately there be little to no doubt that the funding scenario for local government in england have be challenge and it would be foolish of any local government minister to stand at the dispatch box of the house of commons and say it have not it clearly have be and that be recognise in the additional million that we provide to the local government funding settlement this year the funding formula have creak and groan under stress and strain over many year the hon gentleman be right to point out he be not unique in do so virtually every conversation have with anybody with an interest in or represent the concern of local government draw attention to it the two almost unstoppable trajectory of growth demand in special educational need and the support service that wrap around that area of local government service and at the other end of the age spectrum in adult social care those be good news story in themselves because they be testimony to the success of the national health service in support people in their life and ensure that they be fit and healthy those thing lead to additional and grow demand on the service of local government local government be rise to that challenge across the piece magnificently but there be always work to do it be recognise across the two front benches that the funding formula do not need tinker with or little tweak here and there it effectively need dismantle and start from scratch such thing as the use of datum to inform the ability to define need the ability to respect and reflect upon the differential in need demand in rural versus urban and in coastal as well as be deal with yesterday in oral question should all play into that that be why be talk to council leadership across the country and to the wide sector about where we think the formula should land in the next parliament the formula can not be ignore because we all want particularly reflect in this year since the local government reform of to find robust and sustainable way forward so that the future of english local government can continue for the next to year post covid the sector ask the government for stability and certainty we have deliver that by not instigate major review of the formula as say that be job for the next parliament it be worthwhile just to look at the figure for derbyshire county council its manage director emma alexander have by her own admission describe the council and agree with her assessment as be sound and stable financially that be good news for council tax payer and service user of derbyshire because it mean that against that backdrop of sound and stable finance informed and proper decision and change can be take rather than knee jerk reaction in response to pressure outwith the council control the council and ms alexander be realistic enough to highlight that the council next focus its immediate focus have to be on modernisation implement what they describe as one council work and new transformational strategic plan for the whole of derbyshire think that that will drive efficiency one can only hope that in that drive of improved efficiency service will improve still far for the resident of derbyshire this year settlement for the county council be significant increase in core spending power of on the previous year up million make available total of million for the hon gentleman reference some of the work do through the social care grant it now mean that for derbyshire be receive million through that grant last year of course the government award million of levelling up capital funding to the derbyshire region include million for the south derby growth zone and million for chesterfield town centre suggest to the hon gentleman and think that in his heart of heart he know this that one should look not just at the cold figure of the money produce as important as that is in the local government finance settlement but at the broad range of support and intervention that the government be provide across derbyshire include the town deal the accelerated town fund the levelling up fund the community ownership fund the future high street fund the long term plan for town level up culture capital regeneration the uk share prosperity fund the uk share prosperity fund multiplier the community renewal fund level up partnership and level up park all of which have generate significant sum of money for derbyshire alongside the grant and council tax raise ability of the county council to deliver service for local people may say on behalf of the people of derbyshire dales that we be immensely grateful for the million of level up fund without which the town of ashbourne would be go back in time instead of look to the future there be also the share prosperity fund one of my town matlock will receive lot of money and do lot of good work my experience of how the government and the county council have react and respond to the need of my constituent be very different from that of the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins have have over email since my election and great number of they have be about local council send provision pothole and other matter the management of the county council by the conservatives have be very good and there be always more work to do who could not spend more money on send these issue be precious to we but give the money that be available my experience be very different from that of the hon gentleman be worried that these matter have be bring up at this stage mid election when really we need to look at the fact derbyshire county council could always do with more money but it manage the money that it have really well the leader barry lewis be particularly good he be credit to we all be grateful to my hon friend for the upbeat fillip which we need to hear from representative of derbyshire be delighted to hear that her constituent and suggest probably the constituent of chesterfield erewash bolsover across the amber valley south derbyshire clay cross staveley and long eaton be pleased to see the attention on they to deliver level up and make sure that those engine of growth livelihood and success can be sustain be convince by the work of the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for redcar jacob young to deliver the east midlands combined county authority billion devolution deal for the wide west midland to drive growth and boost opportunity demonstrate yet again if demonstration be still need our commitment to devolve more money and power to local leader the establishment of the east midlands cca will open the way to provide considerable funding for the area the combined county authority will have control of million year that can be well spend and maximise with the election of my hon friend the member for mansfield ben bradley who be stand head and shoulder above the other candidate for the post of mayor wish he well wish the people of derbyshire well this government stand behind they ready to serve they to meet their local and central government need question put and agree to house adjourn
