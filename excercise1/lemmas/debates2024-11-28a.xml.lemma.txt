church commissioners the hon member for battersea represent the church commissioners be ask church own hospices assisted die what assessment the church have make of the potential impact of the terminally ill adult end of life bill on church own hospice what assessment the church have make of the potential impact of the terminally ill adult end of life bill on church own hospice church nationwide provide chaplaincy and grief counselling service to hospice patient and their family many modern hospice start off as church affiliate institution thank to the pioneer work of dame cicely saunders they be largely now affiliate to hospice uk which support over hospice across the uk include the royal trinity hospice near my constituency of battersea only third of adult hospice in the uk receive funding from the state the rest rely on charitable support and there be considerable concern that the terminally ill adult end of life bill may divert much need fund from frontline care hospice have charitable aim to provide palliative care at the end of life but these could be compromise by the terminally ill adult end of life bill which come before the house tomorrow what consultation and impact assessment of this measure have there be with hospice that have faith foundation be hear that some hospice need an exemption or they might close do not believe there have be consultation with any faith connect organisation and do not believe that an impact assessment have be carry out however hospice uk the body to which most church associate hospice be affiliate have survey provider staff and practitioner who have express concern about the bill implementation they be concerned about the following who will qualify the impact on those work in hospice palliative care and end of life care the ability of provider and staff to opt out the practical operation of conscience clause the financial impact on the future funding of hospice and the lack of public awareness of end of life care and the available choice can my hon friend confirm whether church own hospice will work with independent hospice and other organisation to mitigate the potential impact of the terminally ill adult end of life bill and to issue statement from across the sector thank my hon friend for her question on this incredibly important issue refer she to my previous answer but it be also worth highlight that in recent year the general synod of the church of england have twice vote by large majority against change the law on assist suicide the association for palliative medicine and hospice uk to which most chaplain and church own hospice be affiliate remain opposed to any change in the law the sector be particularly concerned about the funding challenge such change would bring as be highlight in select committee report the report show that funding for palliative care service fall by almost in country such as the netherlands belgium and luxembourg where legalised assist dying be in place compare with increase in country where it have not be legalised do the church commissioner agree that hospice be about comfort the dying and surround they with care be that not the very antithesis of the state involve itself in sanctioning and assist suicide if we think back to the founder of hospice care it be found on the principle of faith and jesus christ it be only right that those principle of care and compassion ring true in ensure that hospice care be there for those who need it the very ethos of church own hospice be the sanctity of life on which the bible be very clear church own hospice will reflect that in what they do do the church commissioner share my concern about the potential conflict that could arise between church own hospice and this house follow the outcome of tomorrow debate on the assisted dying bill do she share my concern about the sanctity of life and agree with about the importance of make sure that we keep people alive hospice and palliative care play an important role in end of life care believe that we need to fund those service properly before we consider move towards legislate for assist dying historic places of worship what step the church be take to preserve historic place of worship what progress the church commissioners have make on reduce the backlog of work to restore parish church and cathedral the national church institution have invest million in the buildings for mission fund which provide money for repair specialist advice and grant to parish of up to for small scale urgent work building for mission

thank to he for his stylish and expert first century half century should say mr speaker man of your wide culture and extensive learning will doubtless be familiar with the film mad max be no expert but the image that it conjure up of desolate chaotic landscape with wreckage strew everywhere be the perfect metaphor for the government recent budget let we take hospice for example in herefordshire we be bless to have the extraordinary st michael hospice st michael support hundred of in patient year with end of life care and thousand more as out patient and with visit in the community it have dedicated staff assist by some volunteer this be extraordinary shudder to think what it would cost the state to provide that kind and quality of care certainly more than million year what have this labour budget do to st michael hospice the change to national insurance alone will cost the hospice an extra next year but that be only part of it at the same time the budget have directly and indirectly push up the wage bill by furth that be annually in extra cost vast amount for an organisation that offer incredible care and actually save the nhs million year hospice in almost every constituency will be affect and so be the interest of almost every colleague in this house this disastrous outcome be clearly never intend by the treasury it be another completely unnecessary blunder with potentially tragic consequence as with gps pharmacy and mental health and social care charity no compensation whatsoever have be offer for this tax raid when will the government publish proper impact assessment and explain why none have be offer there be direct link here to the issue of assist dying in the word of the health secretary no less do not think that palliative care end of life care in this country be in condition yet where we be give people the freedom to choose without be coerce by the lack of support available that care be now be deliberately worsen by his own chancellor personally feel strongly pull in both direction by both side but one thing no one can be in any doubt about be that the government have no business try to rush this legislation through the house by proxy the text of the bill be publish barely two week prior to our vote tomorrow no impact assessment or legal issue analysis have be publish far from public debate precede legislation legislation have precede debate that be completely the wrong way around we can be perfectly clear about this all member of parliament be recently send dossier by the promoter of the bill entitle your question answer unfortunately far from answer key question the dossier fail even to touch on whole series of important issue those include the bill impact on the medical profession and the relationship between medical staff and patient its impact on the provision and regulation of the different drug and drug cocktail require the record to date and protocol to be use in case an initial attempt at assist dying fail and what the inevitable for profit industry exploit the new law will look like and how we should feel about it as the senior judge sir james munby highlight there be host of question about involve the judiciary in the process and the balance of probability test for coercion most profoundly of all there be the question of what choice and dignity actually mean in different context none of those matter be even mention in the dossier purport to give the answer whatever one feel about the issue of assist die itself as say feel very pulled in both direction this absence of debate especially with so many new member in the house be matter of the grave public concern as the house well know the government themselves be all over the place on the issue in ask for an assessment of the bill likely impact on the nhs the health secretary be do exactly the right thing prepare civil servant and clinician for what could be huge change and ask they to look at crucial question that have not even be address let alone properly answer as for the justice secretary she be attack by none other than her own labour predecessor lord falconer of thoroton for impose her view but his lordship somehow miss that she be also make the argument that it be inappropriate in principle for the state to get involve in what many term assisted suicide that too be yet another issue that have barely be discuss ask the right hon lady whether she share my view that it be tragedy that colleague be be ask to vote without full and proper consideration of the vital issue have mention join the right hon gentleman in congratulate the clerk of the house on his very special birthday as someone recently on the other side of that same special birthday obviously know do not look it welcome he to the half century club and hope his party be as good as mine be we will leave that conversation for another day this week we mark white ribbon day be proud that this government have pledge to halve violence against woman and girl be also proud to have announce the debate on lord etherton review of the treatment of lgbt veteran today be particularly pleased for my friend and manchester resident carl austin behan who after year of decorate service in the raf be dismiss the day the raf find out he be gay he deserve recognition and much more as do many other know that the shadow leader of the house be fairly new to opposition like most of his colleague but gently say to he that the idea of opposition be to oppose the government not his own record in government last week he attack our plan to meet climate goal yet when he be the minister with responsibility for decarbonisation he seem to take very different view tour the studio to champion net zero here we be yet again he be attack our plan on national insurance contribution but check the record and notice that when his government raise national insurance contribution and not just on business but on worker he be the financial secretary to the treasury at the time and say in defence of the measure from this very dispatch box it be profoundly conservative thing to report september vol he seem to have be for it then but be against it now be not sure what his position be be quite confused about it may say to the hospice that he mention and to the many hospice like it that we have make record investment in the nhs the hospice sector be leave on its knee by the right hon gentleman government as he know the health secretary will soon come to the house to explain how the record allocation of resource that he have receive will be distribute include to the hospice sector the right hon gentleman raise the assisted die issue that we will discuss tomorrow must say think it be regrettable that he have choose this opportunity to raise those matter in such an unnecessarily political fashion this issue generate very emotive response on both side and hope that tomorrow debate will be conduct in respectful considerate non partisan and non political manner he ask about time and scrutiny which have mention before as leader of the house be very confident that the bill will undergo sufficient scrutiny and will have sufficient time for consideration as have say before from the dispatch box the government will of course implement the will of the house whatever it may be and as have also say before should the house choose to give the bill its second reading the government will of course work with the bill promoter to ensure that the bill and the policy be workable operable and implement that will mean work with the promoter on tidy up any measure where necessary the department of health and social care be get to work straightaway on what the bill will mean in term of implementation assessment and the documentation that the right hon gentleman highlight should the house decline to give the bill its second reading then of course that work would not happen as have say before after several week in committee the first opportunity for the bill to return to the house will not be until the end of april that be considerable amount of time for the government to do that work and consider the bill far this year mark the anniversary of the summerland disaster on the isle of man in which people include child lose their life after fire engulf the summerland leisure complex my constituent valerie daniels and her young sister be both impact by that horrify tragedy two young man from warrington die in the fire report into the disaster be release in the follow year and catalogue series of failure from the design of the building to the fire safety regulation but to date no individual or group have be single out for blame for what happen will my right hon friend find time for debate on the issue so that survivor and the family of those who lose their life can finally get justice be really sorry to hear about that tragedy that affect my hon friend constituent these be incredibly pertinent issue one that we should be debate in this house she might want to raise they as part of the grenfell inquiry debate that will take place next week if not be sure there will be other opportunity for she to raise they call the liberal democrat spokesperson yesterday mark fuel poverty awareness day and just last week ofgem unveil another increase to the energy price cap for this winter an increase

half of those worried about how they will stay warm this winter when can the house expect statement from the government on tackle fuel poverty this winter thank the hon lady for that question also notice that her leader be out on the airwave today with separate campaign wish he well with that and hope that he be not another one hit wonder when it come to those issue we have inherit really difficult situation when it come to energy supply and energy price as the hon lady know the energy price cap be set by ofgem and reflect its consideration of how energy be buy few month ago we be take this issue incredibly seriously which be why we have plan to get to net zero by it be only by switch our energy supply to renewable that we will be able to bring price down for long and have the energy security we so desperately need the hon lady ask about the situation this winter particularly for pensioner and other she will know that there be the warm home discount as well as cold weather payment that will get trigger we have extend the billion household support fund into this winter that payment of either or be now be make in place such as manchester to those on council tax support so just above the pension credit threshold we have also see the big ever increase in the number of people apply for pension credit so we be take action we will support people this winter but more importantly we will take the long term action that we need to get our energy bill low liverpool woman hospital in my constituency offer the only specialist gynaecology and maternity service in the

word of my hon friend who of course have considerable experience in the area of humanitarian emergency this be foreign policy priority for the uk government that be demonstrate by the recent leadership of the foreign secretary at the security council it will continue to be foreign policy priority as have be make very clear by the foreign secretary and indeed by the prime minister we will continue to use every lever available to we to ensure that we be speak up for the people of sudan and do all we can to secure an end to this dreadful conflict the current war in ukraine and the battle between israel and the terrorist from lebanon and gaza be regularly report to this house yet more civilian be be kill in sudan than in all these other conflict this conflict have be largely ignore across this house and in our medium so warmly welcome the minister statement today and support it completely now of course an end to hostility have to be secure but equally those responsible for human right abuse need to be bring to justice at the international criminal court or the international court of justice what action be the minister go to take to make sure that happen thank the hon member for his kind word as we can see there be considerable concern about this situation right across the house we need to be work together on this emergency and have certainly find the opposition to be keen to do so the hon member talk about the need to ensure there be not impunity for the atrocity that we be currently see that be absolutely priority of the uk government as have mention we be really determined to ensure the renewal of the fact find mission and pay tribute to the previous government for have manage to secure the initial mission there be some suggestion that it might be difficult to get it renew but we actually see an increase in support for it two african country back it which be really encouraging we be determined to work right across the board to ensure that there be no impunity but above all that the voice of people on the ground be hear that also involve back civil society which again the new government be do commend my right hon friend statement as well as the work do by the foreign secretary at the united nations despite the failure of the resolution eleven million displaced people be staggering number some million have go to neighbouring country and specifically million have be displace to egypt the regional and global consequence of that displacement be huge so how can the uk assist those country particularly egypt which may also face the prospect of refugee from gaza be very grateful to my hon friend for raise this matter the word that he use be absolutely correct we have see staggering movement of people both internally within sudan and as he mention to neighbouring country we have have number of discussion with those country about the challenge that this displacement have pose they have of course keep their border open to enable those flee such an appalling conflict to seek sanctuary but we need to make sure their voice be hear that be why we have ensure that we have listen to those country concern about these matter particularly in our delivery of support the education can not wait support that have talk about be also support child in host community thank the minister for come to the chamber today to make this important statement unspeakable atrocity have take place and be take place in sudan and the humanitarian disaster that have follow be horrific both in its nature and its scale in that light my snp colleague and welcome the additional million in aid that the minister have promise however must press she on three specific point first can the minister tell we whether the overall aid budget will increase accordingly or be this simply move money from one budget head to another that be an important point secondly although this aid be welcome it be insufficient the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for melksham and devizes brian mathew call for no fly zone can the minister say what specific measure and action she be take to prevent these atrocity in sudan beyond the provision of aid finally only moment ago the minister say that she be appal by russia veto of security council resolution and that that veto be disgrace on that she be absolutely right but will she commit to consistent uk leadership in condemn un security council member who veto humanitarian resolution go forward be grateful to the hon member for his question on the overall aid budget can assure he that this be not just shift fund around if he look at the programme budget for the fcdo for this year compare with next year he will see that there be an increase of million of course we be inherit situation where there have be huge turbulence within the aid budget particularly because of the increase in in donor refugee cost under previous government but we be determined to get grip of that turbulence and have much more planned approach for the future the hon member ask about the measure be take beyond aid have talk about the arm embargo and we be engage in many diplomatic effort because he specifically highlight atrocity prevention will also mention that the minister for africa lord collins host an event with his dutch counterpart at the un general assembly that be specifically about conflict relate sexual violence we be determined to ensure that the voice of those woman and girl who have be impact be hear and that we be take action against it of course the uk be determined to be absolutely consistent when it come to the prevention of access to aid during conflict and the hon member have see that from this government call another member of the select committee thank you madam deputy speaker many member of the select committee myself include have hear of the role that online disinformation and hatred have play in some of the atrocity in sudan what leadership can the uk demonstrate in help to quell some of this digital fuel on the fire in the war against sudanese civilian my hon friend raise really important point we be indeed see huge amount of misinformation circulate and lot of it be digital that be why we have be determine to support the centre for information resilience research body that be gather open source evidence about the ongoing fighting where the fact about what be go on be be manipulate that be link to fuel violence so it be important that we see continued support for reliable information and evidence in this context and also that we combat that disinformation which have be so damaging the war in sudan be plainly appalling hear that million people have be displace but million be also an appalling figure as understand it this start out as war between the general in charge of the armed force and the general in charge of the rapid support forces militia that make think that we need to get upstream of such situation to try to prevent they happen again the uk use to be involve in defence engagement we be deliver course such as manage defence in wide security context at the kofi annan international peacekeeping training centre teach thing like democratic oversight and democratic control of the armed force will the government look again at that training and see whether we might deliver more such training for military officer and official in those develop country that be receptive to it be grateful to the hon gentleman for his interesting and important question the issue of conflict prevention be absolutely fundamental not just for as minister but for the foreign secretary and indeed the prime minister we have be seek to ensure that the uk do all it can to exercise leadership in relation to what be often describe as fragile and conflict affect state that include state that be not yet in conflict but where there be the ingredient for conflict to increase unfortunately of course the climate crisis be now often link to some of those conflict we have make sure that there be strong focus on economic development for example we have some good result few week ago from the world bank which be focus on this in its international development association replenishment will ensure that the specific issue of defence training be raise with the defence secretary and will definitely be think about it myself welcome the statement and the leadership that the uk have show particularly in the un security council when we look at sudan the complexity can make we feel as though we can not act but it be really important that we do have speak to ngos on the ground know that they continue to push for access as number of hon member have mention the ngos be particularly concerned about the un role in this and keen that we continue to push the un welcome the continuation of access on the border in chad but can we ensure that the uk be push the un on sustainable access on that border and that it be not time bind or unnecessarily condition be grateful to my hon friend for raise these really important issue the uk government have discuss these matter in detail with the un and have myself do so with number of its agency engage in the crisis know that they have be deeply concerned about the restriction on aid that we have see some restriction be very clear such as the closure of crossing but there be also those that be de facto because of bureaucratic or administrative obstacle place in the way of those try simply to keep people alive through humanitarian aid she talk about the crossing in darfur we have welcome news that it would be open for three more month but ultimately it must be open permanently this be an absolutely critical lifeline for million of people and we will continue to advocate for that as be sure will the ngos she mention pay tribute to their work and it have be pleasure to meet they and discuss these matter too welcome the minister statement on the dire situation in sudan as have be mention sudan have be describe as the forget war which be incredible when we think that accord to the united nations million people have be displace and over half its population be on the verge of starvation why do the minister think it have take we so long to give this conflict due consideration would like to push she on what negotiation we be have with our proxy nation that be play role in this conflict with some of which we have excellent relation finally what tangible action be we take to get aid into the country and to distribute it to those who most need it perhaps can reassure the hon member that this crisis have be an absolute priority for as state before will not rehearse what say previously as soon as come into my role be determined that should be brief on this situation be determined to get as close to sudan as could which do when go to south sudan over the summer be really determined to make sure that the uk be exercise its leadership role we have also be absolutely clear have say this in the house number of time that there be no reason for any country to be engage in sudan unless it be provide humanitarian support have say that on the record number of time and we will continue to make that case welcome the minister statement on this harrowing humanitarian catastrophe especially welcome the fact that the uk be commit to give an additional million in aid to the people in sudan have two question first how realistic be it that this aid will actually get to the people still in sudan secondly give the large number of country host huge number of refugee have they in any way indicate how long they be willing to continue host refugee be grateful to my hon friend for those important question we be confident that the uk support be reach those in such desperate need that be require creativity diligence and repeat work from those on the ground particularly to ensure that they be able to get aid to where it be need there be often complex process of negotiation and that be in the context that there should be no impediment on aid but we be determined that it will get to those who need it my hon friend talk about the response of neighbouring country to the large influx of refugee the last conversation have with one of those country be with some ministers and representative from chad they be determined to fulfil their responsibility and they be extremely concerned about their sudanese brother and sister as they describe they to who have come over the border however that country be already under huge amount of stress so we pay tribute to it but we need to see the international community step up thank the minister very much for her positivity when she come to answer question in this chamber we be all encourage by her true and honest enthusiasm so put my thank on the record with an estimate million people look for food and million people displace sudan be fast become the crisis point of the world although be loath to suggest engagement in any theatre of war my question to the minister be this can we do more can we do more to offer safe and secure camp for woman and child with the chance of education and clean water can we do more to assist those who be seek to do well and to battle with tyranny if we can do more my question be will this enhancement start today be grateful to the hon member for his kind word know that he be engage significantly on these issue and he have be at all the discussion of they in the house know that many of his constituent be concerned about this situation as well it really be important that we see far great safety for those who have flee this conflict the hon member talk in particular about woman and girl mention before the extremely disturbing fact that while of course woman and girl must be safe everywhere we have for example have rape report in camp for internally displace people and at checkpoint the fact that we have see this take place in those context be extremely disturbing we be absolutely determined as the uk government that we will be work with partner and the un agency to ensure that we do all we can to provide such safety and security which of course include the food security that he have also champion call another member of the select committee welcome the minister statement this week the select committee hear compelling evidence include about the important role of the sudanese diaspora and not only in the uk but in other country the minister have rightly recognise the importance of listen to civil society organisation and work with they in sudan will she speak specifically about how the department be engage with the sudanese diaspora here and what practical step be be take to tackle the cost of remittance give that many people be send money back to their love one be grateful to my hon friend for raise this of course she have considerable expertise in this area the role of the sudanese diaspora be incredibly important be sure that many of we will have have discussion with member of the diaspora in our constituency and hear their concern about the humanitarian situation but also about what they be do to support friend family and the wide community have certainly do that myself and know that lord collins be determined to ensure that we have strong relationship with the sudanese diaspora indeed we should consolidate it for the future because we all want the same thing peace security and humanitarian support for people live in sudan thank the minister for her statement this week the un call the crisis in sudan an invisible crisis so it be really powerful that we have have so much agreement here today which hope will shed some light on the crisis other have speak about the gender base violence which the un have describe as an epidemic be pleased that the minister be take the issue really seriously and know that this be more than just job for she however sudan be also place where minority faith be persecute so when we be think about distribute aid will we take account of all human right as well as the need to save life be grateful to my hon friend for that important question he be of course right about the need to act against conflict relate sexual violence which many member have reference on religious freedom in particular which have previously be raise in the house we remain concerned by the wide human right situation across sudan since the military coup we continue to promote freedom of religion or belief as means of enhance tolerance and inclusion in sudan but we be not aware of any significant increase in the specific targeting of or discrimination against any religious minority because of their belief include christians in the country since april we will however keep this under review be grateful to my right hon friend for her statement and for her leadership on the grow humanitarian crisis in sudan it all too often feel like forget conflict give the systemic human right abuse we have hear about with that in mind do she agree that russia veto of the joint uk sierra leone un security council resolution on protect civilian be indefensible and will only extend the human suffering in sudan absolutely agree with my hon friend that resolution be ask for what anyone can see be desperately need in sudan an end to impediment to aid above all an end to the conflict and international action to support the people of sudan we be deeply disappointed and frustrate that russia veto that resolution but that will not dim our resolve to work with other partner on this issue last but by no mean least call steve race thank you madam deputy speaker and thank the minister for come to the house to give this statement and for all the work the government be do to support the sudanese people in the face of severe malnutrition and starvation keep the adre crossing open be extremely important the sudanese armed force have commit to three month but what diplomatic pressure be the government bring to bear to ensure that that crossing remain open for long than three month the ability to bring in ready to use therapeutic food be so important and there be global shortage in the production of rutf at the moment ahead of the nutrition for growth summit next year will the government commit to invest in scale up production of rutf my hon friend raise an important point and he be absolutely correct the nutrition for growth conference be come up next year in paris and be discuss that yesterday with some civil society expert we must ensure that we be do all we can so that there be provision of those much need resource especially for those already suffer from malnutrition my hon friend also mention the additional challenge of those impediment to access to aid which must be lift be pleased that the house be unite in its condemnation of those impediment and hope we can continue to work together on this appalling crisis royal assent have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that the king have signify his royal assent to the follow act passenger railway services public ownership act backbench business taiwan international status beg to move that this house recall that united nations resolution of october which establish the people republic of china prc as the only legitimate representative of china to the united nations un do not mention taiwan note that un resolution do not address the political status of taiwan or establish prc sovereignty over taiwan and be silent both on the status of taiwan in the un and on taiwanese participation in un agency and call on the government to clarify its position that un resolution do not establish the one china principle as matter of international law to state clearly that nothing in law prevent the participation of taiwan in international organisation and to condemn effort make by representative of the prc to distort the meaning of un resolution in support of beijing one china principle and the alteration of historic document by representative of the prc change the name of the country from taiwan to taiwan province of china thank the backbench business committee for grant this debate this be the first time have stand in the chamber to back the democratic right of the people of taiwan and want to acknowledge those who have work on this issue over many year in particular the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and my former neighbouring mp stewart mcdonald also recognise the minister long stand commitment to the human right of people in the region and indeed your commitment madam deputy speaker welcome to parliament the deputy representative director and assistant director of the political division from the taiwanese representative office they be in the gallery to observe this debate which carry an important bearing on our strong and vibrant relationship with taiwan the detail in the motion may seem esoteric but diplomatic technicality on an issue as fraught as the status of taiwan could have far reach consequence for the entire world and we must have this debate now rather than later think back to the frenetic last minute activity ahead of the full scale invasion of ukraine with emergency flight full of anti tank weapon hastily draft sanction regime and fruitless shuttle diplomacy ukraine stand as reminder that it be good to form policy on crisis before the crisis emerge incremental change to the status quo make by authoritarian regime be likely prelude to more overt measure and the good time to deter an aggressor be before their confidence grow it be not possible to overstate the risk of conflict over taiwan leave aside the humanitarian cost and geopolitical consequence of another democracy be attack by large authoritarian neighbour the economic pain would be feel in every household in this country around of the world large container ship pass through the taiwan strait once year taiwan produce two third of all semiconductor and well over of all advanced microchip it be estimate that conflict would cost the global economy not less than trillion but that estimate be calculate by the rhodium group use only shipping datum bloomberg put the figure at massive trillion about of global gdp and it regard that to be conservative estimate the scale of the risk be why this debate be take place not only in this chamber but in parliaments around the world and put on record my thank to the inter parliamentary alliance on china for its assistance through its work parliaments in australia the netherlands and canada and the european parliament have all express their opposition to the distortion of un resolution be grateful to the hon gentleman for secure this debate and for give way the comparison point be important the figure he have give for what would happen should taiwan be blockade or even invade be worth relate back to the ukraine effect from when russia invade ukraine we have hit of about trillion to the global economy the hon gentleman be talk about nine or time that effect on the global economy this be our neighbour rather than far and distant land absolutely although first and foremost in our mind should be the impact on people in taiwan of any crisis it would also be feel by our constituent in their cost of living and everything that happen in this country it be right that this be worldwide debate give the military incursion into taiwanese territory cyber attack disinformation interference with shipping and aircraft all the thing that make the headline and welcome the new government expression of concern about aggressive move in the strait however this need to be global conversation because the people republic of china be involve in an aggressive worldwide diplomatic strategy especially across the global south the strategy aim to secure international acceptance for its expansionist one china principle which be to say that taiwan be part of single china and the prc be the only legitimate government of taiwan deny taiwan democracy any distinctive international status of course resolution do not mention taiwan at all and it do not address in any way the political status of taiwan it do not establish the prc sovereignty over taiwan and it be silent on the participation of taiwan in the united nations and its agency importantly it have no force of impact on we as sovereign nation and the relationship we choose to have with taiwan the current strategy by beijing be distortion of international law but it be also at odd with the long stand policy of the united kingdom it be essential that that be contest and this debate offer the minister and the new government the opportunity to make it clear that the uk oppose that effort by the communist government to rewrite history or to unilaterally decide the future of taiwan debate about taiwan be famously full of symbolism which flag be fly what nomenclature be use and which seemingly synonymic word cause offence it would be easy to write off discussion about the interpretation of resolution as yet another fine detail that distract from big picture but that would be mistake this be not pedantry from beijing this be predation chairman xi watch the near unanimous diplomatic disapproval of russia war of aggression in ukraine and he be seek to reduce the chance of similar chorus of condemnation towards any move against taiwan if the prc position that the un resolution endorse its sovereignty over taiwan be accept it would later use that consensus to argue that any future coercion of taiwan through arm or other mean whether blockade or annexation would be legal similarly any acceptance of beijing interpretation would be use to argue that move to prevent such coercion by taiwan democratic supporter be unlawful this be not technical issue but another source of increase risk for conflict across the taiwan strait will the minister confirm today whether as have be report any assurance have be give to the prc that the uk will not seek to counter internationally its effort on the one china principle and whether promise have be make privately that we will not make the case with third party nation for uk policy namely our position that taiwan status be undetermined do she recognise that any uk government acquiescence with the idea that the status of taiwan be an internal matter for the prc alone risk give legal cover to any future aggressive act do she recognise that distort resolution to pursue the exclusion from international organisation of taiwan democratic self govern people undermine the legitimacy of the international rule base order not least as it appear to be inconsistent with the treatment of other dispute territory will the uk advocate for meaningful taiwanese participation in all international organisation for which statehood be not prerequisite past moment of crisis in the strait of taiwan have flare up and subside in particular in and after presidential election but three thing that have change since then should make we more concerned first china be far more heavily armed already possess of the large naval fleet in the world beijing have be add to it the equivalent of the entire royal navy every two year it will soon have the large air force in the world secondly people on both side of the strait have grow apart the taiwanese now have more of sense of their own identity and their democracy be deeply embed while china populist nationalism have grow and the prc which be hardly ever free and open society have move even far in an authoritarian direction from xinjiang to tibet and hong kong chairman xi previously propose to apply the one country two system approach to taiwan however the systematic removal of hongkongers civil liberty mean that any promise from the mainland to maintain the freedom that taiwan enjoy could not be trust we know that beijing do not keep its promise thirdly if we be honest the west have be find want we have be less than united and less than determined in our defence of democratic ally and democracy around the world xi have learn from putin year of slowly boil the frog divide western opponent from each other manipulate our population and operate in the grey zone where gradual increase in aggressive act avoid strong strategic response from the west that mixture of chinese armament grow nationalism increase authoritarianism and western weakness be potentially deadly combination indeed the military exercise and provocation around taiwan be recipe for unintentional disaster last year there be more than occasion when prc military aircraft deliberately enter the air defence identification zone of taiwan prc jet turn away when they be just minute from taipei during exercise we see taiwanese and prc vessel in stand off on the edge of taiwan nautical buffer zone meanwhile we do not have agree red line around taiwan with other like minded country and worry ambiguity remain for example maritime and air blockade be normally class as an act of war but that be not clear in this case because of taiwan ambiguous state will the minister assure the house that the legal status of blockade around taiwan be be look at worry that we could have situation where government use that ambiguity as an excuse for inertia in the event of crisis will she take the opportunity to say that maritime and air blockade around taiwan would be red line for the government on so many occasion during the cold war catastrophe be avoid due to essential de escalation protocol that prevent the misinterpretation of either side intention would be interested in the minister assessment of whether there be sufficient procedure of the kind between the military command of taipei and beijing as in such febrile and nationalistic atmosphere mistake could easily be misunderstood as deliberate escalation and control of volatile public opinion could easily be lose as be say early let we not forget who pay the price for the collective failure of the international community to deter putin aggression it be first and foremost the ukrainian people but ordinary work people around the world also find themselves with unaffordable bill if bloomberg be correct escalation across the strait would be as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green say five time bad than the economic contraction post ukraine we simply can not allow that to happen when we discuss taiwan we talk lot about protect the status quo but we must recognise that the prc be already actively work to change that status quo beijing have not pay any price for that xi diplomatic offensive have not be meet with commensurate effort from western democracy as the prc isolate taiwan within international institution we have not increase our engagement in response above all there have be no sanction for the constant military intimidation or grey zone attack recognise of course that careful diplomatic language be need on this issue but we live in world where free and open society be retreat in the face of authoritarian regime who no long recognise the old order or even international boundary and who be seek to recreate the world in their image do not expect the minister to depart from the delicate long establish language that have define the uk position towards taiwan since diplomatic relation be establish with the prc and the motion do not ask for such departure ask the minister to put on record the government concern about beijing distortion of the international law around taiwan and about the editing of historic un document by chinese official hope that be see not as an outlandish or hawkish request but merely as the least we can do when confront with such troubling behaviour finally put all diplomatic language aside the debate be an opportunity to acknowledge the truth taiwan be not china in one important way that no amount of economic military or diplomatic bullying by beijing can obscure it be this the people of taiwan be free and the people of china be not now more than ever we must stand with democracy and against dictatorship we must stand up for freedom that we claim be universal regardless of where people live in the world and we should stand with the democracy of taiwan the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall mention sanction it give huge pleasure to call my co sanctionee sir iain duncan smith madam deputy speaker will see what can do to speak on your behalf even though you have no opinion on this matter absolutely not we will see if we can ascertain one in pass congratulate the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall on secure the debate that be not easy as he know and it be really good to see so many hon member in attendance as you point out madam deputy speaker be one of nine political sanctionee and it be always worth remind ourselves that there be two other outside parliament who be also sanction they speak to the other day and say we often forget in this matter but we can do business it very difficult wish to remember they while we be at it they be unnecessarily sanction everything that the hon gentleman say be absolutely correct the problem be that we be deal with power that be grow in potency and totalitarianism while it also grow in other way let add something on the size of the growth in its military capability he mention china naval capacity right now china have time the capacity for naval shipbuilding of the united states any one shipyard in china outbuild the whole of the united states in naval shipbuilding someone please tell that that be for peaceful purpose have no conception of why it would need that many naval ship if its purpose be peaceful the answer be that it be not this whole business of taiwan have be obscure constantly by refusal from administrations from both side of the house say to the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs the hon member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west who will respond to this debate that be not have go at this government have be have go at every government for long time it seem that whoever be elect be in opposition she should not take personally the point be about to make gently to she politician be elect to take decision base on the principle that we govern by our principle be simple we believe in free speech base freedom the rule of law and human right we may debate the element and range of that but we believe in the fundamental right to decent treatment be sanction along with you madam deputy speaker and other for raise the then undiscovered genocide that be go on in xinjiang which have now become public knowledge this parliament member on both side vote to agree that the genocide be take place although the government say that they could not vote to agree with that or do anything about it because that action would need to be take at the un through the international court of justice that be never go to happen because it get veto straight off the labour party in opposition agree that genocide be take place and agree on many occasion with those of we who have real problem with china treatment of people and of human right the labour party be constantly in support of our position simply say that as base reminder because this be really about what we believe from one government to the next we have genuinely deliberately obscure the question of taiwan status people have argue with that the question be settle by resolution which be often misquote they say that it somehow settle the status of taiwan they have argue that it be clear from that resolution now that the prc be responsible for china at the un that taiwan be part of china it say no such thing as the hon member for east renfrewshire say in fact it be deliberately obscure about that idea it be not settle under the whole reign of the communist party in china taiwan have never be part of chinese administration or chinese government taiwan right now be democracy and an upholder of human right it have an agreement as we do that the freedom of individual to speak out without let or hindrance and without fear of arrest we see such arrest in hong kong remain important the government should speak out in taiwan defence and argue that china have no right to extinguish that unless there be deliberate indication that taiwan wish to be part of china taiwan have never wish that and the last election demonstrate that be still not the case taiwan do not wish to join china as it have never be part of china this military build up be not for general purpose it be ultimately to try to displace the us position in the pacific so that it will be unable to act should china decide at some point to blockade or invade the incursion that be take place would not be tolerate anywhere else in the world there be huge number of plane overfly taiwan ship be threaten it by come right up close past the border of taiwan they be deliberately provoke in the hope that action will take place that allow the chinese to take action themselves if we move our gaze slightly far south we come to the south china sea china have occupy it and declare it to be historical part of china the un have say that that be not the case and have tell china categorically that it have no right to occupy or build military fortification in the south china sea what have china reaction be to that nothing it say that the un have no right to interfere and now it be try to blockade in fact us navy ship still sail through there but every other ship include recently the philippines coastguard have be hound out of the area ship have be ram and threaten and military naval vessel from china now occupy that space we know what china think of these thing we know what it plan to do because it have already do it we wonder if we do not say very much will that obscurity allow china to back away the chinese have no intention whatsoever of back off that be part of their absolute creed now in fact it be clear even from china constitution that it see taiwan as part of china do not know how many more indication the foreign office need of china direction of travel what do the government plan to do about this to what degree will the government challenge the misinterpretation of resolution publicly and recognise that taiwan have right to self determination as we and all other democratic nation do will the minister take the opportunity to state government policy clearly from the dispatch box will she agree to make public statement to the house about what be go on in taiwan the hon member for east renfrewshire ask for that and back he up we would love clarity from the government on the fact that what be take place in and around taiwan be utterly unacceptable we should even think about move to sanction at the security council china will veto that we know but it be important for the world to understand china position to return to covid we remember when all that happen as result of failure in china but we be unable to get any figure about what taiwan be do and that be rather important because it have advanced method of deal with covid that we could have learn lot from we be not allow to get those figure they all have to come through china china refuse to let we know what be go on as it embarrass china because it have take very little action early on and the result be million die around the world my point be that when we acquiesce and give way as we do at the world health organisation where we no long insist on these thing that weakness be see as success for china the chinese take that and move on how do we know that because back in the every time we acquiesce to new demand by hitler germany it take that and move on we do not appease communist or fascist dictator by say well if we be reasonable in due course they will be reasonable by definition dictatorship be not reasonable fascist germany tell we what it be go to do and china tell we categorically all the time what it will do we in the west do not want to believe that we think that if we be reasonable the chinese will be reasonable they be not reasonable they intend to take taiwan back one way or the other today and go forward the question for we and for the foreign office the unelected body that sit across the road be why do not we get serious about this understand it and say all this if we do not tell the chinese that there be limit they assume that we do not believe that there be any and they go ahead the financial chaos that would ensue from merely blockade not even an invasion of taiwan would be devastating to our economy have an argument the other day with one of my colleague who shall remain there we go he be not in the chamber that individual say to that taiwan have nothing to do with we it be long way from we and we have no arrangement with it when make the point to he that the whack to our economy would be enormous add one other figure which be that of everything make in the world be make in the area around the south china sea include china say to my colleague that it be not far away it be our neighbour without taiwan if anything happen to taiwan we go down too the real point of this important debate be to try to persuade the government to be much bold about this matter and to recognise the threat to recognise the need for british government to say enough be enough and to recognise that what happen to taiwan be not just matter of interest to we but matter of vital importance many member be at the conference in taipei recently where we hear about all the terrible problem that taiwan now face as result of china action one only have to be there to realise just how devastating this situation be to many taiwanese people whose life be genuinely threaten by it with this huge build up the clear threat that china pose the brutality it have already demonstrate in the south china sea and the illegality of its action and its complete failure to take any action other than those it wish to take it be important for we to demonstrate stage by stage at every moment and at every opportunity that we regard china behaviour as unacceptable and that we will oppose it one way this government could start do that would be to go back and look again at the risk register that we start under the previous government we should now move china on to the high tier of that risk register that would send very strong signal to the chinese government that we be serious about our behaviour will end simply by say the following to the minister know the government want to increase and improve trade with china and understand why they want to do that my concern at the end of it all be that we can not detach our desire for commercial engagement from the real engagement which be about the way state treat the people who live there and the way it behave to its neighbour we do so in the past and look what happen million people die because we ignore what be go to happen they tell we what be go to happen but we want to do business with they this time we have to learn that appeasement do not work there be no chance it will work this time we need to be clear to china as america be and as other be and say that this shall not stand that we in the uk will stand for the freedom of those people whose self determination be always matter of high concern to we and that we will defend it at whatever cost call the select committee chair thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for his contribution it be always pleasure to follow in his wake the work you have do to make this house aware of the very real threat that china pose to we be astounding you have be very dogged in make that happen and be grateful for that also thank my new hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall for his contribution in your short time in parliament the work you have do to show how china be exploit the most vulnerable and commit egregious human right violation have be deeply appreciated turn to you madam deputy speaker now can actually use you appropriately for once what you have do in your time as parliamentarian to campaign for and champion the right of the uyghur people who be be so egregiously exploit in the xinjiang autonomous region by china be admirable we regard the sanction china have put on you madam deputy speaker as badge of honour for defend human right and we be very proud of what you have do can say quite simply that love taiwan love the people love the food love the culture most of all love its vibrant democracy which be one of the strong in the world in this speech will share how its democracy actively try to help other around the world and how it be something we all need to stand with it will therefore come as no surprise that must draw member attention to the fact that co chair the british taiwanese all party parliamentary group and to my financial declaration in relation to that over the year have witness at first hand how taiwan actively contribute its expertise to support global partner which we should celebrate taiwan be leader in the field of public health technology clean energy net zero and so much more however despite all that taiwan have to offer it find itself bar from international organisation since china have repeatedly use un general assembly resolution to justify its effort to exclude taiwan from the un system which it have do hugely effectively with population of million taiwan be the most populous self govern state not represent at the un its exclusion undermine critical global co operation effort in particular around public health climate change and the realisation of the sustainable development goal take sdg on promote good health and wellbeing taiwan maintain some of the low case rate in the world throughout the pandemic however while it have notable success in suppress the spread of the virus its exclusion from the world health organisation mean that it be unable to share this expertise with the world the official record show that when the resolution be pass year ago its intent be merely to make judgment on who should take up china seat at the un that be it the resolution bear no mention at all of taiwan it do not state that taiwan be part of the prc nor ascribe any right for china to represent taiwan in the un system most importantly there be no evidence that the resolution establish as matter of international law the one china principle for all those reason the resolution can not be use as reasonable justification to preclude taiwan from participate in international organisation as parliamentarian we must do all we can to contest the narrative that china territorial claim over taiwan be settled issue it be not it be not an issue at all china have no sovereign right over taiwan resolution be one of the many grey zone use by china to encroach on taiwan sovereignty and we must not collude with it in that we have recently see increase incursion into taiwan airspace as well as large scale military drill and advance close to taiwan contingency zone operation by the chinese coastguard have challenge taiwan right to control the water around its own territory as china continue to challenge the boundary and disrupt the rule base international order be deeply concerned by the silence of the international community and that that silence will be interpret by china as tacit consent we must call out any attempt by china to establish legal basis for future armed invasion of taiwan we all hold share interest in the freedom of navigation through the taiwan strait and the south china sea which be one of the world most important trade route as other have say bloomberg economist have estimate that potential invasion of taiwan would cost the global economy around trillion that would come out of our pocket that be equal to around of global gdp which would dwarf the cost of the war in ukraine safeguard the taiwan strait and protect the rule base order be in both our national and our international interest understand but do not appreciate diplomat and uk civil servant dance on the linguistic head of pin on this topic and therefore urge the minister and the house to solemnly refute china argument on un resolution and to curb the prc ambition to unilaterally change the status quo across the taiwan strait and across taiwan itself it be pleasure to speak in this debate thank all member who have speak their contribution be always exceptional and be very pleased to hear they commend the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall for secure the debate he also secure debate in westminster hall on the uyghurs so thank he for give we an opportunity to participate the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith always bring his personal touch to these issue he have deep passion for this subject matter and thank he for that in speak about the future of global democracy and the protection of human right the situation of taiwan the action of the chinese communist party and the increasingly concern violation of religious freedom and human right in china let begin by express my firm support for the sovereign status of taiwan beacon of democracy in region where its survival be threaten by the grow authoritarianism of china taiwan stand as stalwart defender of liberty democracy and human right value that we in this house hold dear we all say that and when we say it other will follow it be essential that we as nation stand with taiwan as it face increase aggression from the chinese government the relationship between taiwan and the united kingdom have always be one of mutual respect and share value it be vital that we strengthen those tie in the face of grow threat from beijing taiwan be not just an ally in the fight for democracy it be live testament to the success of democratic governance in the face of adversity since the taiwan have undergo significant political and social reform transform from one party state under martial law to flourish democracy with free and fair election in fact taiwan rise place in the economist democracy index rank as asia no democracy and globally mark its commitment to the principle of liberty freedom and human right in contrast just across the taiwan strait the chinese communist party seek to erode the very foundation of liberty china increase aggression towards taiwan through military provocation cyber attack and political pressure must be meet with strong response the united kingdom along with other liberal democracy have responsibility to defend taiwan sovereignty and to advocate for its rightful place in the international community that be why today debate in this house be so important it be so important that member from all party on all side of the chamber put that on the record in alone we see staggering intrusion by chinese military aircraft into taiwan airspace sharp increase of on the previous year it be very clear what china be do as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green say why be china build all these ship there have to be purpose where be it go it show the increase military threat pose by china and we must not ignore these act of intimidation on the chinese communist party gross violation of human right within its own border the chinese government have be responsible for some of the most horrendous human right abuse in recent memory particularly against religious minority religious freedom be fundamental human right you and know that madam deputy speaker we all know that in this house and we all know how important it be to say it china continue to systematically violate this right both within its own border and beyond one of the most concern example of those abuse be the ongoing persecution of uyghur muslims in xinjiang report from credible international organisation indicate that over million uyghurs and other muslim minority be detain in so call re education camp they be torture camp they be intimidation camp they take away liberty and freedom and subject family to force labour torture and indoctrination the camp be part of china broad campaign to erase uyghur culture religion and identity this brutal repression be compound by horrendous report of force sterilisation sexual violence and organ harvesting china treatment of tibetan buddhists falun gong practitioner and christians be equally alarming tibetan buddhists continue to face severe restriction on their religious practice with report of monk and nun be detain torture and even kill for peacefully protest or for their religious belief the ongoing effort to erode tibetan culture and religion include the imposition of chinese communist party approve religious leader my goodness just pluck that man out there and he can be religious leader he do know anything about the religion but he do it that be the china that we speak out against today it be direct assault on the freedom of conscience for falun gong practitioner the situation be equally dire thousand have be detain and subject to force labour torture and execution for their belief the crackdown on christians in china be every bit as severe church closure the destruction of cross and the imprisonment of pastor have become all too common religious worship whether in mosque temple church or private home be increasingly subject to government interference and repression china effort to silence opposition extend far beyond its border we be look at taiwan today but there be other part of the world where the focus be equally clear through its belt and road initiative china have seek to extend its economic and political influence across the globe often use debt trap diplomacy to entangle country in its sphere of influence that have include pressure country to withdraw their diplomatic recognition of taiwan and to instead align themselves with beijing because you owe we so much money and this be part of the deal it be gross violation of the principle of sovereignty and self determination and it be essential that we as nation continue to support taiwan in the face of those pressure moreover as other have say china technological influence be grow concern the ccp have make significant investment in surveillance technology which it use both domestically to monitor and control its population and abroad to further its strategic objective as lead global power the united kingdom have unique responsibility to defend the principle of democracy human right and the rule of law it be essential that we not only stand with taiwan but take concrete step to ensure its security and sovereignty the uk must work closely with ally particularly the united states japan australia and new zealand to build co ordinate response to china grow aggression and evil attitude to everyone in the indo pacific region in addition to our military and diplomatic support for taiwan the government must also continue to raise the issue of china human right abuse at every available forum the uk must lead the charge in hold china accountable for its action and ensure that the international community do not turn blind eye to the suffering of million of people under the ccp control we must also ensure that our economic relation with china do not come at the expense of human right it be unacceptable that economic interest should override our moral obligation to stand up for the oppressed in conclusion taiwan be shin example of the power of democracy and freedom in the face of authoritarianism we must stand by taiwan not just because it be in our national interest but because it be the right thing to do we must also continue to speak out against the ccp brutality and human right abuse and work tirelessly to hold china accountable for its action the united kingdom must remain champion of freedom democracy and human right and we must be so in the firm belief that these value will ultimately triumph over the force of oppression believe they will believe we will do the right thing we have maiden speech call alison taylor thank you madam deputy speaker for allow to make my maiden speech during this

her focus on drive economic growth across her constituency china increasingly aggressive behaviour towards taiwan be yet another alarming example of its consistent and blatant disregard for the international rule base order as one who be proud to represent significant hong kong community in bolton west have hear at first hand about the devastating effect of beijing authoritarian rule indeed many of my constituent be effectively force from their old home in hong kong by the destruction of its democratic freedom let we be clear beijing action towards taiwan do not exist in isolation they be part of broad pattern of behaviour as have describe we need only look at tibet where beijing have systematically suppress cultural and religious freedom at xinjiang where atrocity have be commit repeatedly against the uyghurs at hong kong where the sino british joint declaration have be tear asunder and now at taiwan beijing have escalate its military posturing impose economic coercion and engage in cyber warfare all aim at undermine taiwan vibrant democracy and intimidate its people china deliberate distortion of united nations resolution be prime example of the way in which beijing disregard the international rule base system to push its own narrative let emphasise that crucially the resolution do not address the sovereignty of the island of taiwan or preclude it from have representation at the united nations or other international organisation yet beijing have seek to change historic document and record include at the un to allege that the resolution claim that taiwan be an inalienable part of china territory the blatant misrepresentation of resolution be not just an attack on taiwan but an assault on the integrity of the international system that we champion this behaviour also stand in direct opposition to the uk long stand position on taiwan for decade the uk have maintain policy that not only be in favour of taiwan participation in international organisation but reiterate our clear interest in peace and stability in the taiwan strait consider the taiwan issue one to be settle through constructive dialogue not force or coercion however china action continue flagrantly to contradict that principle and threaten the stability of the wide indo pacific region tension be increase with recent estimate suggest that there have be increase in grey zone activity across the taiwan strait as well as incursion into taiwan air defence identification zone beijing grey zone activity in the strait be make it very difficult to establish red line around its behaviour normally maritime and air blockade would be consider an act of war in international law can the minister confirm that maritime and air blockade by beijing around taiwan would be red line for the uk government want to underline the clear public interest in de escalation in the taiwan strait we depend on taiwan for microchip especially for the advanced semiconductor on which we all depend for our critical infrastructure two third of chip and almost all advanced chip be currently produce in taiwan as my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire outline bloomberg have estimate that the conflict would cost the global economy trillion more than five time more than the ukraine crisis as we learn from russia illegal invasion of ukraine the failure to deter conflict in the south china sea will have high cost for all of we in this place and for our constituent in the then defence minister baroness goldie confirm that the uk government be analyse the prospective economic impact on the uk of escalation in the taiwan strait will the government publish that assessment give the clear public interest beijing pattern of behaviour be clear each time we fail to respond decisively to china disregard for democracy and the international rule base order it embolden beijing to continue to act with impunity taiwan be now at the frontline we must stand with taiwan not only to protect its people and democracy but to send clear message to beijing that the systematic erosion of freedom and violation of international law that have take place in tibet xinjiang hong kong and now taiwan will not go unchecked by push back the uk will defend our share value strengthen our global alliance and uphold the international law that ensure peace and stability across the world congratulate my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall on secure the debate and my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north alison taylor on make her maiden speech it be wonderful to have two mp from scotland bring so much knowledge and understanding of international issue to the house it really be enrich and have be in this place for year all the contribution today have be full of different aspect economic public health dictatorship the communist party and filthy politic but will stick to some basic have be to taiwan number of time and think be still get over my last trip which be to the conference that have be mention do not know how many hour of travel we do but it really knock out for six and we do not have many hour between the business over there if anyone think that member go on trip to taiwan be on holiday they be wrong taiwan be wonderful place will not go on too much about it but it must be way up there in the ranking for demonstrate actual democracy believe this parliament have much to learn from taiwan about how to conduct its business on my first visit to taiwan think be go to the third world but come back to somewhere that resemble the third world by comparison with taiwan only last month the people republic of china conduct one of its large ever military drill off the coast of taiwan in an attempt to intimidate it the drill involve naval vessel and at least aircraft the tactic of intimidation be part of today debate and it show what china be about china be attempt to intimidate taiwan and isolate it by insist that the one china principle mean that taiwan can play no role in international body nothing in un resolution state that taiwan can not be part of international organisation and the exclusion of taiwan come with dangerous consequence for the world number of member have explicitly state that today so do not need to repeat what they have say the opening speech of my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall be magnificent he cover every aspect of this matter and congratulate he on do so during the pandemic taiwan deploy one of the world most effective strategy against the disease despite its close proximity to china however taiwan be exclude from the world health organisation and it remain exclude today it be worth mention the force organ harvesting system who determine that china have an ethical organ transplant system china itself do yet the who still admit it accord to the who china operate an ethical organ harvesting system the hon lady raise really important point practitioner of falun gong talk about arrest incarceration and illegal organ harvesting from people who be still alive and about the high level of state base attack and murder it be quite staggering that china export more organ than any other country in the world and wonder where it get they from do not want to go on too much about organ harvesting because it give sleepless night china take organ from year old because it get more for they as there be well chance of succeed if the organ be take fresh from people who be still alive people can order kidney and so on because there be database of the people go to re education school china say to the world do worry we can get what you need you can have it in day how many people have be prosecute we know there have be one prosecution in the uk but how many people have come back from china have receive an organ be the law be enforce the exclusion of taiwan from international body mean that it could not share with the world its successful method of deal with covid when we need they the most the world health organisation be only one example of an international body from which taiwan have be exclude china have consistently block attempt by taiwan to join the un include in which mean that over million people in one of the fine democracy in the world have be block from be hear at the united nations in the event of conflict break out across the taiwan strait only one side would be able to put forward their case at the united nations that be not how the united nations be intend to operate why be it like that shiver when putin russia be allow to use its veto at the united nations people think be mad but we be see the consequence now there be troubling report that former taiwanese president tsai be block from visit this place to address mp and peer last month president tsai have have successful visit to canada brussels and czechia yet apparently she be not allow here that be despite taiwan be an important strategic partner for the united kingdom in the indo pacific sadly it seem as though china intimidation campaign continue to work one of the good way to push back against the people republic of china intimidation campaign be to elevate the status of the taiwanese representative office here in london in similar way to the action take in the united states and lithuania right now the taiwanese representative office be not afford the protection it clearly need it can not even get bank account elevate taiwan diplomatic status would send clear message that the british government do not accept an enforce one china principle and instead consider both taiwan and china to be individual partner the people republic of china be found year ago and taiwan have never be part of it taiwan be thriving and successful democracy that share our value as the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith say what be happen in taiwan be just part of china plan look at what be happen in hong kong instead of wait year to review everything china smash it and move on to the next one taiwan the right hon gentleman be right to raise that point today it be time to show our strength by throw off the shackle of intimidation and give taiwan diplomatic status if the british government lead with our ally other nation will follow suit taiwan be self govern democracy that have succeed despite not be allow into the un and other international organisation it be shin light of democracy in an uncertain region and this world be desperately short of such shin light of true democracy in operation the world be in desperate need urge member to vote for the motion today to send clear message that this house believe taiwan have every right to be part of international organisation in its own right that be what resolution be about some people would have be ashamed of my religion but be not be roman catholic but not holy than thou shudder go through when last year or the year before time seem to go very quickly now roman catholics in china be require to register as roman catholics and our pope accept it what do hitler do this be how he start think dear lord this sleep tiger have not half wake up and it be go to cause harm it be about time that other nation not just our get their act together it be about time that so call democratic country sort this out china be to be fear more than russia it be part of the evil axis that would take over this world if we do not all stand up for democracy and for people call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be always pleasure to speak under your chairmanship madam deputy speaker particularly give your considerable contribution on this issue throughout your parliamentary career as other member have say pay tribute to the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north alison taylor whose passionate love for her community and her family reflect well on she and give her constituent faith that she will act on their good behalf in this house also pay tribute to the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith whose contribution to this debate have already be warmly note expert often talk about the pressure point of geopolitic the place where the strategic aim of different country coincide clash and create tension what be far too often leave out of these conversation be the reality for the million of people who live in those pressure point the taiwanese people be live in real fear at one of these pressure point it should be tell for all of we that despite be an advanced economy and thriving democracy with high living standard and strong manufacturing and with cultural link to the rest of the world taiwan feel increasingly isolated and vulnerable in the face of the chinese government that be testament to the fact that no matter how hard people have work to build robust democracy on that island that do not in and of itself protect the liberty and security that we all deserve taiwan deserve our support as we enter the second half of this decade and this motion can help we to continue do that the liberal democrats stand with the people of taiwan any chinese aggression or threat to their free speech and human right be unacceptable the liberal democrats will continue to support our friend in the democratic progressive party which be the govern party of taiwan long stand member of liberal international and found member of the council of asian liberals and democrats in our manifesto the liberal democrats call for the building of new diplomatic economic and security partnership with democracy threaten by china include taiwan and it be something that we will gladly work with the government to deliver because an issue of this importance should transcend party politic be reassure by the voice and the statement we have hear from member on both side of the house in this debate fundamentally what be at stake in taiwan be question of moral obligation one that we have always have to confront and that liberal have always be clear in answering can we stand up for people live outside recognise sovereign state who cherish the same freedom we do and have the same inviolable right to self determination that we do against neighbour with increasingly imperial objective or be we force to live in world where as be say in antiquity the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must put simply do might make right the people of taiwan deserve we to answer that question with our clear and resounding support as they go about try to integrate into the system of international governance the government should therefore listen to the story be tell in this house today and make it clear that in their dealing with the chinese government they will establish clear red line that call out violation of taiwan territory at land and sea as unacceptable the government should work with their international partner to remove the obstacle to taiwan join various international body as other member have say taiwan exclusion from the world health organisation serve to prove this point despite successful approach to the pandemic taiwan be again rebuff in its attempt to join the who with china veto its accession until such time as taiwan give in to china territorial claim on the island this compromise our ability and the ability of country around the world to learn from the lesson of taiwan successful response to and it will have cost many many life taiwan find itself unable to properly access and work alongside interpol leave it exclude from the international crime fight network that it need not least because international criminal be know to operate in the south china sea this should concern all of we taiwan exclusion from these body make international co operation hard it weaken strategic ally in the region and it embolden state such as china and russia to feel that their attempt to undermine the liberal world order will succeed indeed how can we justify the liberal and democratic world order without ensure that it offer protection to those who subscribe to it and who wish to join and collaborate with the institution that be so key to maintain that very world order we have already leave so many country around the world vulnerable to the influence of state such as china the last government make short sighted and naive decision to continually cut the uk foreign aid budget to slash our international development credential to shrink our world renowne diplomatic service to force cut to our bbc world service output and to undermine our standing as major power on the world stage those step have leave vacuum in africa in asia and in part of europe too we should not be remotely surprised that china have increasingly seek to fill that gap with debt trap and political influence through its belt and road initiative it be up to this government to do something about it to show that the one china policy be not the policy of this government and that taiwan will be support in accede to various international body that would be key step in the right direction they must be willing to discuss taiwan with the chinese government as they embark on new era of bilateralism with president xi note that in its manifesto early this year the labour party commit to new approach to china as part of wide audit of its china strategy the manifesto say we will co operate where we can compete where we need to and challenge where we must those be welcome word so it be disappointing to read coverage this week of the leak news that the foreign office intervene to cancel visit last month that taiwan former president tsai ing wen have be due to make to the uk when he would have speak to mps will the government respond to that claim and explain to the house exactly why former president tsai as it seem be deny visit we all recognise that diplomacy be difficult and sincerely hope the government will put my mind and those of other hon member at rest by confirm that this be an oversight however if it be not an oversight and that decision be take out of deference to the chinese government ahead of the prime minister recent meeting with president xi the government will not be surprised to hear say that that be unacceptable the government new approach to china should be characterise by defence of our value and the robust support of taiwan that be why the liberal democrats have call for the government to issue comprehensive china strategy that place human right effective rule base multilateralism and work with our european partner centre stage without that we risk far backslide into world where china feel able to act with impunity and taiwan will continue to suffer will the minister provide an update on when the government will provide the house with an update on its china strategy audit so that we can scrutinise it and ensure it live up to those value just last month china simulate full scale invasion of the island through war game in the south china sea as the hon member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall say in late and early we watch russian force mass on the ukrainian border and attempt to convince ourselves that the inevitable be not about to occur will quote great man who hang heavy over many of we in this place those that fail to learn from history be doom to repeat it imagine live with the threat of such war on the doorstep we have all be pay close attention to the terrible scene unfold in ukraine and the middle east in recent year we all know that the horror of war have not be ease but rather compound by modern technology imagine people witness those scene on their tv screen while know the very same could happen to their home and family in the very near future the journey to recognition and accession to international body for taiwan be long and will not be solve overnight but the government can play key role in make the journey easy by show its support for taiwan as clearly as they can they can do the right thing on human right in china more widely too they can choose to recognise the genocide happen to the uyghurs in xinjiang autonomous region they can stand with hongkongers who be already live with the experience of creep authoritarianism from beijing and the government can champion the cause of international law and norm in the face of grow disorder and violence around the world invite they to do so and to regularly report back to the house on how such china strategy be develop because britain be at its good when it stand with those face oppression and say clearly with one voice that the day of might make right be well and truly consign to history call the shadow minister thank all hon member for their contribution not least my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith who always bring such knowledge and expertise to the house welcome the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north alison taylor congratulate she on make she make speech and thank she for share her passion for her constituency with we it be apt that you be in the chair madam deputy speaker because of your great knowledge of this policy area although we do not have formal diplomatic relation with taiwan there be nonetheless valuable and dynamic relationship between london and taipei underpin by strong commercial educational and cultural link we also have solid partnership in other important area include health as we see particularly during the pandemic the work of the british office taipei and the taipei representative office in london be highly commendable and benefit both of our people for example with wide range of exchange and visit include on environmental educational and judicial theme we also have significant trading relationship which we call on the government to continue to promote trade in good and service rise from billion in to billion in which be substantial increase we want more british business to benefit from taiwan impressive economy and prominent trade and investment link with the wide region within the current structure of our unofficial relationship there be more we can do to maximise the benefit to both of our people and we will push the government to do so it be right that the uk continue to lobby in favour of taiwan participation in international organisation where statehood be not prerequisite in her response will the minister update the house on the government current plan on that front include on the world health assembly and the world health organisation technical meeting the government must not overlook the risk taiwan have to contend with there have be some worrying early sign which we want to see put right member on the conservative benches harbour concern that the relationship labour be carve out with beijing be all give and no take today provide the minister with an opportunity to dispel the widespread impression that this government be make concession with nothing in return labour have call in the application for new super embassy in london and be desperately perform verbal contortion on issue that should be very forward include the national security law in hong kong we firmly believe that law should be repeal and we be not afraid to say so publicly will the minister name single area where measurable tangible progress have be make in advance critical british interest with china whether on national security economic practice or human right as far as can see we be yet to receive convincing answer we be very clear that what labour must not do be sacrifice the uk voice on the threat face taiwan on the altar of close relation with beijing we have already see sign of naiveté within day of the prime minister meeting with president xi jinping which the prime minister hail as an opportunity to bring about strong and consistent relationship where surprise would be avoid pro democracy campaigner be jail in hong kong follow very harsh application of the draconian national security law it make the prime minister boast that the uk would be partner commit to the rule of law look rather hollow the prime minister response to these entirely unjustified jailing and his inability to sufficiently publicly condemn they have raise eyebrow too it have not go unnoticed and we will not let that point go the government need to be much more clear eyed about the threat and challenge pose by china whether in relation to hong kong or taiwan we be concern by report that the foreign office try to exert pressure to postpone an inward visit by the former president of taiwan tsai ing wen the fcdo have say it do not recognise the description of event set out in the report which in westminster language mean that it do not deny that this happen will the minister give the house the explanation it expect what actually happen will the minister also confirm that the prime minister and the foreign secretary have explicitly raise serious concern in their respective meeting with president xi and wang yi about any activity that risk destabilise the cross strait status quo do they say in no uncertain term that we stand firmly against any unilateral attempt to change the status quo for reason that be well understand we have clear interest in peace and stability in the taiwan strait it be our deep conviction that the tension which have understandably receive great deal of attention in this afternoon debate should be resolve peacefully that be what will well serve people on both side of the taiwan strait as well as the indo pacific region and the wide world that peace and stability matter for the rule base order for trade and for the health of the global economy and we should not shy away from say that we hope that people on the two side of the taiwan strait will renew effort to resolve difference peacefully through constructive dialogue and not under cloud of coercion or threat much of the debate on this subject revolve around the constitutional status of taiwan and its relationship with china yet we should never lose sight of taiwan domestic achievement in its own right because they be deeply impressive flourishing and vibrant democracy strong judiciary and one of asia most dynamic economy taiwan be also vital manufacturer of conductor which be one of the most important piece of tech in the world for all those reason and many more we will press the government to deepen and grow our relationship call the minister may say how apt it be that you be in the chair this afternoon madam deputy speaker be grateful to my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire blair mcdougall for secure this important debate and for his first class speech thank hon member for their insightful contribution will try to respond to all the question in the course of my speech as two thriving democracy the uk and taiwan share unique relationship which be root in our share democratic value cultural link and deep tie despite not have formal diplomatic relation with taiwan we have strong unofficial link across range of issue such as trade education science and cultural exchange in that regard must commend my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion for her adept chairing of the british taiwanese all party parliamentary group which continue to play fundamental role in foster those tie and encourage great parliamentary link and friendship and indeed visit between the people of the uk and taiwan on that point we have question on visit from the two opposition spokesperson the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor and the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton and will say that the good visit be the one that be organise by the friendship group without too much interference from government those link be drive by common interest such as security and prosperity trade innovation climate action and global health and in the first three quarter of this year there be more british visitor to taiwan than from any other european country taiwan uk trade be worth billion in the four quarter to the end of the second quarter of and taiwan remain key destination for uk enterprise in clean energy and professional service the british office taipei and the taipei representative offices in london and edinburgh support the partnership in the absence of diplomatic relation member of this house be familiar with recent tension in the taiwan strait the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith lay they out in his introductory speech and the hon member for strangford jim shannon be very clear on that point our long stand position be clear the issue should be resolve peacefully by people on both side of the strait without the threat or use of force or coercion peace and stability in the strait matter not just for the uk but for the wide world as the fcdo statement in october outline recent chinese military exercise around taiwan increase tension and risk dangerous escalation the right hon member for chingford and woodford green be correct to carefully monitor the increase spending on the people liberation army and my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell be right to warn of the damaging element of cyber warfare conflict across the strait would of course be human tragedy or as my hon friend the member for st helens south and whiston ms rimmer say would have dangerous consequence it would also be devastating to the global economy with the study by bloomberg economics from january which think we have all read estimate that it would cost the global economy trillion or of global gdp no country with high middle or low income would be shield from the repercussion of such crisis that be why the uk do not support any unilateral attempt to change the status quo across the taiwan strait taiwan be not just face pressure in the strait it be be prevent from participate meaningfully in large section of the international system we believe that the people of taiwan make an invaluable contribution to area of global concern and that the exclusion of taiwanese expertise be loss both to the people of taiwan and to the people of the uk therefore reply to the point make by my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire in his excellent speech about the importance of taiwan meaningful participation in international organisation as member where statehood be not prerequisite and as an observer or guest where it be the minister have mention the hon member for east renfrewshire and his excellent opening speech he pose question that hope she can answer at some point do his majesty government now believe that blockade of taiwan would be consider an act of war can confirm that we have ongoing conversation with ally about all the risk associate with the taiwan strait the south china sea which have also be bring up in this debate and other border those include border with india and any other border where we have serious concern because there be number of threat to global security we continue to make the case for taiwan reinstatement to the world health assembly as an observer the uk have restate that several time include alongside partner in recent foreign ministers statement its inclusion would benefit global health include through participation in technical meeting and information exchange by the expert the fact that grow number of country join we in make statement on taiwan inclusion at this year world health assembly meeting demonstrate that the issue resonate not just in the uk and taiwan but with many in the wide international community and we be pleased to play that leadership role we would all benefit from learn from taiwan experience in deal with pandemic which as we know do not respect different geography on that point we believe that as member have say today there be misconception in many quarter about what un general assembly resolution from determine the uk view be that the resolution decide that only the people republic of china should represent china at the united nations however as my hon friend the member for east renfrewshire say it make no separate or additional determination on the status of taiwan and should not therefore be use to preclude taiwan meaningful participation in the un or the wide international system on the basis that have already set out that be why the uk oppose any attempt to broaden the interpretation of resolution to rewrite history do not believe that that would be in the interest of the people of taiwan and neither would it be in uk or global interest on wide uk taiwan collaboration we will continue to strengthen the uk unofficial relationship with taiwan because both side derive enormous benefit from it because the uk be believer in the importance of free and open trade and as the hon member for sutton and cheam say because the uk and taiwan have strong cultural tie our thrive billion trade and investment relationship encompass wide range of good and service not least the uk export of over million worth of scotch whisky think that be quite appropriate give that we have the wonderful maiden speech from my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north alison taylor be sure she be strong supporter of that wonderful export from her beloved scotland and that it take place just two day before st andrew day what could be well our enhance trade partnership that be announce last year as my hon friend the member for rotherham mention will far strengthen co operation in investment digital trade renewable energy and net zero taiwan produce the vast majority of the world most advanced semiconductor that drive our digital economy and it have critical place in the technology supply chain that underpin global market that be why we want our flourish science and technology co operation to continue just recently the national technology adviser lead delegation of business to taipei for the semicon taiwan conference where the uk have its large country pavilion to date the two side also hold the annual dialog semiconductor and discuss the potential to expand co operation on semiconductor skill research and development and supply chain resilience be pleased to say that we hold regular expert level talk with taiwan on range of other important issue hon member may have see that our late energy dialogue conclude just last week we be also partner on climate action taiwan be key market for the uk offshore wind sector our enhanced trade partnership will strengthen our co operation on net zero technology which be essential for the transition to clean energy system and for bolster energy security to conclude this government be maintain the uk long stand policy towards taiwan and relation across the taiwan strait be sure that parliamentary visit by mp will continue give the feeling in the house today our collaboration with taiwan be mutually beneficial which be why we continue to engage with taiwan within the bound of our unofficial relationship we continue to be staunch advocate for taiwan meaningful international participation because taiwan valuable expertise on wide range of issue can only benefit the international community as we work to tackle share global challenge we continue to work closely with our international partner to advocate for peace and stability and to discourage any activity that undermine the status quo before finish be aware that do not answer the question about the china audit which be raise by colleague today we expect it to be ready for public discussion in spring but there be plenty of consultation official and ministerial happen in the meantime the foreign affairs committee will also be approach for comment the uk have critical role to play in support continued peace and stability in the strait through these channel thank you madam deputy speaker call blair mcdougall to wind up thank the minister for restate the government position on the interpretation of un resolution and for celebrate taiwan society economy and democracy which know will be well take by our visitor it be encouraging that so many member speak in the house with one voice on this issue regardless of party and that so many member include my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell and the hon member for strangford jim shannon make it clear that the situation in taiwan can not be separate out from wide question of human right in the people republic of china do not realise that my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north alison taylor be go to give her maiden speech in this debate but it be wonderful none the less and congratulate she on it we can all see why she be such value friend and colleague to so many of we she mention the former munition work in her constituency which be now this beautiful peaceful new build community that make think that it be almost metaphor for our attitude in the world democracy president macron speak recently about how western democracy be herbivore in world of carnivore think that we have forget the sacrifice and the strength that it take for we to enjoy the freedom we have today hon member reach back into different part of history to make that point be particularly pleased with the contribution of the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor be currently try to get my son interested in ancient greek history so to hear someone quote from the melian dialogue in parliament be music to my ear the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith reach back slightly less far into the century but there be pattern whereby dictator will take little bit little bit more and little bit more and if they be not meet with strength early on they will eventually ask for something that we can not give that be when it become crisis and when we have to make great sacrifice what be most encourage by today be that as important as it be for this house to condemn with one voice any attempt to change the status quo through force there be also celebration of taiwan even if taiwan be not democracy it would deserve protection from the international community but it be democracy and we should protect its people even if it do not have vibrant open society and free speech we should be seek to show solidarity with its people but it do have that open vibrant society so we must show that solidarity even if it be not the dynamic economy that be so important and so integrated in everything that we do in the world economy we should be recognise the cost of any conflict there but it be integrate in the world economy and even if we be not in global context where authoritarian be on the march we should stand up and say that we would not tolerate another democracy be bully by its nearby authoritarian neighbour and another society have to be force into defend its own freedom through force when as an international community we can prevent that from happen question put and agree to resolve that this house recall that united nations resolution of october which establish the people republic of china prc as the only legitimate representative of china to the united nations un do not mention taiwan note that un resolution do not address the political status of taiwan or establish prc sovereignty over taiwan and be silent both on the status of taiwan in the un and on taiwanese participation in un agency and call on the government to clarify its position that un resolution do not establish the one china principle as matter of international law to state clearly that nothing in law prevent the participation of taiwan in international organisation and to condemn effort make by representative of the prc to distort the meaning of un resolution in support of beijing one china principle and the alteration of historic document by representative of the prc change the name of the country from taiwan to taiwan province of china pakistan freedom of religion beg to move that this house note report of deteriorate religious freedom in pakistan express its concern over the alleged widespread force conversion and human right abuse of minority religious group deplore the lack of action by the pakistani government which represent serious violation of article of the universal declaration of human rights and further note that the arrest of opposition religious leader by the local authority have lead to condemnation both in pakistan and far afield may first thank the backbench business committee for agree to this debate and for grant time in the main chamber for it thank all hon member who will make contribution to the debate it be pleasure to secure believe the first debate on religious persecution in this government first session think that it be the first time in about four or five year that we have have debate on this subject in the main chamber in essence we have score two in one today rise today with an urgent message about the plight of religious minority in pakistan as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief and also as chair of the all party group for pakistani minority have have the privilege of hear first hand account of bravery resilience and heartbreak from those who continue to face unimaginable persecution for their faith have always have deep interest in pakistan even long before come to this place and for my brother and sister who be christians in country where persecution be rife human right abuse be rampant and the right to express oneself be deny they visit pakistan on two occasion in and would love to say that thing have change in pakistan in those intervene five year but they have not indeed they have get bad and will go into more detail on that as we move forward our appg for international freedom of religion or belief remain steadfast in its mission to uphold and defend the fundamental human right of freedom of religion or belief for all people regardless of faith or creed as chair of that group speak up for those of christian faith those of other faith and those of no faith believe in my heart that that be my duty to do that as christian always explain that when deliberate on all the many religious group that be persecute today urge my esteemed colleague across the chamber to join we in amplify the voice of the oppressed and take decisive action to address the systematic injustice that they endure let put this in plain language that we can all understand the reality of the situation in pakistan be dire it be critical it be at crisis point in fact can understand why some people feel utterly hopeless pakistan be lovely nation with rich and diverse history but it remain fraught with challenge for its religious minority christians hindus ahmadis and muslims face widespread discrimination persecution and violence on regular basis the legislative and societal framework in pakistan have create an environment where intolerance thrive if we let something happen once twice three time then time it become the norm that be what have happen to religious minority in pakistan we be familiar with intervention from body such as amnesty international and the united nations even in our own country obviously there be far more acute need for their attention in place such as pakistan do that seem to be articulate and drive home adequately and be it have an impact especially on such appalling matter as force marriage and honour killing would love to say that such intervention be have an impact but unfortunately do not see much evidence of it our response have to be evidentially base amnesty international be involve and present in pakistan be it highlight these thing in pakistan only amnesty can answer that we do not see much evidence of it my concern be that the legislative and societal framework in pakistan have create an environment where intolerance thrive the blasphemy law which ask the minister to respond to directly be introduce during general zia ul haq regime they be among the harsh in the world and have be frequently weaponise against religious minority will give some example of that in the debate do the hon member agree that the issue go beyond religious freedom into other equality matter such as woman right and lgbt right which go hand in hand will mention that later it be salient point because whenever there be persecution base on people religious belief there be human right issue alongside it the two thing be not separate they be married if human right be take away so be religious right the hon gentleman be right to put that on the record since the many thousand of case have be report disproportionately affect christians hindus and ahmadis the blasphemy law be use not only to silence dissent but as tool for personal vendetta and mob incitement when be in pakistan in meet some of those who have be charge under the blasphemy law it be find that the allegation be vindictive and malicious there be no evidential basis for they whatever such accusation have lead to extrajudicial killing violent attack and mass displacement the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister refer to the plight of young christian and hindu girl who be abduct forcibly convert to islam and marry to their captor that be not merely violation of their religious freedom but an affront to their dignity and human right in sindh province alone the practice have become alarmingly common with inadequate legal protection allow perpetrator to evade justice there be something wrong with society that can let or year old or anyone who be still under the care of their parent be take away abduct and marry against their will these be people of such innocence it really disturb and unfortunately we have report that it be happen regularly in pakistan dignity first report highlight more than violent incident target christians range from mob violence to force conversion and abduction in jaranwala in punjab christian home and business be attack in what appear to be premeditated assault on their religious identity they be attack and brutalise because they be christians tragically the authority have often fail to bring perpetrator to justice christian have be subject to accusation of blasphemy that can result in torture or death at the hand of violent mob the international community must demand that pakistan take concrete step to end the violence against christians and provide legal protection for all religious minority this house believe in freedom for religious minority wherever they be in the world we therefore ask pakistan to conform to that and protect religious minority commend the organisation alliance defending freedom international which recently facilitate the rescue of saima bibi and reeha saleem two brave young woman force into such marriage their release be triumph but countless other remain trap in similar situation their cry for help go unanswered we ask the minister to do something about that want to take up the plight of the ahmadiyya muslim community in pakistan we be fortunate that the last time we be with they we be able to meet some of the imam and people at high level of the muslim faith accord to the society in pakistan the ahmadiyyas be sect of muslimism but they do not conform to everyone else therefore accord to pakistan law they be heretic if that be the right word to use and outside the mainstream there be something wrong with religious liberty if we can not accept that people have the right to choose the god they wish to worship that right should be protect declare non muslims by the state in ahmadis face systematic discrimination enshrine in law there be no freedom there under ordinance xx their religious practice such as call their place of worship mosque or refer to their faith as islam be criminalise the desecration of ahmadi mosque and graf have become almost routine the last time we be there we see picture of church mosque and gravestone that have be destroy with the graf desecrate since more than mosque and graf have be destroy or deface violent hate speech against ahmadis be openly promote with preacher incite mob to commit act of violence it be not just matter of verbally object they take it far mob violence ensue and many people be hurt just two and half month ago the september commemoration of anti ahmadi law be particularly chilling as it embolden extremist and lead to further attack on that very vulnerable community in the parachinar kurram district muslims another sect face relentless attack from extremist group include the taliban and isis affiliate organisation just this year parachinar be cut off from the rest of pakistan due to blockade result in severe shortage of medical supply food and fuel eleven life be lose because critically ill patient could not access essential care to pivot slightly we also have an obligation to address the role of the jamaat islami group in pakistan not only do it play significant role in the bangladesh liberation war but it continue to shape religious and political landscape across the region its student wing be call islami chhatra shibir the organisation have be involve in violent protest include recent clash in bangladesh over government policy found by syed abul ala maududi jamaat islami promote the idea of establish an islamic state and have be link to extremist activity through connection with group such as hamas and the muslim brotherhood the legacy of jamaat islami involvement in atrocity during the liberation of bangladesh still cast shadow over its action today both in pakistan and bangladesh we want to see peace stability and the democratic process work well but there be those who work against that in addition to the suffering of religious minority in pakistan we can not ignore the ongoing target violence against muslims in region such as parachinar locate in pakistan volatile tribal belt it have be the site of relentless sectarian violence include recent attack that leave muslims dead at the hand of extremist sunni militia and the taliban those act of violence be not isolate but part of broad pattern of persecution against the community in august conflict over land dispute escalate into deadly sectarian violence leave people dead and injure such violence be not isolate but part of broad pattern of target attack on muslims perpetuate cycle of hatred and division the situation be urgent these attack be an affront not only to basic human right but to the principle of religious tolerance and co existence let give an example whenever be in pakistan we go to the church of pakistan equivalent to the church of england and the hon member for st helens south and whiston ms rimmer who be no long here go to the roman catholic cathedral both place be surround by guard inside and out and there be metal gate on the entrance we have police guard along with member of the army the whole time we be there simply be christian or have any different religious persuasion require extra security in that area remember see the parishioner as they leave the church to make their way home when they walk out of the gate nobody be there to guard they while obviously we be be guard and be very conscious of that pay tribute to my hon friend not only for secure the debate but for his continue effort in this regard he outline litany of attack which hopefully will be deplore by all so will he join in commend group such as open doors which will publish its annual watch list in january that list itemise in good detail the type of attack criticism and human right violation that exist across the globe particularly for those persecute for their religious belief my hon friend be right to put that on the record pakistan will feature highly in the top country where persecution be rife it be one of those league that country do not want to be at the top of it be not like the premier league country do not want to be no or indeed anywhere in the top pakistan legal framework ostensibly guarantee religious freedom under its constitution yet the reality be far different it have single national curriculum and as recently as that be criticise for marginalise religious minority textbook continue to perpetrate stereotype foster intolerance among the next generation we have to be careful about what pakistan do on education we have hop that during our visit we would see some change and opportunity pakistan say it set many job aside for people from religious minority group but the fact be we do not see that there be many talented people who be christian hindu muslim ahmadiyya or of faith that do not conform with pakistan state faith and they could do the same job every bit as well minority student be force to study islamic content isolate they far in society already fraught with prejudice economic discrimination compound those challenge non muslims be often relegate to low status job with limited opportunity for social or professional mobility that systematic marginalisation keep they in cycle of poverty and vulnerability give the example of those people mostly christians who work in the brick kiln we do report on pakistan religious minority in the last session and present it to the pakistan government but we have not have any response just yet my christian brother and sister be persecute beat and abuse in every way imaginable do not want to have to imagine it their contract of employment be change in such way that they be contract to the brick kiln for not just couple of year or perhaps year they be there forever that report also highlight that the united kingdom have proud history of championing human right on the global stage as we deepen our relationship with pakistan we must use all our influence to advocate for meaningful change and urge colleague to join in call on the minister to do so be pleased to see he and the new elect shadow minister in their place and wish the shadow minister well look forward to consensus of opinion across the chamber on this issue have couple of ask for the minister more than couple it always be with but do so respectfully and in positive fashion can we advocate for blasphemy law reform by work with international ally to pressure pakistan to reform those law ensure that they can not be misuse against religious minority can we support victim of force conversion and force marriage by provide resource to non governmental organisation work on the ground to rescue and rehabilitate victim can we press the pakistan government to implement strong legal safeguard to protect vulnerable girl and woman the hon member for mid leicestershire mr bedford refer to how woman and girl be consider as second class in many case if they be christians they be doubly second class in that country will we demand equal right for the ahmadi people by advocate for the repeal of discriminatory law target the ahmadiyya community and ensure that they be grant full right as citizen of pakistan will we provide humanitarian aid to parachinar and urge the pakistan government to lift the blockade restore essential service and mediate sectarian conflict in order to prevent further bloodshed there be mediation role for our government in this country in pakistan it be more important but it do not seem to happen will we promote education reform by collaborate with the pakistan authority to develop curricula that promote inclusivity and tolerance and that foster culture of co existence my final request to the minister relate to my private member bill it will not be debate tomorrow because the focus will be on the assisted die bill my bill ask for special envoy for freedom of religion or belief to strengthen accountability and to set the precedent on the international stage that we be not for turn on human right or anybody freedom of religion or belief know the bill will be put off tomorrow probably until march because that be how the system work have ask for meeting with the prime minister and the foreign secretary and hopefully those meeting will take place suspect that have it not be for the wash up after the sudden calling of the election my previous bill would probably have become law because have positive response to question have ask in the chamber on it we hope that will be the case but again perhaps the minister could explain the way forward want to cast my mind back to when we be in pakistan in and mention the blasphemy law most people here will know the case of asia bibi she be accuse of blasphemy it be vexatious malicious vindicative and untrue allegation but none the less she be subject to the law that pervade in pakistan she fight her case and be sentence when we be in pakistan we meet two of the three judge who would make the decision be not say that we do any well than anybody else that be not why be say it but we speak about how and why the blasphemy law be use against people of different faith the minister at the time think it be mark field say do say anything about asia bibi because the two judge we meet tell we that they be of mind to set she free we understand the process do not say too much about it at home and let the process run it do and she be free she now live in canada but there be so many other asia bibis who live in pakistan and also deserve to be protect we must be clear that we stand on the side of the people of pakistan and that hate and intolerance divide and hurt people it be within our power to support stability and freedom through our influence and by be resolute in our commitment to the region we can not be idle long before come to this place former prime minister say the lady not for turn we all know who that be suggest that we use that same spirit and that we must not step back from our commitment the challenge face religious minority in pakistan be immense but not insurmountable we have the tool the influence and the moral responsibility to act by join force with international partner civil society organisation and the pakistani diaspora we can help to create pakistan where no one be persecute for their faith that be the objective of this debate that be the goal that hope we might be able to achieve let we not be silent witness to such atrocity let we stand together and be voice for the voiceless shield for the defenceless and beacon of hope for those who have know only darkness always conclude my remark in such debate with scripture text proverb say open your mouth for the mute for the right of all who be destitute open your mouth judge righteously defend the right of the poor and needy let we do just that today congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on secure the debate and thank the backbench business committee through which he secure it also congratulate he on this upgrade from westminster hall to the main chamber some argue that westminster hall should be rename the shannon debating forum will take up the hon gentleman point as be sure other will about the ahmadiyya community like other member in the chamber have an ahmadiyya community in my constituency they operate under the slogan of love for all hatred for none we see that campaign on our london bus at one point few year ago they relate to exactly what the hon gentleman describe distressing tale of what be happen to their community in pakistan as he say just describe oneself as member of the ahmadiyya community be an offence under the penal law in pakistan do so can result in three year term of imprisonment fine or even death in addition if people call their place of worship mosque or their call to prayer the adhan go out they can be prosecute under that penal code which be appal the briefing that the all party parliamentary group receive recently highlight that the situation have get significantly bad this year in the briefing we be tell that at least four people have be murder because of their religion we also have list with number of people who have be arrest and imprison for their religion in prison their situation be extremely precarious there be also worry about torture publication be ban and to be able to vote ahmadis be place on separate list in fact many of they be disenfranchise as result in the past when we have raise those matter in debate in this chamber and in westminster hall government of all political complexion have make representation at time there have be some alleviation because the world have focus its attention on pakistan behaviour but the report that we get show that recently thing have be get dramatically bad that be why we need some action from our government agree with the hon gentleman about the need to work through international agency to shine light on what be happen and make representation it be key now that we mobilise pressure as much as we can to influence the pakistani government to scrap the blasphemy law be use so ferociously against the ahmadiyya community and other let say something that might prove contentious for some think we now need to think about go beyond that there be individual in pakistan within the administration and the security force who we can now identify as lead on some of these human right abuse and wonder whether we should treat they as human right abuser as we would other from other country that would mean name and sham of course but also instigate some form of sanction against they most of those individual have relationship with this country in one form or another in fact many of they will be use their resource via investment vehicle in this country feel that we need to take strong view and strong action than we have in the past because the situation have deteriorate another issue which we have raise before be that although we provide fair amount of aid and assistance to pakistan that be fine completely understand that it be important that that aid be not abuse for example the pakistani government nationalise ahmadiyya school and have never return they to the community we fund education in pakistan so we need to be conditional about how that investment in education be make second point that might be provocative be that we must consider the funding of the organisation campaign for human right in pakistan and internationally so that we can strengthen their arm in advocate on behalf of the ahmadiyya community that be my position on the ahmadiyya community will slightly abuse the scope of the debate if may madam deputy speaker human right abuse in pakistan have worsen in this recent period not just for ahmadiyyas but for other at the moment severe repression be take place in balochistan there be history in the last year and in the recent month in particular of repression among the baloch the pakistani authority have introduce strategy of disappearance large number of people have simply disappear crudity about that be that it involve find and only way in which people who disappear be find be when their body be dump on the street in that region the form of repression take place in balochistan be produce resistance movement unfortunately some of that be armed resistance and we have see what be be classify as terrorist action so there be deterioration however there be also peace movement which be largely lead by woman they have be instigate march over the past month unfortunately they be now be arrest and the peace and human right movement in balochistan be be savagely repressed if we be take up these issue of religious freedom we should extend consideration to the whole range of human right abuse take place in pakistan would not want to see destabilisation of the country as result of reactionary government take these measure from my understanding people be on the edge they have have enough and unfortunately the response from the pakistani government do not suggest that they will reconsider their strategy of repressive measure thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure the debate and be grateful to he and other member for their excellent contribution pakistan constitution enshrine the right of every citizen to profess practice and propagate his religion and in january the minister of foreign affairs go as far as to claim pakistan have undertake wide range measure to promote religious freedom and protect minority right that be sadly and simply untrue in the face of force conversion and mob violence the pakistani government be far too often fail to fulfil their basic duty of protect their citizen even more seriously there be widespread evidence of the state actively support the discrimination of certain religious minority include muslims christians and hindus with law against blasphemy in particular be use to undermine their human right and freedom today however will focus on the ahmadi muslim community who be subject to some of the most serious discrimination be proud that many in the ahmadi muslim community live worship in my constituency which be home to morden magnificent baitul futuh mosque the large mosque in the uk and the worldwide headquarters of the faith it be from there that the caliph regular friday sermon be televise live throughout the world but while ahmadi muslims can practise in freedom in this country that be sadly not the case for those watch and listen to he in pakistan have hear from the mosque and from many of my constituent about the persecution that their community face on daily basis in pakistan in their mosque their home and their business ahmadi muslims be face persecution merely for observe their faith also have number of ahmadiyya muslims in epsom and ewell and it be really shameful that this faith group have to move its home to the uk to avoid exactly this persecution do my hon friend agree that all religious group in pakistan should have the freedom to practise their faith and that we in this house should be voice for the persecute completely agree we have an absolute duty to enforce that and make sure that happen the pakistani government be do more than just turn blind eye to this discrimination with the state actively seek to marginalise the ahmadi muslim community unless ahmadi muslims declare themselves to be non muslims they be not permit to stand for office or vote they be deny voice in the system that be mean to uphold their right it be important to note that this be not always the case for example the first foreign minister of pakistan sir chaudhry zafarullah khan be an ahmadi muslim sadly however ahmadi muslim freedom have be undermine by the pakistani government over time but that do not mean that those right can not be restore for that reason our government should be speak more loudly on this issue the uk be pakistan third large trading partner and its large in europe we be consequently not without influence disenfranchised and marginalise pakistani ahmadi muslims have very few option at their disposal it be therefore our duty to raise our voice and for the government to do what they can to help protect their right and those of other religious minority consequently echo my party leader call last year to reconsider pakistan trade preference also hope the government will work with ahmadi muslim refugee across the world and the united nations high commissioner for refugees to preserve those refugee safety as gladstone say in nonconformity supply the backbone of english liberalism the government must do what they can to continue this country proud liberal tradition protect the right of the ahmadi muslims and other religious minority in pakistan thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for organise this important debate from the many example he have give from his long time spend fight for religious freedom in pakistan and for christians around the world can see that this be something he care deeply about and it be important that we be discuss it today like the minister spend some time work in pakistan with the foreign commonwealth and development office spend three year work in islamabad and lahore from to spend lot of that time travel around punjab have responsibility for that province within the fcdo and lot of the example that the hon member for strangford give be really familiar will talk about some of those example in moment but before do so want to highlight some of the other aspect of pakistan that see there include some of the more positive one which may be example of how religious minority should be treat that we can give when we be talk to pakistan in the future in my time travel throughout punjab get to see many religious site travel through the old city of lahore there be the very impressive badshahi masjid you can travel down to derawar in bahawalpur and see fantastic fort there there be the rukn alam shrine in multan as well as the gurdwara at nankana sahib and of course there be lahore cathedral mention all those site not because want to give people tour of pakistan or indeed to promote its tourism industry although that definitely should be encourage but to highlight that all those magnificent building be from different religion pakistan have proud history of various minority throughout the age from the buddhists of the gandhara civilisation to hindus sikhs muslims of various sect ahmadis and christians there be part of the country that recognise that history spend time with each of those group be real privilege of course this be debate on freedom of religion and belief and while there be huge concern about the treatment of minority in pakistan want to give one positive example of something that have happen in recent year towards the end of my time in pakistan have the opportunity to visit the kartarpur corridor on the border between pakistan and india it be site build on the location that be use by guru nanak when he first establish the sikh community in the century for long time it be divide between india and pakistan but in narendra modi and imran khan allow access for the community to cross between their two country when visit in meet pilgrim from india who have come to pakistan to meet relative in the sikh community whom they have not see since partition nearly year before the joy on the face of those people who be enable to do that by the promise make by the pakistani government show that it be possible for the government to be more positive toward some religious minority in the three year be base in punjab there be numerous case of brutal attack on religious minority some of which the hon member for strangford mention will give three more example from the time be there in april there be mob attack in faisalabad on mariam lal and newsh arooj two christian nurse who have be ask to clean up locker in the hospital in which they be work they be set on by mob after accusation of blasphemy and they be later arrest by the police and hold in prison for some time they have now be release fortunately in december there be the lynching of priyantha kumara in sialkot priyantha be buddhist from sri lanka who be run factory as the general manager he be lynch by an angry mob after accusation of blasphemy while the police stand by and be unable to intervene in august there be the stabbing of naseer ahmed year old ahmadi grandfather who refuse to chant slogan in support of tehreek labbaik pakistan for that crime he be murder in the street by an angry pakistani man raise those three incident not because they be extraordinary but because they feel routine on weekly basis when be there would hear of bad example from the christian community the ahmadi community and other about the brutal violence and humiliation to which they be subject sumera shafique friend of mine who work for the christian lawyers association of pakistan would call regularly to update about the false conversion she be work on particularly in the south of punjab many people from the ahmadiyya community who would obviously prefer to be anonymous at the moment regularly raise with the victimisation they be face with their mosque be destroy and their school be close down as we hear from other member school have also be nationalise by the government there have even be the introduction of new marriage law mean that an ahmadiyya muslim in pakistan must renounce their faith to get marry the level of discrimination be quite outrageous be lucky to have significant ahmadiyya community in my own constituency with the baitul ghafoor mosque on long lane in halesowen it hold number of faith event and have be to many of they have be pleased to see the welcome that member provide to many people from different religious background the contrast with the way the ahmadiyya community be treat in pakistan be strike when be in lahore have many discussion with the human rights ministers of punjab khalil tahir sandhu and ramesh singh whom still count as friend know they face very difficult situation and it be very challenging to work within the system to improve the condition of religious minority many people in pakistan and in the government be try to do that but would of course encourage they to do more finally thank the hon member for strangford again for organise this debate on subject that think we should be talk about more know it be an extremely difficult subject for the fcdo to work on and understand the limitation we be work under but ask the minister to continue to raise the deteriorate situation that religious minority have face in recent year with our counterpart in pakistan also ask he to commit to include freedom of religion or belief in the discussion about the future co operation and trade agreement that we be have with pakistan and to use every opportunity across government to hold discussion to push that forward call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate the hon member for strangford jim shannon on bring forward this debate and allow we to discuss this incredibly important issue in this house on november the general assembly of the united nations pass resolution which say discrimination between human being on the ground of religion or belief constitute an affront to human dignity and disavowal of the principle of the charter of the united nations and shall be condemn as violation of the human right and fundamental freedom proclaim in the universal declaration of human rights nearly half century have pass since those word be write and they come just seven year after the passage of the second amendment to the constitution of pakistan which declare that ahmadi muslims be not muslim for the purpose of the constitution or the law my speech will concentrate on the ahmadi community but that should not diminish the persecution and discrimination suffer by other community which have be mention by many hon member many decade on we still find ourselves grapple with the critical injustice prejudice and persecution that that amendment enshrine in law and enable that be what the current legal framework in pakistan have do it have enable not just legal exclusion and prosecution but ongoing hate speech and violent persecution extremist cleric in pakistan have call for ahmadi muslims to be hang or behead for their woman to be murder to prevent more ahmadi muslims from be bear and even for the government of pakistan to understand that if they do not act the people will take matter into their own hand and kill ahmadi muslims themselves if anyone have any lingering doubt about whether that awful rhetoric extend only to call for violence within pakistan border refer they to one rally this year where the following be say we have to strangle each and every ahmadi you have no idea how powerful this slogan be you will raise it here an ahmadi will die in great britain that abhorrent rhetoric have no place in democratic republic such as pakistan and know from conversation with many of my constituent as well as ahmadi muslims across london that it absolutely terrify ahmadi muslims in pakistan and here in the uk we too often forget that rhetoric have consequence and violent rhetoric become violence as surely as night become day sure enough violent hate crime across pakistan and around the world against ahmadi

incident on the same day the alleged perpetrator year old student of madrassah confess to the killing cite religious year old invite hon member to recall the poisonous rhetoric that have just outline and to which that young man must have be expose in order to carry out such heinous act it seem that violence against ahmadi muslims be rarely investigate and in many case be seemingly encourage or

nothing early this year in january it be allege that local police in the punjab region act under instruction from local official take part themselves in another disconcertingly common and awful act of hatred the desecration of tomb in an ahmadi muslim graveyard desecration be particularly cowardly and heinous act and serve only to underscore the severity of the situation face ahmadi muslims in pakistan freedom of worship be inextricably link with freedom of expression and speech and as liberal will always place the great currency on that most cherish of virtue but as all liberal society have find freedom of speech can not extend to freedom of hate speech or the freedom to incite violence and hatred and the pakistani government ought to be remind of that fact in our bilateral engagement nobody should have to live like that and to face hatred threat violence and death just for worship their own religion in peaceful manner in democratic country it go against every principle we hold dear in the community of international law and against our every principle as an open democratic tolerant nation ourselves not least as nation that be bind to pakistan by common history common language and track record of collaboration on tackle extremism in the region we must be critical partner of pakistan call on the government to respond to the concern raise in the house today and to

do not follow or man who be target through blasphemy charge there be clearly issue that need to be address most urgently religion have provide bedrock for the pakistani people and serve as source of motivation for the betterment of society and all must be free to pursue their belief without fear while have the opportunity will commend the work of my friend friend to many in this house fiona bruce the former member for congleton whom mention early she dedicate many year of her time in this place to fight for freedom of religion or belief and against the persecution of minority who wish to

the house that his majesty government will be do the same and that an appointment to this position will be announce very soon two year ago the conservative government bring together faith and belief leader and human right activist and government delegation for the international ministerial conference on freedom of religion to agree plan to encourage and defend those fundamental inalienable right the outcome of the conference bore witness to the pledge of government international organisation and other entity to take action in support of freedom of religion or belief through the soft power of our diplomatic network the previous government be able to solidify coalition of support to protect freedom of religion or belief for all within international body and through the multilateral framework harden obligation for state to uphold their human right obligation once again sincerely hope that the government will continue the work of the conservative government in the previous parliament on separate note early this year the conservative government put on record their serious concern about the fairness and lack of inclusivity of pakistan recent election we be clear we regret that not all party be allow to contest the election and that legal process be use to prevent some political leader from participation and the use of recognisable party symbol be sure the house be also aware that restriction be impose on internet access on polling day and that there be significant delay to the reporting of result and claim of irregularity in the counting process the new labour government need to urge the authority in pakistan to uphold fundamental human right include those and many other member have touch on as well as other important freedom include free access to information the rule of law must be unflinchingly uphold to be crystal clear that include the right to fair trial which for the avoidance of doubt mean adherence to due process within an independent transparent judicial system free from interference to that end will the minister say what discussion on those issue the new government have have with the government of pakistan will he say what labour position be on the imprisonment and general treatment of former prime minister imran khan as he will know that have cause huge division within the pakistani community to conclude believe the united kingdom have be at the vanguard of defend freedom of religion and belief civil liberty and human right we urge his majesty government to continue this important work to protect all those who choose to practise their faith and who have the right and must continue to have the right to do so without fear and in freedom as the hon member for strangford say there can be no turning back in our defence of

chevening scholar the uk remain committed to media freedom and the protection of journalist we will urge the authority to ensure the safe return of all journalist also want to express my sincere condolence to all those affect by the abhorrent violence in kurram over the past week my thought be with the family of those kill and injure we hope that peaceful resolution can be reach we remain in contact with the relevant individual my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell ask about the situation in relation to the baloch in particular the protest lead by woman in balochistan be aware of report of enforce disappearance the uk strongly condemn any instance of extrajudicial killing or enforce disappearance we urge state to investigate any allegation fully to prosecute those responsible and to provide justice to victim and their family we continue to encourage progress towards the criminalisation of enforce disappearance in pakistan britain have long relationship with pakistan found on our share history and warm tie between our people we have hear some of that today like my hon friend the member for halesowen serve in pakistan in when some of the incident refer to this afternoon occur include the concern incident with asia bibi as say last week have the pleasure of visit this beautiful country meet ministers business and religious leader can reassure the house that in all my engagement raise some of these important issue we know that many minority in pakistan face injustice include structural discrimination economic exclusion and wide social intolerance share member concern about the increase misuse of pakistan blasphemy law too often these law be use to settle personal vendetta with insufficient evidence or safeguard for those accuse once an accusation be make there be high risk of vigilante violence for example in may an elderly christian man die of his injury follow an assault by large mob in punjab these abhorrent attack form part of wide pattern of discrimination and violence towards marginalised religious community frequently when accusation be make accusation that be often vexatious and malicious with no evidential basis whatsoever the police stand by and do nothing to control the mob violence could the minister perhaps take that on board when he next have discussion with the pakistani government we want pakistan police force that be independent and apply the same rule of law to everyone but it be clear that that be not currently the case raise the specific question of how policing operate in relation to religious minority with the pakistani minister for law and human rights the minister for interior and personnel from pakistan security establishment just last week let now turn to the subject of ahmadi muslims in pakistan who as many have point out this afternoon continue to receive threat from extremist group regrettably number have be murder the practice of force marriage and conversion be devastate the life of woman and girl from minority religious community we in the house should welcome small positive step such as an amendment to the christian marriage act to equalise the age of marriage between christian boy and girl in punjab but more clearly need to be do to protect the right of both muslim and religious minority girl across pakistan let now say little about what the uk be do to help this government recognise the central importance of promote more open society in pakistan we regularly engage with its government with like minded partner and with other stakeholder to raise concern and discuss way of protect marginalised community generally our assessment be that private engagement with pakistan authority be the most effective way to get our message across my recent visit be an excellent opportunity to convey those message to an array of senior ministers meet the human rights minister to discuss the importance of promote religious tolerance and harmony highlight concern about recent incident of blasphemy relate violence and the misuse of blasphemy law also raise the issue of force marriage and conversion and the minister assure that effort be under way to pass new legislation to help address it meet the minister of interior as well alongside with the british high commissioner we underline concern about threat of violence towards ahmadi muslims and stress the need for police protection again we receive assurance that the authority would work hard to protect minority community the hon member for sutton and cheam luke taylor express concern about his constituent in the uk while policing be clearly matter independent from the government this government will do everything as one would expect to ensure the freedom of religious belief and ensure that religious minority feel protect here since my visit the high commissioner have speak to the punjab minister for minority affairs about some of the incident that have be describe this afternoon she raise concern regard extremist threat make against minority group include ahmadi muslims and push for more action on force marriage and conversion to maximise the impact of our engagement we co ordinate closely with the wide international community and work alongside international organisation such as the international labour organisation in relation to the forced labour of child in brick kiln which even witness many year ago when serve in pakistan many people whose young female child have be abduct and kidnap for the purpose of marriage be probably illiterate be just be observational here and do not understand the paperwork in front of they when our deputation be in pakistan back in we suggest that legal representative should be make available to each of those people to take their case forward it be simple measure but it would be incredibly effective thank the hon member for his consideration of these issue be happy to write to he in more detail about what we be do in pakistan to try to ensure that woman and girl both from minority community and across the whole of pakistan be able to prosecute their right question about illiteracy be clearly relevant but be afraid that far wide range of issue make it hard for woman and girl across pakistan to assert their full right during my trip be pleased to visit pakistan national mosque the faisal mosque meet the grand imam dr muhammad ilyas and we discuss the importance of promote interfaith harmony and tolerance such engagement be vital part of the uk approach to freedom of religion or belief principle that must be support across all community in pakistan member have pose question about our aid programme so will briefly comment on that alongside our diplomatic engagement be glad that the uk target aid programme be help to protect human right and boost inclusion for example our million accountability and inclusion programme help to change social behaviour and promote interfaith harmony by encourage dialogue between influential community leader follow the sargodha attack in may the programme prevent further violence by help to engage with the police to identify tension and resolve community dispute at the local level we also raise awareness about the harm of early enforce marriage and have reach over million people with our messaging to date note the comment from my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington about aid conditionality we try to ensure that our aid be closely target where there be concern we raise they diplomatically and our aid programme be an important

policy on child bond labour include form system to protect child we have also help set up eight child court across pakistan to provide justice for victim of child abuse child trafficking and child marriage as these example show we be determined to ensure that aid reach those who need it most let turn to the point make about the special envoy understand that minister be consider the role and we should be in position to update the house soon pay tribute to the previous envoy as hope the house can see this government will remain focused on these issue in pakistan and elsewhere with or without an envoy this government place freedom of religion or belief at the heart of our work in pakistan and it be major part of my visit last week pakistan must be open and tolerant and we will continue to work with its government and all key stakeholder include this house towards that end thank right hon and hon member for their speech and intervention which be much appreciated we have hear about the barbaric attack on christians in jaranwala province the relentless persecution of the ahmadis the genocidal violence against muslims in parachinar and the oppression of the baloch people to which the

power to influence change to hold the pakistani government accountable and to stand in solidarity with the oppressed let we remember that the fight for religious freedom justice and peace be not optional it be duty with that in mind thank the shadow minister for his contribution and particularly thank the minister know that he have deep interest in these issue as have have discussion with he

condemnation both in pakistan and far afield petition no bus service in south gloucestershire this cross boundary service enable people in wotton under edge who do not have vehicle to travel south to

motion make and question propose that this house do now smith draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be serve councillor in leicestershire be grateful for this opportunity to raise the challenge pose by cross boundary planning application and thank barrie gannon markfield parish councillor who have campaign for change in this area my constituency be unique in many way but most pertinently to this debate it be unique because it straddle three council boundary blaby district council charnwood borough council and hinckley and bosworth borough council generally these council work constructively alongside each other and with leicestershire county council however one area of tension surround development collaboration on local plan and housing allocation within each council area it be clear to and to many of my constituent that some of the council be purposefully grant application on the edge of their boundary which have disproportionate impact on the neighbouring council in essence they be take all of the benefit but none of the negative have secure the debate not because be nimby but because want to see more collaborative approach from local planning authority as conservative mp fully support the notion of property own democracy particularly for those from the next generation who find it increasingly difficult to get on the property ladder however the free for all approach offer by the current system be harm many of the beautiful village in my mid leicestershire constituency how can it be fair that borough district and parish council be able to democratically pass local plan but adjacent borough can undermine they by allow development on the edge of their boundary have see many such example in mid leicestershire in markfield the challenge pose by cross boundary planning application have be raise with many time by councillors claire harris and deborah taylor and local activist dave hyde who lobby regularly on the frustration of cross boundary anomaly commend the hon gentleman for secure the debate one of the issue that clearly arise from what he refer to be the impact of development on gps education road and leisure structure in adjoining constituency or council area house may be build in one area but people in other area will be affect do he agree with many hon member that there need to be co ordinate plan perhaps at high level that bring future proposal together so that when house be build in one area associated infrastructure be spread across all affected area the hon gentleman be absolutely right will go on to address some of those point particularly in relation to the use of infrastructure markfield village sit in the local planning area of hinckley and bosworth borough council but under the current framework markfield parish council and hinckley and bosworth borough council have very little say or influence over such decision as they be make in the adjacent charnwood borough it be obvious that the new markfield resident will use service in hinckley and bosworth markfield and the surround area but those area will see very little benefit because those benefit will go to other village bad of all such development be go ahead without constructive or bind input from the local parish council or the adjacent borough council another example be in glenfield village in my constituency which sit in blaby district council adjacent to leicester city council steve walters who head local action group have raise the issue that the city council plan to build several hundred home on the edge of glenfield village but because the village do not sit within the city council boundary it will see all the detriment of that development but have very little input in the decision make process indeed steve have campaign many time against the urban sprawl of the city affect village such as glenfield he be work constructively with and local councillor to try to get progress on the issue in my constituency of horsham we be almost entirely surround by other area that for one reason or another have constrain housing target they have area of outstanding natural beauty be in national park or be already build up as result under the duty to co operate horsham have to take very unfair proportion of housing to serve the whole area do the hon gentleman agree that the duty to co operate system need to be revise to stop freak result happen in constituency such as mine absolutely agree with the hon gentleman he give an example in his constituency but have see the same in leicestershire and from speak to other hon member know there be similar example in other constituency so where be we head we have government that be steadfast in their plan to concrete over our green and pleasant land especially in rural constituency such as mine in july the secretary of state for housing communities and local government say that she believe the national planning policy framework offer extra stability to local authority be that really the case the government approach be to alleviate the pressure on housing in uk city and force additional housing on rural area without provide sufficient support to the community that will impact that be see by the government plan to reduce housing target for city by an incredible in the nppf in the village of ratby in my constituency predatory developer such as lagan homes be take advantage of the current situation forge ahead with proposal to bulldoze over the burroughs despite staggering household in that village write to the borough council to oppose that ecological vandalism be sure leicester city council be jump for joy at the news that it would have to build few home by but that mean rural area such as mine and my resident would have to see additional housing as it be push far and far out in truth the reduction be why the decision to build house on the edge of glenfield leave such sour taste in the mouth of local resident particularly in glenfield and blaby district what do it look like in context the city council have be ask to produce few house whereas rural area such as blaby and hinckley and bosworth have be ask to dramatically increase their target by and respectively unfortunately the planning reform do not really take into account the cross boundary implication so what should we do instead the government should foster co operative relationship from the top down our local authority should be encourage to work alongside one another to prevent situation such as those have describe that can be do by allow adjacent borough and district council to have say in housing development policy through their various local plan particularly where that will have an impact on the neighbouring authority there should also be an ability for resident in adjacent borough to view and comment on plan in other local planning authority area furthermore the increase arbitrary housing target for each borough council area simply do not take into consideration the impact of the adjacent target there be surely well method for develop sustainable housing county wide rather than local authority park house next to their own front lawn finally and probably most importantly under the current regime there be no requirement for financial compensation for local authority that be adversely impact no thought be give to that section agreement and community infrastructure levy contribution be pay by developer to local authority to mitigate the impact of specific development they be well intend negotiate agreement that force developer to give something back to the community whether that be fund for infrastructure improvement or green space however they fall short in cross boundary consideration as we have see in the example have give from markfield and glenfield charnwood borough council have make it explicitly clear that the section money for the development along the boundary of hinckley and bosworth would go to its own borough how can spend all those allocation for development on the edge of markfield to the benefit of loughborough and barrow be in the interest of markfield resident who sit in different borough that undermine local buy in to the planning process instead there should be more practical approach whereby section agreement go to the authority where the service be actually be use another anomaly of cross boundary development be the distribution of council tax precept with the new resident in markfield for example pay into charnwood borough council rather than their own be not nimby call this debate to raise the issue pose by cross boundary planning application believe there should be collaborative holistic approach as mention by other hon member encourage the government to listen to the debate and consider bring about the change and proposal that have outline start by congratulate the hon member for mid leicestershire mr bedford on secure this debate on an important but often overlook issue have know he for many year before we take up our new role can say with authority that his constituent will be well serve in this house particularly because they like mine be represent here by one of their local councillor too want to draw attention to the register of members financial interests which include my ongoing unpaid role as district councillor for my home village of norton canes as councillor we know that cross border development can cause various complication which be sure be seldom consider when development be bring forward we all know that council boundary do not always reflect local community and that be inevitable to some extent with boundary go down the middle of main road for example it be not particularly logical or necessary however to have housing estate or even individual home divide between different council area be bit of local government nerd so could give many example from close to where live and across my region but will spare the house that and focus on my constituency on the north east edge of cannock chase we have small estate nonsensically split between brereton and ravenhill in my constituency and armitage with handsacre in the constituency of my hon friend the member for lichfield dave robertson this be reflect in council boundary as well so there be clearly an impact on our local service however far big cross border development be fast approach in the form of the redevelopment of the huge former rugeley power station site when it be mw power station nobody particularly know or minded where the boundary be my predecessor and the former member for lichfield would often joke about which of the cool tower be in each of their patch but once home around of which will be in cannock chase have be build this could become major issue rugeley already have several development on its fringe which be outside our boundary include the hawkesyard estate and hathorn grove the vast majority of those new resident feel that they live in rugeley and go into rugeley for various service yet their low tier local authority council tax go to lichfield district council this mean that any service that draw on district council resource be strain by an inconsistent council tax base the same be true of parish and town council service this be not just about service that resident go out to use but about the service that come to they at home bin collection for example we also know that nhs commissioning decision for example on special educational need and disability provision be sometimes do on district by district basis the chronic lack of general practice capacity in rugeley and brereton will be major issue for the new power station development unless our integrate care board act quickly there can sometimes be democratic deficit as resident in those cross border development be split between different council area and different parliamentary constituency know who to contact about various local issue can be challenge enough as it be without estate be bisect by boundary that make no sense sometimes those boundary be tidy up through ward or constituency boundary review but we know that the process of change council boundary can happen only at the request of both council clearly there be no incentive for the council that benefit from council tax payer who do not tend to use its service to consent to principal area boundary review as the hon member for mid leicestershire say those council have all the benefit and none of the drawback that process can also be cumbersome so it rarely happen even when small move in boundary would be the logical thing to do give that our constituency boundary be often base on council boundary such discrepancy be often not correct for westminster election either do not come here with any oven ready solution although it do strike that in other country canada for example local authority can with appropriate oversight annex territory from other to prevent these cross border challenge and inefficiency from arise hope that the government will consider how we can well address these challenge any solution that we can come to will certainly greatly benefit community identity and local service have not have the chance to do so personally may begin by welcome the hon member for mid leicestershire mr bedford to his place think it be fair to say that the important issue of cross boundary planning co operation have receive far too little attention in this place over recent year and therefore very much welcome the hon gentleman give the house an opportunity to consider it in some detail also appreciate the clarity with which he set out his position on the matter he will know that the eight leicestershire authority be at different stage of plan preparation have delay due to further work address leicester city unmet need owe to the secretary of state quasi judicial role in the planning system be unable to comment on the detail of specific local plan or specific local application but the point that the hon gentleman have make be on the record and would expect he to make written representation to the department in the appropriate way on some of the specific concern that he have raise as the hon gentleman know the nine local authority in leicester and leicestershire voluntarily come together to collaborate on the publication of non statutory strategic growth plan in that plan provide high level vision for the sub region up to set out its housing and economic development need and focus growth on key strategic area key to secure cross party political support for voluntary collaboration along those line have be the commendable desire to address the negative impact of ad hoc speculative development and to stimulate infrastructure investment to support growth but equally vital have be shared understanding of the obvious functional geography of sub region with city at its heart strong pre exist relationship at member and officer level and clear governance structure that be independent of any one authority while the partnership arrangement in leicestershire take not insignificant amount of time to establish and to the good of my understanding nearly collapse several time they aptly demonstrate that local planning authority can and already do work together informally to deal with cross boundary and cumulative matter notwithstanding the concern that the hon gentleman raise leicestershire be rare example of relatively successful cross boundary co operation in planning system whose incentive structure be not gear towards facilitate it the government have inherit planning system in which outside london some metro mayor have spatial planning power while other have only the power to prepare non statutory plan lack of effective lever whether that be governance arrangement that require unanimity or an inability to set the strategic direction for where new affordable housing should be deliver prevent mayor who do have spatial planning power from realise the full potential of those power in the rest of the country there be duty to co operate as the hon member for horsham john milne mention the requirement provide minimum standard for cross border strategic planning but by common consensus have not prove to an effective mechanism for foster the kind of deep strategic co operation that enable area to meet their cross border challenge and unmet local need to be share with adjacent authority the levelling up and regeneration act include provision that enable local authority to come together to produce joint spatial development strategy but as that be entirely discretionary and the current incentive be weak there be no evidence that score of area eagerly await the opportunity to take that particular approach the result be planning system that currently lack any effective mechanism for cross boundary strategic planning that have not always be the case indeed plan for housing growth and infrastructure at large than local scale have be integral to the functioning of england planning system for most of the past half century whether through county structure plan regional planning guidance or the comprehensive system of regional strategic planning introduce by the last labour government include regional spatial strategy the period since that architecture be abolish by the coalition government in have be something of an aberration with the duty to co operate ostensibly facilitate necessary strategic cross boundary planning but in practice fail to do so in any meaningful way the result have be large part of england where no strategic planning activity take place number of notable local plan failure increase delay in local plan production grow public antagonism towards the planning system and yawn gap between the amount of development that the country need and what be actually be build the government be commit to bring that sub optimal situation to an end by first in the short term strengthen the exist national planning policy framework requirement on effective co operation and then introduce effective new mechanism for cross boundary strategic planning through legislation with view to implement universal system of strategic planning in this parliament let make it clear that we do not intend to return to the regional planning regime rather we will look at how we can ensure that effective cross boundary co operation the kind that take it the hon member for mid leicestershire want to see in his constituency be take place at sub regional level while it be still too early to be definitive about the precise model the government be attract to the spatial development strategy which be well establish in london with the london plan have be produce and continually review over year period by successive london mayors whatever model be ultimately select it be important to note that strategic plan be not big local plan nor should the forthcoming introduction of statutory strategic planning arrangement be take by local planning authority as reason not to progress the development of their local plan local plan be the good way for community to shape future development in their area the government be determined to progress toward our ambition of universal local plan coverage and we intend to drive local plan to adoption as quickly as possible in all area strategic sub regional plan will guide development for the local planning authority in the area and local plan will need to be in general conformity with they we will expect local plan to be update or develop alongside the strategic planning process and we envisage that that process be where those large than local level question and negotiation about large scale housing growth will be determine give that the hon gentleman constituency span three local authority know he will take an active interest in the government plan local authority in leicester and leicestershire have show what can be achieve through the voluntary production of non statutory strategic growth plan note that they have be work effectively on their local plan include various local authority meet unmet need from leicester city however the experience of the partnership arrangement be in place in the county also highlight the risk and limitation of voluntarism hope the intention to require statutory strategic planning arrangement to be put in place across england will be welcome by the authority that lie within the boundary of mid leicestershire as means of more quickly and effectively resolve cross boundary and cumulative issue of the kind the hon gentleman have draw attention to on that note look forward to further discussion with he and other hon member as the government take forward their plan in this area question put and agree to house adjourn
