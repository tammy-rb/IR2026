support more disabled people into work and unlock all that potential that we know exist in the government set the goal of see million more disabled people in employment between and be proud to say that by the first quarter of the number of disabled people in employment have increase by million which mean that the goal be meet after only five year by the first quarter of disability employment have rise by million in total since the goal be announce but we be aware that this progress have not be even those early success must be catalyst for further change we know that most learning disabled people want to have job and evidence show that they bring many positive benefit to their employer that be something hear time and again as go round the country meet employer and meeting disabled people experience the benefit of work but we also know that less than three in working age people with severe and specific learning disability be currently in employment that mean that more than seven in of this group be still unable to access the independence and sense of fulfilment that employment can bring and that many employer be not benefit from the enthusiasm skill and commitment that they can bring to their workplace we be therefore work hard in government as an enabler and with other to support disabled people to secure sustain and succeed in employment we be continue to improve the general support available to learning disabled claimant when they attend the jobcentre additional work coach support provide disabled people and those with health condition with increase one to one

help inactive disabled people people with health condition and those face additional barrier to employment into sustained work do more of what we know succeed in secure meaningful outcome for people one of the aspect of the coverage of this issue that frustrate the most be the failure to recognise that it be as important to focus on retention as it be to focus on job start and that both must be see in tandem that be precisely what universal support will help we to do eligible learning disabled people will be able to opt into receive up to month of place and train support help they to move quickly into suitable work follow by wraparound support to help they to sustain that employment in the long term be pleased to confirm that follow the announcement in the late autumn statement we be expand the universal support scheme to enable it to provide support for people year once it have be fully roll out an increase on the place year announce in the spring budget we know that many learning disabled people will require workplace adjustment to secure and retain employment and the access to work scheme can undoubtedly help with the extra cost of work beyond those involve in standard workplace adjustment access to work contribute to the disability relate extra cost of work face by disabled people and those with health condition in the workplace that be beyond the cost of standard reasonable adjustment and include the provision of support worker specialist aid and equipment and help with travel to and from work as part of the scheme we be test an adjustment passport in

employment we be also test access to work plus new employer offer that can offer additional support to employer who be willing to think differently about their vacancy and consider whether they can adapt shape or flex job to enable disabled person to retain return to or move into employment that be relevant to my hon friend point about the key support that need to be available to aid people
