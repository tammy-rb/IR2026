amend the misuse of drugs act this afternoon that year old piece of legislation control the shape of scotland criminal justice system to punish drug addiction with the full force of the law rather than treat user in health setting as addict with health condition what conversation have the minister have with cabinet colleague in the scottish government on introduce safe drug consumption room pilot in glasgow be not sure base on recent report that that particular pilot be work well will happily ask colleague to see whether that pilot be work as the hon gentleman say it be but that be not what the newspaper be report the uk government response to it be something for the inter ministerial group which be meet this afternoon be bit confused by the minister response there currently be no pilot in glasgow but perhaps there have be some positive discussion between the scottish government and the government here give that there be drug consumption room in more than city across the world support by mountain of evidence from ngos civil society group and drug activist alongside the lord advocate new policy not to prosecute drug user for possession offence commit within pilot safe drug consumption facility can the minister give an iron clothe commitment that the government will not block this life save health measure how that legislation be deal with be matter for other colleague but can reassure the hon gentleman that if treat drug taking as health issue be work as he suggest it be we will learn from that and discuss it with our colleague in the nhs the broad principle of it be health issue be be deal with by the nhs and the health secretary in term of legislation that be matter for cabinet colleague prison estate what recent assessment he have make of the adequacy of the prison estate for housing prisoner we be build modern prison place to help rehabilitate prisoner cut crime and protect the public and we continue to invest in prison maintenance so that exist place remain in use and safe the minister answer be very interesting because let face it our prison have be run down for year many be so old that they be build before raac reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete be even twinkle in somebody bank account if we read the inspection report as have it be list of woe they be draughty damp infest terribly overcrowded and woefully understaffed hardly likely to enable rehabilitation it be our community that endure the consequence with at least of prison leaver reoffende within month it be simply not good enough be it we continue to upgrade the prison estate as say we be invest in new place the big expansion in the secure estate since the victorian era at the same time we have be take out some of our most overcrowded and unsuitable prison in the last financial year we take out place and we be invest million in custodial maintenance for and the hon lady mention reoffende there be no good level of reoffende but zero but be pleased to be able to report good progress on reoffende which have be come down as result of more ex offender get into employment few of they be homeless and more be able to get suitable good treatment for addiction call the chair of the justice committee the justice committee be propose to hold an inquiry into future prison population and estate capacity and look forward to the minister give evidence to we about that he will know that that be prompt in part by concern that overall overcrowding in the adult male estate be some and it be much bad in many of the old local prison while he be right to draw attention to the government new prison building programme even if that be all complete on time there would accord to figure we have see be shortfall in march of about place as against anticipated demand what be go to be do to deal with that should we have proper conversation with the public about what be reasonable expectation of what can be do in prison what be the good use of prison and who should be there on my hon friend last point of course we must constantly be have an intelligent constructive public debate about these matter on the question of capacity projection change and there be many complex factor at play look forward as ever to be scrutinise by his committee on that point it be important to note that crowd double up in cell have for very long time be feature of our prison system crowd overall be few than it be when we come into government in foreign national offenders what step he be take with cabinet colleague to reduce the number of foreign national offender in the prison system between january and december we remove foreign national offender from the country as my hon friend rightly suggest that be all about close work with colleague include in the home office we have all see the story of convict foreign criminal be pull off plane at the last minute the nationality and borders act be bring in to improve the process of return criminal to speed up that process and increase the window for removal of foreign national offender from prison under the early removal scheme could my right hon friend comment on how that scheme be work how he expect it to affect the number and how he expect the process to be speed up as my hon friend mention under the nationality and borders act we expand the fno early removal scheme window from nine month to month allow for early removal we be work closely with the home office on that in may we also agree landmark new deal with albania and we be work to negotiate new prisoner transfer agreement with eu member state and other country thank the minister very much for that response it have be report that the proportion of northern ireland total jail population who hail from outside the united kingdom and ireland be disproportionately high the figure indicate that it be between and per year have the minister have an opportunity to assess that with the department of justice back home as the hon gentleman know give the way we be organise we do not cover the northern ireland prison service however it be very important that we stay in close touch and although have not have that specific conversation recently with colleague in northern ireland there will no doubt be opportunity in the future read gaol what progress he have make on the sale of reading gaol the sale of reading prison be proceed and bar any unexpected complication completion be expect later this autumn thank the minister for his answer and for meet and the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma recently to discuss this matter read gaol be hugely important historic building and nearly people across berkshire have now sign petition ask the government to work with and the local art community to turn the gaol into an art hub it have take the government long time to discuss the propose sale with their preferred bidder and no progress or slow progress appear to be be make will the minister now reconsider the government approach and work with read borough council and the local art community to save this wonderful building the sale be progress of course any propose development would be subject to approval from read borough council planning department and the usual due diligence requirement and so on will apply we quite often throw around the term doughty campaigner in this chamber but can certainly say that the hon gentleman and my right hon friend the member for reading west sir alok sharma his neighbour have be incredibly assiduous in their attention to this matter on behalf of their constituent in turn commit to he that we will absolutely stay in touch sentencing offender attendance what step his department be take to help ensure that offender attend their sentencing it be right that those convict of crime face up to its consequence by be in court when they be sentence on august the lord chancellor announce his intention to legislate as soon as parliamentary time allow to enable judge to order an offender to attend court for sentencing make it clear in legislation that reasonable force can be use to compel attendance and that refusal to comply with judge order will cause the offender to face up to two year in custody in colin ash smith be convict of murder year old claire tiltman in my constituency of dartford his final insult to she be to refuse to attend the sentencing hearing so welcome the propose change to compel defendant to face up to the consequence of their action however can the minister confirm that there will be an opportunity for judge to hear representation from the prosecution defence and security staff before such action be take be grateful to my hon friend and hope he will allow this opportunity to express my sympathy to the friend and family of claire tiltman who live in his constituency and in be tragically murder be glad to see her murderer bring to justice after so many year colin ash smith like lucy letby be cowardly for not attend the sentencing hearing to face up to his appalling crime each case be different so it be important that the court and the judge have discretion in how to make an attendance order and in reach that decision although we be work through the detail we would expect the court to consider the full circumstance of each individual case include any representation make by the prosecution or the defence in that context if we want offender to attend their sentencing it do rather help if the court be open harrow crown court be close two and half week ago because of the discovery of crumble concrete raac with no indication as yet of any timescale for it to be reopen its closure will inevitably exacerbate the backlog of criminal case in the london area and prevent victim of crime from see justice could the minister provide quickly an update on the progress at get harrow crown court modernise fully repair and open again be grateful to the hon gentleman particularly for the dexterity with which he get harrow crown court in he be right to highlight that case understand that remedial work be under way and that case list there have be transfer to other london court to ensure they still continue to be hear understand from the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for finchley and golders green mike freer that the indicative timescale to complete the work be six to nine month welcome the shadow minister kevin brennan it will be quieter on the back benches but no doubt he will make up for it on the front bench thank you mr speaker suspect the minister might anticipate what be go to ask he because be begin to think the department should be rename the department for justice delay labour propose that we change the law on attend sentence back in and just last month the leader of the opposition say that we be prepared to amend the relevant legislation if there be no action so why be it take so long for the government to intervene on behalf of victim and their family be grateful to the hon gentleman and may take the opportunity to welcome he to his place suspect there will occasionally be to and fro across this chamber but hope there will also be opportunity where we be in agreement to work constructively together we have be clear on our intention to bring forward appropriate legislation to reinforce the exist power the judiciary have in this respect but it be important that we get this right and that it build in that degree of judicial discretion because there may be some circumstance where victim would not wish to see the offender in court for sentencing because it would be deeply distressing or deeply disruptive so it be important that we get this right we be determined to do that but we will work through the detail to make sure it be robust and effective prison staff vacancies england and wales how many staff vacancy there be in prison in england and wales we have recently see indication of an improve national staffing picture in prison with an increase of full time equivalent band to prison officer and youth justice worker in the year to june be grateful to my right hon friend for that answer but the damn report into hmp woodhill just adjacent to my constituency be clear that staff shortage be huge factor in the serious issue that prison face it be equally well know that hmp spring hill and hmp grendon in my constituency have face recruitment challenge in that light if we can not staff the prison that we do have surely it be unworkable to carry on with my right hon friend totally unwanted plan to build new mega prison in my constituency and that planning appeal should be withdraw be grateful to my hon friend who take close interest in these matter and rightly so particularly on behalf of his constituent who be prison officer and other staff in and around his constituency can assure he we be work urgently to address the finding and the urgent notification at woodhill think we will come on to that little later in question from hon friend the lord chancellor will as ever be publish an action plan by the end of the month we also have active recruitment campaign in place for grendon and spring hill and be seek to increase number by incentivise recruitment magistrates courts what recent assessment he have make of condition at magistrate court recognise that there continue to be work to be do to improve condition in some magistrate court for the user and that be why we have boost the capital investment programme to million over the next two year to march to improve the quality and enhance the resilience of the court and tribunal estate allow we to plan major project much more in advance and with certainty the improvement will ensure that those on the frontline of the justice system will benefit from building that be more accessible and sustainable we speak of access to justice mean the availability of legal advice and representation but for too many old and disabled people physical access to justice through the magistrate court in particular be well nigh impossible because the building themselves be not fit for purpose actually not fit for purpose be the term use to describe the magistrate court in the secretary of state constituency by the former police and crime commissioner do we not need more swift action to remedy the problem than the minister have outline take quite bit of time to read the report from the magistrates association on inaccessible court to ensure that where we can make reasonable adjustment we make they and that where we need to make more substantial investment to make the court more accessible particularly to make they compliant with the disability discrimination act we do so and those work be prioritise we continue to work on new court as in blackpool and the city of london to ensure that the estate be modernise and we have court that be accessible and fit for purpose the point be well make and it be in hand magistrate train what training be provide to magistrate to help ensure impartial decision making to preserve the independence of the judiciary the lord chief justice have statutory responsibility for the training of the judiciary under the constitutional reform act and that include magistrate and their legal adviser magistrate and the legal adviser who support they in court must complete induction training before hear case and once magistrate be sit continuation training be provide on regular cycle impartial decision making be weave throughout all the material thank the minister for his answer chris pincher and have be work very closely to ensure that the police act strongly and swiftly in shenstone near lichfield over constant demonstration at an israeli company that supply arm to the british armed force two people go to trial at magistrate court in walsall and they be acquit it be report we do not know for sure because it be not court of record that the judge say on the principle of proportionality their action be proportionate in comparison to the crime against humanity which they be act to stop by the israelis think that if it be true be outrageous what can be do within the judicial system to ensure that that sort of thing do not happen if indeed it do my hon friend raise an important point about the independence of the judiciary we have to be careful that we do not rely on report by third party perhaps with vested interest because these case be not report officially however if he wish to discuss any point of law that may lead to an appeal from the prosecute authority he can do so and be happy to work with he and guide he on how that may be take up with the attorney general in term of any complaint about the behaviour of the judiciary there be clearly define process that be happy to discuss with my hon friend after today session probation service what step he be take to increase recruitment to the probation service at june just over people be work in the probation service an increase of just over or compare with june the previous year thank my right hon friend for his answer two horrific case those of jordan mcsweeney and damien bendall show how vital it be to have effective supervision of recently release offender what lesson have be learn from those two case and will the minister provide an update on the action be take to address problem in the probation service cause by high vacancy rate and consequentially unmanageably large case load for probation staff be grateful to my right hon friend and again express my sincere condolence to the family of zara aleena terri harris connie gent and john and lacey bennett we have increase probation staff in the london area by over the last year and that include trainee probation officer in post the service have accept all the chief inspector recommendation in respect of the two appalling case that my right hon friend mention and it be implement robust action plan especially with regard to improve risk assessment female offender short sentences whether he have hold recent discussion with the welsh government on develop community base alternative to imprisonment for female offender serve short sentence minister engage regularly with colleague in the welsh government include discussion on female offender and alternative to custody both government work closely on deliver the women justice blueprint for wales on female offending short sentence for woman often do more harm than good reinforce trauma and lead to far reoffende in two third of sentence for immediate custody for woman be for less than month it be anticipate that more woman will be in prison by how do the secretary of state justify the grow female prison population and the use of short sentence give wales ambition to divert as many woman as possible away from prison the woman population in prison have come down and sentencing be matter for the judiciary and not something in which the government intervene it be important that suitable alternative to custody be available and join the right hon lady in pay tribute to the people run woman centre for example which do fantastic job specifically for woman as well as to the broad set of alternative and community sentence option it be important that we make sure we continue to work on those include work together with the welsh government topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility have be ask to reply on behalf of the lord chancellor who have be in riga attend council of europe meeting where political declaration be sign on support for the ukrainian justice system he be sorry not to be here for these oral question and he have ask to convey to the house his thank to the metropolitan police for their quick work in find and return daniel khalife to custody the independent investigation that the lord chancellor commission must now get to the bottom of this serious breach since the last oral question the government have also announce that we will make whole life order the expectation in sentencing where they can be apply we have also outline plan to order the bad offender to attend court for their sentencing hearing we want to ensure that the bad offender receive their sentence in the full glare of the courtroom and that victim have the opportunity to set out the impact the crime have have on they with government spending for housing legal aid fall in the past decade from million to million and the spending for disrepair case fall from nearly million to just over million it be not moment too soon that the government have begin to restore some legal aid with the housing loss prevention advice service due to the government disastrous legal aid sentencing and punishment of offenders act many housing legal aid provider shut up shop leave of the population of england and wales without single provider in their local authority area and with no access to welfare legal aid what recent analysis have the minister make of legal aid desert and what step be he take to remedy the situation we be put more money into legal aid and criminal legal aid follow the independent review specifically on housing which the hon lady mention we be inject an additional million from august what conversation have my right hon friend have across government to make sure that the sentencing for those convict of dangerous cycling be equalise with the sentencing guideline for those convict of dangerous driving be grateful to my right hon friend who know take keen interest in this issue the safety of our road be key objective for the government and protect all road user be priority like all road user cyclist have duty to behave in safe and responsible manner while law be in place for cyclist they be old and it can be difficult to successfully prosecute offence that be why department for transport colleague be consider bring forward legislation to introduce new offence concern dangerous cycling to tackle those rare instance where victim have be kill or seriously injure by irresponsible cycling behaviour welcome the new shadow secretary of state to her post thank the minister for the update about daniel khalife but the fact remain that hmp wandsworth have be know problem for the good part of decade with litany of failure include overcrowding staffing and security issue khalife be not even the first escape from wandsworth there be an incident in which the chief inspector of prison say be the result of serious security breach why after so many warning about wandsworth have the government fail to act we take these matter extremely seriously the independent investigation will of course look at the question the hon lady raise specifically about the incident to ensure that lesson be learn if we look at the independent review of progress from his majesty inspectorate we see that progress have be make in wandsworth particularly on staffing which know have rightly be matter of considerable public interest there have be an increase of some in staffing specifically at wandsworth since year of warning and year of inaction be afraid that rather sum the government up on sunday the justice secretary tell we that prisoner have be move from wandsworth claim that that be out of an abundance of caution will the minister tell we how many other prisoner will have to be move across the whole prison estate as result of this escape what the public want to see be not an abundance of caution after the fact of an escape but an abundance of certainty that the prison estate be secure be it it be the hon lady would not expect to get into running commentary on transfer arrangement when we be talk about security want to reassure she the house and the public that escape from prison be very rare and much rarer now than they use to be the number of escape from prison in the last year since be considerably low than it be in the year before to encourage active travel people need to feel confident use our road yet the court can impose only the same penalty on multiple offender as on first timer will my right hon friend consider the introduction of escalate penalty for repeat traffic offence my hon friend be right to highlight the issue of traffic offence as part of the police crime sentencing and courts act there be an increase in the minimum disqualification period for the serious offence of cause death by careless driving when under the influence of drink or drug from two year to five year and an increase from three to six year if there be repeat offence within three year the department for transport be also currently consider broad call for evidence on motor offence hope that the very recent report from the all party parliamentary group for cycling and walking will be useful to it in that respect will ensure that colleague at the dft be aware of her interest in this issue as the absurdity of terrorist offender in low category prison play out be it not time to free up space by remove julian assange from belmarsh maximum security facility where he have languish since april guilty only of minor bail breach when his real offence be expose war crime regardless of his place of incarceration will the minister ensure that he be able to attend proceeding in person which he have be deny since january give all the comment about people be at court think the hon gentleman have achieve his objective to get something on the record will not comment on ongoing case but speak more generally access to justice be at the heart of what we do have constituent who suffer life change injury as result of an assault eight year ago she be not on her own on that basis but she be award only from compensation order during the criminal case and offer from the criminal injuries compensation authority will the minister look at amend the victims and prisoners bill so that victim can be give adequate care compensation from offender and support through the court and importantly through the cica be grateful to my right hon friend who throughout her time in the house and particularly while home secretary have always take keen interest in support victim of crime it be vital that victim get the compensation they be entitle to be that from the offender or the criminal injury compensation scheme which pay out more than million in the making of compensation order be matter for the court and there be no limit on the amount that court can order an offender to pay in respect of the criminal injury compensation scheme his majesty government be consult on change follow the report of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse alongside previous consultation it be important that that can be consider fully but that will be post passage of the victims and prisoners bill one of my constituent tell that they be at risk of lose their home because of how long they have have to wait for benefit decision appeal will the minister outline what step his department be take to reduce the current week waiting time for benefit decision appeal to be hear across the whole tribunal process the team will constantly monitor who be perform and who be not and will share good practice if the hon lady would like to write to with the detail of particular case can investigate the particular cause of delay parliament pass law in that offender convict of second or subsequent knife offence should go to prison yet in the year to march such of the total dodge jail sentence altogether that be the high total since the law be introduce will ministers ensure that the court now hand down the sentence legislate for in this house eight year ago my hon friend be right to highlight the scourge of knife crime and the need for tough sentence although sentence in an individual case be matter for our independent judiciary which be able to consider the specific circumstance of individual case in legislate on this issue parliament be clear about its seriousness that be reflect in average sentence for all type of knife crime which be up from month in to month in in addition of those commit repeat offence be give custodial sentence include suspend sentence which be custodial sentence have number of constituent whose asylum appeal be allow by court and tribunal service but have now be thrust into limbo while the case go back to the home office for approval what conversation have ministers have with their home office colleague on clear the backlog that be prevent my constituent from get on with their life be always happy to look at individual case to see if there be specific issue cause delay broadly speak work with colleague at the home office and the solicitor general office to see what we can do to ensure that any delay in the process be smooth out so that people do not have to wait for their day in court what review if any have the department carry out to ensure that when court extend bail they ensure that the police be deal with their investigation diligently and expeditiously my hon friend raise an important point for her constituent must stress that the independence of the judiciary be fundamental to the rule of law and the running of the justice system therefore the department have not and will not conduct review into how the judiciary undertake its function in individual case however can reassure she that the judiciary ensure that the relevant agency that it work with undertake their function smoothly and effectively be it not the case that last minute cancellation in magistrate court be largely cause by the inability to recruit and retain legal adviser who be pay lot less than other government legal adviser what step will the minister take to ensure an increase in wage and well term and condition for those legal adviser will he sit down with the pcs union to try to resolve this intolerable situation we look carefully at why all case be vacate in fact the big cause of vacation be often the non availability of prosecution or defence counsel not of legal executive may put it to ministers that the nine month wait for grant simple probate be unfair on people try to sell their parent home fail to get the probate service to work and have constituent who have write to the prime minister will minister please sort it out the time take once all require document be receive be between six and nine week we always advise that no one should take decision on the sale of property until probate be grant but can reassure my hon friend that despite significant increase in application the service be recruit and train up more than new caseworker to ensure that it deliver the service that my hon friend want as do last month the united nations call for an urgent government review of sentence of imprisonment for public protection will the secretary of state listen to the un can he explain why the number of people with an ipp sentence recall to prison without commit any further offence have soar in recent year can confirm that the lord chancellor and and we all be very conscious of the difficulty around ipp sentence which would not be introduce today we abolish they as the hon lady know but there be people in prison who have be recall or not release by the parole board because they have not be consider safe for release our objective be to help to manage people towards safe release into the community to that end our recently announce action plan be central the rehabilitation of offender be so important in reduce the chance of they commit crime once release from prison especially if they can get back into work could the minister outline any scheme that help to give offender the skill they need and how they can access company that be willing to give they second chance in life my hon friend be so right in topical question do not have the time to start to unpack all the different thing would like say so will not suffice it to say that brilliant company be provide training opportunity have write to the secretary of state about the tragic case of my young constituent gregg mcguire he have agree to meet with and be very grateful do his department have any plan to reassess the current rule which mean that victim family be unable to appeal sentence for those convict of cause death by careless driving be grateful to the hon lady know she be meet the secretary of state to discuss this matter and do not want to pre empt that meeting if she wish be very happy to join that meeting with she or even to meet she separately to talk about this issue if she feel that would be helpful mr speaker you will not believe this but it be almost six month since finally secure meeting with the justice minister and the health minister after six cancellation about what happen to section of my civil partnerships marriages and death registration etc act which empower coroner to investigate stillbirth be assure that the law pass by this house in february and with consultation that close in june would be publish imminently and progress would be make but nothing have happen be it ever go to happen yes it will both the health minister and be push this as fast as we possibly can the scale of the illegal drug problem in prison be such that five year ago the government introduce programme that cost million have the problem get bad or improve in the time since we be see progress it be combined approach of drug recovery wing and incentivise subsidise free living and ensure that security be able to stop drug get into prison through thing like ray body scanner which we have deploy in many prison it be perhaps unfortunate that many member of the public and much of the medium only take an interest in prison when there be an escape but that is thankfully very rare will my right hon friend join in hop to now see calm and measure public debate about the role of prison not least work out way to improve rehabilitation which ultimately protect the public my hon friend be exactly right he have long history with this issue since before he reach this house it be ultimately all about rehabilitation reduce reoffende and help to keep the public safe over woman have sign public letter to the prime minister ask he to take action against the escalate campaign of threat and intimidation against woman who stand up for woman right many of these woman be particularly concerned that the institution suppose to protect they be fail to do so include the criminal justice system will the minister with responsibility for victim be good enough to meet and representative of those who organise the letter to discuss this important issue be always happy to meet the hon and learn lady the reputation of our justice system depend on the independence integrity and professionalism of our judge at the end of this month the right hon lord burnett of maldon will retire as lord chief justice to be succeed by dame susan carr who will be the first ever female lord chief justice will the minister place on the record in this house his appreciation and all our appreciation of lord burnett for the exceptional leadership he have show to the judiciary throughout his term in office be grateful to my hon friend know the lord chief justice and be very happy on behalf of his majesty government and all those on the government front bench to do exactly as my hon friend say to pay tribute to lord burnett exemplary period as lord chief justice would like to pay tribute to the campaigner who challenge joint enterprise as result the crown prosecution service have now commit to monitor who be prosecute welcome the report at the end of this month but will the minister commit to an audit of all joint enterprise conviction particularly as more black people be disproportionately impact can commit to wait until we have see what the work be do by the cps uncover once we have datum we can then have rational discussion on the next step be the minister aware of the prevalence of the unfounded and unscientific concept of parental alienation within our family court it be cause suffering and in some case violence against woman and girl what step be the department take to ensure that the court recognise the harm of this discredit concept the department be well aware of the concern which be why the matter be currently under review the result of that review include publication of all the datum and research behind the outcome will be publish later this year offshore wind contracts urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net zero if she will make statement on the implication for offshore wind of contract for difference allocation round the first annual contract for difference auction the first that we have ever do be complete last week and deliver total of gw of renewable electricity with contract go to record number of project the auction deliver significant quantity of new solar and onshore wind generation as well as support new tidal stream project and for the first time geothermal project it be competitive auction set against backdrop of highly challenging macroeconomic condition that have impact the sector globally give that this be our first annual round it be to be expect that it would have low capacity than the previous biennial round and because last year round be the first for three year high annual element than that record round the government remain committed to offshore and float offshore wind project and this round provide valuable learning for subsequent auction work have already start on allocation round incorporate the result of the recent round and we look forward to strong pipeline of technology be able to participate the move to annual auction mean that allocation round will open in just six month time in march which mean that there could be minimal or indeed no delay in the deployment of new capacity through that round the government also remain committed to our target of decarbonise the power system by and our ambition for gw of offshore wind include up to gw of float offshore wind our trajectory for meet these aim as well as our legally bind carbon budget target be not linear the outcome for one technology in one auction do not prevent we from reach those goal what load of nonsense no wonder the secretary of state be in hiding this auction be an energy security disaster for britain and an act of economic harm on the part of the government no new offshore wind project mean that family energy bill will billion high and our energy security will be weaken bad of all this be totally avoidable minister be warn again and again about the impact of high inflation in letter from renewableuk in march and again in july and offshore wind be so much cheap than gas that they could have raise the price in the auction and it would still have save billion of pound for family but they refuse to listen first will the minister tell we why the government ignore those repeat warning secondly he say on friday that every country be in the same boat but that be just wrong ireland listen to industry and adjust its price and have successful auction in march why do the government not learn that lesson thirdly be not the terrible truth that this episode reveal much deep flaw in their approach for month after month this summer they claim that the answer to our energy crisis be more oil and gas and this be the result we will now be more dependent on expensive insecure fossil fuel we will be more expose to the whim of petrostate and dictator every wind farm that we fail to build make we more expose to dictator like putin and he know it bill higher security bad job lose climate failure the government have trash offshore wind the crown jewel of our energy system raise bill just as they trash onshore wind by ban it raise bill and just as they trash home insulation raise bill we have see year of fail energy policy and all this fiasco show be that the conservatives be quite simply party unfit to govern be pleased to see the other day that the rumour of the right hon gentleman no long be in his position be not true it be perhaps understandable in that context that he be so passionate about this highly successful round that have see gw on an annualise basis think that be record round he be member of the previous labour government who leave this country with of its electricity come from renewable in the first quarter of this year of our electricity be from renewable it be this government with our contract for difference system who transform the economic of offshore wind we have gw of offshore wind in the pipeline more than enough we have the right hon gentleman understandably give the weakness of his argument want to heckle at all time know how easy it be to dismantle they he ask where that capacity be and can tell he that gw be currently under construction as ever the right hon gentleman fail to be on the side of consumer we move to an annualise auction precisely to ensure that we could learn the lesson from each round add they to our industry insight and ensure that we could move forward the project take multiple year to be develop and none of they have disappear predict that move on from the triumph of gw of renewable which come through successfully on friday allocation round will be more successful still we will continue to build our reputation as the country that have cut emission more than any other major economy and that have transform our electricity generation he mention insulation how he have the gall do not know we have move from of home be properly insulate when he leave power to over by the end of this year thank the minister for his engagement with this process particularly with the new technology of float offshore wind three float offshore wind project be due to bid in allocation round but none do due to the low administrative strike price as chair of the all party parliamentary group for the celtic sea have repeatedly be tell that these project be part of our future energy supply can he outline what step he be take to ensure that these project will float in allocation round and to give confidence to developer in the region thank my hon friend who be an absolute champion of float wind and the economic opportunity it offer for her area and the rest of the uk be delighted to speak to her last week and meet she yesterday and pay tribute to her effort we have the large float wind pipeline in the world base on confirm seabed exclusivity arrangement we have around gw already identify include through the scotwind lease round and innovation and targeted oil and gas intog process as she as great champion know the crown estate be move forward with its leasing round for up to gw of capacity in the celtic sea this year we have be the world leader on float energy and we be go to stay the world leader thank to the effort of my hon friend know that we will have support across the house call the scottish national party spokesperson the minister fail to point out that gw be scarcely half of what be achieve in auction round he also fail to mention when he be herald onshore wind that of that will be find in scotland since the four auction round have yield gw gw gw and gw so nil return be an utter catastrophe the critical need for massive investment in offshore be patently obvious for bill and for the climate yet this ambition have be thwart by an incompetent previous secretary of state and by the treasury which know the price of everything and the value of nothing can the minister assure we that the department will get round the table with industry as matter of urgency to try to repair this damage industry need strike price that reflect the not mutually exclusive goal of low bill net zero and job and investment in scotland and elsewhere can he confirm whether recovery group for auction round will be convene by he or the secretary of state to try to get this catastrophe resolve and where be she the hon gentleman and his party never fail to trash this he can heckle all he wish will be meet industry representative this afternoon and as have say we will be announce in two month time the price ceiling for the next be get heckle not least from his majesty opposition who leave we in that parlous situation we be the world leader in so many of these technology and we be go to continue to be if the hon member for angus dave doogan be to recognise the need to attract investment to this country and not talk it down he might find that scottish job would be even strong in the pipeline than they be already if any how much of the complete wind capacity still require connection to the national grid until wind capacity be construct it be not normally connect to the grid that which have not be connect to the grid will need to be connect to the grid call the chair of the select committee on energy security and net zero the boom and bust of this fiasco will inevitably have knock ons for the supply chain how concerned be the minister about that also how concerned be he about project that be build on cfd security but have not invoke the contract and be now literally rake in the windfall of that act do not quite follow the second part of the hon gentleman question but be happy to write to he on that topic west somerset as the minister know be ideal for offshore wind be interested to know why people do not bid in this round what be their reason what can the government do to learn the lesson of this round so that people like my hon friend the member for north devon selaine saxby can make sure that people be bid in the next round we typically set out the key auction parameter in november and those include the ceiling of what we will pay for particular technology we do that base on our analysis of supply chain cost and we also commission external analysis the most important datum of all come from individual auction round and it be on that basis that we set the price parameter the industry warn we as it do every year that it want we to pay more we always have to make judgment call between make sure that we it would be so much easy to give my answer mr speaker if the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband would stop order think that as man who be always happy to heckle from the back benches the minister deserve little bit himself we set the price and we immediately learn from each auction one of the reason for have an annual auction be that we can quickly adjust and as say project can then come into the next round with minimal delay the wind farm off brighton have probably become as iconic as the pier itself but the reality be that the government failure will delay the construction of more of these beautiful installation around our coast be this failure not also failure of the market base private investment system that this government be determined to pursue rather than publicly own and co ordinate building programme that can work alongside private investment so that we no long have this failure where nobody bid thank the hon gentleman for reveal the true face of where the labour party be go we can go back to the day when we have hardly any renewable and we can allow great british energy or whatever labour be go to call its creature to squeeze out private investment and destroy the most successful renewable market in europe and to destroy this government progress on tackle the parlous position leave behind by the right hon member for doncaster north and his friend we will continue to be the world leader in cut emission but not if we move to the state run left wing obsession of colleague like the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle offshore wind play and will continue to play key strategic role in enhance energy security achieve net zero and revitalise coastal community such as lowestoft to get back on track can my right hon friend confirm that the criterion apply to round will take account of current economic reality that appropriate fiscal measure be be consider ahead of the autumn statement and that specific focus will be give to enhance local supply chain thank my hon friend who have be such consistent champion not only for the power of renewable to meet our environmental challenge but for the economic benefit that come from they he be absolutely right that the nature of the cfd system be that it learn from the previous auction round which be the most real datum of all and use that learn to inform the next round that be why be confident that just as we have success with gw on friday promise to be more successful still congratulate the minister on turn complacency and chutzpah into new art form the ineptitude of tory ministers mean that this late cfd round see the small auction return since failing that be entirely avoidable how will he ensure that the uk deliver the gw of new offshore wind capacity that be need in just six year why do ministers yet again fail to heed the warning from industry and expert in advance we have to set the parameter base on the good information we have as say one reason for move to an annual round be to allow we quickly to learn the lesson of each round we do not get the wind on this occasion which regret and we will put the real world price and learning from that into the next round that be the system we have because we be always try to make sure that we get the parameter right so that we balance the need to generate additional green energy with the cost to the taxpayer understandably give their carelessness with the public finance and with consumer the opposition do not seem to care about that my job be to balance it ensure that we get the generation and we have gw in the pipeline we be in position and on track to meet our ambition which lead europe not that we would know that to listen to the hon lady thank the minister for include geothermal project in allocation round as that be very welcome however echo everything my hon friend the member for north devon selaine saxby say about the celtic sea project what will we do differently in round what advice would he give to those in the supply chain specifically port that be try to submit application for the flowmis float offshore wind manufacture investment scheme funding what conversation have he have about grid capacity to ensure that all of this eventually run smoothly as ever my hon friend be well informed we be work on all those front flowmis application close just two week ago and we be work flat out to analyse they hope that by the end of the year we will have shortlist to the primary list and those scheme will move forward to due diligence as we take forward not only our float wind deployment but the supply chain in the south west wales scotland and around the rest of the uk we be work on all those front and be determined to do that as she rightly highlight see our first geothermal project come through the cfd be fantastic as be the tidal project pay tribute to all colleague who have work so hard to promote tidal energy and make sure that we continue to be world leader in that as well this be an embarrassment for the government and show that we be fall far and far behind in the race for green job internationally we have the low growth in these industry among the eight big economy should the government not be focus much more on broaden and increase the capacity of offshore wind rather than not listen to industry and make fatal error if the labour party be not nationalise or create some state own behemoth it want just to hurl money in the direction of business our judgment be to balance those thing and be pleased to say that we have be successful we have the large offshore wind sector in europe this country and this government through the cfds transform the economic from the situation we inherit after the right hon member for doncaster north and his colleague have be in power deliver on the float offshore wind project in the celtic sea be vital for our energy security and decarbonisation do the minister agree that we now need to bolster confidence in this emerge industry there be two thing he can do do he agree that successful allocation of flowmis money to the south wales port in order to get this industry move be vital do he also agree that we need to ensure that the crown estate leasing round at the end of the year be do successfully but with more than gw of visibility in order to send strong market signal to the industry to invest my right hon friend be also someone who through thick and thin promote that industry and see the opportunity it offer wales he make special bid for the welsh port as would expect he to do but he will understand that can make no comment on that entirely agree with he on the importance of the crown estate round suffice it to say that across government we have be work flat out with his and other colleague support to support the crown estate to ensure that we maximise the opportunity in the celtic sea the government obsession with oil and gas have leave we in this mess the department have prioritise new oil and gas licence over support for wind power which fly in the face of our climate change commitment and our responsibility to uk citizen our constituent to keep energy price low oil and gas will always be more expensive than wind energy when will the minister fill the gap of gw of offshore wind that we have now miss out on which would have save consumer billion year be not talk about the sixth auction round be talk about the fifth one where we have miss out now the hon lady be completely mistaken we be work flat out both to reduce demand for fossil fuel in this country and to build up our renewable would hope she would celebrate the fact that we have the large offshore wind sector in europe the government have long be warn that their focus on cfds as the primary mechanism for finance new renewable risk undermine investor confidence in infrastructure asset with long lifespan but significant up front capital cost such as nuclear and tidal range generation follow the government decision to employ regulated asset base model to support the development of new nuclear will the minister now commit to look urgently at the optimum financial model for new tidal range project which could make crucial contribution to the future uk energy mix the cfd scheme be among the most successful if not the most successful of its sort in the world we always look at way in which we can improve it we be look at bring in non price factor as we finesse it but the opposition party idea of some state run enterprise squeeze out private investment would destroy the opportunity go forward we need at least another billion to be invest by and if the labour party ever do threaten to come into power it would put all that at risk on teesside we have be promise thousand of job in the offshore wind industry but investor be get little nervous as direct result of government failure to provide the right business environment what will the minister do to get the business environment right to deliver the job we have be promise which be be put in jeopardy by government failure we be get that balance right and we will continue to do so make sure that we look after the consumer be always my guide light and we balance that with get the generation we need we have see company such as seah invest in teesside and sumitomo look at invest in scotland they be get nervous as the hon gentleman decry this and talk both the area and the nation down he then tell that investor be get nervous if he be to champion all the success we have have instead of decry they he might find that he would give investor even more confidence still do not agree with the policy that the minister pursue his net zero policy be disastrous and have be costly in term of electricity price and future planning however feel some sympathy for he today he be be criticise by those who have highlight high energy price for not offer inflated price to the wind industry which claim that produce wind energy be get cheap but of course want high price as it be not offer that it would not bid in the auction be the real reason for this not that for the first time he have refuse to allow those who bid to walk away from their cfd agreement to price electricity at whatever price they want and therefore to have inflate profit do that not indicate to he that the wind industry know it can not produce electricity cheaply and want the system balance in its favour the right hon gentleman and do not see eye to eye on net zero or on the economic benefit of the wind industry it do offer cost effectiveness it have be amazing to see how as it be scale it have be able to bring the price down it be not obvious when we go out into the north sea that we would be able to bring the price crash down yet this country lead the world in do that if he look at the number hope he will find that the whole of this house can agree on one thing offshore wind be an economic way of produce energy and one that all of we should support last week the think tank common wealth make the critical point reliance on market coordination leave the transition vulnerable to the demand of private capital it be abundantly clear that private capital can not deliver what be urgently require to stem the climate crisis in wales the welsh government know that which be why over the summer they launch the community own renewable energy company ynni cymru do the minister agree that that be what be require and what action be he take to address this thank the hon lady for pull back the veil on labour real policy which be that it hat private capital it hat private investment and it would destroy the phenomenal success of this country in generate that interruption the front benchers can heckle all they like but that be what their back benchers want that be the policy that threaten the british people and threaten our path to net zero we must make sure that people such as the hon lady never have power in this country scottish renewables have say that the result be major blow to the renewable sector in scotland and should serve as an indication that urgent reform be need scottish renewables not political party but part of the industry have also say that these disastrous result be bad for scotland energy supply chain which desperately need steady stream of project to make its own investment in skille up and in new technology will the minister acknowledge that his and his department failure to listen to warning from the industry be hold back scotland renewable sector thank the hon and learn lady for her question industry always ask to be pay more money our job be to make the right judgment call on get the balance right see in the newspaper yesterday that astronomer have discover water cover planet in far away galaxy have to disappoint these excited scientist that from his answer today the minister appear to have get there before they interruption on another planet yes seriously though this setback to the erebus project in south west wales be deeply disappointing it be the first of its kind in wales and be suppose to pave the way to develop industry hope the minister can reassure that he be take step to make sure that in project such as erebus be enable to compete successfully and to lead the way for this industry in wales thank the hon gentleman not least for his attempt at gag can tell he that what he say be the whole basis of the system that it learn from each round the most real economic datum that we get be from an auction round move to annual round there will be ebb and flow as the right balance be seek between get the generation that we require set against our extremely ambitious deadline and not pay too much that be the balance that we strike we have gw and imagine that we will do even well next time feel as if be almost take my life in my hand but do want to commend the minister for one small piece of good news in this round which be in relation to the development of marine renewable the success of the auction for tidal stream development illustrate what would be possible for wave power if it be to be give the same opportunity in but for tidal stream do the minister agree that what be now need be the gw target for deployment will he work with and other people in the house with an interest in this and the marine renewable sector itself to deliver that ahead of may pay tribute to the right hon gentleman meet he in his constituency when visit the european marine energy centre and see for myself some of the project in the water be personally determined to ensure that tidal stream continue to grow we maintain our global leadership with very high percentage uk supply chain as far positive to it he tempt to get ahead of myself on policy but can not do that however what we be do and what our dedicated pot this year do be far strengthen that so that we can get in position where that might be realistic policy position to take even with high price offshore wind would help to slash bill when the minister see the irish government recognise inflation up the price and proceed to successful auction what discussion do he have with the industry and with treasury colleague about the price to be set thank the hon lady for her question which be good one obviously we do look at whether intervention give that price continue to change after they be set be the right thing to do we think that the cfd mechanism the way that it be operate be sound and that the good thing to do be to allow that to pass for the year one reason for have the annual auction be precisely to allow we quickly to adjust and as say as soon as november we will be set the parameter for the next year last november the government pay up to million to china general nuclear corporation to buy out china state own nuclear power enterprise from sizewell and we spend the good part of free ourselves from our reliance on russian oil and gas give the failure of this government to sell offshore wind project in the late round can the minister please comment on how energy independence from authoritarian state be serve by this inability to run an auction we be now run these auction every year and every year we will be seek to get the generation that we require at the low possible cost to the consumer make no apology for do that the fact that we have the most successful system not only in europe but globally be something that should be applaud and recognise the windsor report last month provide sobering analysis about the scale of new electricity transmission infrastructure require to serve increase renewable generation and consumer demand in very short space of time however as the report find there be considerable resistance locally to pylon development as we be find out in my constituency competence for such development be with the welsh government but will the minister pull together work group of ministers from across the uk and expert to consider the windsor report and in particular the advantage of cable ploughing technology which would underground those cable at comparable cost to overhead pylon without the visual damage thank the hon gentleman for his constructive and effective question he be absolutely right to highlight the challenge of make sure that we have the right transmission and connection infrastructure to facilitate offshore wind we have to do that in way that minimise negative impact on community that reward they for host it and that look at new technology and innovation just as we do in other area in order to facilitate that effective connection with minimal negative impact on community that host in light of the disappointing result of the cfd auction and give that be always try to be constructive in my contribution in this house will government revisit the exclusion of northern ireland renewable project from the scheme especially in light of the significant increase in onshore wind and tidal stream project support by the northern ireland be perfectly position for onshore wind and tidal stream to make major contribution to energy security and net zero from and beyond will the minister commit to enable northern ireland to be part of suggest that it be the hon gentleman and his colleague who need to commit to facilitate that in northern ireland energy be devolve and it be up to they to get the devolved assembly up and run if they get devolved government go in northern ireland they will unleash these opportunity it be not for this department which be not responsible for energy in northern ireland that complete the urgent question point of order on point of order mr speaker st leonard in my constituency be one of the school affect by reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete last week we receive ministerial statement from the secretary of state for education but this week despite raac still be an issue we have hear nothing from the secretary of state or minister the issue may be yesterday news to some but it be very real issue for my constituent many of whom have write to to express their anger and anxiety about this avoidable crisis may please seek your guidance mr speaker as to how we can implore the secretary of state to come back to the house this week preferably tomorrow when it be well attend and update we on what her department be do first thank the hon member for notice of her point of order as she say the secretary of state do make statement on the subject last week have have no notice from ministers that they intend to make further statement on this matter this week however be sure that ministers on the treasury bench will have hear her point of order and know that member would like an update before the house go off again on point of order mr speaker should say that this point of order come with trigger warning today bbc news the times and other carry shocking report that female surgeon be sexually harass assault and in some case rap by colleague and some of the sexual assault take place in operate theatre while female surgeon perform surgery on anaesthetised patient the house will also be aware that on may this year it be report that more than incident of sexual misconduct or sexual violence be record on nhs premise in england between and those report be just as serious as some of the revelation about sexual misconduct in the metropolitan police which rightly lead to the creation of the casey review of the standard of behaviour and internal culture of the met but when revelation be repeatedly make about the scale of the same problem in the nhs they be meet with government inaction would be grateful if you could confirm whether the secretary of state for health and social care intend to make statement to the house on today shocking revelation or whether he intend to announce an independent inquiry so that we can expose the scale of sexual misconduct in the nhs and put an end to that horrific practice and culture of silence thank the hon member for give notice of the point of order have have no indication from ministers that they intend to make statement on this important matter but be sure that the government front bench will have hear the point of order if not be sure the hon lady will pursue it through other mean and there will be opportunity to do so before the house rise electricity supply vulnerable customers motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require ofgem to amend the condition of an electricity supply licence in relation to vulnerable customer to require ofgem to establish fund for the purpose of rectify dangerous electrical fault for vulnerable customer to require energy supply company to inform vulnerable customer about the service available to customer on the priority services register and for connected purpose rise to propose bill that would address critical issue in our energy sector the bill aim to require ofgem to revise the term of electricity supply licence with much need focus on vulnerable customer specifically it call for the creation of fund by ofgem to rectify dangerous electrical fault affect vulnerable customer additionally it would mandate energy supply company to inform vulnerable customer about their entitlement under the priority services register and related matter as the uk move towards achieve net zero emission our home be undergo transformation in how they use energy we be transition away from gas and increasingly adopt clean energy system currently of home rely on gas boiler for heating but by up to of home could depend on electrically power technology such as heat pump the shift to electricity be expect to continue in the year ahead in this transition it be imperative that we prioritise the safety and well being of our vulnerable citizen last year in england alone there be staggering fire cause by home electrical installation an average of seven fire day those incident encompass issue relate to electrical distribution within home and heating system despite support from organisation such as electrical safety first the gas safe charity the chartered institute of housing the national home improvement council and national energy action the priority services register maintain by energy supplier have fall short in address critical electrical safety concern for the most vulnerable in our society the psr administer by ofgem serve as support system for vulnerable energy customer offer voluntarily by supplier it provide assistance tailor to specific requirement while the type of help can vary among supplier they typically include free gas safety check for customer on mean test benefit live with child under five year old those receive pension and those who be disabled or chronically ill that invaluable service have undoubtedly save life and the bill seek to extend similar safeguard to the many household across the country use and depend on electricity while existing legislation in england scotland and wales mandate electrical safety check for vulnerable individual live in the private rent sector the recent social housing regulations act have extend these check to those in the social rent sector align england with wales and scotland however significant portion of vulnerable people may still fall through the crack datum from various housing survey across the uk indicate that in as many as million household could have qualify for the priority services register mark they as part of vulnerable household furthermore the elderly population often eligible for the psr predominantly reside in the owner occupy sector which lack mandatory requirement for essential electrical safety protection the risk of electrical fire fatality be notably high for people age and above particularly those live alone or in old housing with outdated electric this be significantly heighten if they have health condition such as dementia or parkinson vulnerable people be more susceptible to electrical fire when they lack the financial mean to pay for electrical safety check or be physically unable to respond swiftly in case of fire many of they may reside in substandard housing with outdated electrical system potentially in high density housing far increase the risk of fire spread to neighbouring property the bill also address the press issue of fuel poverty among psr register people there be significant overlap between vulnerable individual on the psr and those experience fuel poverty the rise cost of living have hit many household hard but it be incredibly challenging for old and vulnerable group particularly regard energy cost as of england alone have million household in fuel poverty in my constituency of ilford south of household more than family be grapple with fuel poverty shockingly cold home link to fuel poverty contribute to excess winter death in england and wales last year life lose each day during the winter month for vulnerable people who already face the difficult choice between heat their home and have enough to eat afford electrical system check be often impossible that hidden danger compound the already distress issue of fuel poverty although the psr be voluntary system for energy provider it include requirement for free gas and carbon dioxide check under ofgem licensing condition none the less concern have be raise by organisation such as national energy action regard the alarmingly low awareness of available assistance it be crucial for energy supplier not only to promote their service but actively to enrol all eligible people on to the psr expand the reach of these service across the board in november study of eligible psr customer electrical safety first find that around quarter of respondent have never check their electrical installation or be unsure if they have be check some of they support the idea of the energy sector provide regular electrical check as requirement of the psr viewpoint share by both private and social housing landlord of course some of the check may reveal severe and dangerous fault in the electrical system the bill also address that concern it would require energy supplier ofgem and local authority to have the necessary grant make capability to address those issue that would ensure that vulnerable people with electrical fault be afford the same protection as those with gas safety issue we have moral obligation to shield the most vulnerable member of our society from the devastating consequence of fuel poverty and electrical danger today as the bill receive its first reading we take the first crucial step toward achieve this goal it would guarantee that as statutory minimum those most susceptible to fuel poverty during this era of rise living cost would receive enhance electrical safety protection we can not permit million of people to make the heart wrench choice between food safety and live in peril

those they lead in the clerks department sir john draw the attention of commentator in the press gallery three year ago member of particular party complain that if everyone have to stay six foot or two metre apart there would not possibly be room for all snp members to perch in their usual seat the commentator write the clerk with the small flash of weariness say most problem could be resolve by common sense and everyone behave in grow up way common sense and grow up behaviour we may need to keep an eye on clerk benger they add that sir john be model clerk circumspect bookish fair in the good sense modest public servant think that that be the kind of reputation that each person join the clerks department would wish to have whether or not they achieve the high office sir john be in his academic life an expert on martin marprelate tract which basically mock the church of england the style be describe as heady mixture of nonsense satire protest irony and gossip combine with pungent wit full of the language of the street or unparliamentary language be sir john predecessor sir david natzler here he would say that the tract be good preparation for the intrigue deception and vituperation member of the house of commons commission have to get use to in the old day mr speaker let use the word of your predecessor john bercow who say that the clerks department be unstinting selfless formidable and quite exceptional he go on to say that good clerk be bless with brilliant brain an understated manner unfaile courtesy and an absolute and undiluted passion for report february vol follow his retirement as clerk sir thomas erskine may who like sir john spend time in the library as well as in the clerks department go on to become baron farnborough of hampshire and he hold that role for six day before he die make it the second short peerage hope that sir john time at st catharine be long and that when he get to cambridge he will understand what it be like to be member of the denis thatcher society marry to person more important than you be his wife professor susan be an expert anglo saxonist refer those who be interested to her chadwick memorial lecture in on uncertain beginning think the clerk arrive in cambridge will not be uncertain as the master of st catharine hope he have as good time as we hope he have have with we and we thank he for his service call the snp spokesperson it be great pleasure to speak in this debate on behalf of the scottish national party to add to the tribute pay to sir john benger and congratulate he on his new role as master of st catharine college cambridge his alma mater as you share with we mr speaker sir john departure mark the end of nearly four decade of exceptional service to the house of commons in various capacity only handful of mp have serve this institution as long as sir john have during his four year tenure as clerk of the house sir john face series of unique and unprecedented challenge just year into his tenure he be task with lead the house service swift and extremely successful response to the outbreak of ensure the continued and safe operation of parliament those early lockdown be as everyone will recall very worrying and uncertain time for everyone and sir john calm diligent effort to navigate the house through the pandemic include the swift implementation of remote and virtual participation stand out as some of his most significant achievement want to echo the tribute that my hon friend and other be pay to john benger today during my time as snp chief whip he be always source of extremely valuable advice and while some of the issue we have to deal with be perhaps easy than other as my hon friend allude to his professionalism and courtesy shine throughout it all be pleased to have the opportunity to say how grateful be to he for his service and to wish he all the good thank my hon friend for that fitting tribute know he work closely with sir john over the year also pay great tribute to sir john for oversee the establishment of the independent expert panel to determine complaint of bullying and harassment in relation to mps implement the recommendation in dame laura cox report another major project during sir john term have be the ongoing restoration and renewal of the parliamentary estate the public accounts committee warn there be real and rise risk that catastrophic event will destroy the palace before it be ever repair and restore the evidence that sir john give to the committee early this year should be read carefully by all member of both houses especially those who think that this building be perfect and nothing need to change have not know sir john for very long on personal level so will admit that do pop in to see senior clerk to gather some of her insight she describe he as deeply intelligent man with sharp sense of humour who have truly passionate love of football as we have hear he be man united fan so be sure he will be hop for some improvement after slightly difficult start to the season colleague who have work with sir john closely remark on his rich eclectic cultural and intellectual interest that be one of the quality perhaps that have help he successfully transition between various different role in this place for example at one point move from the commons clerk team to the commons library sir john draw inspiration from different field and sector to inform his work in parliament be tell that he be keen reader of the harvard business review at time when that be consider unusual and he engage with bank and other such organisation to gain insight into improve customer service for members parliament have certainly benefit from that approach the mps guide to procedure which know member and staff find enormously helpful and practical be an initiative that he lead on as well as introduce simple thing such as the buddye system for new mp which newcomer find invaluable when attempt to navigate the complexity of this place wish sir john all the good in his new role and his future endeavour and warmly congratulate tom goldsmith on his appointment as sir john successor tom be most recently principal clerk of the table office and he have be with the house service since so he will bring vast range of expertise and experience to the job my colleague and very much look forward to work with he call the former leader of the house sir jacob rees mogg one of the great virtue of the clerks and particularly of the under clerk of the parliaments be that whether we be the most junior most recently elect member or the leader of the house we get the good cleverest advice confidentially during that difficult time of the parliament which sir john handle brilliantly people be go in to seek advice to do completely opposite thing some want to smooth government business through and other want to obstruct it and each one of we be give good professional thoughtful advice and treat without any difference accord to seniority or recent appearance in this house that be true mark of good clerk and of fairness to give an example of the complexity of the issue one that come up be whether humble address fall at prorogation or not the first edition of erskine may say that it do subsequent edition of erskine the think say that it do not after that nobody mention it because we have not have humble addresses for year the clerks have to work out which it be and how it be and advise accordingly although this be not the occasion for pay tribute to you mr speaker because hope you be go to stay in office for very long time it have to be say that you then make the very important statement that you would stick to clerkly advice or give write reason as to why not reinforce the importance and independence of the role because it be key constitutional role other have mention covid and what sir john do to ensure that the house sit he turn the whole house around it be really remarkable thing we go away for the easter recess have no idea how this house would sit when it come back none at all we have no idea whether the technology would possibly work and yet the clerk be be tell that he have to get parliament back it be our democratic requirement that this house should sit and sit safely that be perhaps easy for some of we to say because it be the clerk who have the legal responsibility we must bear in mind the uncertainty of that time nobody know how serious or how dangerous the disease be or what its effect might be but we know we have to have parliament back as we say to he from time to time it be all very well but you sir dr benger as he be the one who go to prison if you get it wrong he take that responsibility and ensure that democracy carry on he have be an innovator and have introduce thing in this house we have mention the icgs which he be great driver behind and which have be hugely to the benefit of the house he also get rid of the wig that come as great surprise to have always know that the clerks be some of the clever people in the world we know that whenever we go to see they to ask question on some procedural point their wisdom be phenomenal think that this be because they keep their brain warm by wear wig and that without that warmth the brainpower would not carry on as it have but confess turn out to be wrong their brainpower continue without that warmth should have know what radical our clerk really be at heart as my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley point out his specialist subject be the marprelate tract one of the thing that marprelate be so against be clerical dress he ridicule the clothe wear by the clergy so it be no surprise that in radical act sir john simplify the dress of the clerks we all wish he enormously well he have be model of clerkly wisdom and service to this house call the mother of the house thank you mr speaker associate myself with everything you say about sir john and also what the leader of the house and the shadow leader of the house my hon friend the member for manchester central lucy powell who welcome to her position say do not intend to repeat everything that everybody have already say but to warmly and very personally thank sir john and pay tribute to he when somebody have be work in the same field for four decade they accumulate huge amount of experience and wisdom but it can sometimes be the case that they get stick in the old way and think thing should not change the great thing about sir john be that he accumulate all that wisdom and experience but he be never stick in the past he fiercely protect the endure value of this house but also show himself to be an ally of progress and modernisation think we all recognise that there be furth to go but he have that remarkable duality of characteristic he lead an absolutely extraordinary team of clerks we always need to take the opportunity to say how lucky we know we be to have the clerks advice it be quite easy to take it for grant because it be always like that and it have always be like that but we depend on it so much pay tribute to sir john for his leadership of that clerk team clearly sir john have brain the size of planet but he be never condescend with it he be always very pleasant and never pompous many people who be that clever can not resist look down on those who be not but he never do that he be always pleasure to deal with wish he well in his new role at st catharine and also hope that he will write his memoir as colleague have say he have be through an enormous swathe of history from bird eye point of view so if he do for one will certainly be read they once again thank he for his extraordinary service and wish he all the good for the future and also wish all the good to his successor mr speaker too would like to associate myself with your remark and with the tribute pay to sir john benger by all other person in the chamber it be always an enormous pleasure to know that the clerks department which be so important to the functioning of this house be in such safe hand will just refer to one or two incident that have occur my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg and one or two other refer to what call the paralysis parliament between and where there be great deal of fractiousness effectively decision be take sometimes by coalition shall we call it across the floor of the house the result of which be that nothing could be do it be time of very considerable frustration to many of we but have such wise clerk such as sir john benger at the front of the ship guide we through that period of time be incredibly important of course we come out of it eventually that be as compare with be bind to say this be not if do not would regard myself as have walk away from the subject in be tell by the clerks and also by the deputy chairman of ways and means that be not allow to even debate the issue of sovereignty table an amendment to the single european act have to confess that be the only person in the house who have an amendment on the subject by the situation have change so much that the sovereignty amendment to the european union withdrawal agreement act section of that act go through without any adverse comment either in this house or in the house of lords that be tribute to the change that have take place and to the guidance and navigation of sir john benger and other who allow those important constitutional change to take place people have speak eloquently about covid and could not agree more have not the faint idea what be go to happen when we all return to the country up in shropshire or wherever it happen to be and wonder what on earth we be go to do how on earth be we go to be able to participate it run very very smoothly and it could only have run so smoothly with the wisdom and judgment of those like sir john benger and sir john in particular also pay tribute to his contribution to the funeral arrangement for her late majesty the queen with those thought simply wish sir john the very well when he get to st catharine cambridge when hear that it be st catharine think for one moment that it might have be st catherine oxford but it be not it be st catharine cambridge whichever university he be go to wish he the good of luck and hope it all work well for he like other speaker associate myself with your remark mr speaker and those we have hear so far today in recognise sir john benger and his departure from the house to st catharine be elect in december and my first engagement with sir john in that first and last sit week of be bleary eyed and tired here in the chamber with other new mps be privy to the procedure and process that we need to follow do my good to listen but also believe that an mp be not properly an mp in this place until they have stand up at an oral question session start to ask their substantive question and be tell by yourself mr speaker to say question number eight apology and sit back down we all do our good to pay attention to the clerk and the guidance he and his team give but sometimes we do not quite manage it we of the intake have be mps for such short period of time before covid take place that we be still get to grip with the way the process work can certainly speak for my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael by say that the communication we have from the house via the clerk ensure that we be as well equipped as we could possibly be as we come back in virtual environment it be very different environment it be very good that we be back here in this place but the amendment and adjustment that be able to be make include those that we have take forward be part of sir john legacy since september have act as the whip for the liberal democrats the father of the house mention that previous clerk have sympathetic understanding and would certainly say that that have be the case for john in relation to he have be sympathetically understanding of my sometimes completely daft question treat they with respect and give the appropriate advice accordingly be hugely grateful for that we be reflect on what have happen since sir john become clerk of the house have reflect on covid the work that take place to mark the death of her majesty queen elizabeth and the restoration work that this place require go forward however for particularly as whip his long last legacy will be change the culture in this place the thing that we do not see as we recognise that the clerk role be to provide non political impartial advice it behove we as parliamentarian to think about how we change that culture for the well in much the same way it be always sad when we say goodbye to clerk of the house exciting when we welcome new one but sad when we see clerk depart sir john have be kind thoughtful and reflective this have be very challenging parliament but all parliaments be challenge and we would expect the clerk to rise to that challenge will miss he greatly people have say that he be wise and have benefit from that wisdom on number of occasion however one of his most underappreciated talent be that he do not speak very often and he do not speak very loudly so when he do speak he capture the room and people listen we benefit in our parliament from the very good clerk in the world that be testament to sir john effort over his four year lead this place and his team and to his predecessor be sure the next clerk will deliver great parliament and lead great team rise on behalf of my party plaid cymru to pay tribute to john benger for his commitment to this house we be talk about four decade and year be very long time in workplace he have serve diligently and conscientiously and during that tenure he have undoubtedly see some of the high and low of parliamentary life sir john tireless work whether through brexit or the pandemic as we have hear have ensure an extraordinarily smooth running of this place through what be often the most torrid of time would particularly like to thank sir john for his work in implement the independent complaints and grievance scheme it have be clear that the welfare of staff have be of the utmost importance to he and the guidance in this place be testament to his good work we be talk about cultural sea change and how to put that into effect and see its be put into effect here have be extremely interesting of course it be not over it be not do but it do change how we handle ourselves and each other think that that work be one of the thing we will hold on to and see he realise it be one of the thing we will remember he for alongside the technological change and his own style of working would like to place on the record my personal thank and those of my party for his adept agile stewardship as clerk of the house and of course to wish he the very good for his new position as the master of st catharine college rise to speak as chair of the house of commons procedure committee and wish to associate myself and my committee with the remark make so far know that we as committee agree wholeheartedly with the tribute that have be pay so far the procedure committee constitute itself on march and at the end of our agenda when we get to any other business somebody ask do you think we should find out something about this coronavirus that people be talk about we agree that we would invite sir john to come to speak to the committee privately the following monday and he be face with committee of very enthusiastic mp all keen to hear about procedure and what we might do with this unknown thing call coronavirus see fellow member of the committee the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman who be there at the time we hear from sir john term such as social distancing and he talk about our sitting as one would expect from sir john six foot apart not two metre he talk about how he would transform this place so that we could continue to sit and we would have to have space between member and make sure there be list of speaker we sit there just astonish because this be not something anyone on the procedure committee have expect we would be face so soon after be constitute but we do only few week later this house go into hybrid form and introduce new voting system and new way of work it be to the credit of sir john and you mr speaker that this parliament continue to sit throughout the pandemic because many other do not manage to do so we continue

need and ensure that our child be well protect against pornography and other content that be harmful to they the bill will also guard child against perpetrator of abhorrent child sexual exploitation and abuse and ensure that tech company take responsibility for tackle such content on their platform or be hold criminally accountable as be sure my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates will agree may say how much we appreciate what the government have do in relation to the matter just refer to as the minister know we withdraw our amendment in the house of commons after discussion and we have amazingly constructive discussion with the government right the way through and also in the house of lords shall refer to that if be call to speak later but simply want to put on record our thank because this will save so many child life thank my hon friend and my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates for all their work on this hope that this debate will show that we have listen and try to work with everybody include on this important part of the bill we have not be able to capture absolutely everything that everybody want but we be all determined to ensure that the bill get on the statute book as quickly as possible to ensure that we start the important work of implement it we have amend the bill to bolster its provision number of topic have be of particular interest in the other place follow engagement with colleague on those issue we have bolster the bill protection for child include significant package of change relate to age assurance we have also enhance protection for adult user my hon friend will know that ministers and official in his department have work extensively thank they for that with baroness kidron and the bereaved families for online safety group on the amendment that will make it easy for coroner to have access to datum from online company in the tragic case where that might be cause of child death he will also know that there will still be gap in legislation but such gap could be close by further measure in the data protection and digital information bill his ministerial colleague in the other place have commit the government to that so may invite my hon friend to set out more about the government plan for do just that thank my right hon friend for his work on this and baroness kidron for her work will cover that in more detail in moment but we remain committed to explore measure that would facilitate well access to datum for coroner under specific circumstance we be look for the good vehicle to do that which include those possibility in the data protection and digital information bill we want to ensure that the protection for adult user afford people great control over their online experience the bill will ensure that ofcom have the power it need to ensure that coroner be provide with the information they need follow such tragedy as well as my right hon friend and baroness kidron that provision be also champion by ian russell and other bereaved parent with whom we have work closely to ensure that we get the right solution be grateful for their tireless effort we have make sure that we can address the concern raise by member about the risk relate to the design and functionality of service because this be complicated issue for number of reason that have be well rehearse the change have outline will ensure that the bill contain the strong possible protection for child that user right to freedom of expression and privacy be protect and that service be transparent and accountable let go into more detail on the government amendment that be pass during the bill passage through the lords and the amendment that present to the house today as have say child safety be key priority in the bill and during its passage through the lords we have far strengthen its protection for child that have include place the category of primary priority and priority content that be harmful to child in the bill that will provide company and ofcom with explicit and early confirmation on the kind of content that child must be protect from rather than address those issue later via secondary legislation provider of the large service will also be require to publish summary of their risk assessment for illegal content and content that be harmful to child that will empower child and their parent or carer to clearly understand the risk to child present by such service the government listen to the view express in both houses and introduce new offence in committee that will more effectively hold technology company to account if they fail to protect child ofcom will now be able to hold company and senior manager where they be at fault criminally liable if the provider fail to comply with ofcom enforcement notice in relation to specific child safety duty or to child sexual abuse and exploitation on their service the minister be set out powerful case for how the government have listen to the overture in this place and the other place far to the intervention from my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash and my right hon friend the member for bromsgrove sajid javid the former culture secretary will the minister be clear that the risk here be under regulation not over regulation although the internet may be widely use by perfectly good people the people who run internet company be anything but daft and more likely to be dastardly this be difficult path to tread in approach this issue for the first time in many way these be thing that we should have do or year ago as social medium platform and people engagement with they proliferate over that period regulation have to be do gently but it must be do we must act now and get it right to ensure that we hold the big technology company in particular to account while also understand the massive benefit that those technology company and their product provide agree with the minister that this be groundbreake bill but we must be clear that there be still gap give what he be say about the requirement for regulation of online social medium company and other platform how will he monitor over period of time whether the measure that we have be as dynamic as they need to be to catch up with social medium as it develop the hon lady ask an important question and that be the essence of what we be do we have try to make this bill flexible and proportionate it be not technology specific so that it be as future proof as possible we must obviously lean into ofcom as it seek to operationalise the act once the bill gain royal assent ofcom will come back with its reporting so not only will government and the department be check on this but parliament will be able to assess the efficacy of the bill as the system bed in and as technology and the various platform move on and develop talk about the offence and will just finalise my point about criminal liability those offence will be punishable with up to two year in prison far to that point about the remain gap in the bill appreciate what the minister say about this area be move target everybody not just in this country but around the world be have to learn as the internet evolve thank the minister for government amendment which deal with provenance and understanding where information post on the web come from and allow people therefore to check whether they want to see it if it come from dubious source that be an example of collective harm of people post disinformation and misinformation online and attempt to subvert our democratic process among other thing park with he if may the notion that we will have to come back to that area in particular it be an area where the bill be particularly weak notwithstanding all the good stuff it do elsewhere notably on the area he have mention hope that everyone in this house accept that that area will need to be revisit in due course undoubtedly we will have to come back to that point not everything need to be in the bill at this point we have industry initiative such as adobe content security policy which be good initiative in themselves but as we well understand misinformation disinformation deepfake and the proliferation and repetition of fake image fake text and fake news we will need to keep ensure we can stay ahead of the game as my hon friend say that be why we have make the legislation flexible have two thing to ask first will the minister spell out more clearly how parliament will be able to monitor the implementation what mechanism do we have to do that secondly on director liability which warmly welcome be pleased that the government have listen to back benchers on this issue do he not agree that the example we have set in the bill should be copy in other bills such as the economic crime and corporate transparency bill where similar proposal exist from back benchers across the house the right hon lady raise some interesting point we have converse about harm so totally get her point about make sure that we tackle this issue in parliament and be accountable in parliament as have say that will be do predominantly by monitor the bill through ofcom report on what harm it be have to deal with we have regular engagement with ofcom not only here and through the select committees but through the secretary of state on criminal liability we converse about that and make sure that we have liability attach to something specific rather than the general approach propose at the beginning it therefore mean that we be not chill innovation people can understand as they set up their approach and system exactly what they be get into in term of risk for criminal liability rather than have the general approach that be suggest at the beginning the review mechanism strike as one of the place where the bill fall down and be weak because there be not dedicated review mechanism we have need this legislation for more than year and we have now get to the point of legislating do the minister understand why have no faith that future legislation will happen in timely fashion when it have take we so long even to get to this point can he give we some reassurance that proper review will take place rather than just have ofcom report that may or may not be read have talk about the fact that we have to keep this legislation under review because the landscape be fast move at every stage that have be deal with this bill have say that inevitably we will have to come back we can make the bill as flexible proportionate and tech unspecific as we can but thing be move quickly with all our work on ai for example such as the ai summit the work of the global partnership on artificial intelligence the international response the hiroshima accord and all the other area that my hon friend the member for weston super mare john penrose speak about early we will have to come back review it and look at whether the legislation remain world beat it be not just about the finding of ofcom as it report back to we need to make bit of progress because hope to have time to sum up little bit at the end we have listen to concern about ensure that the bill provide the most robust protection for child from pornography and on the use of age assurance mechanism we be now explicitly require relevant provider to use highly effective age verification or age estimation to protect child from pornography and other primary priority content that be harmful to child the bill will also ensure clear privacy preserve and future proof framework govern the use of age assurance which will be oversee by ofcom there have be coverage in the medium about how the bill relate to encryption which have often not be accurate take the opportunity to set the record straight our stance on challenge sexual abuse online remain the same last week in the other place my noble friend lord parkinson the parliamentary under secretary of state for arts and heritage share recent datum from uk police force that show that offence relate to sexual communication with child be record last year alone shockingly of those offence take place against primary school age child those appalling statistic illustrate the urgent need for change the government be commit to take action against the perpetrator and stamp out these horrific crime the information that social medium company currently give to uk law enforcement contribute to more than arrest or voluntary attendance of suspect child sexual offender on average every month that result in an estimate child be safeguard from child sexual abuse there be no intention by the government to weaken the encryption technology use by platform as last resort on case by case basis and only when stringent privacy safeguard have be meet ofcom will have the power to direct company to make good effort to develop or source technology to identify and remove illegal child sexual abuse content we know that this technology can be develop before it can be require by ofcom such technology must meet minimum standard of accuracy if appropriate technology do not exist that meet these requirement ofcom can not require its use that be why the power include the ability for ofcom to require company to make good endeavour to develop or source new solution do my hon friend agree that the company already say in their term of service that they do not allow illegal use of their product yet they do not say how they will monitor whether there be illegal use and what enforcement they take what the bill give we for the first time be the right for ofcom to know the answer to those question and to know whether the company be even enforce their own term of service my hon friend make an important point and thank he for the amazing work he have do in get the bill to this point and for his ongoing help and support in make sure that we get it absolutely right this be not about bash technology company it be about not only hold they to account but bring they close to make sure that we can work together on these issue to protect the child be talk about despite the breadth of exist safeguard we recognise the concern express about privacy and technical feasibility in relation to ofcom power to issue cse or terrorism notice that be why we introduce additional safeguard in the lords first ofcom will be require to obtain skilled person report before issue any warning notice and exercise its power under clause ofcom must also provide summary of the report to the relevant provider when issue warning notice we be confident that in addition to ofcom exist route of evidence gathering this measure will help to provide the regulator with the necessary information to determine whether to issue notice and the requirement that may be put in place we also bring forth amendment require ofcom to consider the impact that the use of technology would have on the availability of journalistic content and the confidentiality of journalistic source when consider whether to issue notice that build on the exist safeguard in clause regard freedom of expression and privacy we recognise the disproportionate level of harm that woman and girl continue to face online and that be why the government have make number of change to the bill to strengthen protection for woman and girl first the bill will require ofcom to produce guidance on online harm that disproportionately affect woman and girl and to provide example of good practice to provider and it will require provider to bring together in one clear place all the measure that they take to tackle online abuse against woman and girl on their platform the bill will also require ofcom to consult the victims commissioner and the domestic abuse commissioner in addition to the children commissioner while prepare code of practice that change to the bill will ensure that the voice of victim of abuse be bring into the consultation period the offence of control or coercive behaviour have be add as priority offence and will require company to proactively tackle such content and activity that disproportionately affect woman and girl the bill also introduce new offence relate to intimate image abuse include criminalise deepfake for the first time in england and wales those new offence to protect woman and girl sit alongside other change that we have make to the criminal law to ensure that it be fit for purpose in the modern age for example we have also introduce new communication offence of intentionally encouraging or assist serious self harm our amendment will also require platform to remove the most harmful self harm content for all user the offence have be design to avoid criminalise or remove recovery and support content the government be commit to empower adult online and make change to the bill to strengthen the user empowerment content duty first we have introduce new content assessment duty in relation to the main user empowerment duty that will require big tech platform to carry out comprehensive assessment of the prevalence of content that fall in scope of their provider user empowerment duty on their service such as legal content that encourage suicide or an act of self harm they will need to keep record of that assessment and publish summary of it for their user in their term of service the new duty will underpin the main duty to offer user empowerment tool ensure that platform and user have comprehensive understanding of the relevant type of content on their service secondly where category provider offer the user empowerment tool we have far strengthen the duty on they by require they to proactively ask their register adult user whether they wish to use the user empowerment content feature that will help to make the tool easy for user to opt into or out of this approach continue to balance the empowerment of user and the protection of freedom of expression by avoid the default on approach baroness fraser of craigmaddie make amendment in the other place that align the definition of the term freedom of expression in the bill with that in the european convention on human right that also reflect the approach of other uk legislation include the higher education freedom of speech act those amendment will increase clarity about freedom of expression in the bill the government recognise the difficulty that coroner and bereaved family have when seek to understand the circumstance surround child death and have introduce number of amendment to address those issue have outline bit of those first we expand ofcom information gather power so that the regulator can require information from regulated service about deceased child online activity follow request from coroner that be back up by ofcom exist enforcement power we have also give ofcom the power to produce bespoke report for the coroner and enable the regulator to share information with coroner without the prior consent of business to disclose that will ensure that ofcom can collect such information and share it with the coroner where appropriate so that coroner have access to the expertise and information they need to conduct their investigation finally we have introduce amendment to ensure that the process for access datum regard the online activity of deceased child be more straightforward and humane the large company must set out policy on disclosure of such datum in clear accessible and sufficiently detailed format in their term of service they must also respond in write in timely manner provide dedicated mean for parent to communicate with the company and put in place mechanism for parent to complain if they consider that service be not meet its obligation we recognise the valuable work of researcher in improve our collective understanding of online safety issue which be why we have make amendment to the bill that require ofcom to publish its report into researcher access to information within month rather than two year ofcom will then be require to publish guidance on the issue set out good practice for platform to share information in way that support their research function while protect user privacy and commercially sensitive material while we will not be make additional change to the bill during the remainder of its passage we understand the call for further action in this area that be why we have make commitment to explore this issue far and report back to the house in due course on whether further measure to support researcher access to datum be require and if so whether they could also be implement through other legislation such as the data protection and digital information bill the government hear the house concern about the risk of algorithm and their impact on our interaction online give the influence they can have the regulator must be able to scrutinise the algorithm functionality and other system and process that provider use we have therefore make change to provide ofcom with the power to authorise person to view specific type of information remotely information demonstrate the operation of provider system process or feature include algorithm and test or demonstration there be substantial safeguard around the use of that power which include ofcom legal duty to exercise it proportionately seven day notification period and the legal requirement to comply with data protection rule and regulation the government be grateful to baroness morgan of cotes and my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright who like many in the house have steadfastly campaign on the issue of small but risky platform we have accept an amendment to the bill that change the rule for establish the condition that determine which service will be designate as category or category service and thus have additional duty in make the regulation use to determine which service be category or category the secretary of state will now have the discretion to decide whether to set threshold base on the number of user or the functionality offer or both factor previously the secretary of state be require to set the threshold base on combination of both factor it be still the expectation that only the most high risk user to user service will be designate as category service however the change will ensure that the framework be as flexible as possible in respond to the risk landscape say to my hon friend the member for yeovil mr fysh who know will speak later that it be not mean to capture user to user system it be very much about content but not about stifle innovation in area such as distribute ledger and so on be grateful for the amendment which think be important will the minister make it clear that he will not accept the amendment table by the hon member for yeovil mr fysh indeed we will not be accept those amendment but will cover more of that later on after have listen to the comment that know my hon friend want to make as result of the amendment we have also make small change to clause the emerge category service list to ensure that it make operational sense prior to baroness morgan amendment service have to meet the functionality threshold for content and of the user number threshold to be on the emerge service list under the amend cause there be now plausible scenario where service could meet the category threshold without meet any condition base on user number so we have to make the change to ensure that the clause work in that scenario we have always be clear that the design of service its functionality and its other feature be key driver of risk that impact on the risk of harm to child baroness kidron amendment and seek to treat those aspect as source of harm in and of themselves although we agree with the objective we be concerned that they do not work within the legislative framework and risk legal confusion and delay the bill we have work closely with baroness kidron and other parliamentarian to identify alternative way to make the role that design and functionality play more explicit be grateful to colleague in both houses for be so generous with their time on this issue in particular thank again my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam for his tireless work which be crucial in enable the creation of an alternative and mutually satisfactory package of amendment we will disagree to lords amendment and and replace they with amendment that make it explicit that provider be require to assess the impact that service design functionality and other feature have on the risk of harm to child on report my hon friend the member for crawley henry smith raise animal abuse on the internet and ask how we might address such harmful content be pleased that the change we have since make to the bill fully demonstrate the government commitment to tackle criminal activity relate to animal torture online it be cause that baroness merron have champion passionately her amendment in the other place seek to require the secretary of state to review certain offence and depend on the review outcome to list they as priority offence in schedule to accelerate measure to tackle such content the government will remove clause the review clause and instead immediately list section of the animal welfare act as priority offence official at the department for environment food and rural affairs have work closely with the royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals and be confident that the offence of unnecessary suffering will capture broad swathe of behaviour hope the whole house will recognise our effort and those of baroness merron and support the amendment you will be pleased to know mr deputy speaker that will conclude my remark express my gratitude to my esteemed colleague both here and in the other place for their continued and dedicated engagement with this complicated complex bill during the course of its parliamentary passage strongly believe that the bill in this form strike the right balance in provide the strong possible protection for both adult and child online while protect freedom of expression the government have listen carefully to the view of member on both side of the house stakeholder and member of the public the amendment we have make during the bill progress through the lords have far enhance its robust and world lead legislative framework it be groundbreake and will ensure the safety of generation to come ask members of the house gather here to support the government position on the issue that have speak about today call the opposition spokesperson before address the amendment at hand let first put on record my thank for the incredible effort of our colleague in the other place the bill have go on huge journey the government have repeatedly delay its passage and even go to great effort to recommit part of the bill to committee in an attempt to remove important provision on legal but harmful content for those reason alone it be somewhat of miracle that we have arrive at this moment with bill that be glad to say be in much well place than when we last debate it here that be thank to the tireless work of so many individual charity and organisation which have come together to coalesce around important provision that will have positive impact on people live online today we have the real privilege of be join by ian russell stuart stephens emilia stevens hollie dance and lisa kenevan who have all be impact by lose child at the hand of online harm want to take moment to give my most heartfelt thank to they all and to the other family who have share their story insight and experience with colleague and as the bill progress today in our thought be archie isaac olly molly and all the other child who be take due to online harm today their legacy stand before we we would not be here without you so thank you we also could not have arrive at this point without the determination of colleague in the other place notably baroness kidron colleague will know that she have be an extremely passionate determined and effective voice for child throughout and the bill be strong today thank to her effort more broadly hope that today debate will be significant and poignant moment for everyone who have be fight hard for more protection online for many year it be good to see the minister in his place this be complex bill and have be the responsibility of many of his colleague since its introduction to parliament that be say it will come as no surprise that labour be pleased with some of the significant concession that the government have make on the bill many stem from amendment the opposition seek to make early on in the bill passage although his department press release may try to claim united front let we be clear the bill have sadly fall victory to tory infighting from day one the conservatives truly can not decide if they be the party of protect child or of free speech when they should be the party of both sadly some colleague on the government benches have try to stop the bill in its track entirely but labour have always support the need for it we have work collaboratively with the government and have long call for these important change it be welcome relief that the government have finally listen let also be clear that the bill go some way to regulate the online space in the past and present but it make no effort to future proof or anticipate emerge harm the labour party have repeatedly warn the government of our concern that thank to the bill focus on content rather than social medium platform business model it may not go far enough with that in mind echo call from across the house will the minister commit to review of the legislation within five year of enactment to ensure that it have meet their objective of make the uk the safe place in the world to be online my hon friend be make an important speech it be clear that the government want to tackle harmful suicide and self harm content it be also clear that the bill do not go far enough do she agree that we should support samaritans suggest way forward after implementation we need the government to engage with people with live experience of suicide and self harm to ensure that the new legislation make thing well if it be show as we fear not to go far enough new legislative approach will be require to supplement and take it far to ensure that the internet be as safe as possible for vulnerable people of all age thank my hon friend for that intervention he have be passionate advocate on that point speak on behalf of his constituent joe nihill and his family for more protection in the bill it be clear that we need to know whether the legislation work in practice parliamentary oversight of that be essential so echo call around the chamber for that review how will it take place what will it look like parliament must have oversight so that we know whether the legislation be fit for purpose let turn to the amendment labour be particularly pleased to see the government follow the excellent lead of baroness kidron in the other place by address the alarming gap in child risk assessment those amendment will go some way to ensure that social medium platform have to carefully consider harmful content both create and disseminate to child when use their service this be an incredibly important point with online content be constantly available and drip feed to child thank to autoplay feature it be right that risk assessment relate to harm will have to include widespread provision wonder however if the minister could explain one particular point the government own press release have long laud the bill as focus on child safety indeed in the secretary of state open letter in december to all parent carer and guardian she note the strong protection in this legislation be for child and young people would therefore be interested to hear from the minister exactly why the bill make no specific reference to child right or more specifically the un convention on the right of the child it be the most widely ratify international human right treaty in history yet it be miss from the bill hope the minister can clarify that for we all it will come as no surprise that labour be proud that the government have concede on an important amendment that will see social medium site require to proactively remove animal torture content online first raise that issue in committee more than year ago vile animal torture content have no place online or in society be proud that it be the labour party that first recognise the alarming gap in the government early draft of the bill research from the rspca show that in there be report of animal abuse on social medium compare with in and in we can all see that this horrific content be more widespread and common than we might initially have believe thank to labour party colleague in the other place particularly baroness merron it will no long be tolerate online be particularly proud to see the government adopt an amendment that represent move towards risk base approach to service categorisation this be an important point and significant concession from the government along with many other repeatedly warn the government that by focus on size versus risk approach to categorisation the online safety regime be doom to fail put simply we could have be leave in position where some of the most harmful website and platform include and bitchute which regularly host and promote far right antisemitic content slip through the crack of the legislation none of we want that to happen but in may the then minister choose not to accept cross party amendment in committee that could have resolve the issue more than year ago we be pleased to see progress and thank colleague in the other place for see sense but that approach highlight the government wide strategy for online safety one base on delay and indecision if we need more proof we only have to turn to the government approach to allow researcher access to datum relate to the online safety regime labour welcome small government amendment in the other place on this point but there be real world consequence if the government do not consider improve level of transparency other jurisdiction across the globe be look at strengthen their datum transparency provision because they recognise that regulator such as ofcom need academic and civil society to have sight of datum in the most complex of case in australia and canada there be real progress our friend across the pond in the usa have recently sign deal with the eu that will see they commit to work together on researcher access to datum the secretary of state talk good game about our world lead university and research environment and claim that she want the uk to be leader yet inaction be put our country and our homegrown talent pool at disadvantage let we be clear access to datum go far than academic in the last month elon musk have seek to sue the centre for counter digital hate and the anti defamation league organisation fill to the brim with brilliant british research excellence recognise that the government have make loose commitment to go far in future legislation but that have not be formally outline sincerely hope that the promise make to bereaved parent about further progress in the data protection and digital information bill be keep would be grateful for some reassurance from the minister on that point labour have long campaign for strong protection to keep people both child and adult safe online the bill have make remarkable progress thank to our colleague in the other place come together and genuinely put people priority over party politic and political gain labour have always support an online safety regime and have seek to work with the government while raise valid concern carefully throughout we all want to keep people safe and there be broad consensus that social medium company have fail to regulate themselves labour be proud of the change it have develop and push on but this be not the end we will continue to push the government to deliver this regime in good time and to ensure that it be review regularly and have appropriate parliamentary oversight after all child and adult across the uk deserve as first priority to be keep safe the minister know we will be closely watch rise call the chair of the select committee welcome the return of the online safety bill from its exhaustive consideration in the other place as the minister know this vital legislation kick off several year ago under the leadership of my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright with the ambitious aim of make the uk the safe place in the world to go online while other country pick at the edge of that we be the first place in the world to set ourselves such an ambitious task the legislation be mammoth in size and globally significant in scope its delivery have be long wind and be so pleased that we have get to where we be now as one of the ministers who carry the baton for this legislation for around month understand the balance to be strike between freedom of speech campaigner charity and the large pressure from the platform to get this right commend my hon friend for her remark may point out that there be provision in european legislation speak as chairman of the european scrutiny committee call the data service protection arrangement they have nothing to compare with what we have in the bill that demonstrate the fact that when we legislate for ourselves we can get it right that be something people ought to bear in mind my hon friend be absolutely right to point that out much of the european legislation on this be take from our own draft legislation but have not go anywhere near as far in the protection it offer we know that the internet be magnificent and life change in so many way but that the dark corner present such serious concern for child and score of other vulnerable people associate myself with the comment of the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones on the child protection campaigner who have work so incredibly hard on this issue particularly those who have experience the unimaginable tragedy of lose child as result of what they have see in the online world to turn an unspeakable tragedy of that nature into campaign to save the life of other be the ultimate thing to do and they deserve our massive thank and gratitude be also grateful to so many of our noble colleague who have shape the bill use their unique knowledge and expertise would like to mention few of they and welcome the change they bring but also thank the minister and the government for accept so many of the challenge they bring forward and adapt they into the bill we all owe massive debt of gratitude to baroness kidron for her tireless campaign for child protection child safety stalwart and pioneer for many year virtually no one else know more about this vital issue it be absolutely right that the cornerstone and priority of the bill must be to protect child the minister mention that the statistic be absolutely horrible and disturbing that be why it be important that the secretary of state will now be able to require provider to retain datum relate to child sexual exploitation and abuse ensure that law enforcement do not have one hand tie behind its back when it come to investigate these terrible crime also welcome the commitment to the new power give to ofcom and the expectation of provider regard access to content and information in the terrible event of the death of child the tragic suicide of molly russell the long and valiant battle of her dad ian to get access to the social medium content that play such key role in it and the delay that bring to the inquest be the only example we need of why this be absolutely the right thing to do know baroness kidron play big part in that as do my right hon friend the member for bromsgrove sajid javid be still concerned that there be not enough protection for vulnerable adult or for when people reach the cliff edge of the age of people of all age need protection from extremely harmful content online be still not convince that user empowerment tool will provide that but look forward to be prove wrong welcome the news that ofcom be now require to produce guidance set out how company can tackle online violence against woman and girl and demonstrate good practice be thankful to the former equalities minister baroness morgan of cotes for her work on that it be vital piece of the puzzle that be miss from the original bill which do not specifically mention woman or girl at all as far as can remember it be important to stay faithful to the original thread of the bill to futureproof it it have to be about system and process rather than specific threat but the simple fact be that the online world be so much more hostile for woman for black woman it be even bad illegal activity such as stalking and harassment be daily occurrence for so many woman and girl online over one in woman in england have experience online violence and three in have witness it we also know that woman and girl be disproportionately affect by the abuse of intimate image and the sharing of deepfake so it be welcome that those will become an offence also welcome that control and coercive behaviour which have be make recognise offence in real life will now be list as priority offence online that be something else the government should take pride in thank baroness merron for bring animal welfare into the scope of the bill all in scope platform will have proactive duty to tackle content amount to the offence of cause unnecessary suffering of animal thank ministers for take that on board anyone who victimise being small and weak than themselves whether child or animal be the most despicable kind of coward it show the level of depravity in part of the online world that the act of hurt animal for pleasure be even thing recent bbc story uncover the torture of baby monkey in indonesia the fact that individual in the uk and the us be profit from that and that it be share on platform like facebook be horrify in the brief time leave available to must admit to still be bit confused over the government stance on end to end encryption it sound like the minister have acknowledge that there be no sufficiently accurate and privacy preserve technology currently in existence and that the last resort power would only come into effect once the technology be there technically that mean the government have not move on the requirement of ofcom to use last resort power many security expert believe it could be many year before any such technology be develop if ever and that worry be of course very supportive of protect user privacy but it be also fundamentally right that terrorism or child sexual exploitation ring should not be able to proliferate unhindered on these channel the right to privacy must be trump by the need to stop event that could lead to mass death and the harm of innocent adult and child as my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins say that be also against their term of service would therefore welcome it if the minister be to make couple of comment on that also welcome the change bring forward by baroness morgan of cotes on the categorisation of harm too have be one of the long stand voice over successive stage of the bill say that platform size should not be the only measure of harm clearly massive platform by definition of their reach have huge potential to spread harmful content but we know that online platform can go viral overnight we know there be some small but incredibly pernicious platform out there surely the harmful content on site should be the definer of how harmful it be not just its size welcome the increase flexibility for the secretary of state to set threshold base on the number of user or the functionality offer or both would love to know little more about how that would work in practice we be the first country in the world to set out the ambitious target of comprehensive online safety legislation since then so much time have pass other country and the eu have legislate while we have refine and in the meantime so much harm have be able to proliferate we now need to get this do we be so close to get this legislation over the finish line can the minister assure that we be send out very clear message to provider that they must start their work now they must not necessarily wait for this legislation to be in place because people be suffer while the delay happen put on record my thank to member of this house and the other place who have work so hard to get the legislation into such great state and to ministers who have listen very carefully to all their suggestion and expertise finally put on record my thank to the incredible government official be responsible for shepherd the bill for mere month it nearly finish off but some official have be involve in it right from the beginning they deserve our enormous gratitude for everything they have do rise order thirteen member wish to participate in the debate the wind up speech will need to start shortly before pm and the minister have indicate that he have quite bit to say therefore suggest self deny ordinance of between seven and eight minute follow the speech from the scottish national party spokesman it be up to colleague because we have not impose mandatory time limit at this stage but if member be sensible and not greedy everyone should get in with no difficulty it be pleasure to speak during what hope be the final stage of the bill give that nearly all the bills on which have speak up to now have be money bills this business of come back from the lords and scrutinise lords amendment have not be part of my experience so if get anything wrong apologise like other member want to begin by thank number of people and organisation include the mental health foundation carnegie uk the internet watch foundation the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children and two researcher for the snp aaron lukas and josh simmonds upton for all their work advice knowledge and wisdom also join the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones and for gosport dame caroline dinenage in thank the family involve for the huge amount of time and energy and the huge amount of themselves that they have have to pour into the process in order to secure these change this be the beginning of the culmination of all their hard work it will make difference today and it will make difference when the bill be enact member in all part of the house will do what we can to continue to scrutinise its operation to ensure that it work as intend to ensure that child be keep as safe as possible online and to ensure that ofcom use these power to persuade platform to provide the information that they will be require to provide follow the death of child about that child use of social medium the bill be about keep people safe it be different bill from the one that begin its parliamentary journey think more than two year ago have see various minister lead from the dispatch box during that time but the voice around the chamber have be consistent from the conservative labour and snp benches all the member who have speak have agree that we want the internet to be safe place be extremely glad that the government have make so many concession that the opposition party call for congratulate the hon member for pontypridd on the inclusion of violence against woman and girl in the bill she champion that in committee and be glad that the government have make the change another change that the government have make relate to small high risk platform back in may or june last year table amendment and which call for that categorisation to be change so that it be not base just on the number of user think it be the hon member for gosport who mention and have mention kiwi farms number of time in the chamber such organisation can not be allow to get away with horrific vile content that encourage violence they can not be allow low bar just because they have small number of user the national risk register produce by the cabinet office great bedtime read which thoroughly recommend state that both the risk and the likelihood of harm and the number of people on whom it will have an impact should be take into account before decision be make it be therefore entirely sensible for the government to take into account both the number of user when it be significant number and the extremely high risk of harm cause by some of these provider the hon lady be make an excellent speech but it be critical to understand that this be not just about wickedness that would have take place anyway but be now take place on the internet it be about the internet catalyse and exaggerate that wickedness and spawn and encourage all kind of malevolence we have big responsibility in this place to regulate control and indeed stop this and the hon lady be right to emphasise that the right hon gentleman be entirely correct whether it involve particularly right wing cause or antisemitism or indeed dieting content that drag people into something more radical in relation to eat disorder the bubble mentality create by these algorithm massively increase the risk of radicalisation and we therefore have an increase duty to protect people as have say be pleased to see the positive change that have be make as result of opposition pressure and the uncompromise effort of those in the house of lords especially baroness kidron who have be nothing short of tenacious throughout the time in which we have be discuss the bill have speak to member of both houses about it and it have be very unusual to come across anyone who know what they be talk about and in particular have the incredible depth of knowledge understanding and wisdom show by baroness kidron be able to speak to she as someone who practically grow up on the internet we have it at home when be eight but she know far more about it than do be extremely pleased that the government have work with she to improve the bill and have accept that she have huge breadth of knowledge she manage to do what we do not quite manage to do in this house although hopefully we lay the foundation want to refer to number of point that be mention by the minister and be also mention in the letter that the government provide relate to the lords amendment algorithmic scrutiny be incredibly important and along with other member have raise it number of time again in connection with concern about radicalisation some organisation have be do well thing recently for instance someone who search for something may begin to go down rabbit hole some company be now put up flag for instance video suggest that user be go down dark hole and should look at something bit light and direct they away from the autoplaying of the more radical content if all organisation or at least significant number particularly those with high traffic can be encourage to take such action rather than allow people to be drive to more extreme content that will be positive step be pleased to hear about the upcoming researcher access report and about the report on app store ask previous minister about app store year or so ago and the minister say that they be not include and that be the end of it give the risk that be pose by app store the fact that they be not categorise as user to user content concern greatly someone who want to put something on an apple app store have to jump through apple hoop the content be not own by the app store and the same apply to some of the material on the playstation store it be own by the person who create the content and it be therefore user to user content in some case it be create by one individual there be no ongoing review of that age rating be another issue app store choose whatever age they happen to decide be the most important some of the date app such as have be active in that regard and have make it clear that their platform be not for or while the app store have rat the content as be for young age than the user actual age that be of concern especially if the company be try to improve age rating on the subject of age rating be pleased to see more in the bill about age assurance and the framework be particularly pleased to see what be go to happen in relation to try to stop child be able to access pornography that be incredibly important but it have be miss from the bill understand that baroness floella benjamin have do huge amount of work on push this forward and ensure that parliamentarian be brief on it and thank she for the work that she have do human trafficking have also be include again that be something that we push for and be glad to see that it have be put on the face of the bill want to talk briefly about the review mechanism then will go on to talk about end to end encryption be still concerned that the review mechanism be not strong enough we have push to have parliamentary committee convene for example to review this legislation this be the fast moving area of life thing be change so dramatically how many people in here have even hear of chatgpt year and half ago how many people have use virtual reality headset how many people have access rec room of any of the other vr system understand that the government have genuinely try their good to make the bill as future proof as possible but we have no parliamentary scrutiny mechanism write in be not try to undermine the work of the committee on this think it be incredibly important but select committees be busy and they have no legislative power in this regard if the government have write in review that would have be incredibly helpful the hon lady be make very good speech when first come to this house which be rather long time ago now there be companies act every year because company law be change at the time as be the nature of post war capitalism it seem to that there be strong argument for an annual act on the handling and management of the internet what she be say be exactly right and that be probably where we will end up completely support the right hon member point would love to see this happen on an annual basis be sure that the ministers who have shepherd the bill through would be terrify of that and that the government team sit over there be probably quake in their boot at the suggestion but give how fast this move think that this would be incredibly important the government record on post implementation review of legislation be pretty shoddy if you ask government departments what percentage of legislation they have put through post implementation review in the timeline they be suppose to they will say that it be very small some departments be bit well than other but give the number of reshuffle there have be some do not even know which piece of legislation they be suppose to be post implementation reviewing be concerned that this legislation will get lose and that there be no legislative back up to any of the mechanism for review it the minister have say that it will be keep under review but can we have some sort of governmental commitment that an actual review will take place and that legislation will be forthcoming if necessary to ensure that the implementation of this bill be carry out as intend we be not necessarily ask the government to change it we be just ask they to cover all the thing that they intend it to cover on end to end encryption on child sexual exploitation and abuse material and on the last resort provider have be consistent with every minister have speak to across the dispatch box and every time have speak to hon member about this when there be any use of child sexual exploitation material or child sexual abuse material we should be able to require the provider to find it that absolutely trump privacy the large increase in child sexual abuse material be in self generate content that be horrific we be see massive increase in that number we need provider to be able to search use the hash number that they can categorise image with or however they want to do it for people who be share this material in order to allow the authority to arrest they and put they behind bar so that they can not cause any more harm to child that be more important than any privacy concern although ministers have not put it in the bill until this point they have to their credit be clear that that be more important than any privacy concern and that protect child trump those concern when it come to abuse material and exploitation be glad to see that that be now write into the bill it be important that it be not just state at the dispatch box even though it be mention by number of member have speak about the huge number of online harm the huge number of issue with access the internet and the huge number of concern we have for the future but also need to say that the internet be wonderful place it be absolutely great to be able to go and play online game it be great to be able to have community of people that can speak to online and have conversation with it be good that the government have include in some of the risk the issue about platform where adult can contact child for example that be another thing address during the course of the amendment it be great that people can find their tribe online in way that they perhaps can not do in real life it be brilliant that people can have try out at be someone else online that be not about try to confuse or upset people or about catfishe sometimes we need to have wee bit of self exploration in order to try and work out who we be there be so many positive aspect of the internet but we need to ensure that child and the most vulnerable adult in particular be keep safe online this be not the perfect bill this be not necessarily the bill that would have like to see it have go through so many change and iteration over the time we have be try to scrutinise it that some of it have go back to what it previously look like except the harmful content in relation to adult be pleased that the internet will be safe place for our child and our child child be pleased that they will have more protection online have an amount of faith and cautious optimism in the work of ofcom because of how fast it have be scale up and because of the incredible people it have employ to work there they really know what they be talk about wish the government and ofcom every success in ensure that the bill be embed and ensure that the internet be as safe as possible would just really like commitment from the minister on ensure that this legislation be keep under proper review and that legislative change will be make should we identify any loophole the draft bill be publish in april so it be fantastic that we be now discuss its final stage after it have go through its process in the house of lords it go through pre legislative scrutiny then it be introduce here commit to the bill committee recommit come back to the house go to the lords and come back again do not think any bill have have as much scrutiny and debate over such long period of time as this one have have hon member have disagree on it from time to time but the spirit and motivation at every stage have never be political it have be about try to make the bill the good it can possibly be we have end up with process that have see it get well through all its stage pick up on the comment of the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman and other the question of ongoing scrutiny of the regime be an important one in the pre legislative scrutiny committee the joint committee that chair there be recommendation that there should be post legislative scrutiny committee or new joint committee perhaps for limited period the pre legislative scrutiny committee benefit enormously from be committee of both houses baroness kidron have rightly be mention by members today and she be watch we today from the gallery she be keep her scrutiny of the passage of the bill go from her position of advantage in the gallery we have discuss number of new technology during the bill passage that be not discuss at all on second reading because they be not live include the metaverse and large language model we be reassure that the bill be futureproof but we will not know until we come across such thing ongoing scrutiny of the regime the code of practice and ofcom risk register be more than any one select committee can do the government have previously speak favourably of the idea of post legislative scrutiny and it would be good if the minister could say whether that be still under consideration my hon friend make powerful point echo the comment of member on both side of the house he be absolutely right that as well as the scale and character of internet harm their dynamism be feature that government must take seriously the problem it seem to be that the pace of technological change in this area and in other do not fit easily with the thoroughness of the democratic legislative process we tend to want to do thing at length because we want to scrutinise they properly and that take time how do my hon friend square that in his own mind and what would he recommend to the government the length of the process we have go through on this bill be good thing because we have end up with probably the most comprehensive legislation in the world we have regulator with more power and more power to sanction than anywhere else it be important to get that right lot of the regulation be principle base it be about the regulation of user to user service whereby people share thing with each other through an intermediary service technology will develop but those principle will underpin lot of it there will be specific case where we need to think about whether the regulatory oversight work in metaverse environment in which we be deal with harm create by speech that have no footprint how do we monitor and scrutinise that one of the hard challenge could be make sure that company continue to use appropriate technology to identify and mitigate harm on their platform the problem we have have with the regime to date be that we have rely on self reporting from the technology company on what be or be not possible indeed the debate about end to end encryption be another example the company be say that if they share too much datum there be danger that it will break encryption but they will not say what datum they gather or how they use it for example they will not say how they identify illegal use of their platform can they see the message that people have send after they have send they they will not publicly acknowledge it and they will not say what datum they gather and what trigger they could use to intervene but the regulator will now have the right to see they that principle of accountability and the power of the regulator to scrutinise be the two thing that make confident that this will work but we may need to make amendment because of new thing that we have not yet think about in addition to the idea of annual scrutiny raise by my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden mr davis do my hon friend think it would be reasonably good idea for the select committee on culture media and sport to set up sub committee under its standing orders to keep any eye on this stuff my hon friend be great chairman of that select committee and such sub committee would allow the annual monitoring of all the thing that could go wrong and it could also try to keep up with the pace of change when chair the digital culture media and sport committee we set up sub committee to consider these issue and internet regulation of course the sub committee have the same member it be up to the select committee to determine how it structure itself and spend its time but there be only so much that any one departmental select committee can do among its huge range of other responsibility it might be worth think about special committee draw on the power and knowledge of both houses but that be not matter for the bill as my hon friend know it be matter of amend the standing orders of the house and the house must decide that it want to create such committee think it be something we should consider we must make sure that encrypt service have proper transparency and accountability and we must bring in skilled expert member have talk about researcher access to the company datum and information and it can not be free for all there have to be process by which researcher apply to get privileged access to company information indeed as part of respond to ofcom risk register company could say that allow researcher access be one of the way it seek to ensure safe use of its platform by seek the help of other to identify harm there be nothing to stop ofcom appoint many researcher the bill give ofcom the power to delegate its authority and its power to outside expert researcher to investigate matter on its behalf in my view that would be good thing for ofcom to do because it will not have all the expertise in house the power to appoint skilled person to use the power of ofcom exist within the bill and ofcom should say that it intend to use that power widely would be grateful if the minister could confirm that ofcom have that power in the bill it be very kind of you to call to speak mr deputy speaker apologise to your good self to the minister and to the house for arrive rather tardily my daughter and her husband have be stay with over the past few day when get up to make my wife and myself an early morning cup of tea find my two grandchild sit in the kitchen with their ipads which do not half bring home the danger look at they and think gosh hope there be security because they be just little kid worry about that kind of thing as everyone have say keep child safe be ever more important the bill progress show some of the good aspect of this place and the other place work together to improve legislation the shadow minister the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones and the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman both mention that and it have be encouraging to see how the bill have come together however as other have say it have take long time and there have be lot of delay perhaps that be unavoidable but it be regrettable it have be difficult for the government to get the bill to where it be today and the trouble be that the delay mean there will probably be more victim before the bill be enact we see before we much change bill and thank the lords for their amendment they have put in lot of hard work as other have say the secretary of state power worry my party and and wonder whether the bill still fail to tackle harmful activity effectively perhaps well thing could be do but we be where we be welcome the addition of new offence such as encourage self harm and intimate image abuse future bill might be need to set out the threshold for the prosecution of non fatal self harm we may also need further work on the intent requirement for cyber flashing and on whether ofcom can introduce such requirement be encourage by what we have hear from the minister we would also have like to see more movement on risk assessment as term of service should be subject to mandatory risk assessment my party remain unconvinced that we have get to grip with the metaverse this terrifying new thing that have come at we think there be work to be do on that and we will see what happen in the future as other have say education be crucial hope that my grandchild sit there with their ipads have be tell as much as possible by their teacher my daughter and my son in law about what to do and what not to do that lead on to the huge importance of the parent be able where necessary to intervene rapidly because this have to be do damn quickly if it look like they be go down black hole we want to stop that right away kid could see something horrid that could damage they for life it could be that bad once child see something they can not unsee it this be not just about parental control we hope that the requirement on the company to do the risk assessment and on ofcom to look at those will mean that those issue be stop before they even get to the point of require parental control hope that such an approach will make this safe by design when it begin to operate rather than rely on have an active parent who be not work three job and therefore have time to moderate what their child be do online the hon lady make an excellent point let just illustrate it by say that each of we in our childhood when we be little when we be four five or six see something that frighten we oddly enough we never forget that throughout the rest of life do we that be what bad dream be make of we should remember that point which be why those be wise word indeed finally shall try your excellent patience mr deputy speaker with few word about encryption to which reference have be make commend the government for their recognition of the danger that exist online and the inadequacy of current protection however regulation and enforcement must be base on clear evidence of well define harm and must respect the right to privacy and free expression of those who use social medium legally and responsibly on encryption for the vast majority privacy mean security we have always to test that theory but think that be what most of we believe if pick it up right the right hon member for haltemprice and howden mr davis say that this should be revisit on regular basis perhaps the adviser that ofcom will hire will address this sort of thing but this be about constant vigilance be it not let put it on the record that my party would fundamentally oppose any attempt to undermine or weaken encryption once again wish to thank all the member who have put together good piece of legislation in the spirit of generosity let say that the government have try their very good on tricky issue and give credit to those on both side of the house for this step in the right direction this bill may well have be with we since april and be subject to significant change but it remain bill about keep people safe online and it remain groundbreake welcome it back after scrutiny in the lords and join other in pay tribute to those who have campaign for social medium platform to release information follow the death of child be pleased that some be able to be with we today to hear this debate and the commitment to that issue this will never be perfect bill but we must recognise that it be good enough and that we need to get it on to the statute book the minister have help by say clearly that this be not the endgame and that scrutiny will be inherent in the future of this legislation hope that he will heed the comment of my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins who encourage he to set up bespoke committee which be one of the recommendation from the initial scrutiny of the bill will confine my remark to the government lords amendment and those surround it which insert the amendment table on report into the bill they relate to the sharing of intimate image online include deepfake without consent wish wholeheartedly to say thank you to the minister who always listen intently to the minister of state ministry of justice my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar who have recently join he and to the secretary of state for science innovation and technology they have all not only listen to the argument on intimate image abuse but act the change today be no less testament to their commitment to this bill than any other area focus on child safety be very important but the safety of adult online be also important we start on journey to address intimate image abuse way back in with the criminal justice and courts act and we have learn to provide that protection much well mostly through the work of the law commission and its report on how we should be tackle intimate image abuse online the bill as it have be amend have be change fundamentally on the treatment of intimate image abuse in line with the debate on report in this place that have create four new offence the base offence remove the idea of intent to cause distress entirely and rely only on whether there be consent from the person appear in the image two more serious offence do include intent with one be send an image with intent to cause alarm and distress we also now have the offence of threaten to share an image which will protect people from potential blackmail particularly from an abusive partner that will make huge difference for victim who be still overwhelmingly woman in his closing comment will the minister address the gap that still exist particularly around the issue of the image themselves which because of the scope of the bill will not become illegal he and his colleague have indicate that more legislation might be in the planning stage to address those particular recommendation by the law commission perhaps he could also comment on something that the revenge porn helpline be increasingly be tell by victim which be that online platform will not remove an image even though it may have be post illegally and that will not change in the future perhaps he can give and those victim who might be listen today some comfort that either there be way of address that matter now or that he will address it in the very near future as we reflect on the bill today it be important to say that it have be improve as it have progress through the parliament that be due in no small measure to member from across the party both here and in the other place who have engage very collegiately and to individual and group outside this place particularly the samaritans and those who have live experience of the consequence of the danger of the internet people from my constituency have also be involve include the family of joe nihill whom have mention previously at the age of joe take his own life after access dangerous suicide relate online content his mother catherine and sister in law melanie have bravely campaign to use the online safety bill as an opportunity to ensure that what happen to joe so tragically do not happen to other thank the minister and his team for meet joe mother his sister in law and and for listen to what we have to say recognise that as result the bill have improve in particular with the government acceptance of lords amendment which be first table by baroness morgan of cotes it be welcome that the government have accept the amendment which will enable platform to be place in category base on their functionality even if they do not have large reach that be important because some of the bad and most dangerous online suicide and self harm relate material appear on small platform rather than the large one also welcome the fact that the bill create new communication offence of encourage or assist self harm and make such content further priority for action which be important the bill provide an historic opportunity to ensure that tackle suicide and self harm relate online content do not end with this bill become law urge the government to listen very carefully to what the samaritans have say as my hon friend the shadow minister ask will the government commit to review of the legislation to ensure that it have meet the objective of make our country the safe place in the world in which to go online importantly can the government confirm when the consultation on the new offence of encourage or assist self harm will take place as mention in an intervention it be clear that the government want to tackle harmful suicide and self harm relate content with the bill but as we have hear throughout our discussion the measure do not go far enough the samaritans be correct to say that the bill represent welcome advance and that it have improve recently but it still do not go far enough in relation to dangerous suicide and self harm online content how will the government engage with people who have live experience people such as melanie and catherine to ensure that the new law make thing well nobody want the implementation of the bill to be the end of the matter we must redouble our effort to make the internet as safe place as possible reflect on the experience of my constituent joe nihill and his family and understand that there be lot of dangerous suicide and self harm relate content out there we be talk about people who exploit the vulnerable regardless of their age urge all those who be follow the progress of the bill and who look at this issue not to make the mistake of think that when we talk about dangerous online suicide and self harm relate content it be somehow about freedom of speech it be about protect people when we talk about dangerous online material relate to suicide and self harm it be not freedom of speech issue it be an issue of protect people have the hon gentleman note hope with satisfaction that the government yesterday and today have make statement on strategy for prevent suicide nationally and that what he be say which agree with will be implement it have just be announce it be very important and it be relate to the bill thank the hon gentleman for his intervention it be important that the government have announce strategy it be part and parcel of the ongoing work that be so necessary when we consider the prevalence of suicide as the lead cause of death among young man and woman it be scourge across society people should not make the mistake of think that the internet merely showcase awful thing the internet have be use as tool by exploitative and sometimes disturb individual to create more misery and more instance of awful thing happen and to lead other down dangerous path that sometimes end sadly in they take their own life thank the minister for his engagement with my constituent and the shadow minister for what she have do also thank baroness kidron baroness morgan and hon member who have engage with this issue urge the government to see the bill not as the end when it come to tackle dangerous online content relate to suicide and self harm but as part of an important ongoing journey that we all work on together rise to speak to lords amendment on visible identity verification will not press the amendment to vote have have several discussion with ministers and the secretary of state and be grateful for their time will explain little more the dry nature of the amendment mask the fact that the issue of identity verification or lack of it affect million of people around the country we increasingly live our life online so the public be able to know who be or be not real person online be key part of the uk be the safe the place to be on the internet which be the bill ambition unfortunately too often it feel as though we have to wade through nutter bot fake account and other nastie before come to real person we want to hear from the bill take huge step to empower user to change that but there be more to do hon member will recall that have campaign for year to tackle anonymous abuse thank stroud constituent celebrity and parent who have bring to sad story that have convey to the house involve abuse about the death of baby and child and about disabled child that be absolutely awful alongside smart stroud constituent and clean up the internet fantastic organisation we have fight and argue for social medium user to have the option of be verify online for they to be able to follow and be follow only by verified account if that be what they want and crucially to make it clear who be and be not verify online people can still be princess unicorn if they want but at the back end their address and detail can be hold and that will give confidence my hon friend be make powerful case umberto eco the italian philosopher describe the internet as the empire of imbecile and much of social medium be indeed imbecilic but it be much bad than that my hon friend be right that the internet provide hiding place for the kind of malevolence she have describe do she agree that the critical thing be for the government to look again at the responsibility of those who publish this material if it be write material the publisher would have legal liability that be not true of internet company be that way forward be interested in that intervention but fear it would lead we into very long discussion and want to keep my comment focus on my amendment however it would be interesting to hear from the minister in response to that point because it be huge topic for debate on the point about whether someone be real or not real online believe passionately that not only famous people or those who can afford it should be able to show that they be real and verified person say roll out the blue tick or the equivalent and not just to make the social medium perform more money as we have see we need it as safety mechanism and personal responsibility mechanism all the evidence and endless polling show that the public want to know who be and who be not real online and it do not take rocket science to understand why deal with faceless anonymous account be very scary and anonymous abuser be terrify parent be worried that they do not know who their child be speak to and anonymous unverified account can not be trace if detail be not hold that be before we get to how visible verification can help to tackle fraud we should empower people to avoid fake account we know that people be less likely to engage with an unverified account and it would make it easy to catch scammer fraud be the most common form of crime in with of all crime be fraud of all report fraud be initiate on social medium and of fraud be cyber related we can imagine just how fantastically clever the scam will become through ai since we start this process tech company have recognise the value of identity verification to the public so much so that they now sell it on twitter as blue tick and the government understand the benefit of identity verification option the government have do huge amount of work on that thank they for agree to two of the three pillar of my campaign and believe we can get there on visibility know from discussion with government that ofcom will be look carefully at that make thing simple for social medium user be incredibly important for the user verification provision in this bill to fulfil their potential and prevent harm include illegal harm we believe that user need to be able to see who be and be not verify that is who be real person and all the evidence say that that be what the public want while ministers in this place and the other place have resist put visible verification on the face of the bill be grateful to the government for their work on this after lot of to ing and fro ing we be reassure that the bill as now word give ofcom the power to do what the public want and what we be suggest through code and guidance we hope that ofcom will consider the role of anonymous inauthentic and non verify account as it prepare its register of risk relate to illegal content and in its risk profile pay tribute to the way my hon friend have focus on this issue through so many month and year do she agree that in light of the assurance that she have have from the minister this be just the sort of issue that either stand alone committee or some kind of scrutiny group could keep an eye on if those guideline do not work as the minister be hop the action she have suggest will need to be take absolutely give the fast nature of social medium and the tech world and how quickly they adapt often for their own benefit sadly think that committee with that focus could work to wrap up thank mp from across the house and you madam deputy speaker for your grace today have have help from my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden mr davis in particular for which be very grateful in the other place lord clement jones lord stevenson baroness morgan baroness fall and baroness wyld have all be absolutely excellent in push through these matter look forward to hear what the minister say and thank everybody for their time as other have do welcome the considerable progress make on the bill in the other place both in the detailed scrutiny that it have receive from noble lords who have take consistent and expert interest in it and in the positive and consensual tone adopt by opposition front benchers and crucially by ministers it seem that there be very few member of this house who have not have ministerial responsibility for the bill at some point in what have be an extraordinarily extensive relay race as it have move through its legislative stage the anchor leg the hard bit in such bill have be run with dedication and skill by my right hon friend the secretary of state who deserve all the praise that she will get for hold the baton as we cross the parliamentary finish line as hope we be close to do have be an advocate of humility in the way in which we all approach this legislation it be genuinely difficult and novel territory in general think that my right hon friend the secretary of state and her ministers the noble lord parkinson and of course the under secretary of state for science innovation and technology my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully have be willing to change their mind when it be right to do so and the bill be well for it like other who have deal with they also thank the official some of whom sit in the box some of whom do not they have dedicate as suspect they would see it most of their life to the generation of the bill and we be grateful to they for their commitment of course as other have say none of this mean that the bill be perfect frankly it be never go to be nor do it mean that when we pass the bill the job be do we will then pass the baton to ofcom which will have large amount of further work to do however we now need to finalise the legislative phase of this work after many year of consideration for that reason welcome in particular what think be sensible compromise on two significant issue that have yet to be resolve first the content of child risk assessment and secondly the categorisation process hope that the house will bear with while consider those in detail which we have not yet do start with lords amendment and and lords amendment in relation to search as well as the government amendment in lieu of they those lords amendment insert harmful feature functionality or behaviour into the list of matter that should be consider in the child risk assessment process and in the meeting of the safety duty to add to the harm arise from the intrinsic nature of content itself that be an important change as other have do pay great tribute to the noble baroness kidron who have invariably be the drive force behind so many of the positive enhancement to child online safety that the bill will bring she have promote this enhancement too as she say it be right to recognise and reflect in the legislation that child online experience can be harmful not just as result of the harm an individual piece of content can cause but in the way that content be select and present to that child in other word the way in which the service be design to operate as she know however part company with the lords amendment in the breadth of the language use particularly the word behaviour throughout our consideration of the bill have take the view that we should be less interested in pass legislation that sound good and more interested in pass legislation that work we need the regulator to be able to encourage and enforce improvement in online safety effectively that mean ask the online platform to address the harm that it be within their power to address and to relate clearly the design or operation of the system that they have put in place the difficulty with the wording of the lords amendment be that they bring into the ambit of the legislation behaviour that be not necessarily enable or create by the design or operation of the service the language use be feature functionality or behaviour include those enable or create by the design or operation of the service that be harmful to child in other word not limit to those that be enable or create by the service it be step too far to make platform accountable for all behaviour that be harmful to child without the clarity of that link to what the platform have itself do for that reason can not support those lords amendment however the government have propose sensible alternative approach in their amendment in lieu particularly in relation to lords amendment and lords amendment which relate to search service the government amendment in lieu capture the central point that design of service can lead to harm and require service to assess that as part of the child risk assessment process that be significant expansion of service responsibility in the risk assessment process which reflect not just ongoing concern about type of harm that be not adequately capture in the bill so far but the positive move we have all seek to make towards safety by design as an important preventive concept in online safety also think it be important give the potential scale of this expand responsibility to make clear that the concept of proportionality apply to service approach to this element of assessment and mitigation of risk as it do throughout the bill and hope the minister will be able to do that when he wind up the debate my right hon and learn friend have mention ofcom several time would like to ask his opinion as to whether there should be if there be not already special provision for report by ofcom on its own involvement in these process during the course of its annual report every year to be sure that we know that ofcom be do its job in parliament we know what select committees be do the question be what be ofcom do on continuous basis my hon friend make fair point one difficult part of our legislative journey with the bill be to get right in so far as we can the balance between what the regulator should take responsibility for what ministers should take responsibility for and what the legislature this parliament should take responsibility for we may not have get that exactly right yet on my hon friend specific point my understanding be that because ofcom must report to parliament in any event it will certainly be ofcom intention to report back on this it will be quite large slice of what ofcom do from this point onwards so it would be remarkable if it do not but think we will have to return to the point that my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins and other have make about the nature of parliamentary scrutiny that be then require to ensure that we be all on top of this progress as it develop be talk about what would like my hon friend the minister to say when he wind up the debate know he will not have huge amount of time to do so but he might also confirm that the balance duty in relation to freedom of speech and privacy for example continue to apply to the fulfilment of the safety duty in this context as well that would be helpful the government amendment in lieu do not replicate the reference to design in the safety duty themselves but do not see that as problematic because as understand it the risk identify in the risk assessment process which will now include design risk feed through to and give rise to the safety duty so that if design risk be identify in the risk assessment service be require to mitigate and address it again would be grateful if the minister confirm that we should also recognise that government amendment in lieu of lords amendment and government amendment and in lieu of lords amendment specifically require consideration of functionality or other feature of the service that affect how much child use the service as far as can tell that introduce consideration of design relate addiction recognisable to many parent it can not just be into the assessment process these change reflect the reality of how online harm to child manifest itself and the government be to be congratulate on include they although as say the government and subsequently ofcom will need to be clear about what these new expectation mean in practical term for platform consider its risk assessment process and seek to comply with its safety duty now turn to the amendment deal with the categorisation process which be lords amendment and the government amendment arise from it lord amendment would allow ofcom to designate service as category service with the additional expectation and responsibility that bring if it be of certain scale or if it have certain functionality rather than both be require as be the case in the original bill the effect of the original drafting be in essence that only big platform could be category platform and that big platform be bind to be category platform that give rise to two problem that as my hon friend the minister know we have discuss before the first problem be that small platform where highly harmful material be to be find whether organically or because it be seek refuge from the great regulation of large platform could not be make subject to more restrictive regime the second be that large platform whose operation give rise to very little concern in the context of this bill wikipedia be common example would have to be subject to more extensive regulatory requirement than be justify by the risk they really present lord amendment in the name of my right hon friend the noble baroness morgan seek to resolve those two problem at once give that propose an identical amendment in this house be unsurprisingly in favour of it and congratulate baroness morgan on do well job of persuade the other place of its merit than manage to do in this place be pleased to see the government effectively accept that amendment today finally will say few word about the amendment table by other right hon and hon member if you will forgive madam deputy speaker in the interest of time will not speak to all the amendment propose by my hon friend the member for yeovil mr fysh can see that you approve however from what have just say he will gather that can not support his amendment to lords amendment which would limit application of all the safety duty in the bill to provider of significant size and capacity and with substantial involvement in the communication of medium content can not support my hon friend amendment for both technical and substantive reason the technical reason be that lords amendment add an introductory clause to the bill that be design to be guide to its content and effect and his amendment to that clause be not follow through in the rest of the bill as such the introductory clause would say that the bill scope be limit to large platform only but the rest of the bill would not say the same the more substantive reason be that in my view my hon friend amendment be both inappropriate and unnecessary it be inappropriate because highly harmful content can be find on small platform and all platform should surely do what they can to minimise harm to child and the presence of illegal content on their service which be the focus of the bill it be unnecessary because the concept of proportionality run through the bill so the regulator expectation of small platform can and should be different from its expectation of large one my hon friend other amendment seek to avoid introduce by mean of the imposition of the safety duty what he describe as systemic weakness and vulnerability relate to compliance with the duty he seek to do so in number of place in the bill however that concept of systemic weakness and vulnerability be not define and could be extraordinarily wide potentially undermine the whole purpose of those safety duty be be slightly unfair to my hon friend because he have not speak yet but think he be primarily concerned with the bill effect on encrypt service other have express concern too my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden mr davis and the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas have make their concern know through their amendment to lords amendment which raise an important question about where we be on encryption throughout the progress of the bill ministers have be clear that it involve no ban on the use of encryption however as other have say there will need to be some further clarity not least by the way about the interaction of the regime we be create with the data protection regime and the involvement of the information commissioner office encryption clearly can not be get out of jail free card for safety duty compliance surely people can not say operate an encrypt service so do not have to comply with the safety duty do it therefore follow that if there be no prohibition on the use of encryption and no exemption from safety duty just because service use it each service that be within the scope of the bill and use encryption must show ofcom that it can meet its safety duty proportionately and with due weight give to balance duty particularly on privacy with the use of encryption if service can not do so do it follow that ofcom will require that service to not use encryption to the extent that that be necessary for it to meet its safety duty to ofcom satisfaction we need clarity on that point finally as say at the start the bill be not perfect and there be still much work to be do but if we can agree the final change we be discuss and indeed if their lordships be prepare to endorse that next week the very real prize to be win be that ofcom can begin the work that it need to do soon rather than later and we can bring near the benefit that this legislation can deliver for the vulnerable online more than that we can enhance the reputation of parliament as we show that we can do difficult legislation in otherwise fractious time with sincerity seriousness and willingness to compromise think that be valuable prize and one within our grasp and it be why shall support the government amendment it be pleasure to follow my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright who make characteristically thoughtful speech at the outset want to put on record my entry in the register of members financial interests and also my chairmanship of the all party parliamentary group on digital identity and on central bank and digital currency which include stablecoin also put on record the fact that be the father of an eight year old girl and nine year old girl who have both just get ipads and be very aware of the need to protect they as all other child in the uk just want to say that have have good engagement with ministers during the progress of this bill through all of its stage and want to thank they and their team for that also want to say that really welcome what be now in the bill to progress what talk about in this place at the last stage it be discuss which be the effect of algorithm and all of those design feature that be part of the addiction we have hear several member talk about as potential harm think it be really good that that be in the bill and it be really good that the tech company be be force to think hard about these thing my amendment they be proposal for amendment rather than one realistically think we would adopt through vote today be design to address couple of potential shortcoming see in the bill one be the potential chilling effect on innovation and in the use of really important service that be user to user service from technical point of view but be not involve in the transmission of the content we be try to deal with as the main objective of this bill so it be very welcome to hear my hon friend the minister speak at the dispatch box about the government intention not to cover the sort of service to do with datum exchange and multi party computation some of the more modern method by which the internet of thing artificial intelligence and various other type of platform run which be not about make content available that could be risk in the context we be talk about the other shortcoming be try to address be this idea come back to my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam of the potential for the introduction of systemic weakness and vulnerability into the core system that all our communication many of our service government service and other rely on day by day for their secure operation think he make very interesting point about the need to think through the precise legal impact that the potential uncertainty about some of those issue might have on the operation of those system be try to introduce amendment for example amendment in lieu of lords amendment essentially to provide clarification this be particularly important when we be think about the remote access power or the remote viewing of information power in lords amendment which be why have propose an amendment in lieu it be incredibly important that what we do in this bill do not create the really fundamental weakness that could undermine the security that we and all of our system rely on for their core operation be also try to address people understandable desire for their datum not to be potentially accessible by an unauthorised third party that type of systemic weakness which could be introduce by do the access process in the wrong way be something we need to think carefully about and hope the minister will say something about intent in respect of that at the dispatch box do not want to take too much more time because know that lot of other member wish to speak but the place where get these idea particularly around systemic weakness be power in australian law that be there to provide protection from exactly that type of application of the regulation know official think that lords amendment do not present such systemic risk because it be about view information remotely rather than have access to the system directly but think that need more clarity it actually state view remotely information in real time which could potentially be interpret as require that type of access on proportionality this be my last point we must think about the concept of necessity within that we must try to strike the right balance hope we will all try to do this between want to encourage tech firm to divulge how their system work and give people include the government tool to say when something be not work well and they want to opt out of it while also ensure that fundamental operative thing that be use in cryptography and computer system to communicate with each other securely be not inadvertently undermine let start like other by say how extraordinarily pleased be to see the bill return to the house today put on record my enormous gratitude to the many people who have work on it especially the family of those who have lose love one organisation such as the internet watch foundation of which have be champion for over decade the mental health foundation the many ministers who have work on this and especially the secretary of state who continue to work on it through her maternity leave and those in the other place it be wonderful to be at the bar of the other place listen to baroness kidron and other when they speak and thank she for be here today also particularly wish to thank baroness morgan and lord bethell few month ago at the beginning of the year go to one of those meeting that all mp do when they go and speak to politic student in their own sixth form they normally throw load of question at we but before let they throw question at say listen have question need to ask as back bencher in this place we get ask to work on so many different issue so grab the white board and scribble down list of many issue that have be ask to work on both domestically and internationally give the student each three vote and ask they what they want my priority to be the issue of tackle online pornography and the impact it be have be way up that list thank the children commissioner for the work do with young people to identify and understand that risk more our research ask to year old when they have first see online pornography and in have see online pornography by the age of nine and have see it by the age of so more than one in four fifty per be half that be every other one of those young people have see online pornography before they turn it be also the case that the type of pornography they have be see be increasingly more violent in nature and that be change young people attitude towards sex young people age to be more likely to assume that girl expect or enjoy sex involve physical aggression such as airway restriction strangle or slapping than those who do not see such pornography among the respondent state that girl expect sex to involve physical aggression and say that most girl enjoy act of sexual aggression some of respondent age to have experience violent sexual act the children commissioner also ask these young people where they be watch pornography and the great number of young people be watch that pornography on twitter now not pornography platform this be not just an issue in this country take delegation with the inter parliamentary union to the un commission on the status of women where we hold joint meeting with the women and equalities committee and it be stand room only with woman from hugely diverse part of the world include south korea india canada new zealand and many different european country say that in the uk we be see young and young child view online pornography that be increasingly violent in content lead to more violence in relationship and more sexual abuse ask they which of they be see that in their own country and every single hand in that room standing room only go up they have come to that room because they know that the uk be go to legislate in this area and they want to see what we do by pass the amendment work with the house of lords we will ensure that we have age assurance to stop young people be able to see pornography and not just on pornography site but on social medium site we be take massive step to safeguard our child and young people and the rest of the world will follow thank you for everything that have be do also want to talk about self harm and in particular eat disorder madam deputy speaker you will remember the last time speak about this matter and speak as former anorexic anorexia be the large killer of all mental health condition last week meet mental health expert in my constituency and they be talk about the increase we have see recently in acute mental health issue especially in people consider suicide and in people with eat disorder they completely agree from what they be see on the ground that online content encourage or glamorise self harm be part of what be fuel this rise that be why the mental health foundation beat and other charity have work so hard and thank they for their advice and work they have long call for well regulation of dangerous suicide and eat disorder forum be absolutely delighted that the government have accept and strengthen the amendment from baroness morgan of cotes because dangerous platform be not just large platform hear from the group meet last week about tiny forum that be set young woman their death date two young people have already kill themselves on their death date as set by this platform before the mental health expert have find out about it they have be able to rescue at least two other by know about it small platform can be really dangerous the amendment will enable small platform to be regulate in the same way as major platform such as facebook the mental health foundation say we be delighted that the government have accept the amendment this will make it hard for people to stumble upon the bad content and help protect their mental health the government be to be congratulate for this important change we also thank all parliamentarian from both houses and from all party who have support this change listen to my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright and absolutely agree with how he set out his support for this measure it be why be afraid we can not support the amendment from my hon friend the member for yeovil mr fysh in this area in particular want to make sure that the new criminal offence of intentionally encourage people to self harm cover eat disorder be grateful to the minister of state ministry of justice my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar for write to early this year on may confirm that the definition of serious self harm when it come to this offence will cover for example encourage someone not to eat not to drink or not to take prescribed medication he confirm that those provision be include with eat disorder in mind actually when we delve deep into this we see that it be sometimes not the individual bit of content but the way in which vulnerable person get bombard with content on those platform that can be so damaging last december the center for counter digital hate do some research into that and find that tiktok be bombard vulnerable user with harmful content every second that be how the algorithm be affect the issue therefore write back to the minister and ask he whether the offence would cover the algorithm as well as the content will try to be quick madam deputy speaker but want to put on the record exactly what he say because think it be important he say that the offence can not apply to algorithms themselves algorithms be design to automatically send people material that may be of interest to they it seem unlikely that if person merely create an algorithm and do not themselves send transmit or publish the communication for example they could be say to be undertake relevant act however every case will turn on its specific fact and if the circumstance be such that person action do constitute relevant act capable of encourage or assist the serious self harm of another person and that act be intend to encourage or assist the serious self harm of another person then the creator of the algorithm will be capture want to read that out in this place because it be really important that creator of algorithm be aware that there be risk that if they continue with this behaviour which be bombard our young people with this most dangerous content they could be catch under that offence will the minister in his closing remark kindly confirm from the dispatch box that that be exactly what the minister of state for justice put in writing to rise have three more speaker ask that colleague bear that in mind so that can bring in the minister would like to mention very long journey in relation to the protection of child because to my mind that be right at the heart of the bill social value think it be disraeli who say the youth of nation be the trustee of posterity if we get it right in the early stage of their life and we provide legislation that enable they to be properly protect we be likely to get thing right for the future the bill do that in very good way the bill also reflect some of the thing in which find myself involve in just over year ago with the protection of children bill when cyril townsend come top of the private member bill ballot mention that because at that time we receive resistance from government ministers and other be afraid must say that it be labour minister but we get the bill through as the then prime minister james callaghan eventually ensure it do so his wife insist on it as matter of fact pay tribute to the house of lords other have repeatedly mention the work of baroness kidron but would also like to mention lord bethell baroness morgan and other because it have be combined effort it have be parliament at its good have hear other include my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins and my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright make that point it have be remarkably lengthy but none the less essential process and pay tribute to those people for what they have do in retrospect would like to mention baroness lucy faithfull because back in would not have know what to do if she have not work relentlessly in the house of lords to secure the measure necessary to protect child from sexual image and pornographic photography it be about assault and do not need to go into the detail the bottom line be that it be the first piece of legislation that swing the pendulum towards common sense and proportionality in matter that year later have culminate in what have be discuss in the bill and the amendment today pay tribute to ian russell and to the other here whose child have be catch up in this terrible business pay specific tribute to the secretary of state and the minister and also the health secretary for his statement yesterday about national suicide strategy in which he reference amendment to the bill because have have lot to do with he would like to pay tribute to richard collard of the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children who have not be mention yet for work so hard and effectively pay tribute to my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates for her work to help get the amendment through the write ministerial statement come after some interesting discussion with the minister who be bit surprised by our vehemence and determination it be not chariot of fire but chariot on fire and within three week by the time the bill get to the house of lords we have write ministerial statement that set the tone for the part of the bill that discuss just now to protect child because they need protection at the right time in their life the nspcc tell we that of uk adult want company to understand how groomer and child abuser use their site to harm child and want action to prevent it by law come up with the idea although the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge give we lot of support in debate in this house at the time and be grateful to she for that the fact that we be able to come forward with this legislation owe great deal to lot of people from different part of the house very much accept that continue review be necessary many idea have be put forward in this debate and be sure that the minister be take they all on board and will ensure that the review happen and that ofcom act accordingly which be sure it will want to it be important that that be do must mention that the fact we have leave the european union have enable we to produce legislation to protect child that be very significantly strong than european union legislation the digital services act fall very far short of what we be do here pay tribute to the government for promote idea base on our self government to protect our voter child and our society that step could only have be take now that we have leave the european union research by the nspcc demonstrate that four in five victim of online grooming offence be girl it be worth mention that because it be significant piece of research that mean that there have to be clear guidance about the type of design that will be incorporate by virtue of the discussion to be have about how to make all this legislation work properly the only other thing would like to say be that the million suicide prevention grant fund announce yesterday complement the bill very well it be important that we have degree of symmetry between legislation to prevent suicide and to ensure that child be keep safe there be much more could say but do not need to say any more except to say thank you to everybody in this house and in the other place and to official for the advice we have receive from the department and for the co operation we have have believe that this will be groundbreaking bill when it be apply in practice it be not enough just to pass piece of legislation the question be how we manage to implement they that to my mind be the most important thing thank everybody concerned for the work they have do to make sure the bill will eventually reach the statute book will follow on from the remark make by my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford who talk powerfully about the impact of online pornography particularly on child who see it sadly online pornography be increasingly violent many video depict graphic and degrading abuse of woman sicken act of rape and incest and many underage participant also want to refer to the excellent study by the children commissioner which reveal that the average age at which child first encounter pornography online be just year old and that there be million visit to pornography site by british child each and every month as my right hon friend say that be rewire child brain in respect of what they think about sex what they expect during sex and what they think girl want during sex think we will all look back on this widespread child exposure to pornography in similar way to how we look back on child work down mine or be condemn to the poor house future generation will wonder how on earth we abandon our child to online pornography end the ready availability of pornographic content to child and criminalise those who fail to protect they should surely be the most important goal of the online safety bill indeed that be most of the aim of part of the digital economy act which be never enact without the government amendment table in the lords last week which strongly support the online safety bill would have be in danger of miss this opportunity as my colleague have do want to thank the secretary of state and ministers for their engagement in what have be cross party campaign both in this place and the other place with baroness kidron and lord bethell lead the way along with charity and the campaigning journalist charles hymas at the daily telegraph who do fantastic job of report it all so powerfully also thank my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash who have teach all ever need to know about how to negotiate with government we now have these brilliantly strengthen amendment include significantly an amendment that will criminalise director and manager if they do not comply with ofcom enforcement notice in relation to specific child safety duty that be really important because we be talk about the wealthy company in the world just have fine will not be enough to generate the kind of culture change at board level that we need only potential jail term which have work in the construction industry and the financial service industry will do what it take lord amendment and make pornography primary priority harm for child importantly user to user provider as well as dedicated adult site will now be explicitly require to use highly effective age verification tool to prevent child access they the wording highly effective be crucial because porn be porn wherever it be find whether on twitter which as my right hon friend the member for chelmsford say be the most likely place for child to find pornography or on dedicated adult site it have the same effect and cause the same harm it be therefore vital that tech company will actually have to prevent child from go on their site and not just try hard that be an incredibly important amendment do my hon friend agree that what have really put their tooth on edge most of all be the idea that they might go to prison my hon friend be completely right the impact of not take responsibility for protect child have to go to the very top lord amendment would compel ofcom to submit its draft code of practice within month that be an improvement on the previously lax timescale which welcome along with the other significant improvement that have be make and repeat my gratitude to the minister and the secretary of state let we not pretend however that on royal assent our child will suddenly be safe from online pornography or any other online harm there be serious question to be ask about ofcom capability to enforce against non compliant porn site and think we should look again at part of the digital economy act which would have allow the british board of film classification to act as the regulator congratulate the hon lady on the excellent effort she have make over long period to highlight these matter do she agree that this be not the end but only the beginning of the first day of ensure that we have proper digital access protection for not only child but adult who have access to digital device thank the hon gentleman for his support what he say be entirely correct the key to this do of course lie in the implementation one of the capability of the bbfc be to disrupt the business model and the payment provision of the adult online industry ask the minister to consider whether he can direct ofcom to examine the way in which the bbfc deal with offline and stream pornography and whether ofcom could learn some lesson from that there be still disparity between the kind of pornography that be allow offline on dvd or stream service and the kind that appear online offline certain act be illegal and the bbfc will not classify the content any act that look non consensual for example be illegal and the material can not be distribute whereas online it proliferate the bill should have be the perfect vehicle to expand those rule to all online service offer pornographic content sadly we have miss that opportunity but nevertheless welcome the government recently announce porn review hope it can be use to close the online offline gap to insert verification check for people appear in pornographic video and to deal with related offence many of those people do not consent and do not know that they be in the video we also need to take account of the complete lack of moderation on some of the site it be recently reveal in court case in the united states that pornhub site have be flag for illegal content but have not be check pornhub have manage to check just video day and have acknowledge that unless video have be flag more than time for potential criminal content such as child rape it will not even join the queue to be moderate and potentially take down the child and the trafficked woman who appear in those video be see their abuse repeat million of time with no ability to pull it down the bill have be controversial and many of the argument have concern issue of free speech be supporter of free speech but violent pornography be not free speech draw child into addiction be not free speech knowingly allow child to view horrific sex crime be not free speech publishing and profit from video of child be rap be not free speech it be sicken it be evil it be destructive and it be crime and it be crime from which too many profit with impunity third of the internet consist of pornography the global porn industry revenue be estimate to be as much as billion the bill be an important step forward but we would be naive to expect this goliath of an industry to roll over and keep child safe there be much more to be do which will require international co operation co operation from financial institution and government who be prepared to stand their ground against the might of these vest interest very much hope that this one will want to speak briefly about lords amendment and which would allow ofcom coroner and bereaved parent to acquire information and support relate to child use of social medium in the event of that child tragic death specifically want to speak about archie battersbee who live in my constituency but lose his life tragically last year age only archie mum hollie be in the public gallery at the beginning of the debate and hope that she be still present hollie find archie unconscious on the stair with ligature around his neck the brain injury archie suffer put he into four month coma from which sadly doctor be unable to save he to this day hollie believe that archie may have be take part in some form of highly dangerous online challenge but unable to access archie online datum beyond day of his search history she have be unable to put this devastating question to rest like the parent of molly breck isaac frankie and sophia for the last year hollie have be engage in cruel uphill struggle against faceless corporation in her attempt to determine whether her child engagement with digital service contribute to his death despite know that archie view seven minute of content and receive online message in the hour and half prior to his death she have no way of know what may have be say or exactly what he may have view and the question of his online engagement and its potential role in his death remain unsolved lord amendment which will bolster ofcom information gather power will hope require much more humane response from provider in such tragic case as this this be vital and much need legislation have it be in place year ago it be highly likely that hollie could have lay her concern to rest and perhaps receive pocket of peace in what have be the most traumatic time any parent could possibly imagine also welcome lords amendment which will mandate the large provider to put in place dedicated helpline so that parent who suffer these tragic event will have direct line and well way of communicate with social medium provider but the proof of the pudding will obviously be in the eating very much hope that social medium provider will man that helpline with real people who have the appropriate experience to deal with parent at that tragic time in their life believe that hollie and the parent of many other child in similar tragic case will welcome the government amendment that allow ofcom coroner and bereaved parent to access their child online datum via the coroner direct ofcom pay tribute to the noble baroness kidron to my right hon friend the member for bromsgrove sajid javid and to the bereaved families for online safety group who have do so much fantastic work in share their heartrende story and open our eye to what have be necessary to improve the online safety bill also of course pay tribute to ian russell to hollie and to all the other bereaved parent for their dedication to raise awareness of this hugely important issue if could just say one last thing have be slip from the education committee to attend this debate today and would like to give an advert for the committee new inquiry which be launch on monday into the effect of screen time on education and wellbeing this bill be not the end of the matter in many way it be just the beginning and urge all member please to engage with this incredibly important inquiry by the education committee thank all right hon and hon member for their contribution to the debate today and indeed right through the passage of this complex bill first let turn to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for yeovil mr fysh understand that the intention of his amendment be to restrict the reach of the new online safety regulatory regime in number of way appreciate his concern to avoid unnecessarily burdensome business and be sympathetic to his point that the bill should not inhibit sector such as the life science sector reassure he that such sector be not the target of this regime and that the new regulatory framework be proportionate risk base and pro innovation the framework have be design to capture range of service where there be risk of significant harm to user and the build in exemption and categorisation will ensure it be properly target the alternative would be narrow scope which would be more likely to inadvertently exempt risky science or to displace harm on to service that be out of scope the extensive discussion on this point in both houses have make it clear that such position be unlikely to be acceptable the amendment to the overarching statement that would change the service in scope would introduce unclear and subjective term cause issue of interpretation the bill be design so that low risk service will have to put in place only proportionate measure that reflect the risk of harm to their user and the service provider size and capacity ensure that small provider will not be overly burden unless the level of risk require it the amendment that would ensure ofcom can not require the use of proactive technology that introduce weakness or vulnerability into provider system duplicate exist safeguard it also introduce vague term that could restrict ofcom ability to require platform to use the most effective measure to address abhorrent illegal activity ofcom must act proportionately and it must consider whether less intrusive measure could achieve the same effect before require the use of proactive technology ofcom also have duty to protect both privacy and private property include algorithms and code under the human rights act thank the minister for engage with we on access to private property and for set up with his official consultation on the right to access person phone after they be deceased or incapacitate thank he for incorporate some of those thought in what he and the government be do today hope this be the start of something and that these big digital company will no long be able to bully people the boot will be on the other foot and the public will own what they have on their digital device the hon gentleman be talk about the access of coroner family and other to information follow the sad death of molly russell again pay tribute to ian russell and all the campaigner be glad that we have be able to find an answer to very complex situation not only because of its international nature but because of datum protection et cetera the measure have outline will ensure that risk relate to security vulnerability be manage the bill be also clear that ofcom can not require company to use proactive technology on privately communicate content in order to comply with their safety duty which will provide further safeguard for user privacy and datum security will the minister make it clear that we should expect the company to use proactive technology because they already use it to make money by recommend content to people which be principal reason for the bill if they use proactive technology to make money they should also use it to keep people safe my hon friend absolutely nail it he say early that business be already collect this datum since be first involve with the bill it have primarily be about get business to adhere to their own term and condition the datum they use should be use in that way the amendment to the definition of freedom of expression in part would have no effect as these concept be already cover by the exist definition change the definition of automated tool would introduce untested term and would have an unclear and confusing impact on the duty my hon friend the member for yeovil also ask for clarification of how ofcom power to view information remotely will be use and whether the power be sufficiently safeguard assure the house that this power be subject to strict safeguard that mean it can not be use to undermine provider system on third reading in the other place the government introduce amendment that define the regulator power to view information remotely whereas previously the bill speak of access as such there be no risk to system security as the power do not enable ofcom to access the service ofcom also have duty to act proportionately and must abide by its privacy obligation under the human rights act ofcom have stringent restriction on disclose business commercially sensitive and other information without consent my hon friend also ask for clarification on whether ofcom will be able to view live user datum when use this power generally ofcom would expect to require service to use test dataset however there may be circumstance where ofcom ask service to execute test use datum that it hold for example in test how content moderation system respond to certain type of content on service as part of an assessment of the system and process in that scenario ofcom may need to use provider own test dataset contain content that have previously violate its own term of service however that would be subject to ofcom privacy obligation and datum protection law lord amendment seek to explicitly exempt low risk functionality from aspect of user to user service child risk assessment duty be happy to reassure my hon friend that the current drafting of the government amendment in lieu of lords amendment place proportionate requirement on provider it explicitly exclude low risk functionality from the more stringent duty to identify and assess the impact that high risk functionality have on the level of risk of harm to child proportionality be far bake into this duty through ofcom risk assessment guidance ofcom be bind by the principle of proportionality as part of its general duty under the communications act as update by the bill as such it would not be able to recommend that provider should identify and assess low risk functionality the amendment to lords amendment table by my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden mr davis would introduce new safeguard that require ofcom to consider whether technology require under clause notice would circumvent end to end encryption wish to reassure he and other who have raise the question that the amendment be unnecessary because it be duplicative of exist measure that restrict ofcom use of its power under the bill safeguard ofcom can not require platform to weaken or remove encryption and must already consider the risk that specify technology can result in breach of any statutory provision or the rule of law concern privacy we have intentionally design the bill so that it be technology neutral and futureproofed so we can not accept amendment that risk the legislation quickly become out of date that be why we focus on safeguard that uphold user right and ensure measure that be proportionate to the specific risk rather than focus on specific feature such as encryption for the reason have set out can not accept the amendment and hope it will not be press to vote the amendment table by my hon friend the member for stroud siobhan baillie would create an additional reporting requirement on ofcom to review as part of its report on the use of the age assurance whether the visibility of user verification status improve the effectiveness of age assurance but that duplicate exist review requirement in the bill the bill already provide for review of user verification under clause the secretary of state will be require to review the operation of the online safety regulatory framework as whole this review must assess how effective the regulatory framework be at minimise the risk of harm that in scope service pose to user in the uk that may include review of the effectiveness of the current user verification and non verify user duty thank my hon friend also for raise the issue of user verification and the visibility of verification status be pleased to confirm that ofcom will have the power to set out guidance on user verification status be visible to all user with regard to online fraud or other illegal activity mandatory user verification and visibility of verification status be something ofcom could recommend and require under legal safety duty let quickly cover some of the other point raise in the debate thank my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage former minister for all her work she talk about young people and the bill contain many measure for example on self harm or suicide content that reflect they and will still help to protect they on the comment make by the hon member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman and indeed the shadow minister the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones whom be glad to see back in her place there be number of review point clause require the secretary of state to review how the bill be work in practice and there will be report result from that which will be lay before parliament we also have the annual ofcom report that talk about and most statutory instrument in the bill will be subject to the affirmative procedure the bill refer to review after two to five year minister can dictate when it take place within that period but that be base on allow long enough time for the bill to bed in and be implement it be important that we have the ability to look at that in parliament the un convention on the right of the child principle be already in the bill although the bill do not cite the report by name the eu convention principle be all cover in the bill my hon friend the member for folkestone and hythe damian collins do an amazing job in his time in my role and before and afterwards as chair of the joint committee responsible for the pre legislative scrutiny of the online safety bill when he talk about scrutiny have the advantage of see the wry smile of the official in the box behind he that scrutiny have be go on since sarah connolly one of our amazing team of official have be involve with the bill since it be just concept as carnegie uk trust observe online child bear on the day the government first publish their original internet safety strategy would now be in its second year of primary school do not think need to respond to that but it go to show do it not my hon friend talk about post legislative scrutiny now that we have the new department of science innovation and technology we have extra capacity within committees to look at various aspect and not just online safety as important as that be it also give we the ability to have sub committees clearly we want to make sure that this and all the decision that we make be scrutinise well we be always open to look at what be happen my hon friend talk about ofcom be able to appoint skilled person for research totally agree and he absolutely make the right point my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller and the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone talk about flashing as have say that have come within the scope of the bill but we will also be implement broad package of offence that will cover the taking of intimate image without consent to answer my right hon friend point yes we will still look far at that matter the hon member for leeds east richard burgon talk about joe nihill will he please send my good wish and thank to catherine and melanie for their ongoing work in this area it be always difficult but it be admirable that people can turn tragedy into such positive cause my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright make two point with which absolutely agree they be very much cover in the bill and in our thinking as well so say yes to both my right hon friend the member for chelmsford vicky ford and my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates talk about pornography clearly we must build on the online safety bill we have the pornography review as well which explore regulation legislation and enforcement we very much want to make sure that this be the first stage but we will look at pornography and the enforcement around that in deep way over the next month it have just cross my mind that the minister might be say that he agree with everything that say which can not be right let be clear about the two point one be in relation to whether when we look at design harm both proportionality and balancing duty be relevant think that he be say yes to both the other point that raise with he be around encryption and whether put it in the right way in term of the government position on encryption if he can not deal with that now and would understand if he can not will he write to and set out whether that be the correct way to see it thank my right hon friend for that intervention indeed end to end encrypt service be in the scope of the bill company must assess the level of risk and meet their duty no matter what their design be can the minister confirm whether the letter receive from the minister of state ministry of justice my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar be accurate be just come to that thank my right hon friend for the rest of her speech she always speak so powerfully on eat disorder on anorexia in particular and can indeed confirm the intent behind the minister letter about the creation and use of algorithm finally shall cover two more point my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash always speak eloquently about this he talk about brexit but will not get into the politic of that suffice to say it have allow we as in other area of digital and technology to be flexible and not prescriptive as we have see in measure that the eu have introduce also ask my hon friend the member for southend west anna firth to pass on my thank and good wish to hollie whom meet to talk about archie battersbee on the small high harm platform that be now in the scope of the bill will the minister join in thank hope not hate the antisemitism policy trust and cst which have campaign heavily on this point while we have be have this debate the cst have expose bitchute one of those small high harm platform for geoblocke some of the hate to comply with legislation but then advertise loophole and way to get around that on the platform can the minister confirm that the regulator will be able to take action against such proceeding will certainly look at that our intention be that in all area especially relate to child and their protection that might not fall within the user enforcement duty we will look to make sure that the work of those organisation be reflect in what we be try to achieve in the bill we have talk about the various ministers that have look after the bill during its passage and the secretary of state be leave literally hold the baby in every sense of the word because she continue to work on it while she be on maternity leave we can see the result of that with the engagement that we have have urge all member on both side of the house to consider carefully the amendment have propose today in lieu of those make in the lords know every member look forward eagerly to future in which parent have surety about the safety of their child online that future be fast approach reiterate my thank to esteemed colleague who have engage so passionately with the bill it be due to their collaborative spirit that stand today with amendment that we believe be effective proportionate and agreeable to all hope all member will feel able to support our position amendment make to lords amendment lord amendment as amend agree to amendment and make to lords amendment lord amendment as amend agree to amendment make to lords amendment lord amendment as amend agree to government consequential amendment make lord

lords amendment and order that committee be appoint to draw up reason to be assign to the lords for disagree to their amendment and that paul scully steve double alexander stafford paul howell alex davies jones taiwo owatemi and kirsty blackman be member of the committee that paul scully be the chair of the committee that three be the quorum of the committee that the committee do withdraw wood committee to withdraw immediately reason to be report and communicate to the lords dangerous drug beg to move that the draft misuse of drugs act amendment order which be lay before this house on september be approve the order propose an amendment to paragraph of part of schedule to the misuse of drugs act to bring nitrous oxide under the control of that act as class drug in september follow increase report of the harm associate with the use of nitrous oxide the government commission the advisory council on the misuse of drugs to undertake an independent assessment of it the government request that the acmd include in its assessment recommendation on the appropriate legislative control of the substance thank the acmd for the update harm assessment that it publish in march its work have be helpful and we be grateful for the time it spend advise the government on this and other issue the acmd report do not recommend the control of nitrous oxide under the mda but it do note concern health harm such as nerve damage on health harm do the minister acknowledge that the amendment be just tinker with an act that do not address the health harm of drug do he agree that wide review of the act which be half century old be need to take drug dealer off the street tackle sinister organise crime and treat those with addiction issue with compassion do not agree that the amendment be tinker it be an important measure as will outline in just moment on action against drug abuse more generally we have whole year drug strategy that we be year and half into it include tough enforcement at the border and action to disrupt criminal gang who deal drug we have record level of drug seizure recently in addition we be invest record sum in drug million extra over three year period and increase the number of treatment place by so there be comprehensive programme of work both on enforcement to break drug importation and drug gang and critically on treatment to help people out of addiction and into well life thank the minister for clearly outline the government intention the amendment deal very specifically with nitrous oxide and welcome it the government have recognise the need to make change would like more stringent drug control as think would the minister but bear in mind the government intention and the intention of some member to divide the house can the minister confirm that the amendment will not place more onerous condition on those who need to use nitrous oxide such as dentist will they be outside its scope at the same time the need for the law be clear yes can provide that assurance will expand on this later but those who be use nitrous oxide for legitimate purpose which include the catering industry the dental sector research and even semiconductor manufacture will be outside the scope of these restriction the hon gentleman touch on the control of harmful drug more generally it be important to control harmful drug particularly where they be very addictive and cause health harm we have see in city in north america that have liberalise their drug law substantially such as san francisco portland and some canadian city that it have result in widescale public health problem know that the minister be go to bring up portland at some point there have be clarion call to the extreme right wing to clamp down on drug policy but we have to look at portland in its entirety yes it decriminalise drug but it also cut back all its support service drastically and have fentanyl crisis at exactly the same time that create perfect storm for the damage that have be do there we would not want to undermine some of the good work that have be do there as well well if we look at the centre of san francisco at the moment it be not very happy sight the de facto decriminalisation of drug and indeed the failure to police certain criminal offence such as shoplifting have lead to disastrous outcome and be determined that we do not see the same in our jurisdiction do accept that treatment be very important which be why we be invest all that extra money in treatment the minister talk about problem in san francisco do he agree that this legislation will also help to stop the havoc that nitrous oxide be wreak in our coastal community in particular by tackle the increase availability of these high harm large canister last summer southend police confiscate on one day welcome this motion and thank the minister for engage with and other member across the house and listen to our concern thank my hon friend for her kind word the campaigning that she have do on behalf of her southend constituent be an important part of why we be move this motion can see my hon friend the member for wyre forest mark garnier in his place recall westminster hall debate just few month ago in which he and other colleague raise the harm that nitrous oxide be do in their community people may sometimes wonder about the value of westminster hall debate but can honestly say that the contribution make by my hon friend the members for southend west anna firth and for wyre forest and other be instrumental in bring about this change be grateful to my right hon friend for mention that westminster hall debate do he agree that campaigner such as dr david nicholl an eminent neurosurgeon in bromsgrove be also instrumental he be responsible for raise with and many colleague the unbelievable harm that this do to child who think that because it be call laugh gas it be amusing but it actually cause profound neurological problem for those who use it too much my hon friend be right to point to dr nicholl work and thank he again for his campaigning on this issue without which we possibly would not be here today take this legislation through parliament the evidence we have see about the neurological damage cause in particular by large scale consumption of nitrous oxide be very worrying neurological unit around the country have see case of people who have be paralyse and suffer really quite serious consequence the number be not enormous but they be extremely worrying and the severe case include paralysis be deeply concern agree completely with what my hon friend just say draw the house attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests until recently be an act consultant addiction psychiatrist on the point about other us of nitrous oxide legitimate medicinal and industrial us move it away from the psychoactive substance regulation to the misuse of drugs act put number of limitation on its use in its current setting what consultation have my right hon friend or his department do with the medical sector as whole and also with other commercial provider or user of nitrous oxide in advance of lay these regulation before the house we have conduct further engagement and consultation with the acmd and other in industry to understand the implication of this move be jump ahead little but we intend to table further statutory instrument that will take effect alongside this one which will make it clear that the sale and use of nitrous oxide for legitimate purpose will not be criminalise in any way it will continue to be permit the definition of legitimate use will be very broadly draw in that si because nitrous oxide be use for wide range of medical research and commercial purpose and we be not go to try to comprehensively list those purpose wide base exemption for legitimate use will be put in place to make sure that we do not unintentionally stymie either medical research or commercial use of this drug it be worth say that the use of nitrous oxide be quite widespread among those age to could we have little clarity on those two si do that mean that there be go to be period in which otherwise legitimate us will be illegitimate until the new si be in place and be that new si need because people come forward and say whoop you ve miss this use be not quite sure how the two si be go to interact no there will be no gap and it be not unintentional or inadvertent it be just likely that we will have to amend the way schedule to the act work in order to create this new category essentially to accommodate nitrous oxide the two si will be implement on the same day there will be no lacuna or gap that be just how we have to sequence the secondary legislation under the act let return to the question of prevalence some young people inhale this harmful substance in the year end june it be the third most misuse substance among that age group and as we have discuss already there be evidence that it have harmful neurological effect particularly when consume in quite large quantity beyond that we know that nitrous oxide have significant effect on antisocial behaviour indeed we announce the measure for which we be legislate today in the antisocial behaviour action plan again thank parliamentary colleague for raise the impact that nitrous oxide have have on their community it be fuel antisocial behaviour and have an impact on the decent hard work majority who want to use their local park or go down their local high street without be harass by antisocial behaviour or see the little silver canister litter all over the place to give an illustration of the scale of the problem after the notting hill carnival couple of week ago it be estimate that tonne of those nitrous oxide canister and other be collect from the street by the clean up crew that be an extraordinary amount how many tonne of beer can be collect the hon gentleman will be aware that the consumption of beer do not generally speak lead to severe neurological damage and paralysis in the way that the consumption of large amount of nitrous oxide do do not wish to be disoblige to the minister but the acmd be very clear that it do not believe that the medical harm of nitrous oxide pose anything like the significance of those cause by many other street drug or indeed alcohol alcohol relate brain damage cause much more neurological harm than many street drug do so think it would be helpful for the minister to correct the record on that point have refer to the acmd advice before and the acmd do note the anecdotal report of severe paralysis cause by excessive nitrous oxide consumption to which have refer already on this occasion rarely but not uniquely disagree with acmd advice the government as we be entitle to do take broad view we think about the association with antisocial behaviour and about the fact that among to year old nitrous oxide be the third most used harmful substance and that be why we take the step we do of course acknowledge that as my hon friend say alcohol can have an adverse effect as well but we feel that in this particular case the misuse of nitrous oxide merit action many member have raise concern about the effect it have have in their community and we be respond at least in part to the concern that member have raise nitrous oxide be currently regulate under the psychoactive substances act it be not of course currently an offence to possess nitrous oxide it be only an offence under the psa to knowingly or recklessly sell it for personal consumption so by control nitrous oxide as class drug under the misuse of drugs act it will not just be an offence to recklessly or intentionally sell this substance for personal consumption but be an offence to possess it except for the legitimate use exemption mention early as say in response to my hon friend early intervention we will be bring through further si to set out the definition of those legitimate us as say moment or two ago those will be extremely wide range to make sure we do not inadvertently stymie legitimate commercial medical or research use in summary it be clear that drug misuse ruin life in the case of nitrous oxide it also contribute significantly to antisocial behaviour the government have listen to the public and to parliamentarian who have be speak for their constituent and that be why we be take this action call the shadow minister nitrous oxide cause significant problem in our community as we have hear it be the third most misuse substance among to year old it lead to antisocial behaviour and the litter associate with it be blight on our street park and pavement we know from our own mailbag that our community be sick of have to literally and figuratively pick up after the problem that nitrous oxide create we feel that what the government be propose be relatively minor change to how we approach this and we do not intend to stand in the way but do have number of question that hope the minister can address it have to be say that as psychoactive substance nitrous oxide be already cover by the psychoactive substances act in practice that mean it be already an offence to produce it supply it offer to supply it possess it with the intent to supply it import it or export it on similar basis the only thing that be not an offence be the possession of it outside custody that be in practice what will be different as result of this instrument so would say as do at the beginning that this be relatively modest be glad that the minister have address the point relate to the advisory council on the misuse of drugs because it be important when the government diverge from what their independent adviser tell they which they be of course able to do that they explain why they be do so the opposition view be that we would have give great weighting to the creation and impact of antisocial behaviour than the acmd do in its report which be why take action be reasonable the acmd do raise other point and the minister have cover they to some degree but want to get some great clarity start with the legitimate use of nitrous oxide we hear couple of answer from the minister originally that there would be no change but later that there would be follow up statutory instrument to make sure there be no change those two thing be slightly different think hear he say that they will come into force on the same day so there will be no interregnum but would be grateful for more clarity if he be willing to say that that be the case the acmd report also discuss tight definition of nitrous oxide so that lawful activity be not disrupt the minister in his response seem to indicate that he be minded to do that could he say what the timeline might be it also raise the crucial point about the move from the act to the act and that the impact of that ought to be keep under review can he confirm that will be the case because we do need to know that this will not excessively criminalise certain group especially young people it be clear that the act be vastly out of date and have many adverse consequence in its application wonder whether those on the labour front bench would welcome the idea of our commit to review the use of that act and to update and modernise it be not say we should scrap it but we definitely need to investigate its use that would give some reassurance and enable to do what those on the front bench be ask later on be afraid that be go to disappoint my hon friend by not set such broad policy while debate statutory instrument on narrow bit of policy but know he will continue to make his case to and my colleague ahead of the election down the road let address the point about the diversionary work from what understand from the impact assessment the government envisage relatively small minority of those catch in possession be charge with the other instead have conditional caution community resolution or diversionary activity would be keen for the minister to state what he have base that assessment on and how he think it be likely to work in practice the minister think rightly and importantly have couple this issue with that of antisocial behaviour so we must take reckoning of the government broad record on antisocial behaviour they have have year the minister talk about the antisocial behaviour action plan and the pilot programme in police force but that be less than quarter of all force we have see from the minister and his colleague complete failure to reverse the cut to neighbourhood policing and we still have few neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer than we do eight year ago half the population say that they rarely see the police on the beat and that proportion have double since it be clear that the government plan be too modest to meet this challenge welcome the shadow minister to his place will he join in express pleasure at the fact that we now have record number of police officer as of march there be in england and wales which be about more than we have ever have at any time in history be grateful for that intervention and for the minister kind word of introduction as he say be new to this parish but if be in his seat and not mine might be little less gleeful about there be few neighbourhood police officer and pcso than eight year ago and about the fact that the people of this country whom we serve be twice as likely to say that they rarely see police on the beat than when this government start in that should perhaps be point for reflection rather than the grandstanding that we see people will ask it be important that the minister address this what non legislative action be be take alongside this statutory instrument to ensure it be effective on enforcement this provision have important implication for our police and would be keen to know the minster assessment of the overall readiness of those who be already busy and who we will be ask to enforce this ban what training do he think it will take to be effective again we must see this record in its historical context to know where we be build from the government have weaken power over the last decade and bring in power that have not be use such as the community trigger they have abandon the major drug intervention programme that the previous labour government leave they have slash youth service budget by billion and they have let charge for criminal damage halve we do not hear from the minister what sort of broad preventive action he intend to implement alongside this statutory instrument to make it effective we see in the independent report that standalone publicity campaign be likely to have limited effectiveness so what more thoughtful community level approach be go to be use labour members have set out full comprehensive plan with extra neighbourhood officer and pcso pay for by saving that have be identify by the police foundation but which ministers be refuse to make we would introduce new respect order for repeat offender hotspot police to tackle drug dealing and strong action on fly tipping those be the sort of thing we could align alongside the decision be take today to make sure that they be actually meaningful otherwise there be risk which the minister will have to reflect on that people think the government be chase headline rather than chase change to conclude we will not stand in the way of this instrument today but it must be see for what it be small intervention when we need much big idea be grateful to the minister for lay out the reason for this si recognise the impact on community up and down the land of this particular substance not least in litter and antisocial behaviour be anxious as be sure be the minister that if we be go to introduce this new measure we do it properly have couple of question for the minister about the impact of this instrument particularly on the criminal justice system look at the impact assessment be surprise by the relatively low number of individual it be envisage will be put through the system as the minister will know if we be to have an impact there have to be significant deterrent effect if we be to have deterrent effect there have to be sense in people mind that there be very high probability of their be catch and that when they be catch there will be swift and certain consequence can he reassure we that the police be gear up to deal with the number even the relatively low number in the impact assessment and that he have an ambition to go beyond those number know he do not want to do something that be merely performative but that he want to have an impact on this issue we want to see few and few of these ampoule on the street and indeed few and few young people in particular use this substance if the minister hit his ambition what impact will that have on the criminal justice system overall the estimate be that we will put think total of odd people in prison for possession of this substance as far as can see that be small against background number that be run into the hundred of thousand nevertheless that will have an impact on the prison system the thousand who will be go through the magistrate court will obviously have an impact there the police cost per capita of an arrest charge and disposal of any kind by my calculation come in at about which seem light to can the minister reassure we about the cost the capacity in the system and the ability for police force to do this properly when this si land will we see some action out there on the street be concerned we will see broadly what happen after the blair brown reform to cannabis possession if the house remember at the tail end of that particular period in our political history the notion be bring in of cannabis warning and then cannabis penalty of quid for police to hand out for pure possession what happen be that we see bit of bump in number and then it tail off because the police realise there be little effect and it be not cost effective to do it the number diminish over the year as the minister will know white paper last year look at different set of consequence for possession but in the absence of response to that white paper be keen to hear from he what the plan will be once the si be in place because as he and both know the policy be not the product the product be what happen out there on the street we be hold out promise to our community up and down the land that they will see few of these ampoule and less antisocial behaviour as consequence hope there be an action plan my second point be to ask about unintended consequence one of the characteristic of my youth in liverpool in the and be the group of young people gather together to sniff glue it be horrible thing to do and obviously have serious impact on their brain the chemical be even more noxious than this particular substance so how will the minister ensure that there be not diversion towards those kind of substance and the resumption of glue sniff in park and playground instead of take this gas if he can reassure on both those point will be happy to support the si rise order before call alison thewliss point out that as member can see there be bit of interest in the debate will not impose time limit but intend to call the minister no later than pm if there be to be division they will come when the minister sit down it be pretty unusual that come to debate entitle dangerous drug where have direct experience of have take some of those dangerous drug because live very quiet life however for many in the chamber woman in particular nitrous oxide will have be well experience as gas and air which when use under medical supervision be generally very safe drug although my hon friend the member for aberdeen north kirsty blackman would tell we that she have collapse lung as result of her use of it it be not something to be take lightly but would certainly dispute whether it be dangerous drug as the minister point out nitrous oxide be not an uncontrolled substance non legitimate use for psychoactive effect be currently control under the psychoactive substances act and the advisory council on the misuse of drugs point out that production supply and importation be illegal there be an offence to supply if the person know or be reckless as to whether it will be use for psychoactive effect in the advisory council do not advise control under the misuse of drugs act and in march it advise exactly the same so be curious as to why the minister be so light on his reason for ignore his expert adviser who have look at this in great detail we be hardly in the realm of evidence base policy he have decide that he must do something and that this be something that be why we be here we do not dismiss the public nuisance of these substance we have all see the silvery capsule litter in the street they be particular hazard to cyclist and in part of my constituency have also see some of the large canister discard but all of that could be say for other drug as the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle say we see beer can litter all over our street regularly in part of my constituency we see syrinx litter about the place and the government do nothing about it because they do not want people to have safe consumption room to take their drug somehow uniquely the government seem concern by the small canister and the public nuisance of nitrous oxide nothing that the minister say have give any reassurance on that he say nothing really about the supply of these substance because clearly they be be sell to people against the current legal framework which be illegal it will be interesting to hear from the minister on sum up how many people have be arrest charge and jail for supply of this substance under the current rule if it be zero he have bit of cheek come here and ask we to agree to further legislation what conversation have the minister have with social medium company one of my member of staff mhairi love see an advert on facebook for nitrous oxide be sell online again how many prosecution have happen for that supply for entirely illegitimate purpose which would fall under the current legislation and be prosecutable the hon lady make very important point about how it be easy to get hold of this stuff these little canister can be buy in corner shop and they can also be buy by the pallet load for which would keep an entire festival go for the weekend she be right that those people should be arrest for supply it but it be also important to ensure that we limit the market to buy it and if we clamp down on the market where people buy it that will dry up the supply that be not how the market work we have have the misuse of drugs act for year and it have not stop anybody from take heroin cocaine or anything else those drug be quite moreish and people tend to keep take they regardless of the legislation put before they to deter they it do not work what we need to do be go after the supplier but from what the minister say it seem to that the government have no intention of do that the minister also talk about the broad legitimate use and the regulation he will bring forward on that without see they it be difficult to see how effective this will be if that legitimate use be incredibly broad it must be to allow people to continue to buy the substance to run their cafés and produce whip cream he will find it very difficult to continue that enforcement game we have no sight of those regulation tonight so argue that it would be irresponsible of the house to pass this statutory instrument without have see the other part of the equation be there not danger that the broad us clause will mean that good middle class white people with house where they can consume this drug in private will be able to continue to do so and poor working class young people in park possibly predominantly black asian and minority ethnic will end up be criminalise as with many other drug that be legitimate question and legitimate risk but do not see it in the government impact assessment there be also nothing about the preventive action that the acmd talk about in its report there be nothing about public health campaign education or wide knowledge of the health impact of the drug which the acmd recommend that the government take forward there be thing such as deficiency nerve damage incontinence and erectile dysfunction but the government be not promote plan of how to disseminate that information to people worry as do the neurologist who have write to the government with their concern about further regulation and criminalisation about stigmatise people who have use this substance and want come forward and get support criminalisation will make they less likely to come forward by criminalise the misuse of drugs act dissuade people particularly woman from come forward for help the government have say nothing tonight or in the impact assessment about whether people be less likely to come forward for medical support for have use the substance if they be criminalise furthermore if kid be use the drug what support service do the government intend to put in place to tackle addiction in that age group if that be problem what be the government specific response for addiction support for young people who abuse the drug the minister have nothing to say on that whatsoever let come to the position of scotland on this issue the scottish government respond to the acmd report on the use of nitrous oxide and be crystal clear say the scottish government have and will continue to promote public health approach rather than continue the fail war on drug it be our view that ban nitrous oxide will far criminalise people for their drug use serve only to heap additional harm on vulnerable individual our young people and community while do little to improve the health of these individual the point about health be absolutely crucial the government have say nothing about the health impact of the drug and intervene on it what they have outline in the impact assessment be the cost they say in an incredibly vague paragraph on page total cost across all monetise set up and ongoing cost be estimate to be between to million with central estimate of million over the year appraisal period that be an incredibly wide range the government again be not explain exactly why they should pass the legislation they also say at the top of page there be limited evidence available to estimate how nitrous oxide misuse may change follow the intervention they want to spend ten of million of pound and they do not even know whether the intervention will have an impact frame this issue under the misuse of drugs act do not recognise tackling addiction as public health issue it be public health issue we can not arrest our way out of public health issue it do not tackle the reason why people be take this drug in the first place not do it tackle supply or public health the home affairs committee recently conclude in its report on drug that the misuse of drugs act and the misuse of drugs regulations require reform the report say we recommend that the uk government reform the act and regulations in way that promote great role for public health in our response to drug whilst maintain our law enforcement to tackle the illicit production and supply of control drug this si do nothing about production and supply and nothing about public health we be here tonight because the government have decide that something must be do and this be something the scottish national party oppose this si and will vote against it tonight it criminalise people at unclear cost there be no sense of tackle the source reduce demand or treat this as public health issue it be bang on form if may say so mr deputy speaker that the labour party be go along with this unevidenced drivel in scotland we want humane drug policy we have caring and compassionate human right inform drug policy for scotland but we do not yet have the power to implement it until such time as the scottish government have full control over all our power as normal independent country we seek the devolution of drug law to allow we to deal with they as public health issue as they should be it be pleasure to follow the snp spokesperson the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss do not disagree with much of what she say believe the government will achieve very little through these measure except perhaps to cause considerable disruption to industry and the medicinal use of nitrous oxide be far from convince by the change reassurance give by the minister at the dispatch box in that respect once again draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be practise nhs psychiatrist until recently be work as an act addiction consultant psychiatrist and have deal with the misuse of drug extensively throughout my medical career believe in an evidence base approach to policymake this issue have be examine by the acmd at the request of the government the acmd suggest very clearly that this be not the appropriate legislative vehicle to deal with nitrous oxide it make that recommendation for two reason first we already have the psychoactive substances act so if we want to deal with the illegitimate sale and supply of nitrous oxide there be already legislation in place to do that secondly we have other law that can be use for example to deal with the unacceptable littering that sometimes occur with the canister use in the recreational use of nitrous oxide be my hon friend aware that the acmd be ask many year ago to opine on exactly this point and it be chase up by two home secretaries to try to get response it be not until this statutory instrument be first talk about early this year that the acmd get around to answer the government request to make judgment be aware that it take some time to compile acmd report the reason be that the acmd like to look at the evidence in the round there be number of issue to look at here such as harm of use there be relatively limited evidence and datum to suggest that nitrous oxide be substantially more harmful than many of the substance we use daily such as caffeine use caffeine to great excess have very profound and immediate health consequence as do alcohol the point be make by the hon member for brighton kemptown lloyd russell moyle about the notting hill carnival and the number of beer can and other form of rubbish leave there if we look at the social and health harm of alcohol which be legal drug and one that be misuse legally they be considerably more profound than what we be talk about or indeed many other street drug can my hon friend clarify to the house what his conclusion be on this matter be he say that he oppose the measure or be he say that if the measure go ahead he want the government to keep the matter under review if the house divide this evening will be vote against the measure for the further reason be about to outline think it would be helpful to remind the minister what the acmd actually say with regard to legislation base on this harm assessment the psychoactive substances act remain the appropriate drug legislation to tackle supply of nitrous oxide for non legitimate use there be however need for enforcement of the psychoactive substances act to be support by additional intervention design to reduce health and social harm base on this harm assessment nitrous oxide should not be subject to control under the misuse of drugs act for the follow reason those reason have be draw out to some extent during the debate but they be neatly summarise by the acmd in its recommendation to the government in its report first level of health and social harm which be relatively limited and current evidence suggest that the health and social harm be not commensurate with control under the misuse of drugs act secondly proportionality of sanction the offence under the misuse of drugs act would be disproportionate for the level of harm associate with nitrous oxide and could have significant unintended consequence thirdly impact on legitimate us control under the misuse of drugs act could produce significant burden for legitimate medical industrial commercial and academic us the current scale and number of legitimate us that stand to be affect be unknown but be estimate to be large think it be fairly clear that the government do not carry out proper impact assessment before bring this measure to the house thank my good friend for allow to intervene do that mean that he think we should do nothing at all no do not think it mean we should do nothing think that if we believe as think many of we do that we should control the illegitimate supply of nitrous oxide we should look at exist legislation such as the psychoactive substances act which be design and take through its stage by my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning this point be discuss at some length during its passage the focus be not on criminalise use and the potential user but on control the supply clear distinction be draw the minister may correct this view but the acmd make it clear in its report that well enforcement of that exist legislation to control illegitimate supply would be much well and more proportionate way of deal with the issue at hand and the same be suggest more broadly in the evidence supply to the acmd while it be compile its report so there be already legitimate mean of deal with this but unfortunately there be the potential for unintended consequence and be not reassure when the minister say early that the government would introduce another measure which no one in the house have see as yet to ensure that there would be no such unintended consequence if government be introduce two good piece of legislation they should introduce both of they together so that the house can consider they in the round my concern be that primary legislation such as the misuse of drugs act be tightly draw and unless it be amend it be difficult to introduce another measure to sit beneath it and mitigate its provision be therefore not reassure by the minister comment but in any event it be not good or effective government not to present the two measure at the same time so that we could consider the issue in the round because believe that there be already legislation in place which need to be well enforce to deal with illegitimate supply and because do not believe that the government have give adequate weight or consideration to the potential unintended consequence for legitimate user of nitrous oxide which the minister effectively admit in his opening comment believe that the government be in the wrong place at present and that it would have be well to produce proper impact assessment of the legitimate us to sit alongside this measure before bring it to the attention of the house for all those reason will vote against the order if it be put to vote to my constituent nitrous oxide be an irritant manifest itself in the plethora of canister that we see cluster in certain place seemingly in never end number judge by the number that my constituent and collect during our litter pick however for user of nitrous oxide there be far more serious side pick up on the comment by the hon member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter it seem obvious that the power of the psychoactive substances act have not be effective because we be here today talk about this have come to different conclusion to he though on what we should do with this regulation we know from investigation by the like of sky news that it be very easy to acquire this drug it be describe as be as easy as buy bread it be probably cheap at the moment as well the sky news investigator find that age verification be skip and that balloon be offer in accompaniment to cannister so there be no pretence at all that those sale be for legitimate purpose that ease and the apparent openness about the intend use of the gas be astonishing especially give that someone can end up with seven year prison sentence for sell it but with just and report conviction in and respectively it be clear that only tiny fraction of the transgression be lead to action more than this it be fail the predominantly young people who be consume the substance it appear that the potential side effect of the drug be underappreciated to many it be consider harmless and short lasting but there be mount evidence that there be significant issue particularly for those who regularly consume large amount of the drug have speak to the family of those who have be affect between and there be register death involve nitrous oxide most of which have take place in the last decade while that figure be relatively low compare with benzodiazepine for which over death be register in the same period the fact that some of those heavy user have develop myeloneuropathy which cause damage to tract of the spinal cord and nerve should not be overlook medical professional have warn of notable increase in the number of people require medical intervention as result of use the drug datum release by the london ambulance service show an almost increase in the number of incident relate to nitrous oxide between and with more than triple in the number of call between and if those trend in london be be reflect across the country we be in the middle of rude awakening about the consequence of this so call safe drug certainly my constituent whose son be admit to hospital after rupture his lung follow inhalation of nitrous oxide would attest to the need for great awareness of the risk of take it she have certainly do her bit in highlight her son hospitalisation but it really should not be up to she to point out the danger of nitrous oxide there be also the impact of nitrous oxide usage on community as we have hear it cause significant amount of litter and environmental damage constituent be feed up with have to see collection of small container litter in park and on street corner in my constituency user be now graduate to the large canister which be even more unsightly and presumably cause far more damage than the little canister constituent be feed up with the antisocial behaviour that often come along with this and there be also danger when people drive vehicle have inhale nitrous oxide accord to the acmd that misuse when driving account for of the death associate with nitrous oxide in the last half century support the government motion today but there be question that have be leave unanswered which many member have pick up on know that various option be be consider for the licensing regime which the minister talk about it be clear to that just classify nitrous oxide under these regulation without deal with the licensing regime will not be sufficient it will just criminalise those use it instead of tackle the problem of those supply the drug for non legitimate purpose which appear to account for the majority of sale those glare loophole have raise concern one of my constituent whose family have be impact worry that this be knee jerk reaction from the government and that they have not properly consider the view of healthcare professional addiction service and those with live experience she also have concern about unintended consequence as result of this legislation it would have be extremely helpful if we have have full detail of the licensing regime when we be consider this statutory instrument today this legislation be only go to work if we have properly enforce licensing regime that be effective in deal with non legitimate sale if we be go to support this motion we need to be assure that there will be an effective licensing regime come off the back of it of course we be cognisant of the fact that criminalise this substance must be accompany by other measure such as increase community police the impact assessment state investigation cost to the police have not be estimate surely if use remain as ubiquitous as it be now it will have huge impact on police resource unless user be give free pass give that thousand of kid be currently inhale nitrous oxide without any police intervention at all wonder what the approach will be to enforcement unless we expect the cell to clog up paragraph of the impact assessment state it be estimate that between and additional prison place will need to be build this imply that there will be some enforcement action and it come with price tag of between million and million which be not an inconsiderable figure can the minister advise we on where these new prison place will appear it look like this will lead to at least some people end up in prison there also need to be campaign to increase awareness of this new criminal liability because young people have be inhale nitrous oxide without any criminal consequence that campaign need to be accompany by well awareness campaign on the danger of inhale nitrous oxide be it criminalisation or hospitalisation people who see it as bit of harmless fun need to know that there be consequence refer the house to my outside interest on the register of members financial interests bear the scar of be on the treasury bench in when as my hon friend the member for central suffolk and north ipswich dr poulter allude to take through the primary legislation on what most people call legal high or synthetic drug we have many debate like we be have this evening on how far that legislation should go and what it should contain learn an awful lot during the bill passage take it all the way through about certain habit and certain us of certain product we discuss nitrous oxide and at the time be comfortable with it be exactly where it be until today agree with many colleague on both side of the house that the enforcement envisage when we pass that legislation have not materialise in quite the way we would have like corner shop be sell legal high and sadly there be some really tragic death people be not only hospitalise but long term hospitalise and parent lose young child so we have to pass that legislation alongside this statutory instrument we should have more enforcement although know that not everyone in the house agree local government could do more and it be ask for these power my constituent be feed up to the hind tooth with their park and street be turn into dump have many beautiful park in my constituency and recently speak to the gardener responsible for look after gadebridge park be astonish when they tell of the sheer quantity of these little capsule we also have some degree of the large one come through now stand to be correct but do not think these little capsule be for commercial use they be specifically manufacture for the predominantly young people who think nitrous oxide be safe which be massively dangerous when we have the debate back in we hear that the same language be be use to indicate that legal high be safe nitrous oxide or laugh gas as it be call by those who want to undermine the argument we be make today be not safe it be dangerous some people use it will feel at the stage they have be use it now god know what will happen far down the line that it be okay and have have no effect on they however like other who have speak this evening have hear from my constituent of instance where nitrous oxide have have devastating effect on their young child it appear that young and young child be use this product and it be become increasingly freely available support this measure and will go through the lobby in support of it but legitimate question have be raise in the house today if we pass legislation we have to feel that it be go to make difference and be enforceable do not quite know how my local police force in hertfordshire be go to be able to enforce this do not know how it enforce the legislation which vote against on people smoke in their car if there be young person there we all know that that legislation be right and logical but it be almost unenforceable and there have be almost no prosecution so there be lot more work to be do and the minister be go to have some of the scar that have on my back as result of this but what we be do be right let go back to the issue of advice minister get advice from many different place colleague expert their civil servant and their special adviser but at the end of the day they have to make the decision on the decision that this minister have make there will be work to be do when we bring the further secondary legislation through and we might need to amend primary legislation in the distant future we have hear from both front benchers that there be no intention to do that imminently which will disappoint some in the house this evening however it be right to concentrate on what we can do today in this house to protect our constituent and their loved one and hope that this legislation will do that rise as say will be call the minister at pm if not before three member wish to speak if you could all help one another so that everybody get in that would be really useful call ronnie cowan be delighted to hear that there be move afoot to change the misuse of drugs act because if ever piece of legislation need change it be the act it be follow closely by the gambling act but that be for another day there be so many thing wrong with the act it be bad legislation in its day and for more than year it have ensure that people be criminalise stigmatise and ostracise it have create division in society and lead to unnecessary pain and suffering that should not be surprise to anyone because that be what it be design to do it be never intend to provide support for those harm by drug it be never base on compassion it be never mean to address the issue associate with recreational drug use therefore it come as no surprise that in the past year thing have simply get bad sadly today rather than right some of the wrong by decriminalise or legalise drug and rather than strive for drug consumption room safe consumption facility naloxone provision medication assist treatment education and support we be be ask to make matter bad we be be ask to turn blind eye to the evidence and learn nothing from the misclassification of cannabis instead we now want to persecute more people with the continued aim of arrest our way out of drug crisis it be widely acknowledge that give the many legitimate us of nitrous oxide enforcement will be nightmare currently the government have three licensing proposal but be still in consultation over which to adopt perhaps the minister can clarify that in his response quite why we be pursue the reclassification before we have sort out the licensing be beyond in the meantime we be be ask to remove this regulated substance and create marketplace for criminal to fill with who know what it be absolutely bonker as steve rolles say in conservativehome empower and enrich criminal group will fuel violence and anti social behaviour not reduce it be bit sceptical as we be talk about nitrous oxide use as though it be much hard drug lot of the kid take it certainly those in wolverhampton be not harden drug user but young people who do not think they be do anything wrong they do not hear about the medical risk and this drug be so cheap and so widely available surely the government be do the right thing in nip this in the bud so that these young people do not go down the road of fall in with the wrong crowd and continually move on to hard drug my point be that the government be not nip this be in the bud what will happen here be that they will hand this over to the criminal fraternity and kid who want to take drug will continue to take drug but now we will not know what they be take and it could be do they more harm meanwhile they will be arrest and give criminal record which will live with they for the rest of their day that be not help the situation at all be just go to say that this change will result in people be arrest and convict that conviction will lead to stigma and damage employment opportunity housing personal finance travel and relationship that be what we have be do for year and that have be rolling success have it not there be little or no evidence that say that this action will do the right hon member for north west hampshire kit malthouse want to intervene indicate dissent there be little or no evidence that say that this action will address the problem can the minister provide with one example just one over year where arrest someone for personal possession and give they criminal record have help reduce the misuse of drug as have be highlight already in this debate the problem of antisocial behaviour and littering can be address through exist legislation properly apply this change be drive by the government desire to be see to be come down hard on crime and by do so they be ignore evidence from their own expert body the advisory council on the misuse of drugs along with the royal society of medicine the world health organisation and the united nations the focus should be on education not punishment this change do nothing to address the question of why people fall into addiction or indeed why they take drug in the first place it do nothing to reduce criminality it just push it on to the consumer it do nothing to make people safe it create vacuum for criminal to fill it be wolf whistle to the hang high brigade and it be typical of the lack of long term strategic planning that be require there be no short term solution no magic wand exist finally continue to bolster policy that have not work for year will only add to the misery and pain that have already be inflict it be time to think outside the box and radically overhaul this act and make it fit for the century where drug harm be health issue and not matter for the criminal justice system have have westminster hall debate on exactly this subject few month ago do not propose to take up too much of the house time just want to thank the minister for listen to that debate and actually take action as result get involve in this matter as result of be lobby by bbc hereford worcester and dr david nicholl liberal democrat councillor in bromsgrove who be neurologist he highlight for the damage that nitrous oxide do to kid he liken it to an electrical appliance that have have the insulation strip off the wiring inside it and then expect that electrical appliance to carry on work this be what it do to your nerve and it be huge problem for people who take it there have be lot of debate this afternoon about the fact that the measure will criminalise people and that we should be attack the supplier rather than the user at the end of the day if something be call laugh gas and be say to be harmless drug harmless and safe high that mislead people into think that it be perfectly safe to take but it be not perfectly safe it have profound implication for people health it be absolutely terrible the hon member for inverclyde ronnie cowan make the important point that we be go to be criminalise people ultimately of course some people will be criminalise but be it not worth small number of people be criminalise to act as deterrent for the majority who it have not be prove to be deterrent look at the number that we have across the united kingdom have arrest people and criminalise they ever be prove to be deterrent it be always very difficult to prove negative take the hon member point but be happy that we will be provide deterrent for kid of the generation of my child that be what care about be incredibly grateful to the minister for listen incredibly grateful to dr david nicholl neurologist for give scientific evidence to support his campaign and incredibly grateful to bbc hereford worcester as with all these issue we be remind of particular communication that we have from constituent when be prepare for my westminster hall debate receive an email from somebody who want to talk about her brother he be very talented sportsman who be possibly go to play rugby for england he be also talented investment banker know we do not always like investment banker with very good career ahead of he in the city of london he find nitrous oxide think it be harmless high but within year he have commit suicide as result of the damage he have do to his system if we know that be possible outcome do not think it be right to do anything other than send very strong message that this be dangerous drug criminalise it send that message to try to put people off use it rise with great scepticism about this measure because it be use an act that be fundamentally flawed the act do not work it do not work in criminalise people or in reduce drug use drug death or drug harm in fact the evidence across comparable country especially portugal and other southern european country be that the act increase the harm for people it drive people away from get treatment and support be also sceptical about the slight moral panic that be not to dismiss the marginal case of horrible and acute harm for those affect include death in the bad circumstance by the way we have caffeine death in this country and heart lung and neurological problem as the minister say this be the most widely take drug by young people but the harm cause do not even rank in the top harm cause to young people the idea that this drug be cause great harm be just not true most people use this drug have use it at the dentist people have use it in hospital setting but most people use the drug recreationally harmlessly and acceptably my view be that that be fine have not use the drug recreationally but have be in room where top judge from the high court lawyer senior politician and celebrity have use these kind of drug and other drug and it cause they no harm the police do not come knock at their door because the usage be behind closed door by wealthy people predominantly white who be out of sight and out of mind the state do not mind this classification will target poor people young people and predominantly people from ethnic minority we know that be the case because that be what have happen with all other form of drug taking where large number of people from different demographic take the drug but the law criminalise specific set of demographic that be the fundamental problem with the act it target people and community rather than help they get off the drug they be addict to or to move to safe space this measure will make thing bad the measure will also make thing bad in term of gang and criminal syndicate it should come as no surprise the conservative government have be give get out clause to criminal gang for the last year in many other sector through bung to their mate or legislation that allow dodgy dealing but this measure will move this trade underground it will suddenly mean that premium can be charge on this particular drug it will mean that people will not know what be in the canister safely it will mean more death and it will mean profit for criminal gang they will go laugh to the bank the people who really want this measure be the gang the people who really want the continuation of the act be the gang want the government and my party to stop be the cheerleader of gang and criminal because while they continue to cheerlead for the act that be what they be let we look at the evidence of what the government own advisory council on the misuse of drugs say that this drug have no effect on crime whatsoever at the moment there be no evidence that it cause or exacerbate crime although there be some minor evidence that it cause antisocial behaviour suggest to hon member that the antisocial behaviour be not really cause by laugh gas it be cause by the fact that there be young people hang around park and bench with nothing well to do because youth service have be slash in this country and billion of pound take out of support service people who live in miserable accommodation who do not have live room to sit in because they live in horrible filthy bedsit who be out on the street in the evening try to while away the hour and take the edge off their often miserable and difficult life because they be in absolute poverty or they have other social issue around they and there be no one in the state to support they that be what be antisocial yes for the person in their nice big house who do not want to be disturb in the evening it be bit of frustration but those thing can be deal with just as we deal with many other issue the same argument can also be make on litter it be reason surely to move to producer responsibility where we have stamp and mark on the canister so we can see who be supply those canister and ensure that supplier of those canister be punish properly many of my constituent think we should do that with the plastic cup strew on our beach because we do not know which bar have give they out and not pick they up agree with that think that for waste and recycling we need to move to completely different model but that be not model of criminalise young people this measure be criminalise young people because the only change here be to criminalise young people if there be way to stop this substance be produce if there be way to ensure that people can enjoy themselves personally do not have problem with people enjoy themselves with drug but in safe way that do not cause antisocial behaviour would be all for it however be afraid that all this measure will do be exacerbate the situation personally would like not to have vote on this measure today because think it would be well for the government to go away and rethink it give the cross party opposition to it and to find way forward if there be vote be afraid will very reluctantly not to be able to support the government on this this have be an interesting and wide range discussion and will try to conclude relatively briefly start by thank the shadow minister for his support for this measure in principle it be good to start off on this note of cross party consensus which hope will continue for the remainder of his tenure in his new role he ask some question as do my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse about plan for enforcement and the resource that will be dedicate to this issue can confirm that it be something we expect the police to be focus on the shadow minister also ask about the antisocial behaviour action plan it be true that we be start with pilot in just force area do the antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol but in april of next year that will expand to all police force across england and wales back by around million pound of extra new funding to make sure those asb hotspot patrol be out and about both deal with antisocial behaviour more widely and look specifically at the issue of nitrous oxide consumption there be number of question about prison place we be in the process of build more than extra prison place we expect this measure to have significant deterrent effect on the consumption of the drug as my hon friend the member for wyre forest mark garnier say reduce consumption will reduce the incentive to supply the drug as well we expect it to be enforce pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for hemel hempstead sir mike penning for his work on the psychoactive substances act some member ask about the action that follow and think my right hon friend can take pride in the fact that retailer stop sell psychoactive substance as result of his legislation and that there have be at least prosecution under that act which of course cover nitrous oxide think say early that it regulate nitrous oxide but it would be more accurate to say that it cover it there have be some discussion about the acmd put on the record again my thank to that council for its work advise the government we almost always follow the acmd advice although there have be occasion include under the last labour government when the government have take slightly broad and different view for reason that many member include my hon friend the member for wyre forest the hon member for ellesmere port and neston justin madders and the shadow minister have outline we have take slightly different and broad view in consider the social harm and our concern that the harm and paralysis the substance cause may get bad if its use be allow to spread but we have also consult the acmd on how we will go about implement the legislation we have do public consultation on implementation and the report be publish on september make it clear that there will be wide range exemption for legitimate use some member ask about legitimate use we will amend the misuse of drugs regulations to make it clear that legitimate use be any use that do not involve inhalation by human inhalation by human for research and medical purpose will of course be lawful hope that that give the little extra clarity that member ask for couple of member refer to people who consume the substance medically of course when people consume nitrous oxide at the dentist or in the context of give birth they be be supervise by medical professional in the case of give birth an anaesthetist be typically supervise the administration of the drug that be necessary because it be potentially very harmful few comment have be make about the misuse of drugs act more widely do not propose to go into that in detail save to say that if we consider jurisdiction where they have take an incredibly permissive view such as san francisco it have not result in more people go into treatment it have lead to significant increase in death as result of drug overdose particularly from synthetic opioid and to widescale disorder on the street do not accept the thesis that we can have treatment only if we liberalise drug law and have out of control public consumption as in some american city we do not want that happen in this country that be why combination of go after drug supply at the border and go after criminal gang be important combine with the funding of treatment which we be do with an extra million for treatment over three year and record police number we have police officer more than ever before the measure which hope we will vote through this evening will help we to combat antisocial behaviour across the country it will protect people particularly young people but adult as well from the medical harm that the drug can do it be critical part of the government battle against antisocial behaviour commend the order to the

and question propose that this house do now edwards thank you mr deputy speaker for the opportunity to address this most important issue today in the house do so with the support of my colleague in the democratic unionist party include our leader the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson and the deputy leader the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson who unfortunately have prior engagement let say at the outset this be no slight on the minister respond that it be disappointing yet not surprising that neither the secretary of state nor the minister of state be in this place to respond today once again that show lack of connection with the issue that matter although the investment conference in belfast be important so too be the very foundation stone of our society our child and their education one thing have learn in my time in politic be that government mess with child education at their peril they do not meddle in issue where parent be and should be first educator and they certainly do not do it without consult and engage with parent teacher and board of governor parent in northern ireland be genuinely angry and fearful teacher feel vulnerable and fearful yet this government continue on track of potential wide reach change to the teaching of relationship and sex education in post primary northern ireland school with no consultation little scrutiny and no care for the devolution settlement this change be impose teaching regime on school that many parent object to do my hon friend agree that one of the most sinister aspect be that teacher who will have strong conviction about some of these issue will be force by law to teach the subject within the parameter set down by the government as former teacher my right hon friend know only too well the impact that the change will have on teacher which will refer to throughout my speech be proud to have stand in this house time and again to be unequivocal in my opposition to these liberal and irresponsible agenda be proud to sit on these benches with my dup colleague who have consistently vote against the regulation my party have and will continue to oppose unpick and expose they for what they be pay tribute to my colleague diane dodds our education spokesperson at stormont who have do deep dive with we into the detail of the change expose the wrong of this late rse legislative change we on the democratic unionist party benches will be work with parent teacher and board of governor to ensure that our child and young people be protect that their innocence be protect that teacher can exercise conscience and remove themselves from teach something they do not agree with and that board of governor have the flexibility and ability to protect the ethos of their school the hon lady be give an excellent speech do she agree with that it be not only contrary to the spirit of devolution education be of course devolved matter to impose this on northern ireland but that give the controversy that have surround rse in great britain and the inquiry the government have launch because of those controversy it seem absurd to implement this right now when the inquiry be still ongoing want to get into that in detail the law on rse in england change three year ago and since then public concern have be build steam mistake have be make so much so that as the hon lady say the government have have to bring forward their review of rse and appoint an external body to assist the department for education here in its review what concern now be the risk of the same error be repeat in northern ireland be ask the government to take step to ensure that we have credible approach to rse in northern ireland which parent teacher school and our community as whole can have confidence in unfortunately the secretary of state have get off to very bad start with his approach to introduce the regulation with lack of consultation scrutiny and the pretence of cedaw the convention on the elimination of all form of discrimination against woman be use to justify the move my hon friend must have be delighted at the turnout of over schoolteacher board of governor and political representative in her constituency last night campaign on this issue of let kid be kid be that not the important message as she rightly say interfere in the education of our child at your peril it will not be tolerate by people across the community in northern ireland be that not the message the secretary of state should hear loud and clear absolutely parent teacher and board of governor be angry frustrated and really concerned that have be demonstrate through meeting hold locally in northern ireland be about operate in the realm of reality be not about platitude or throwaway line that will be forget be about protect our child and young people come ask the government to listen to the concern and to make amend the change as per the northern ireland rse regulation be deeply concern they will change rse teaching in northern ireland in post primary school force the teaching of contraception and abortion that couple with the long term agenda of implement the rse progression framework have invoke so much anger and genuine concern when it come to teaching about abortion the government have seek to reassure we that it should take place in factual way that do not advocate nor oppose particular view on the moral and ethical consideration of abortion but such assurance be impossible to deliver the very act of teaching about abortion be not morally neutral it normalise it present the subject the taking of innocent human life at their most vulnerable stage as mere moral dilemma about which people may be free to disagree whereas for those who be pro life human life be at stake far it diminish the value of life because if young people be teach about the legal availability of abortion and how to access it they be more likely to do so in great number we have see that in england and wales since the abortion act be introduce indeed the widely use sexwise rse resource in england and wales even teach girl that they can go and do it privately without their parent know so much for assurance on parental consultation the secretary of state also seek to assure we that education on so call sexual and reproductive health right should be scientifically accurate again would point out that this be cause of significant contention for example many people in northern ireland and many scientist would contend that an unborn baby be scientifically human being the education for choice website recommend as an rse resource in england and wales assert that before the limit of viability the foetus be not consider human being such claim be highly contentious and would suggest neither neutral nor scientific the point be that it be not possible to be neutral on this issue where science and ethic be interweave it be highly likely that resource in northern ireland will therefore end up be bias as in england and wales in short these be matter which should be leave to parent not school rse be not just like any other school subject it deal with issue on which there be wide range of view and perspective it be highly sensitive topic that involve very personal issue and it be critical for parent teacher and school governor across northern ireland to feel confident that the regulation and the guidance now be draw up recognise that they need to know that the government will ensure that school understand the sensitivity of the topic and approach it appropriately and in way that respect the range of view that exist unfortunately in recent time it have seem that one view be not respect that of the christian or of the citizen who value life and respect other the pro life view be scorn the view that those who do not want to get pregnant should not have sex the view that teach faithfulness in relationship and the view that subscribe only to the fact that boy be bear boy and girl be bear girl and there be not more than different gender ideology and that it be ludicrous that people can now identify as cat dog and fox say this not to provoke but because these be the view of the vast majority of people in northern ireland and throughout this united kingdom and unfortunately they appear no long to be welcome the vote on the amendment relate to rse in northern ireland take place on june and the secretary of state announce the result that evening in speech at the pinknews belfast summer reception let say seriously that if the aim be to give stakeholder in northern ireland confidence that rse will be balance and not partisan objective and not ideological and sensitive to the community that school serve that be an odd choice the position of school governor must be respect major part of their role be to safeguard the ethos of school and ensure that school serve its local community and to do so they need degree of flexibility and freedom to make decision on the school approach and policy that can not be dictate in detail from belfast still less from westminster indeed large proportion of school in northern ireland be not establish by government but by the church and be later transfer not sell into government hand on the understanding that they would continue to provide an education in accordance with their church foundation of course understand that the government can now make law on the education that take place in those school as they have now do in respect of teaching on contraception and abortion but it be crucial for teach to be handle in sensitive and balanced manner that do not disempower governor in their important role that be my first ask for school governor to have the autonomy that will allow they to produce rse policy in line with the school ethos most young people in northern ireland grow up to form healthy relationship many form the stable family that be so important to the upbringing of child provide the care personal knowledge and understanding that only parent can give safeguarding be important and we be right to be alert to the very tragic case in which parent present risk of real harm to their child but those case be extremely rare they be the exception to the universal rule that parent make the good parent not the state so parent must be give the power to make the final decision as say early the hon lady be make an excellent speech and entirely agree with she that parent should have the power to make the final decision about what be particular and personal value for each individual family but do she agree that part of the problem be the fact that parent can not make those decision give that many of the material concern be not available for parent to view how can they know whether they want to exercise their right of withdrawal the hon member have do an immense amount of work in this regard and she speak about the issue in very educate way she be absolutely right parent should be at the heart of this the consultation that be currently open in northern ireland ask about balance parent and child right but with respect that be not how it work parent have right to empower they to do their job of care for their child it be parent who be the first and good guardian of their child right and their role must therefore be safeguard at present in northern ireland it be common for school to allow parent to remove their child from rse but it do not happen frequently because afford that ability to parent discourage school from adopt radical and controversial approach school want to avoid push parent into make the decision when school empower parent in this way it build trust and confidence on both side in the school delivery of rse the education department in northern ireland be currently carry out public consultation on right of withdrawal the plan emphasise in that consultation be to afford statutory right of withdrawal only from the new statement introduce into the minimum content order thereby narrow the ability of many parent in northern ireland to withdraw their child from any part of rse that they be concerned about urge the minister to ensure that this do not happen my second ask be therefore that the guidance will not restrict parent ability to withdraw their child from all part of rse about which they have concern most teacher be highly professional care deeply about their job and the child family and community they serve and be conscientious in follow school policy and instruction from school leader but teacher also have their own view and sensitivity the uk supreme court have recognise that no one should be compel to express view with which they fundamentally disagree yet regrettably some of the teaching resource produce by the council for the curriculum examinations and assessment present as fact opinion that many teacher disagree with while there be safeguard build in currently allow for ethos to be uphold by the board of governor thus protect teacher there be no clarity on whether those safeguard extend to the change that will be implement in january quite frankly when we do deep dive into the resource and material that could make their way on to our child desk it be scary it be worry want to put on record my thank to the many board of governor and schoolteacher who have hold the line and resist force down pupil throat ideologie that their parent and community do not support therefore my third ask be to make provision for teacher with conscientious objection to refuse to teach something they do not agree with the statutory guidance for school that will be issue in january will be crucial yet no draft of this guidance have be provide as part of the consultation and nor do the consultation provide any clarity on the scope or detail of its content this be simply not good enough therefore my fourth ask be that this be make available stand in this place today not only as parliamentarian but as mum and as board governor of three school and stand here on behalf of the people of northern ireland who do not support what be be do by this government who want protection for their child and who want the classroom to be safe space not space that force on their child opinion and ideology that be not in keep with their view before leave home this morning dress my little boy for school charlie age four entrust he into the care and keeping of his new school safe in the knowledge that the school he attend promote and support christian ethos my niece and nephew travel to their post primary school where christian ethos be uphold and the teaching of rse be measure balanced and do not promote some of the most bizarre and liberal view do this for they for every child and young person in northern ireland and for every teacher and board governor who want to protect ask the secretary of state to stop meddle stop stop stop this agenda of devalue life and radically change the very bedrock of our society our child and their education let start by thank the hon member for upper bann carla lockhart for secure tonight debate on an issue that know she feel very strongly about the secretary of state be disappoint that he can not respond himself but unfortunately this debate have coincide with the northern ireland investment summit where he be busy showcase northern ireland innovation and potential to investor from around the world as result be make my somewhat improbable dispatch box debut relationship and sexuality education for child in the united kingdom be sensitive issue and recognise and respect the fact that there be strongly hold personal view on the issue across the house in respond for the government seek to continue in the spirit of respect that have characterise the hon member remark let start by outline why the government have act early this year the secretary of state for northern ireland lay the relationships and sexuality education northern ireland amendment regulations in do so he be act to implement the clear will of parliament with respect to sexual and reproductive health education in northern ireland when pass the northern ireland executive formation etc act this parliament by an overwhelming majority in free vote vote to impose duty on the secretary of state to implement in full the recommendation of the united nations committee on the elimination of discrimination against woman what legal authority do cedaw committee of unelected official from other country have over uk law in what other point of uk law do it have the authority to tell we what to do the authority come not from cedaw but from an overwhelming majority of this house in free vote for that statutory duty do the minister agree that at that time there be minimal opportunity for debate and confusion about the vote itself that be no way to impose legislation on northern ireland from this place give that the vote take place before be member of this house it be difficult for to comment will state only that the result be aye to noes that legislation thereby place statutory duty on the secretary of state to make age appropriate comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on sexual and reproductive health and right compulsory component of the curriculum for adolescent in grant aid school in northern ireland and to monitor its implementation this be specific and unique duty which colleague will recall also place the government under duty to establish abortion service in northern ireland the regulation to deliver on this decision of parliament be pass in the house of commons again by an overwhelming majority on june the secretary of state do not take lightly the decision to bring forward this legislation it have always be the government preference that because education be devolved matter the department of education in northern ireland should update the curriculum the government give it every opportunity to act but regrettably it do not do so it be widely acknowledge that there be problem with how sexual education be be teach in school in northern ireland indeed recent report from the northern ireland human rights commission recommend that standard level of rse throughout all school be introduce the minister come to the nub of the issue one of the criticism be that when they be teach it people be introduce some value into their teaching the objection be that faith school and christian teacher because they believe certain thing bring those value into their teaching these regulation be design to prevent people and school from reflect those value in their teaching and in the curriculum that be the crux of the issue and it should not be the case in free society be grateful for the right hon gentleman intervention it be the government view that educate adolescent on issue such contraception and access to abortion should be do in factual way that do not advocate or oppose particular view on the moral and ethical consideration of abortion or contraception nearly four year have pass since the northern ireland executive formation etc act and adolescent in northern ireland be still not receive comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on sexual and reproductive health and right and the government have therefore act to implement the will of the house in do so the government have seek to ensure that the education provide be broadly in line with that already provide in england with regard to contraception and abortion these regulation do that the regulation pass early this year amend the curriculum for key stage and to year old will the minister give way will make some progress if that be okay the regulation make age appropriate comprehensive and scientifically accurate education on sexual and reproductive health and right compulsory component of the curriculum in northern ireland this cover prevention of early pregnancy and access to abortion in recognition of the fact that education in northern ireland be devolved matter the secretary of state have seek to ensure that the department of education in northern ireland have lead in determine the content and delivery of this education they be the expert the regulation place duty on that department to issue guidance by january and to place duty on the board of governor and principal of every grant aid school to have regard to the guidance as note at the beginning of my remark this government recognise the sensitivity of this topic some parent may wish to teach their child about sex education or make alternative arrangement for sex education to be provide in line with their religious background or their belief about the age at which their child should access sex education let assure hon member that in recognition of that the regulation also place duty on the department of education in northern ireland to make regulation about the circumstance in which pupil may be withdraw from such education or element of that education at the request of parent that mirror the opt out approach take in england and scotland the minister have use the word sensitivity on number of occasion during his speech do he accept that advise someone on the killing of child be one of the most sensitive issue that there could possibly be yet accord to what the secretary of state have say what cedaw have say and what these regulation will result in any teacher who have deeply hold view that kill child be wrong will be prevent from say so to the child they be try to guide on the point of teacher opt out it be important to stress that this will be matter for the department of education in northern ireland as it have overall responsibility for education in northern ireland it will be part of its consultation which will be come to in moment and the guidance that be publish next year on teacher opt out it be also worth point out that large majority of the school in northern ireland outsource their relationship and sexuality education to third party provider thank you for indulge on this mr deputy speaker the minister say that the government recognise the sensitivity of this matter and he then use the word some parent may wish to how do he reconcile that with the fact that scrutiny in the other place say that there have be insufficient consultation with parent do he not think that some strong legislation may have be bring forward if that be deem appropriate follow proper consultation with parent by the way you should first have apologise for not be present throughout the entire debate will be come to that report from the other place shortly rise be very short on time have only three minute if the hon gentleman will forgive would like to make some progress it will be short intervention in that case will give way the minister should accept that he be very popular tonight on his debut at the dispatch box as my colleague have say the mechanic of teach sex the mechanic of an abortion and the mechanic of contraception be one thing this be about the teaching of value go through life as we all know be about one thing relationship relationship with each other how we build those relationship whether they become sexual and whether they take place in love environment when those value be remove what happen to the thing that we believe in passionately it be you can have an abortion because it be an inconvenience to have child that be where the problem come can the minister give we an assurance that value will be allow to be keep so that at the centre of all our relationship we have value be not sure that be quite the short intervention that the hon member promise reiterate what say early about the need to have the education do in factual way but that do not exclude parent be able to teach those value to their child which surely would be the most primary thing when it come to this the department for education have confirm that it intend to have the opt out regulation in force on the same day as the guidance on the update curriculum which be january next year on september the department for education launch consultation on the guidance and the opt out regulation this will run for week until november encourage hon member who feel strongly about this to engage in that consultation northern ireland office official will continue to work closely with the department for education as it work towards implementation of the curriculum hon member have note in this debate that the house of lords bring the regulation to the special attention of the house as result of their concern about the decision not to publicly consult on they the secretary of state have already address the issue in subsequent debate on those regulation but just reiterate that in line with the government statutory obligation under section of the northern ireland act and in consultation with the equality commission for northern ireland the government complete an equality assessment screening the outcome of which do not indicate the need to consult publicly on the policy the secretary of state duty be clear that it require topic such as abortion and contraception to be compulsory curriculum component public consultation would not change this requirement as have mention there be the consultation now open on both the guidance and the opt out provision in closing reiterate that the government have only step in where necessary on this issue to deliver on statutory duty in bring forward these regulation rise be afraid that be out of time in bring forward these regulation the uk government do not set new policy direction but rather give effect to decision take by parliament in by an overwhelming majority in free vote the department for education in northern ireland house adjourn without question put standing order no
