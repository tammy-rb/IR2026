beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the secretary of state to review the criminal injuries compensation authority and for connected purpose from time to time this house have ask itself the question what value do we place on support for the victim of violent crime believe that this be the right time to ask ourselves that question again victim support can take many form include non financial measure we have get well but we must get well still at recognise the lifelong impact that violent crime have on person victim would benefit from well sharing of information about support service both public and voluntary and the process for access nhs diagnostic and therapeutic support that information sharing should start with the police the ambulance service and the crown prosecution service and be pleased to hear recently from the cps west midland region about the enhanced victim support that be now in place nevertheless there will always be case in which financial loss have occur or financial remedy be necessary or otherwise appropriate mean of provide some measure of justice for those who have suffer assault think that member in all part of the house would wholeheartedly endorse the principle that whenever possible the perpetrator of violent crime should pay the cost of restitution indeed it be welcome and remarkable achievement that the amount recover to fund support service through the victim surcharge first introduce in have nearly double over the last four year however the criminal injury compensation scheme exist because some offender lack or can not be prove to possess the asset or revenue to pay those cost the so call straw man of the justice system and in still more case the perpetrator of violence be never identify crime statistic notoriously do not tell the full story but in the west midlands police force area nearly one in five violent assault be not prosecute because no suspect can be name commend the chief constable craig guildford and the police and crime commissioner simon foster for their success in increase the number and the share of identified assailant but the point stand the animate force behind the current criminal injury compensation scheme be birmingham magistrate and the first secretary of the howard league for penal reform margery fry who lead campaign in the under the clarion call of justice for victims she argue that criminal injury could not be narrowly consider to be private matter between the assailant and the victim just as we provide for each other in time of sickness through national insurance so too she argue duty be owe by the state when it fail to prevent one citizen from injure another in her word the state can not disown all responsibility for its occasional failure to protect today that same principle be set out by the criminal injuries compensation authority which say that payment be sometimes need as an acknowledgement of harm and an important gesture of public sympathy the criminal injury compensation scheme be now an integral part of the justice system even if it be as the chair of the justice committee my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter put it last week something of cinderella service nothing that say today be intend as criticism of the staff of the criminal injuries compensation authority they work hard in difficult circumstance give that staff number have fall by fifth since the current iteration of the scheme be introduce in the civil service people survey show that they take pride and find professional fulfilment in their work and as someone who once receive an award from the scheme remain grateful to they important and positive improvement have be make since six year ago the victims commissioner publish an excoriate report let say at this point how welcome it be to see the under secretary of state for justice the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones in her place know that she care deeply about victim support as well as have specialist knowledge of this issue and be grateful to she for her thoughtful response and conversation about it however it be also clear that failing remain within the system as we hear last week when member across party contribute to debate in westminster hall draw particular attention today to the delay that too many applicant still experience lack of signposting or integration with wide support service and general lack of public awareness of the scheme itself the trauma of dog attack on postal worker and other victim by new and ban breed the victim of which be mostly ineligible for compensation follow change to the scheme in the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse supposedly year hardship fund establish year ago that be now essentially dead letter the criterion be so restrictive that no payment have be make from it in the last seven year and the tariff system itself as many serious and life change injury be not cover at all it be true that the upper cap on the scheme be generous by international standard but the low limit of have be freeze in cash term since my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson refer in this place to annex of the scheme which define crime of violence as include sexual assault to which person do not in fact consent those be word and idea from another age even if the court now adopt more informed interpretation the continued presence of that definition can only cause harm and it must be strike from the scheme these problem and believe on the basis of my own casework and that of other member that they do to an extent persist impose heavy burden on the victim of crime like some other member bear the physical scar of violent crime alongside other scar of different and more subtle kind have speak previously in another debate about that experience and do not intend to repeat those word today it be enough to ask hon member to take it on trust that delay the seemingly arbitrary rule of the scheme the manner of the communication and sometimes poor decision making can add to the sum of the pain that victim feel pain that can only be partially outweigh by the release that the end of the criminal injury process bring perpetrator might evade justice but it be part of the nature of the trauma response that at slight or unexpected prompting victim may be compel to relive that crime again and again that be why the victims commissioner have call for an overarching review of the scheme to establish whether it actually fulfil its state remit to acknowledge the harm suffer by victim of violent crime who have no other access to compensation and to provide redress as part of just and compassionate response that be what the bill which beg leave to introduce would achieve the legislation would set out simple requirement for fundamental review and for ministers to report back to the house with proposal for further scrutiny and debate can not stand here and claim that easy answer exist to all these question although note that to the good of my calculation the cost of the scheme appear to be fall in real term we live in straiten financial time that be why it be well for reform of the scheme to be carry out in deliberative manner on the basis of accurate and recent evidence and with the need of victim as the primary concern to that end take heart from the minister statement that the government do not plan change to the scheme at this time she go on to say the clear message to be that we need change and will be consider how government can well provide the support that victim need and deserve also take heart from the prime minister statement of personal support for the victim of violent crime when this matter be raise with he fortnight ago by my hon friend the member for warrington north charlotte nichols this issue touch the life of people in every one of our constituency no amount of money can return someone to their mental or physical state prior to an assault but well function fair and compassionate scheme can bring victim some measure of justice question put and agree to order that laurence turner charlotte nichols michael wheeler andy slaughter warinder juss antonia bance chris bloore catherine atkinson kevin mckenna mark sewards tim roca and alistair strathern present the bill laurence turner accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill
