protect on develop brownfield site will the secretary of state consider give power to council such as westmorland and furness and to planning authority such as those in the yorkshire dale and the lake district to ensure exclusive provision for affordable and social rent housing so that we do not see community such as ours die out because all the house build end up be sell for second home from his perspective as an assiduous constituency member the hon gentleman make very good point but may commiserate with he at the recent liberal democrat conference be afraid he be defeat and his party adopt housing policy that he describe as thatcherite it be source of sadness to to be outflank on the right by the liberal democrats but may welcome more defection to the thatcherite cause from those who

my right hon friend make very important point if her local authority have an up to date plan that be the good protection against speculative development if however local authority do not have plan in place there can be presumption in favour of sustainable development and that can be uphold by the planning inspectorate which could mean development on site where local community do not wish to see it that be why it be so important for local authority to adopt plan the secretary of state be very clever man and he must know that if there have be large amount of brownfield land it would have be build on the fact of the matter be that we in this country must bite the bullet and build on land other than brownfield because there be not enough of it do he agree that courage along with intellect would help we solve the housing problem the hon gentleman be man of independent mind and he be stray from front bench policy by decree man of intelligence that be not the official labour party position on these issue but should say that he be right it be not only brownfield land that can be develop but it must be brownfield first and there be significant room for additional brownfield development if we

white paper design to tackle regional inequality across england there now exist gap chasm between transformative change promise by the rhetoric of level up and the actual reality be the truth of the matter not that downing street have totally lose interest in that agenda while the department leadership bumble on directionless and toothless its bold promise unfulfilled and in many case utterly disregarded thank the hon lady for her kind word and her question though completely disagree with she at the party conference we announce billion for our long term plan for town which will help we level up town right across the country hope she welcome that first time buyer what step he be take to support first time buyer the government have range of scheme available to first time buyer include

car park none of which be actually open that be total so far of million on transport project and virtually none of they function it be now ask the government for million more it be no wonder that in cambridge and south cambridgeshire people think that the greater cambridge partnership be unelected unaccountable and waste of public money do the minister agree that we have to ensure public value for money will he meet to talk about the detail order that question be too long and be not quite sure how it fit in with first time buyer will ask the minister later do think you will green spaces

of biodiversity or lack of access or proximity to site of special scientific interest be not take forward and build upon although this be national not local question be think particularly of contentious application on water lane in knaresborough which have previously be refuse my hon friend will hope understand that can not comment on that specific case or situation but it be really important that local authority make decision accord to their local plan as my right hon friend the secretary of state set out early if local authority have plan in place it allow they to set out where they would like to see development that benefit their natural environment take place in england we have also set out that from january biodiversity net gain will apply to mitigate the impact of major development that require developer to deliver biodiversity net gain in day time bradford council be likely to give the green light to yet more house to be build in silsden on valuable green space if approve the additional house will follow many hundred of house currently be build in silsden and many more be await planning approval silsden infrastructure simply can not cope do the minister agree that bradford council should prioritise silsden infrastructure first rather than see the area as quick win for achieve its housing target my hon friend be completely right as ever he champion his constituent over the action of labour run bradford council which obviously have detrimental impact on his constituent life local authority have an obligation to spend section receipt in line with the purpose for which they be agree for exactly the reason he give we be committed to introduce new measure through the levelling up and regeneration bill that will give great certainty to local community about the infrastructure that will be deliver in their area newcastle under lyme be go through its local plan process at the moment welcome the fact that the conservative lead administration have reduce the overall number of new home to from the in the previous labour lead local plan which would have carpet over our green space as the leader of the opposition seemingly want to do everywhere nevertheless some people be unhappy would the minister join in urge the council in its next draft to far prioritise brownfield development which be the key to regeneration can assure my hon friend that it be the government policy to strongly encourage local authority to make the most of brownfield land first especially for new home it be right that if local authority want to alter green belt boundary they have show exceptional circumstance we conservative believe in preserve our green space and it be interesting to hear the proclamation from the opposition will be very interested to see whether they propose concrete over the green space surround their own constituency chair the all party parliamentary group for healthy home and building we have undertake an inquiry and send the report through to ministers the recommendation from that be clear while it be good to have healthy energy efficient home it be really important to have green space around those house have the minister have an opportunity to read the report from the appg if not will ensure that she get copy and hope that she will then come back to on the recommendation thank the hon gentleman so much for his comment

although that be as much the responsibility of the government as that of people in northern ireland but give that the criterion have already be set why have it not be possible to select town in northern ireland to benefit from the town fund we want to see the northern ireland executive up and run as soon as possible and think that that be an ambition share across the house hope that when it be up and run we will be able to help it with the fund that the right hon gentleman have mention call the shadow minister we all know that this government claim lot but now they be claim that they have long term plan for town while continue to build they without any of the infrastructure that people want and need resident of mid bedfordshire know that all too well like many other they struggle to see gp or get dentist and the council budget be half what it be in the tories have gutte the element that make town home can the minister please explain why they persist in prioritise developer in our town over the people live in they thank the hon lady for her question but completely disagree with she member need only look at the measure that we be introduce in the levelling up and regeneration bill which will come to the house tomorrow to see the huge change that we intend to make to high street to allow they to work well for local people new homes what step he be take to help increase the number of new home we have announce billion of investment in housing supply since the start of this parliament and we be also invest billion in the late affordable home programme to provide thousand of new home across the country for people to rent or of course to buy in july we set out our long term plan for housing with regeneration programme in cambridge london and leeds when the department try to change the nutrient neutrality rule the labour party fall at the first hurdle show that it have change since its claim to be the party of house building it block that so will minister commit themselves to push through these essential change afresh absolutely we have just hear from the hon member for luton north sarah owen crude nimbyist appeal to the voter of mid bedfordshire week after the leader of the labour party say he be in favour of the builder not the blocker but who could be surprised give that as my hon friend have rightly point out when we put forward legislation for new home labour block it it be unbelievable that the crew of gangster over there be peddle the same nonsense week in week out order think we be go to moderate our language little bit rise so sit down and we will move on for all the sound and fury from the secretary of state he know that the math do not lie and that the government have fail on their target they have downgrade their affordable housing target and have still fail on those when will the secretary of state bite the bullet and provide more properly affordable social housing for people in my constituency and other who simply can not afford to buy their own home withdraw the word gangster mr speaker should have say huckster will tell the hon lady who have downgrade their social housing target it be the hon lady herself when she be run for the deputy leadership of her party she say that she want new social home every year what be the target now zero call the shadow minister it be essential that we boost the number of new home build each year for private sale but just as important be the need to significantly increase the supply of new affordable home to buy and rent the national audit office have confirm that the government target for its flagship to affordable home programme be start by march can the secretary of state explain how on earth the public can trust this government to address the housing affordability crisis when recent figure reveal that they have fail to deliver on their share of that target outside london the significant increase in the affordable home programme that outline early be the mean for that to be do but the difference between we be that we have target for social and affordable home while labour have none leaseholder residential building remediation what recent progress he have make on support leaseholder with cladding and non clad remediation to residential building what recent progress he have make on support leaseholder with cladding and non clad remediation to residential building the government expect those who have cause defect to step up to solve they as the house be aware developer have now sign contract to resolve cladding and non clad defect in more than building for other property the government be make extensive taxpayer subsidy available to support clad remediation along with other mechanism to pursue those who be responsible help for people live in metre building that have fire safety defect do not go far enough because of the huge amount of money involve one of my constituent have describe her experience as never end nightmare will the minister bring that nightmare to an end for constituent such as mine who be force to pay to fix the mistake of other be grateful to the hon lady for raise specific question about metre property every property be it over or under metre need fire risk assessment and encourage her constituent to ensure that fire risk appraisal of external wall be undertake against that property if the fraew indicate that extensive work be necessary would be happy to receive copy of it and look into it personally in order to deal with this have write to the minister about constituent of mine who be leaseholder live in an metre property and so be not protect by the building safety act the cladding cost alone will be well over and any non clad cost will be substantial that be completely unaffordable for my constituent and it will bankrupt he so when will the minister provide full update which be promise to back on august as say if the hon lady wish to raise the case of this individual building once again with or talk to separately outside will be happy to enable that for every metre building we be make aware of as require additional remediation we be go through and check thing and compile audits where necessary to get to the bottom of it the government strongly believe that metre building do not need extensive remediation and we will be happy to talk more about any building where these issue have be raise do the necessity for the government to take that sort of action show the danger that leaseholder be under from the abuse of freeholder power may through he gently remind the secretary of state of an assurance he give when talk about leasehold he say we need to end this feudal form of tenure and ensure individual have the right to enjoy their own property fully official report february vol be that still intend to be in the king speech my right hon friend know that be not able to anticipate what will be in the king speech we be clear that particularly with regard to remediation some freeholder have step up and should be credit for do so but other have absolutely not do so the secretary of state and will not hesitate to call out that activity where it occur congratulate my hon friend on the action he and the secretary of state be take against developer that refuse to remediate tall building what action will he now propose to take against developer that deliberately do not carry out this work and leave leaseholder with their life in peril and potentially not able to sell or even insure their property as my hon friend be aware we be ensure that developer uphold the promise they have make through the developer contract and through the responsible actor scheme which make sure that if they fail to do so they could in extremis be ban from build in this country again if there be any indication what he describe be occur we will be happy to take action and will be happy to receive any information from he or other in the house call the shadow minister more than six year on from the grenfell disaster where people lose their life sam disabled resident in galliard homes building be one of the hundred of thousand of people still trap in building that have not be remediate be this the new do nothing approach from the department to build safety that be highlight in the guardian today an approach that force the resignation of senior civil servant from the department think that question be somewhat beneath the hon gentleman but let state clearly what the government be do they have recognise that there be an issue and have legislate to resolve that they be work extremely hard to ensure that developer be hold to account for that and over the past few month they have have success in ensure that that process take place where developer be no long around they be also step up and make sure that the clad defect be cover hundred of building have conclude their remediation over recent month which demonstrate the progress that be be make level up across the uk what step he be take with cabinet colleague to support levelling up policy across the uk what step he be take to level up across the whole of the united kingdom level up be uk wide project that be why we have deliver city and growth deal across scotland wales and northern ireland why we have launch our investment zone programme include zone in the north east of scotland and glasgow and why we be invest billion through the levelling up fund in project range from the transformation of burnley historic mill to the development of cultural quarter in peterhead thank my right hon friend for that answer however as he develop these policy far will he remember that even in apparently affluent area there be pocket that would benefit significantly from level up investment especially across basildon and thurrock will he therefore tell the house what plan he have to include those area in the next round of investment my hon friend make very important point and in particular it be vital to make sure that we level up that community in thurrock our plan to extend the economic development of docklands east to make the thames estuary powerhouse for economic growth have be inspire by my hon friend work and that of my hon friend the member for thurrock jackie doyle price it be pleasure to welcome the prime minister to burnley two week ago when he announce that burnley be one of the many town get money as part of the long term plan for town on top of more than million from the levelling up fund be particularly pleased to see that key part of the long term plan for town be community engagement will the secretary of state set out what that community engagement will look like in particular will it be one off or can community expect to be consult throughout the decade for which the million be allocate my hon friend be right to point out that this be decade long investment in town across the united kingdom we will work with people in burnley with its excellent member of parliament and with other representative to ensure that we can tackle antisocial behaviour revive high street and make sure that the pride that people have in burnley be reflect in investment from government one of the economic sector that provide level up across the whole of the united kingdom be the creative industry whether that be film production theatre the art video game or modern high tech will the secretary of state have conversation with her majesty revenue and customs and the treasury about the proposal to change business rate which may have dramatic effect and curtail the opportunity for the creative industry absolutely the vital role that our creative industry play across the united kingdom in level up be one we need to not just protect but enhance the delivery of local service be so important to level up all area of britain the secretary of state will be aware that in rural area the cost of deliver public service be much high than in their urban counterpart in rural county such as shropshire for example the cost of provide social care be much high and the proportion of people who need that care be high because there be old resident will the secretary of state consider take into account the cost of provide those service when determine the local government settlement in the future it be very fair point and absolutely on the government side of the house we understand that rural community need additional investment not least when it come to the cost of adult social care as my hon friend the member for south basildon and east thurrock stephen metcalfe have say there be pocket of deprivation even in wealthy area include lichfield will the secretary of state give some indication of what sort of timescale there be for the next round of application simply can not believe that there be any pocket of deprivation in lichfield give who have be represent that constituency since the idea that there be any home unvisite by its member of parliament or that there be any hearth where there be chill seem to be inconceivable but nevertheless we will make sure that levelling up fund round be bring forward just in advance of the autumn statement and staffordshire hope will have its voice hear we understand that the secretary of state be plan some rush back of cigarette packet devolution deal with hull and the east riding can urge caution after year of deliberate sustained and savage cut to our city the last thing we need now be botched deal ahead of the general election the very least expect the secretary of state to guarantee be proper consultation so that the people of hull who have be badly let down by this tory government get the opportunity to understand the implication and to speak on the issue will he guarantee that have lot of respect for the hon gentleman but we be not rush or embark on any botched process we be talk to representative from both the east riding and kingston upon hull council in order to ensure that we can get devolution deal that work we have devolution in york and north yorkshire west yorkshire and south yorkshire as far as we be concern east yorkshire should not be leave out in that progress but it be important that we get that right in the meantime we be develop levelling up partnership with hull in order to ensure that vital investment not least in transport match the investment that we have already secure on the south bank of the humber call the spokesperson for the scottish national party prior to scotland be drag out of the european union against its will eu regional development policy allocate up to million from to crucially the scottish government play key role in direct the funding in stark contrast to the department for levelling up housing and communities which bypass scotland parliament and undermine devolution will the secretary of state and his cabinet colleague stop play politic and devolve level up to holyrood we be devolve level up we be devolve it to local government that be why our recent town fund announcement be welcome by all council include snp lead council say to the hon lady with

minority group at election as we commit to do in legislation we be conduct an evaluation of the impact of voter identification at the may poll we will publish that evaluation no later than november this year the electoral commission report into voter id be utterly damning it find that awareness of the new rule be low among black and minority ethnic community and take up of voter authority certificate be minimal even the government own mps can see the reality of this fail experiment the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg say party that try and gerrymander end up find their clever scheme come back to bite they do the minister agree with her own conservative colleague remind the hon lady that of the electorate be able to vote successfully also remind she that it be the electoral commission that call for voter identification it have exist in northern ireland for two decade and be introduce under labour government and it exist in most european country on the hon lady point about ethnic minority everyone deserve fair and free election and it have be ethnic minority in area such as tower hamlets and birmingham who have be the victim of electoral fraud social housing accountability to tenants whether his department be take step to help ensure that social housing provider be accountable to tenant we be take action to improve the quality of social housing the social housing regulation act which receive royal assent in july will deliver transformative change across the sector introduce proactive consumer regulation and rebalance the relationship between landlord and tenant ensure that landlord be properly hold to account for their performance welcome the step the government be take to support people live in social housing but

make early he talk about have conversation with hull city council about transport this come after the government decade long refusal to back the electrification of line to hull it also come after the exclusion of the northern mayors in the decision to scrap the northern leg of why should any of the people in hull and east riding order topical should be short and sweet the right hon lady should just finish her question very quickly why should the people of hull and east yorkshire trust what this government ever say be huge fan of the right hon lady the proof of the pudding will be in the

the labour party should be build social home every year and yet its current target be zero why do she retreat the right hon gentleman just come out with flannel think he be audition for panto season this afternoon he can dress it up however he like but the truth be that he could not spend this vital funding quickly enough in the middle of housing crisis it be clear that the prime minister share his disregard for struggle family in his hour long speech in manchester the prime minister do not mention housing single time not once but the housing minister do tell conference that renter be not all weed smoke gangster which be sure the right hon gentleman know all about as he mention gangster early today can the secretary of state assure we that despite the tone of those remark the renters

we call for the immediate release of all hostage and say to they we stand with you we stand with israel the murder and the miss come from over country include the united kingdom the terrible nature of these attack mean it be prove difficult to identify many of the deceased but with heavy heart can inform the house that at least six british citizen be kill further be miss some of whom be fear to be among the dead we be work with israel to establish the fact as quickly as possible and we be support the family who be suffer unimaginable pain we be also help british citizen who want to leave israel

help citizen when they be able to cross will come back to the grave humanitarian situation in gaza in moment but want first to address the british jewish community directly as say at finchley united synagogue last week and at the jewish school visit this morning we stand with you now and always this atrocity be an existential strike at the very idea of israel as safe homeland for the jewish people understand why it have shake you to your core be sickened that antisemitic incident have increase since the attack we be do everything we can to protect you we be provide an additional million for the community security trust to protect school synagogue and other jewish community building and we be work with the police to ensure that hate crime and the glorification of terror be meet with the full force of the law know that the whole house will support that and join in say unequivocally that we stand with the jewish community also recognise that this be moment of great anguish for british muslim community who be also appal by the action of hamas but be fearful of the response we must listen to those concern with the same attentiveness hamas be use innocent palestinian people as human shield with the tragic loss of more than palestinian life include many child we mourn the loss of every innocent life of the civilian of every faith and every nationality who have be kill so let we say it plainly we stand with british muslim community too israel be found not just as homeland for the jewish people but as guarantor of their security to ensure that what happen in the holocaust could never happen again through its strength and resilience israel gradually achieve some of that long for security despite the strategic threat on its border include hezbollah in the north with iran at its back israel normalise relation with the united arab emirates and bahrain through the abraham accord and move towards normalising tie with saudi arabia step that be consider unthinkable not long ago one reason this attack be so shocking be that it be fundamental challenge to any idea of co existence which be an essential precursor to peace and stability in the region the question be how should we respond believe that we must support absolutely israel right to defend itself to go after hamas and take back the hostage to deter further incursion and to strengthen its security for the long term that must be do in line with international humanitarian law while recognise that israel face vicious enemy who embe themselves behind civilian as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every possible precaution to avoid harm civilian repeat president biden word as democracy we be strong and more secure when we act accord to the rule of law humanity law decency respect for human life that be what set we apart from the mindless violence of the terrorist there be three specific area in which the united kingdom be help to shape event first we be work to prevent escalation and further threat against israel on friday raf surveillance aircraft begin patrol to track threat to regional security have deploy royal navy task group to the eastern mediterranean include rfa lyme bay and rfa argus three merlin helicopter and company of royal marines ready both to interdict arm and to support the humanitarian response and we be bolster our force in cyprus and across the region let be clear we be not engage in fighting or in an offensive in gaza but we be increase our presence to prevent broad regional instability at this dangerous moment secondly be proud that we be long stand and significant provider of humanitarian aid to the palestinian people can announce today that we be increase our aid by third with an additional million of support an acute humanitarian crisis be unfold to which we must respond we must support the palestinian people because they be victim of hamas too like our ally we believe that hamas do not represent the palestinian people or their legitimate aspiration to live with equal measure of security freedom justice opportunity and dignity hamas simply do not stand for the future that palestinians want and they seek to put the palestinian people in harm way we must ensure that humanitarian support urgently reach civilian in gaza that require egypt and israel to allow in the aid that be so badly need we also need to keep the situation in the west bank at the forefront of our mind at this moment of heighten sensitivity early today speak to mahmoud abbas the leader of the palestinian authority to express our support for his effort to provide stability thirdly we will use all the tool of british diplomacy to sustain the prospect of peace and stability in the region ultimately that require security for israelis and palestinians and two state solution so we be increase our regional engagement have speak to prime minister netanyahu twice in the last week along with the us france germany italy and other my right hon friend the foreign secretary be the first to visit israel after the attack meet his majesty the king of jordan yesterday long time voice of reason and moderation have speak today with the leader of turkey and previously egypt and will speak to other in the come day our partner in the region have ask we to play role in prevent further escalation and that be what we will do however hard it be we need to ask the tough question about how we can revive the long term prospect for two state solution for normalisation and for regional stability not least because that be precisely what hamas have be try to kill in conclusion unequivocally back israel right to defend itself step forward with humanitarian support work to protect civilian from harm and strain every sinew to keep the flame of peace and stability alive that be our objective it be the right approach for the region and it be the right approach for britain commend this statement to the house thank the prime minister for the advance copy of his statement and for the update the government have provide to labour front benchers over the past few day last saturday israel be the victim of terrorism on an unimaginable scale the senseless murder of man woman child and even baby the horror of hostage taking music festival turn to kill field innocent jews slaughter within their own kibbutz an attack with no cause other than bloodshed be sure that over the last few day every member of the house have see image from this crisis that will never be unseen tiny body wrap in bundle in israel and now in gaza mother and father grieve israeli palestinian muslim jew the innocent dead as in any time of grave crisis it be crucial that this house speak with one voice in condemnation of terror in support for israel in its time of agony and for the dignity of all human life because hamas do not wish to see peace in the middle east they just want to see israel wipe off the map but hamas be not the palestinian people and the palestinian people be not hamas labour stand with israel britain stand with israel the attack be ongoing terrorist be at large and hostage be still be hold some of they british citizen israel have the right to bring her people home to defend herself and to keep her people safe while hamas have the capability to carry out attack on israeli territory there can be no safety as secretary of state blinken say last week we democracy distinguish ourselves from terrorist by strive for different standard even when it difficult he be right as the prime minister have say there be an acute humanitarian crisis unfolding israel defence must be conduct in accordance with international law civilian must not be target and innocent life must be protect there must be humanitarian corridor and humanitarian access include for food water electricity and medicine so that hospital can keep people alive and so that innocent people do not needlessly die and there must be proper protection for all those who work selflessly so that aid can be deliver to victim there can be no doubt that responsibility for this crisis lie with hamas they have no interest in palestinian right and no interest in the security of the people of gaza they unleash terror and then hide among they woman and child use as human shield hostage hold who should be release hamas be destroyer of life of hope and of peace and we can not give they what they want we must keep strive for two state solution palestinian state alongside safe and secure israel we can not give up on that hope we can not let hamas brutality be catalyst for conflict in the wide region engagement between israel and arab nation must be strengthen not abandon international co operation the rule of law and political road to peace hamas want we to abandon all three in defiance we must be resolute on all of they these attack be have huge impact on community across the united kingdom many in this house will have hear devastating story from people who have lose friend and family and from people who be deeply worried about the future of those they know in israel or palestine include the first minister of scotland who speak to at the weekend we stand with all of they we stand against the worrying rise in islamophobia and against the antisemitic abuse threat and assault that we have see on british street because we must never underestimate the burden of history that jewish people carry with they do not want britain to be place where jewish school be close where jewish child stay at home out of fear and where jewish family feel compel to hide their identity do not want britain to be place where british muslims feel they have to apologise for the action of people who do not act in their name we can not allow community cohesion in our country to be destroy we all bear responsibility to do all we can to stamp out hate and we fully support police action to provide extra assistance for our community the event of the past week have see horror beyond our imagination so let we send strong message that westminster be united and britain be unite with israel against terror for international law and for the protection of innocent life there be difficult day ahead but our value can not be compromise terror can not win thank the leader of the opposition for his remark let say at the outset that this be an unprecedented and extraordinarily difficult situation it be likely to remain difficult for all of we in the day and week ahead but we must always have at the forefront of our mind that responsibility for this crisis lie with hamas and with hamas alone it be barbaric act of terrorism that have inflict untold suffering and misery on so many people and we have feel that acutely here at home we have see the impact on our street over the past week and it have sicken all of we we stand united in say that antisemitism have no place in our society let be unequivocal that those who incite racial or religious hatred on our street or who inflict violence and cause untold suffering to people will be meet with the full force of the law know the whole house will join in make sure that happen that the police have all the tool resource and power they need to bring that about in conclusion let say that the right hon and learn gentleman be absolutely right that this house stand united unite in condemn unequivocally this terrorist attack by hamas and unite in say that we will be steadfast in our support for israel and steadfast in our support for the jewish people not just today not just tomorrow but always call the father of the house the house will be grateful to both the prime minister and the leader of the opposition for the lead that they have give in today statement this be not the time to point out the fault of benjamin netanyahu what we have to say be that the inexcusable terror attack on israelis be intend to bring awful harm to the palestinians rather than quote international leader want to quote senior constituent who say this be very harrowing time for jews all over the world there be about million of we worldwide why can they leave we alone if we pray for the peace of jerusalem we want to try to bring security both to the people of israel and to the palestinians in gaza do the prime minister know that he will have our support as he try to do that thank the father of the house for what he have say and simply agree with his constituent in say that all of we will pray for peace in the region but especially for peace for those family who have be so tragically affect by what have happen over the past week call the snp leader rabbie burns once poignantly write that man inhumanity to man make countless thousand mourn it be with those word echo in all our heart that we send our thought and prayer to all those suffering in the middle east the abhorrent terrorist attack by hamas on the jewish people and the israeli state be crime against our common humanity and it must be condemn unequivocally what more powerful response can we have than to seek to protect the share innocence and share humanity of both israeli and palestinian civilian that will require lot it will require the defeat of hamas it will require the safe return of all those hostage who have be take it will require the opening of humanitarian corridor so that people can escape gaza and aid can get in and it will require medicine water and electricity for hospital so that people who be injure can be treat it will require no collective punishment make all of that happen will require international leadership and diplomacy on these isle that responsibility will fall to the uk prime minister and very much wish he well in make that happen right across this chamber we all need to be very conscious that history will judge we on our response not just to these abhorrent attack but to the humanitarian crisis that be undoubtedly unfold in gaza let we not be on the wrong side of history thank the hon gentleman for his remark and agree that this crisis demand that the united kingdom step up diplomatically to make difference to bring about peace and stability that be what we have do over the past week as allude to in my statement the foreign secretary be the first person to visit israel and have speak to multiple counterpart in the same vein myself have be work with ally across the region to make sure that we can work together to bring about successful and peaceful resolution we also recognise the scale of the humanitarian situation that be unfold and be play lead role in help to alleviate it not least with our announcement today of considerably more aid for the palestinian territory build on our strong track record as one of the lead provider of aid to the region that will continue the attack on israel by hamas terrorist be barbaric terrorist must be defeat whoever they be and wherever they be commend my right hon friend the prime minister and the foreign secretary for the stance that the government have take in support of the jewish community here in the uk and in support of israel and its right to defend itself welcome the prime minister statement that action must be take in line with international humanitarian law but will he give commitment today that the government will leave no stone unturned in their effort to prevent regional escalation of the conflict in do so will he reflect on the role of iran can give my right hon friend that reassurance it be not only something that we have discuss extensively with partner in the region but why last week deploy surveillance aircraft and asset to the mediterranean and they be already engage in ensure that arm shipment do not find their way to people such as those in hezbollah and that iran do not see this as an opportunity to escalate the conflict the support that we have put into the region have already be welcome by our partner who share our aim to ensure that action be constrain to deal with hamas and what they have do no one want to see any escalation again that be something that prime minister netanyahu and discuss and he very much agree that his objective be to deal with hamas and not to see the conflict spread more widely the scale of hamas terrorist attack have be utterly horrifying and the atrocity they have commit be truly sicken we stand with the people of israel and with the jewish community who be grieve and afraid we call for the unconditional release of all hostage and urge the government finally to proscribe as terrorist organisation the funder of hamas iran revolutionary guard israel unquestionably have the right to defend itself and its citizen that mean target hamas not innocent civilian in line with international law be concern about the force evacuation of hospital in gaza which mean death for innocent palestinians who will not survive be take off life support the world health organisation have say that this may be breach of international humanitarian law so will the prime minister set out what advice he have receive on the matter unlike hamas the israeli president have say that the israeli armed force will operate in accordance with international law israel attempt to minimise civilian casualty by warn people to leave northern gaza have be far complicate by hamas terrorist tell the local population not to leave and instead use they as human shield we will continue to urge israel as have do when have speak to prime minister netanyahu that while it exercise its absolute right to defend itself and ensure that such attack can never happen again it should take every possible precaution to minimise the impact on civilian call the chair of the foreign affairs committee saturday terror attack on israel constitute crime against humanity crime so heinous that they violate our understanding of the depth of human depravity that depravity continue today as innocent remain held hostage by hamas terrorist and their patron the state of iran israel have legitimate right to self defence and to defeat hamas we can support israel and grieve with its people while recognise that how counter terrorism operation be conduct matter it matter because israel action as rule of law nation and our word as its friend shape our ability to be legitimate arbiter in future conflict and to have the right to call out abuser such as russia it matter because although there be an imperative to defeat hamas in the immediate term in order to secure israel future how they be defeat will shape the region future and because the people of gaza be not million child bear no collective guilt for hamas terror so today repeat my call for the creation of special envoy for the middle east peace process will my right hon friend tell the house more about what action be be take to prevent conflict and loss of life on the west bank and in east jerusalem when will we finally proscribe the islamic revolutionary guard corps with regard specifically to the west bank this be something about which speak to mahmoud abbas the president of the palestinian authority this morning also speak yesterday to his majesty the king of jordan we discuss the measure that be necessary and the support the uk can provide to ensure the strong stability of the west bank no one want to see the situation escalate assure my hon friend that we be in active dialogue with both partner to see how we can help bring that stability to the west bank indeed it be something will also continue to discuss with prime minister netanyahu it be important that the west bank remain calm and that be what we will help to bring about on saturday go to shul and sit next to constituent whose cousin be one of the hostage my thought and prayer go out not only to he but to all family and hostage currently detain while conflict escalate in the middle east we see the effect on the street here in britain welcome the prime minister and the leader of the opposition stand behind israel right to defend itself and the million increase in funding for the community security trust however unfortunately in the past week we have see an increase of around in antisemitic incident and an increase in suspicious behaviour and even this weekend glorification of hamas and genocidal chant on the street of our city in some case mere foot away from police officer will the prime minister join in applaud the effort of the cst in keep the jewish community safe but also commit to ensure that anyone find to be preach this hate speech on our street face the full extent of the law can give the hon gentleman that assurance meet the cst and police chief last week in downing street not just to provide extra funding but to reiterate that there be zero tolerance in the united kingdom for antisemitism it be tragic that we have see significant increase in incident over the past week but those who perpetrate these crime will be meet with the full force of the law want to add my voice to all those who stand with israel and her inalienable right to defend herself against an unspeakable crime as someone bear in the middle east as father and as human it be too painful to watch israel have to take the necessary step to root out this evil virus of fundamentalism that have so clearly infest those in hamas and of course destroy it just as we stand together against isis we will stand together again my request to my right hon friend be that when this have be do the uk encourage israel to set out for all to see the positive action it will take to change the reality in gaza once and for all gaza and the world will need israel to show her good self after this war thank my right hon friend for his powerful statement and also agree with he we must think about the future and in spite of this awful tragedy we can not lose sight of the well future that we all want to strive for indeed in my conversation with leader we have already be think about that and it be something raise with the prime minister of israel as well we all want that well future for the israeli and palestinian people and hopefully out of this tragedy we will find way to move close towards it the massacre of israeli civilian be heinous act of terrorism that we all utterly condemn and the hostage must be release immediately in the word of the united nations secretary general the horrific act by hamas do not justify respond with collective punishment of the palestinian people but that be what we be see in gaza with civilian area bomb and food electricity water and medicine all cut off such collective punishment be war crime under the geneva convention so will the prime minister take this opportunity to make it clear to the israeli government that this collective punishment of palestinian civilian must end immediately would say gently to the hon gentleman that actually believe that we should support absolutely israel right to defend itself and to go after hamas recognise that it face vicious enemy that embed itself behind civilian of course israel will act within international humanitarian law and as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution in avoid harm citizen but we must acknowledge always that the responsibility for what be happen here be with hamas and hamas alone may thank you mr speaker for the step that you take at the beginning of last week in light up this palace in the colour of blue and white as an act of solidarity with the israeli victim of hamas terrorism know that it be appreciate by those british family mourn love one who be slay in that action as well as by family live with unimaginable fear right now because they have family member who have be take hostage in gaza some of those family member be with we in the gallery do the prime minister agree that after the act of barbarism by hamas there be no go back to the situation before where right under the nose of the international community hamas be allow to rearm time and again they be allow to misappropriate aid into terrorist infrastructure build those tunnel amass armament and hide they behind civilian family do he agree that the international community must take stand and not allow the gaza strip to go back to become terrorist statelet first thank my right hon friend for everything he do to support the jewish community here and overseas agree that no country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizen and simply return to the condition that allow that to take place israel have the right indeed the obligation to defend itself and to ensure that this never happen again mr speaker no stone can remain unturned in find political solution those be not my word but those of the israeli and arab mother collective woman wage peace echo in recent day by survivor from kibbutz the family of those murder at netiv organisation such as omdim ben yachad and thousand of peace activist and ordinary israelis who be desperately pray for the cycle of violence to end and last peace to be secure what will the government be do to heed that call and mobilise international actor to find the political solution however far away it feel right now so that there may be way out of the nightmare that hamas have unleash for all in israel palestine and the wide region for good we must provide an alternative to the vision of violence fear and terror present by hamas and that be what the united kingdom will do stand with israel but also work together with its people and our ally across the region all of those who remain committed to vision of more peaceful more integrated more secure and more prosperous middle east that be what we will work towards welcome my right hon friend statement welcome in particular his urging of the state of israel to act in line with international humanitarian law and his call for israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian may ask he to press upon our israeli friend the principle of distinction and proportionality in their action to avoid any sense in which it look like collective punishment be be mete out on the palestinians in gaza as well as ensure that we do nothing that will leave the democracy bad off at the end of this which be not in line with the principle all of we would wish to hold as say we support israel right to defend itself but as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian that be something that specifically discuss with prime minister netanyahu and we will continue to do so six year old palestinian child be murder in chicago because of his muslim faith and as response to the war between israel and hamas in the last week we have see sharp rise in islamophobic rhetoric and the dehumanisation of palestinians tragically yesterday we see the consequence in the murder of that little boy will the prime minister review his statement about the conflict and ensure that he do not add to the further vilification of palestinians and muslims when condemn the action of hamas gently urge the hon gentleman to examine what say early from the dispatch box particularly about stand with the british muslim community at this difficult time we will not tolerate anti muslim hatred in any form and we will seek to stamp it out wherever it occur be pleased to say that in june the security minister confirm additional funding of million available this financial year to provide protective security at mosque and muslim faith school as demonstration of our intent to deliver on what say but say to he please see what say early from the dispatch box we stand with all community at this difficult time in the long litany of attack against jews around the world this be the single most murderous since the end of the holocaust in the prime minister support for the jewish community in this country and for israel have be heroic this be an historic moment and the response of his majesty government have be all anyone could have ask do the prime minister agree that israel have act entirely in accordance with international law despite hamas use human shield and every type of horrific provocation israel have not only right to defend itself but duty to defend its people from sadistic and vicious murderer my right hon and learn friend make an excellent point that israel have not just the right but the duty one only need to imagine if similar incident have occur in our country what we would do to secure the safety and security of our citizen that be what israel be do it have every right and duty to do so and it will have our support as it do condemn unreservedly the action of hamas and the horror that have unfold in the region and ask that the hostage be return safely as soon as possible however from speak to aid worker base in gaza the reality on the ground be that despite the evacuation order people who be ill frail in hospital or just get old can not get out this morning speak to aid worker who tell people be return from southern gaza to northern gaza because they have no water and there be nowhere to go they can not escape will the prime minister urge the israeli government to bear in mind the reality for ordinary palestinian people live in the nightmare that be unfold around they through no fault of their own as say have speak to president sisi about the importance of the rafah crossing be open for humanitarian purpose and will continue to do so and about the importance of allow humanitarian aid to flow into gaza today announcement of more support will hopefully make difference again contrast israel attempt to minimise civilian casualty by warn people to leave gaza with hamas who be urge the local population to stay to use they as human shield it be unacceptable and we should call it out for what it be every tragic loss of life in gaza be the responsibility of hamas alone some people in this place would do well to remember that fact week on from the pogrom what do we have on the street of britain we have some people attend pro palestinian march hold up banner in support of terrorist whether it be hang glider chant anti jewish chant support the racist boycott divestment and sanction movement or in the case of protest in glasgow remind jews where they be in jews need no reminder of where they be in those scene be deeply distress to british jews many of whom do not believe that the police will take action could urge the prime minister to look at what some of our european partner be do and to take strong action against some of those march thank my hon friend for everything he do to support the jewish community in our country join he in say that these act be appal want to make sure that we provide security and relieve the anxiety in the jewish community here in the united kingdom which be why quickly take step last week to provide that reassurance be clear that where people incite racial or religious hatred or where people conduct be threaten abusive or disorderly or cause distress to other we expect the police to take action and those commit such crime should face the full force of the law join this house in its condemnation of the bloodshed in israel and palestine the million palestinians in the open air prison of gaza face dire humanitarian emergency long before today yet indiscriminate airstrike and siege tactic have turn what be critical emergency into devastating catastrophe will the prime minister make it clear to the israeli government that lay siege to civilian in gaza by cut off food water power and medical supply and through indiscriminate airstrike kill civilian be in clear violation of international law just what be the international community do to stop the horrific and inhuman treatment of palestinians again point out gently to the hon gentleman that hamas be the entity responsible for the suffering we be see and hamas alone of course we in the international community will do our good to alleviate the impact on innocent people which be why we have today announce further aid to the region we will make sure that we provide as much humanitarian support as we can and indeed in all our conversation with leader around the region we be discuss the humanitarian situation and find way to work together to alleviate the impact on innocent life and that be what we will continue to do do the prime minister accept that what hamas do be not terrorism for its own sake but an act of calculated barbarism with strategy behind it the present war will not feature egypt and jordan as enemy of israel as be the case in previous war so do he agree that that strategy be to try and prevent similar peace agreement with country such as saudi arabia do he accept that hamas be creature of client state of russia and while we be talk about this we must remember that russia be still at war in ukraine thank my right hon friend and he be right to point to the broad situation and welcome the progress that have be make on normalisation between israel and other country in the region which speak to the bright future that we all hope we will see one day let reassure he on our support for

for the hon lady constituent but all those british national and other who be take by hamas in that appalling act they should know that we be do absolutely everything we can to try to bring they back home as quickly and safely as possible we in this house be all absolutely horrify by the terrorist atrocity in israel and the appalling way in which the hamas terrorist have murder torture and kidnap man woman and child thank the prime minister for his important and significant statement today and for the way in which as he have just say we be give all the support to the grieve family right now that be paramount can he explain from his conversation with president sisi how the opening of the border crossing between gaza and egypt on humanitarian ground will be undertake in way that prevent hamas terrorist from leave and potentially create further atrocity in the region my right hon friend have make an excellent point that be why there be complexity to open the rafah border crossing but she should be reassure that we be engage in those conversation with the egyptians and with other partner include the americans to find safe way to open the crossing ideally for the evacuation of british national who may be in gaza but also to send humanitarian support into gaza which know we would all like to see happen the international committee of the red cross have state that hospital in gaza risk turn into morgue without electricity the commissioner general of the united nations relief and works agency for palestine refugees in the near east have say that the agency colleague in gaza be no long able to provide humanitarian assistance and the number of people seek shelter in unrwa facility in the south be absolutely overwhelming some civilian have no choice but to stay in the north of gaza and must be protect at all time what conversation have the prime minister have with his israeli counterpart about create safe zone and humanitarian corridor in gaza have the prime minister raise the urgent need to prevent the perpetration of atrocity on all civilian will he increase financial support for unrwa and the surround host nation give that the increase need of refugee from palestine will only sadly increase far for many year be proud that over the past few year we have be one of the lead donor to unrwa account for about of all its support for the region today we announce an increase of about third in our humanitarian support and we will work with the relevant partner to see how good to ensure that those fund can make difference in the region as quickly as possible thank you mr speaker for allow we one minute silence to reflect on the victim of what have take place in the middle east there can be no great contrast between the action of the israel defence force which attempt to prevent the loss of civilian life and the sheer brutality of the terrorist who kill and maim as many people as they possibly can there can be no comparison between those two aspect of what be happen this operation by the terrorist group hamas be clearly well plan well resource and well equipped and have clearly be plan for many month it be beyond belief that the islamic revolutionary guard corps which fund and support hamas be not behind this whole operation will my right hon friend now take the action that the whole house have ask he to take and proscribe the irgc in its entirety we have already take strong action against the iranian regime include the sanctioning of individual and entity include the irgc in its entirety furthermore the national security act implement new measure to protect the british public include new offence of espionage and foreign interference and tough power to arrest and detain people suspect of involvement in state threat as the house know the government have long stand policy of not comment on whether specific organisation be be consider for proscription and our approach as currently state be completely in line with that of our ally the israeli government have the right indeed the duty to protect their civilian against these bloody terrorist attack and we wish the prime minister well in his advice and guidance to the israeli government to enable they to achieve the aim that they need to achieve in protect their citizen his statement indicate that we would not tolerate the glorification of terror which would be meet by the full force of the law will he therefore join in condemn the irish language speak school in west belfast whose student hold pro palestinian demonstration this week which be facilitate within the school do he agree that school should be place where pupil be teach that it be morally wrong to support terrorism and they should not facilitate such demonstration thank the right hon gentleman for his remark do not know the detail of the incident that he have describe but he be right that this malicious activity should not be happen in school we be absolutely clear about the fact that under the terrorism act and it be an offence there be range of offence to encourage terrorism glorify and support group that have be proscribe as terrorist organisation under uk law the police will use all the tool at their disposal to stamp that out and arrest those who perpetrate such act one of the many thing bournemouth be know for be its large jewish community indeed our first citizen and mayor councillor anne filer be jewish those people in my constituency will have hear and draw comfort from the calm and measure word of not just the prime minister but the right hon and learn gentleman the leader of the opposition this afternoon what we have see be not just an attack on the territorial integrity of israel but an attack on jews and those of the jewish faith will my right hon friend join everyone else of good will in this house to make it clear not just this week last week this month next month but always that antisemitism have no place in our society agree with my right hon friend this be an attack on jews and we should call it out for what it be that be what hamas believe and what they have try to do but they will meet firm resistance from we we will not tolerate antisemitism in any form on our street not just today or tomorrow but always the prime minister have reaffirm his commitment to two state solution why then have his government fail to recognise the state of palestine when united nations member country have do so israel have absolutely every right to defend itself but palestinians need to have that right as well if recognise as state palestine will be able to root out terrorism and defend its territory do the unjustifiable action of hamas group that do not represent palestinians justify the collective punishment of innocent palestinian civilian in gaza by the israeli defence force the united kingdom government long stand position under both party have be that the united kingdom will recognise palestinian state at time when it well serve the object of peace we be committed to the objective of sovereign prosperous and peaceful palestinian state living side by side with safe and secure israel as last week attack demonstrate right now we must ensure that israel have that security do my right hon friend agree that to conflate hamas and the palestinians be not only wrong but dangerous hamas have abduct torture and execute palestinian member of fatah they have break the arm of child who have wear fatah colour to school and they do not want two state solution because they do not believe israel should exist as state but if the finger on the trigger be hamas the string be be pull from tehran with million of investment go from tehran to the terrorist of hamas be it not time that we in this country ask again why iranian bank be operate from the city of london why iran air be operate from heathrow airport and why we have not proscribe the irgc as believe we should have agree with my right hon friend that crucially the palestinian people be also the victim of hamas as he say hamas do not represent the palestinian people or their legitimate aspiration to live with security and dignity they do not stand for the future that the palestinian people want and he be right to highlight that that be why we have take the approach that we have and we will continue to make sure that our sanction regime be effective where we have sanction entity include bank we will ensure that those sanction be comply with the new economic deterrence initiative that we have establish with funding will help to ensure that that happen join other in condemn the atrocity of hamas and my thought be with all those affect by the conflict in israel and gaza one of my constituent uk national be trap in gaza have travel there on friday october thank the prime minister the foreign secretary foreign commonwealth and development office staff and those on labour front bench for the work they have be do to try to bring my constituent home write to the foreign secretary on friday to update he on my constituent whereabouts ask the prime minister and the foreign secretary to redouble their effort to bring my constituent home to ensure the safe passage of all other uk national trap in gaza and to work to support people both in gaza and israel who be catch up in this terrible conflict thank the hon lady and express my sympathy to her constituent and their family we be in touch with all the family who have register with the foreign commonwealth and development office to provide consular assistance to they obviously the situation in gaza be difficult but we be do everything that we can not least through our conversation with the egyptians about the rafah crossing we have pre emptively deploy border force rapid deployment team to egypt so that when and if the crossing be open we be able to extract our citizen and bring they home that be something have explicitly discuss with president sisi to receive assurance from the egyptians that they will allow the safe passage of british national when the time allow the hon lady can rest assure that we will continue to do everything that we can to support her constituent and all other who be trap modern medium have bring the full horror of the profoundly evil crime commit against state of israel into our home and they be now bring the unfold horror of the human catastrophe take place in gaza into our sit room as well in his statement the prime minister indicate that israel and egypt be deny access for humanitarian aid into gaza what possible reason could there be for that as we hear previously there be complexity with ensure the safe opening of the rafah crossing we be have conversation with the israelis the egyptians and other partner to see how good we can provide humanitarian assistance to the region not least through the deployment of our royal navy asset which will arrive over the course of the coming week and the increase in aid funding which we announce today that will provide support to people in the region the use of white phosphoru in densely populate area against civilian be illegal both amnesty international and human rights watch have report the use of white phosphorous against civilian in gaza have the foreign commonwealth and development office receive confirmation of those report if such weapon have be use against civilian population in gaza what will the prime minister response be of course we keep everything under review but be not go to comment or speculate on report where we do not have full access to information or be unable to verify fact welcome the prime minister statement and the three step approach terrorism be terrorism as somebody who come from muslim background say this the action that we see with regard to hamas be clearly terrorist and barbaric and therefore everything must be do to confront that terrorist organisation as the former special envoy for freedom of religion or belief work with people from the muslim jewish and christian faith we work together to tackle intolerance against all people of all faith on the specific point about conversation with king abdullah hamas will be defeat but the question be who replace hamas in gaza have the prime minister have conversation with king abdullah with regard to whether president mahmoud abbas and the palestinian authority be prepared to step in with the support of international partner and humanitarian assistance everything must be do to preserve human life and find two state solution in this matter thank my hon friend for his excellent question and reassure he that exactly that be part of the conversation have both yesterday with the king of jordan and today with president abbas we need to provide stable leadership in gaza once hamas have hopefully be remove that thinking be already happen among we and our partner on behalf of plaid cymru condemn the atrocity of hamas our thought be with all the israeli and palestinian civilian kill injure or bereave in this horrific conflict international humanitarian law exist for reason to safeguard all civilian universally among the right under that law be the right to water fuel be necessary for many people in palestine to have safe drinking water without clean water people will die the prime minister have announce humanitarian support today which welcome as close ally of israel what step be he take to urge israel to comply fully with international law include by supply essential fuel to gaza as say previously as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian and we will continue to do everything we can to provide humanitarian support to those affect commend the calm leadership of my right hon friend over the past few day as well as that of the leader of the opposition some people forget that the reason we defend israel right to exist and its security be that million jews be murder due to perverted ideology and we must never return to that that be why we stand with israel in its time of absolute need have jewish sister in law she be quite clear that she have never feel more threatened than she do this weekend when she see people take to the street wave flag bear hamas crest do not know whether the prime minister see this and call for israel to be sweep from the river to the sea this be all about get rid of the jews in palestine there be no question about it we must be clear about this we have to protect the jewish people here who be british citizen and we must stamp out antisemitism therefore ask my right hon friend whether we will redouble our effort to ensure that if ever such scene be to happen again the people bear those flag and hurl that abuse would be arrest and prosecute with the full strength of the law thank my right hon friend for his excellent contribution he be right there be no place for demonstration convoy or flag wave on british street that glorify terrorism or harass the jewish community that be why last week meet police chief and people from the community security trust in downing street to discuss how well we can protect the jewish community at this time and police these protest appropriately be pleased that that work be ongoing but of course we will remain engaged with all partner as my right hon friend say anyone who break the law should be meet with the full force of the law and be swiftly arrest many people will have see incident online and footage of scene that be simply unacceptable can reassure he that the police be currently review that footage and where possible and where they can they will arrest those responsible the act of terror that be commit by hamas be horrify and our prayer go out to everyone affect both in israel and across the world and those who be here in the house today israel be seek justice but innocent palestinians must not collectively pay the price urge the prime minister to seek guarantee from the israeli government on four crucial point first that incendiary weapon will not be use in civilian area secondly that hospital and medic will not be target thirdly that food water and electricity supply must be immediately restore and finally that we must not see military occupation and annexation of gazan land be confident that the prime minister of israel do not want to see any regional escalation beyond deal with hamas as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian since the hamas terrorist attack the unequivocal government support and concern for the safety and welfare of the uk jewish community have be extremely well receive by those in that community and no one have show great care than my right hon friend whom would like to thank over the come day as israel take the remedial and self defence action that it have be force to take can my right hon friend confirm that he will work with our international ally to ensure continued support for israel such that israel be not leave out on limb on its own to be pick off by enemy thank my hon friend for his kind word and agree that we will continue to support israel right to defend itself we remain engaged in the region talk to our partner so that we can provide israel with all the support that we can defend its position and also provide humanitarian support to alleviate the impact as good we can my thought and prayer be with all the family who be grieve follow the horrific terrorist attack by hamas which unreservedly condemn these atrocity be commit by terrorist who do not seek peace and they have set back the just cause of palestinian freedom and statehood which along with many across this house have long support over million palestinians in gaza have be tell to flee highlight the scale of the impending humanitarian disaster which will only inflame tension in the region there be grave concern about the escalation of the conflict in the wide region can the prime minister tell the house what particular step our government be take to help de escalate the conflict which risk turn into wide regional conflict draw in lebanon and iran both the foreign secretary and be speak extensively to all our partner in the region to urge everybody to put pressure on those who would seek to take advantage of the situation not to as say we have deploy surveillance aircraft to the mediterranean not least to ensure that hezbollah be not in receipt of extra arm shipment because that would be damaging to regional stability we will continue to make sure that that do not happen in take group of schoolchildren from the beit shvidler primary school in edgware to the hanukkah party at no lead voice of the choir be nathanel young one of the first people to be kill in the terrorist attack in israel will the prime minister advise the house what action have be take for the bereaved family and the family of the hostage who remain in gaza and what

morning and see at first hand the impact that this be have on the community there assure he that the foreign office be provide extensive consular support to all family who be impact and we will continue to do so throughout this crisis refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests wish to put on record my utter condemnation of the hamas attack israeli hostage must be release over the last week we have all see horrific image of innocent israelis and palestinians on our screen it have be awful what strike be quote that have see from an aid worker in gaza from medical aid for palestinians mahmoud shalabi say ve see kid write their name on their palm because when they die they want people to know who they be that be because in gaza family be be wipe out across the globe there have be collective outcry for the people of gaza most of whom as the prime minister have say have nothing to do with hamas have the prime minister pledge funding or support for the safety of child and their access to healthcare in hospital what be he do to facilitate the opening of the border for aid humanitarian access be so important so that foreign national can leave gaza have specifically speak to president sisi about the importance of open the rafah border crossing both for humanitarian purpose and to provide for the safe evacuation of british national today we have announce an increase in our aid funding to the region by around third and we will figure out how good that money can help those who need it as quickly as possible on international law and media impartiality will the attorney general be ask to provide legal note if not full opinion give for example that one of ofcom director ofcom have full statutory and regulatory responsibility for all visual and oral medium include the bbc be report to be support post this week argue that the government support for israel be vile colonial alliance and refer to ethnic cleansing and genocide of palestinians ofcom must surely be tell that it must deal with this at once as matter of impartiality quite apart from any criminal action that may be need under terrorist or criminal law thank my hon friend for his question will ensure that the attorney general look into it and more generally will just say that absolutely endorse those describe these attack as what they be which be act of terror by terrorist organisation obviously the bbc be editorially and operationally independent of government but the culture secretary raise that specific issue with the bbc director general last week hamas kidnapping of israelis be stark reminder that the terrorist group have learn from their paymaster the iranian regime who for year have promote state hostage taking include of course of uk national will the prime minister say bit more about the step that the uk government be take for the release of the british national who be currently hold in gaza as say we be provide consular support to the affected family we recognise that this will be very difficult time for they we have for long time maintain foreign office travel advice that people should not travel to gaza because we know the situation be dangerous we be work as hard as we can to open the rafah crossing and the border force team have already be deploy to egypt so that if and when the crossing be open we will rapidly be in position to be able to bring people home welcome the prime minister most powerful statement in robustly stand with israel in its mission to defeat hamas after their brutal terrorist offensive last week this have rightly be call israel but we now appreciate that follow those attack on america in grave operational and strategic error be make however well intentione in the name of defeat terrorism that lead to significant escalation and indeed radicalisation how event play out in the next few day will have severe repercussion across the middle east and beyond for year with no emergency governance security or humanitarian plan yet confirm do the prime minister agree that if we be true friend of israel we should counsel against full scale ground invasion at this time as it will see this conflict spill into the west bank east jerusalem and southern order there be still many member stand want to get everyone in as think that be right but ask that member please consider each other in both question and answer of course every country have the right to defend itself and it would not be appropriate for the uk to define that approach thank my right hon friend for his remark we will continue to stand with israel and as friend we will urge they to take every possible precaution to minimise the impact on civilian as you be aware mr speaker my immediate family be from the west bank but have extend family in gaza city their house be bomb by the idf so they go to seek sanctuary in church we be christian palestinians and be afraid to say that they be still there because they be too old to leave they say to that they have nowhere to go because of this not despite it attend vigil in oxford organise by the jewish community between our community we now share profound emotion loss and grief when the prime minister say never again agree with he will he give his assurance that it will be never again and that whenever we get through whatever happen in the next few day he will keep the promise he make to my great grandfather that there will be palestinian state to call our own at the end of it start by express my sympathy to the hon lady and her family for what they be go through know this will have be an incredibly difficult time for they also pay tribute to she because her presence at the vigil in spite of everything will have mean an enormous amount to many people and the courage she show in talk about that experience here today be admirable she look forward to more positive future which be an ambition share this be an unspeakably difficult situation tragedy but we must find way to move forward to secure more stable peaceful settlement for those live in the middle east because this tragedy have remind we all of the horror of war and the horror of terrorism we must find way to bring peace and stability to the region and that be what will strive very hard to help bring about as child of northern ireland will never forget how frightening it be to be in schoolroom when bomb go off across the road the hamas atrocity of last weekend rewrote the definition of evil the prime minister be right to have condemn hamas he be right to have stand beside the jewish population and he be right to have stand by israel duty to defend itself but our history also tell we that terrorism be rarely defeat by further terror so he be right also to be concern for innocent palestinians catch in the crossfire and who be be use as human shield thank he for what he say about the need for israel to stay within international law and for the additional aid we have pledge today may urge he to try to get that aid to the people who need it as quickly as possible thank my right hon friend for her contribution and can give she that reassurance know that she will have advice for we on how good we can do that we be keen to make sure that that aid make difference to as many people as quickly as possible and we will be work with partner to make sure that that happen hamas know what would happen to the people that they purport to represent after their atrocious terrorist action they know that it would rain down fear and pain and killing in the region anybody in our country who purport to support they deserve as the prime minister say the full force of the law thank the prime minister for say that more aid will be go to gaza but want to know from conversation that he have have with israel which he say he have have today what progress have be make to ensure that that aid medical supply fuel and water will actually reach the people of gaza as my hon friend the member for sunderland central julie elliott say people have nowhere to go nothing be get through so what be israel go to do to ensure that british aid can reach gazans it be also important that egypt be involve in that conversation because the rafah crossing be one of the primary route for aid to reach gaza that be why we have speak specifically with president sisi about that and we will continue to talk with he and other regional ally to find way to bring humanitarian aid to the region as quickly as possible thank my right hon friend for his statement and for his unequivocal condemnation of calculated act of murder and hostage taking which be deliberately design to provoke response that plunge the entire region if not the wide world into great conflict what assessment be my right hon friend and the government making of current escalation on the northern border of israel and lebanon we hear this afternoon of an evacuation of israeli citizen within km of the border do he think that that might well be further escalation of the situation and all part of calculate plan to plunge the region into chaos we absolutely do not want to see regional escalation one of the way that we can help to ensure that that do not happen my right hon and learn friend specifically mention lebanon be the deployment of our surveillance asset which go into the region last week with far to follow by the end of this week one of the thing that they can do be track and interdict armed shipment that might be go to hezbollah for example that be something that none of we will want to see which be why we have deploy those asset partner be grateful for our intervention because no one want to see an escalation of this conflict some of the most vulnerable citizen in the event of war be people with disability so what representation have the government make for the protection particularly of people with disability in northern gaza who be unable to move in all our conversation we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian and we will do everything that we can to bring humanitarian support to the region during the prime minister school visit this morning we hear incredibly powerful speech from student about the situation show the anguish feel about the bad attack on jewish people since the holocaust in the light of that will he ensure that the unequivocal support for israel that he have express today be maintain and do not weaken in the difficult day ahead as israel do what it have to do to remove the capacity of hamas ever to do this again thank my right hon friend for welcome to her constituency this morning and for join on what be an incredibly powerful visit to one of her local school praise the courage and eloquence of the student we hear who be incredible in explain how this have affect they and their family she have my assurance that we will continue to stand with israel as say this morning not just today not just tomorrow but always the prime minister be absolutely right to say that the unspeakable action of hamas mean that israel have not simply the right but duty to protect its own citizen however israel also have duty to protect innocent palestinians how do israel cut off food and water seriously bring the hostage home and help to defeat hamas it be not right for we to prescribe how another country can well exercise its lawful right indeed it be duty to self defence but as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian on saturday meet in rawtenstall representative of the british muslim and british palestinian community of east lancashire they be unite in one voice condemn the appalling action of hamas in the barbarous murder of jewish people they will have be hearten to hear the prime minister say that we stand with both the british muslim community and the british jewish community at this very difficult time they want to see israel comply with international law they want humanitarian corridor to remain open to enable innocent gazans to escape how will the deployment of the royal navy help to ensure that that happen know that this be important to my right hon friend like he we recognise that this be moment of anguish for british muslim community who be appal by the action of hamas but fearful of the response as say we mourn the loss of every innocent life of the civilian of every faith and nationality who have be kill our navy asset can help as have say to ensure that illegal arm shipment do not find their way to people such as hezbollah also the asset that we be deploy next week will be there as contingency and can provide humanitarian assistance if and as require which will be valuable contribution to the role we play we in walthamstow stand in solidarity with our neighbour who be in parliament today plead for help to get her elderly parent back after they be brutally take hostage by hamas we be also desperately worried about family from our community who be stick in gaza uk citizen try to get home we believe that every life deserve the protection of international law and that anyone who break it should be hold to account my constituent be also ask what more we can do by use our international connection as the prime minister will have see it have be report today that the qataris have broker deal to ensure that ukrainian child kidnap in russia be return home to their family what conversation have he have with the qataris about whether they might play similar role stop the violence in gaza accordingly rise some member will be disappoint but there be no way that we will get everybody in the question be far too long which be not help hope the answer will also be brief assure the hon lady that we be talk to all leader across the region indeed be due to speak to the qatari leadership maybe even today so that we can work with they and other to ensure the safe return of hostage and to de escalate the situation refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests relate to my visit to israel and palestine in may this year the median age of palestinian in gaza be year in the west bank the median age be year and in israel it be if we do not sort out this long term conflict quickly and permanently we will have generation of young people affect in both palestine and israel more radicalisation and more tragedy for family live in those country can my right hon friend elaborate far on his comment about peace process that will have lasting impact and on two state solution it be precisely because hamas have try to kill off that notion of peaceful settlement for the middle east peace stability and security for both the palestinian and israeli community that we must redouble our effort to bring it about that have very much be the subject of the conversation that have have and will continue to have with leader from around the region if we can contribute to that in any way we will thank the prime minister and my right hon and learn friend the leader of the opposition for their statement what role do the prime minister see for the united nations in provide much need humanitarian relief in the region particularly in gaza and in try to get new peace process off the ground know that that will be difficult but it be badly need thank the right hon gentleman for his kind comment the united nations can play significant role when it come to the humanitarian side indeed around three quarter of our exist aid to the region be channel through the un particularly the united nations relief and works agency which be refer to early be sure that it will continue to play valuable role go forward leed have proud jewish community include in my own constituency it be not just the barbarity that we see in the hamas attack burning murder mutilation and rape that be make my jewish constituent fearful but the fact that we come through several year where antisemitism have be give safe space in this country and that there be now protest on the street push forward the antisemitic message every day they be worried about how they go about live their normal life as such thank my right hon friend for the million of investment he have announce for security but ask he to keep close eye on whether more be need can not emphasise enough that the jewish community in my constituency and probably across the country be fearful all the time thank my right hon friend for his comment he be rightly champion of the jewish community in his constituency like he be clear that there be zero tolerance of antisemitism in the uk we will continue to do everything we can to ensure the security and safety of our jewish citizen stand with this house in condemnation of hamas appal killing of innocent israeli civilian and call for the immediate safe return of all the hostage but be very concerned about the increase number of death of innocent palestinians the forced mass displacement of gazans be lead to massive humanitarian crisis so can the prime minister explain what the government be do to prevent this have he demand an immediate ceasefire to end the collective punishment of civilian believe that we must absolutely support israel right to defend itself and to ensure that attack like this can not happen again but as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian and we will provide humanitarian support this morning be contact by constituent who on visit london on saturday be deeply disturb by the pro hamas chant that be be shout the destruction of national monument the fact that the main stage for the protest be right next to the cenotaph and medium report of somebody with union jack be detain and lead away what representation be go to be make to the mayor of london and the metropolitan police so that future protest be police appropriately we have ensure that the police have the tool power and guidance they need to police these protest appropriately obviously this be difficult situation be thankful to they for what they do over the weekend they have make think over arrest and as say they be currently review footage of some of the thing we have see after the fact where they can they will make further arrest but we be clear people may be free to express their view but where they be incite racial or religious hatred that be against the law and they will meet the full force of the law as result be go to finish the statement at so let we help each other over the weekend the archbishop of canterbury say that the price of evil can not be pay by the innocent yet in gaza palestinians have have no access to food water or electricity for over week we have see an evacuation order that have leave people with an impossible choice constituent in luton north have speak to about their pain and anguish at the unimaginable loss of life in gaza so many of which be child all follow the despicable attack of terror carry out by hamas even at time of war there be still law so as well as the urgent and desperate need for humanitarian aid and corridor what be minister do to counter breach of international law that risk the further loss of innocent life and threaten the possibility of peace in the middle east it be hamas alone who be responsible for this conflict and we support israel in take action against terrorism and to defend itself hamas have also enmesh themselves in the civilian population in gaza and be use they as human shield we will continue as friend to call on israel to do everything it can to reduce the impact on human life and we will continue to support the area with humanitarian support be it not the case that israel good hope for its future security in its justified response to hamas atrocity be to treat the civilian population in gaza and the west bank with the full respect that the law of war and civilised nation demand or else this tragic cycle of violence will simply repeat itself in the year to come as say we must support israel right to defend itself to go after hamas and recognise that it face vicious enemy who be embed themselves behind civilian but it will do so in accordance with international law as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian join the prime minister in strongly condemn the despicable horrendous act by hamas last week it be and be an ongoing war crime of course though one war crime do not excuse another so will the prime minister please speak to prime minister netanyahu and ask he to stop drop bomb on innocent child in gaza some of we know all too well that unspeakable violence should not be meet with unspeakable violence we know in ireland that the only option be to relentlessly pursue peace through dialogue refer the hon gentleman to the israeli president word where he have be clear that the

community in every part of the united kingdom feel safe at this terrible time thank my hon friend for everything he be do to support the jewish community in scotland agree with he that there be zero tolerance in our society for antisemitism which be why we have provide extra funding to the community security trust to ensure the safety and security of jewish institution school and synagogue and clear guidance to the police so that they can step in and take action where someone be break the law after the brutal terror atrocity carry out by hamas which tragically lead to the death of over israelis the israeli government of course have duty to defend their citizen but that must be proportionate and in line with international law we must also condemn any indiscriminate killing or forcible eviction from their land of the palestinian people who have suffer so much for several decade and be now face horror on an unimaginable scale do the prime minister agree that there must be no collective punishment of palestinians that we must strive for peace and that there must be humanitarian effort by the international community to avert further crisis we be work with our partner to bring humanitarian support to the region again today we announce significant increase in our humanitarian funding for the region which come on top of what be strong support already we will continue to talk to partner about how good to ensure that humanitarian aid find its way to the people who need it warmly commend the prime minister for the strength and clarity of his statement and for his support for israel his condemnation of hamas and his deep concern for the humanitarian situation in gaza also thank he for be so strongly supportive of the jewish and israeli community in britain but be he aware of an organisation call palestine action which have this weekend list series of company and the director of those company whom it believe to be legitimate target for terrorist action will he now name this outfit palestine action and condemn what it be do and will he ask the police and the crown prosecution service to act without further delay to deal with it thank my hon friend for his kind word be sure he will understand that arrest be an operational matter for the police but obviously what he have say on the face of it sound concern the police have power under the terrorism act of and to arrest people who be support either terrorism or proscribe terrorist organisation and would expect they to use the full power available to they to prosecute people under the law our thought at this time must above all be with the israeli and palestinian civilian dead and injure and with the hostage accord to medical aid for palestinians over palestinians have be kill so far in air attack more than quarter of they child and this be before any ground invasion what practical help can the government offer the million people of gaza and the uk citizen such as my constituent who be trap at

action of the iranian regime in the region echo the prime minister unequivocal condemnation of hamas and their appalling act of terrorist violence international humanitarian law demand that any israeli response must be legal and proportionate do the prime minister agree that regardless of the circumstance the collective punishment of an entire civilian population one that involve force displacement and the cutting off of water food fuel and medicine can never be legal or proportionate believe that we must support absolutely israel right to defend itself to go after hamas and to ensure its security in the long term and that such act can not happen again as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian greater manchester be home to large and vibrant jewish community they be our neighbour our friend and our family it be also home to sizeable presence of the bbc which when face with child murder rape and torture decide that hamas should be call militant rather than terrorist the political leader of this country and our royal family can decide that they be terrorist why can not our national broadcaster agree with my hon friend absolutely endorse those who in describe these attack call they what they be attack of terror by terrorist organisation my hon friend will know that the bbc be editorially and operationally independent of the government but the culture secretary have raise this issue directly with the director general and we wait to see my thought go out to everyone affect by the terrible violence in israel and palestine thank the prime minister for his announcement of additional funding for humanitarian aid press upon he the need to integrate framework of atrocity prevention into the uk strategy

on that be the reality that unfold in front of holocaust survivor and their family my own staff member share the story of his day old cousin who be surround by hamas try to murder they will the prime minister join in utterly condemn the act of hamas and in say that we will never forget and that never again really do mean never again thank my hon friend for her powerful statement and for all the work she do to support this cause in the country agree with she wholeheartedly in unequivocally condemn this act of barbarity as well as say that there be no place in our society for antisemitism she be right we must never forget praise her work and that of the holocaust educational trust and other for make sure that we never will wish that the horrific terrorist attack by hamas last week have be truly exceptional but the truth be that they remind of what the russians do last year in bucha in ukraine they also bring to mind how the first place the russians target in kyiv be jewish cemetery there be pattern here and actually there be network around the world so while of course we must ensure that israel be able to do everything it can to defend itself and we stand with every single person in this country who have friend or family member either in gaza or in israel who will be terrify about what will happen to they in the next few day we also have to tackle this network do we not do that not mean have some tough word with qatar in particular about why it have host so many people from hamas over recent year thank the hon gentleman for his powerful word we will continue to speak to all leader in the region to find way to de escalate the crisis and ensure that we can bring about an end to the evil that hamas represent he be right that it be not just limit to this particular conflict it be much more widespread that be why we need to work with our ally to stamp it out across the world hamas be an iranian proxy terror organisation designate as such under the terrorism act credible report indicate that the october attack be plan in concert with iran islamic revolutionary guard corps for many year hon member have be call for the irgc to be proscribe as terrorist organisation and those call have be repeat today while understand that the government do not indicate in advance what action they intend to take under the terrorism act may assure my right hon friend that if hon member be to wake up tomorrow morning and hear on the news that it have be so designate today they would be extremely relieved and grateful to he agree with my right hon friend that iran both pose an unacceptable threat to israel and have destabilising influence throughout the region that be why we have sanction more than iranian individual include the entirety of the irgc the new national security act also give we the power that we need to keep we safe here at home assure he that we will continue to work closely with our ally in find the good possible way to contain iran pernicious activity represent one of this country big jewish community in my constituency of hampstead and kilburn follow hamas brutal attack on israel there have be an increase in antisemitic incident in my local area most heartbreakingly have have email from local parent who be very worried about their child go to local jewish school because aggressive man have be stand outside take photo some of the parent have have their car tyre slash the prime minister have pledge support to jewish institution but will he commit publicly to ensure that the support actually reach local jewish school will he provide some much need reassurance to parent in hampstead and kilburn the hon lady make an excellent point this morning visit jewish school in north london to ensure that the community there know that will do everything can to keep they safe that be why last week meet with the community security trust which do an excellent job we have provide it with extra funding which it will ensure get to the frontline whether that be to school synagogue or other institution we will continue to do everything we can to keep our jewish community safe what be happen to our schoolchildren be simply unacceptable and sickening and we will work very hard to bring it to an end think it be disgusting to choose the day after the massacre to start wave palestinian flag outside the israeli embassy also find what happen at the cenotaph disgusting but those who be explicitly pro hamas be on different level do the prime minister agree that it be important to work with the home office and where possible to deport these individual because they do not share our value and they be not welcome in this country the military wing of hamas have be proscribe as terrorist organisation by the uk for some time in addition to the political wing more recently once group be proscribe it be criminal offence for people in the uk to do various thing in support of that organisation under the terrorism act furthermore the terrorism act create the offence of the encouragement of terrorism which give the police the power and tool they need to arrest those individual who be perpetrate that kind of support will ensure that they face the full force of the law utterly condemn the barbaric attack by hamas and call for the unconditional release of all those take hostage these be horrific act of terrorism and constitute war crime israel do have right to self defence but the collective punishment of the people of gaza be also war crime those two thing can both be true the killing of over civilian by the idf be not only humanitarian catastrophe but risk drive the deadly cycle of violence still far welcome the prime minister statement that he be strain every sinew to keep the flame of peace and stability alive so will he listen to those un expert call for ceasefire what more will he do to promote renew international effort towards two legally recognise separate state safe within their own border it be that vision of safe and secure two state solution that hamas have try to kill off with their terrorist atrocity over the past week that be why absolutely support israel right to defend itself it must be able to go after hamas to take back hostage to strengthen its security for the long term and to ensure that this can not happen again as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian and we will continue to work with international partner to bring humanitarian support to the region give the appalling terrorist atrocity and wide event of the past day not to mention the division we be now see in our street do the prime minister agree that it be time for cool head dial down the rhetoric restraint and objective leadership right across the political community with view to provide humanitarian support in gaza defeat hamas and bring people home those be all the right objective and we be work on all three particularly work with regional partner to de escalate violence but also bring humanitarian support to the region and think about bright future where people can live peacefully and securely side by side as well as the discussion that the prime minister have have with his international counterpart can he tell we what discussion the government have have with international aid organisation particularly on ensure that if the rafah border crossing be open to allow humanitarian corridor the aid be successfully co ordinated have there be discussion about who will take responsibility for displace palestinian civilian who will have nowhere to go do he support the principle that those palestinian civilian have the right to return home at the early opportunity be proud that we have be long stand significant supporter of aid to the region and have regular dialogue with agency such as the un our support to the un directly help around million palestinians refugee every year over the past few year we have announce an increase in that funding today by around third which be significant we will work with partner agency to find the most effective and quick way to get that aid to the people who need it in unequivocally condemn the barbarity of hamas associate myself with the remark of my right hon friend the member for clwyd west mr jones few moment ago about the irgc and iran may ask specifically about the aid that we have pledge today for palestinians clearly we have see that hamas have be misappropriate aid include use piping design for water to fire missile at israel how will we make sure that aid that go into the gaza strip be not use to strengthen hamas that be very good question from my right hon friend and it be something we review and monitor very carefully we channel the vast majority of our aid for the palestinian territory through the un and it be almost overwhelmingly on humanitarian purpose health education and the protection service for palestinians we do not provide any bilateral financing aid into the region which should give he some reassurance with the new investment announce today we will of course ensure that it go on the thing we care about and to the people we care about agree with the prime minister that israel response need to be constrain by international humanitarian law what step will the government be take to monitor compliance with those constraint in the come day and how many day do he think it will now be before urgently need humanitarian relief can be take into gaza we be do everything we can to support humanitarian effort move aid into the region as quickly as we can we will continue to have conversation with all our counterpart in the region to make sure that that aid get there as quickly as humanly possible stand with my constituent in bolton in condemn the act of terror commit by hamas who have target not only innocent adult but even more barbarically child at the onset of the horrific atrocity the government rightly reach out their hand to the victim of unspeakable terrorism do the prime minister agree with and my constituent that the people of gaza must be treat fairly within the bound of international law and that we refuse to accept an all out humanitarian crisis we do support israel right to defend itself and as friend we will continue to call on israel to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian we will do everything we can to bring humanitarian support to the people of gaza as quickly as practically possible the targeted killing of civilian whether israeli or palestinian must be condemn as must the kidnapping of hostage the civilian of gaza should not be make to pay the price for the atrocity of hamas block child access to food go beyond self defence it be violation of international law the world health organisation have describe force patient to relocate from hospital as tantamount to death sentence for some will the prime minister do anything he can to convince the israeli government to cancel the relocation order lift the siege and end indiscriminate bombing must gently point out to the hon lady that it be not israel that be deliberately target civilian in gaza it be hamas who be enmesh themselves in the civilian population and use people as human shield she talk about people move but again israel be attempt to minimise the impact on civilian by ask people to leave northern gaza and it be hamas who be tell people to stay and use they as human shield we should all have no time for those who express sympathy for the terrorist of hamas and we should have no time for those who amplify their horrible message either will the prime minister join in welcome the action of the secretary of state for science innovation and technology in try to call the social medium giant to account and will he join in encourage they both to co operate with the police in this country in their investigation and to do the same to try to minimise their impact abroad thank my hon friend for his excellent point more broadly want to make the point that online offending be as serious as offline offending we have robust legislation in place to deal with threaten and abusive behaviour or behaviour that be intend or likely to stir up hatred and it apply whether the behaviour take place online or offline we be work closely with the police and the internet company to make sure that those who break those rule meet the full force of the law follow the horror of hamas appal terrorist attack it be crucial as other have say that we distinguish between hamas and innocent palestinian civilian in line with international humanitarian law the united nations population fund say that there be pregnant woman in gaza with due to give birth this month what effort be be make to ensure that gaza hospital be protect and able to operate for those pregnant woman newborn child and all other who need urgent medical attention this be an incredibly difficult time with an impact on many and it be important that we recognise and remember that the people responsible for bring it about be solely and unequivocally hamas with their appalling act over the last week as israel take step rightly to defend itself we will continue to call on it to take every precaution to avoid harm civilian we be do everything we can to bring humanitarian support into the region do the prime minister agree that we face grave and dangerous moment in the middle east which have be the result of myriad policy failure go back more than year and that vacuum have be create where country such as iran through its hamas and hezbollah proxy be test the will of israel and the west as they seek to destabilise the region urge the prime minister to work with the us and other ally to ensure that they do not succeed and that we show the same resolve on this era define moment as we do with our support for ukraine thank my hon friend for what he say he be absolutely right we must stand resolutely with israel and also with our ally such as the us to demonstrate that hamas terrorism will not prevail we will ensure not only that israel can defend itself but that we work with partner to bring peace and stability to the region that everyone live there deserve the barbarism unleash last weekend be unparalleled in the history of the state of israel israel unequivocally have the right to defend itself and yet it remain the case that half the population of gaza be child under the age of of whom around be believe to have die already welcome very much the additional aid provide but with the united nations relief and works agency warn that its ability to provide relief be run out today can the prime minister use every channel to drive home the message that humanitarian aid delay risk be aid too late can assure the hon lady that we be work very hard with partner across the region to bring humanitarian aid to the people who need it as soon as practically possible order know that lot of people be disappointed that they have not be able to ask their particular question but the house be grateful to the prime minister for have be at the dispatch box for two hour must point out in advance to all those colleague who will come and complain to about not be able to speak that the house have be ask the prime minister to use his diplomatic skill to the good of his ability on behalf of our country so think we must release he from the chamber to allow he to do so thank you prime minister on point of order madam deputy speaker point of order come after statement be this directly relate to the statement indicate assent then hope it really be point of order madam deputy speaker thank you for grant this point of order appreciate that the prime minister be at the dispatch box for nearly two hour but as result of the importance and the magnitude of this issue and the complexity and nature of our question nearly member do not get chance to speak will you madam deputy speaker do everything that you can to ensure that time will be afford to we during the rest of this week and go forward so that we can debate and discuss this very important issue the hon lady make perfectly reasonable point the leader of the house be in her place and will have hear what she have say far to that point of order madam deputy speaker know that the foreign secretary and his colleague be make themselves available to speak to colleague because we be very aware that they will have constituency issue to discuss be very grateful to the leader of the house for give that immediate answer hope the hon lady and the rest of the house will appreciate that minister be do their good to make themselves available especially where there be particular issue relate to constituent hope the house will settle down as we move on to the next item of business will those who be leave do so quietly and swiftly prison capacity with permission shall make statement on the criminal justice system in england and wales the first duty of any government be to keep their people safe and that be why those who pose danger to society must be lock up the government be categorical that the bad offender should be lock away for as long as it take to protect the public we have increase the sentence for offence include knife crime cause death by dangerous driving now maximum of life imprisonment and cause or allow the death of child we have end automatic halfway release for serious sexual and violent offender so they will serve two third of their sentence behind bar and in the most dangerous case all of their sentence behind bar we be change the law to make whole life sentence the default for the most heinous type of murder so that for society most depraved killer life mean life and murderer end their day in prison today can announce that we will be go far we will legislate so that rapist as well as those convict of equivalent sexual offence will serve the entirety of the custodial term hand down to they by the court year custodial term will mean year behind bar there have be inaccurate report in the medium claim that judge have be tell not to send rapist to prison let be categorical this be untrue sentencing be matter for the judiciary act impartially and in accordance with the law it be fact that under this government the most serious and dangerous offender be be lock away for long in the case of rapist average sentence be nearly third long than in that be the right thing to do to keep the public safe to continue to put the bad offender away for long we must use prison well and always so that there be sufficient space to lock up the most dangerous criminal we must reform the justice system so that it keep the bad of society behind bar rehabilitate offender who will be let out and present the least serious low risk offender with path away from life of crime that matter because intelligent reform mean less crime have be candid from the moment take on this role that our custodial estate be under pressure today the prison population in england and wales be great than it have ever be nearly double the level it be three decade ago that be not principally because of the growth in the sentence population instead it be the remand population principally make up of unconvicted prisoner await trial which have surge in recent year from in to more than in that be more than more people in our prison out of total of some that be because in the white heat of the pandemic we take the right and principled decision not to jettison hundred of year of british history and abandon the jury trial system we do that because the jury trial system be the bedrock of our freedom but covid restriction inevitably mean that the flow of trial slow and in turn the remand population grow that growth be exacerbate by industrial action last year in addition the recall population be also significantly high than in partly because we be rightly ensure that offender who do not comply with their licence condition be return to prison the government have take unprecedented step to meet demand we be build modern rehabilitative prison place the large prison build programme since the victorian era by double up cell where it be safe to do so speed up the deportation of foreign national offender and delay non essential maintenance project to bring cell back into use we have free up an extra place since september last year alone on top of that we have continue to roll out hundred of rapid deployment cell at prison site altogether we have be bring on capacity at rate of more than place week the fast rate in living memory and possibly in year we be go far today can announce up to million for more prison place enough for more than new cell when we legislate to keep rapist behind bar for the whole of their custodial term will ensure that commencement be dependent on there be sufficient prison capacity there be already an obligation to lay before both houses of parliament report as to how have discharge my general duty in relation to the court to ensure public confidence new annual statement of prison capacity will be lay before both houses it will include clear statement of current prison capacity future demand the range of system cost that will be incur under different scenario and our forward pipeline of prison build that will bring great transparency to the plan and will set out the progress that be be make have also already commission urgent work to conclude before the end of the year to identify new site for we to purchase that be back by down payment of up to million in funding to acquire land in and launch the planning process we must do whatever it take to ensure that there be always enough prison place to lock up the most dangerous offender to keep the british people safe to ensure that criminal can be bring to justice and to maintain safety and decency in the prison estate we have decide to use the power in section of the criminal justice act to allow the prison service to move some less serious offender out of prison on to licence up to day before their automatic release date let be clear this will not apply to anyone serve life sentence anyone serve an extended determinate sentence anyone serve sentence for an offence of particular concern anyone convict of serious violence offence anyone convict of terrorism or anyone convict of sex offence and this power will be use only for limited period and only in target area every offender will be place under strict licence condition that provide step down from custody to live in the community they may include the follow first be make to wear an electronic tag when that be need for the offender to be manage safely secondly condition not to contact name individual directly or indirectly thirdly have to live at an address approve by the offender probation officer fourthly attend appointment and fifthly condition not to enter certain area such as particular postcode should also make it clear that breach of those condition could lead to offender be recall to custody for the entire second half of their sentence this will be oversee by the probation service probation service into which we have inject million year to recruit staff to bring down case load and deliver well supervision of offender in the community in addition hm prison probation service leadership will retain discretion to decide on further exemption from release on advice of governor when concern remain let make it clear that this be temporary operational measure to relieve immediate pressure contribute to by remand however if we be to protect the public and reduce crime we need to go far to use our prison well at the heart of the long term plan for prison reform that be announce today be simple mission cut crime to deliver that we need to do three thing first we need to ensure that the most dangerous offender be lock up for long away from the public and unable to commit crime secondly we need to ensure that prison be gear to help offender turn away from crime to change their way and to become contribute member of society thirdly we need to ensure that more low level offender get the tough community sentence that be show by the evidence to cut reoffende and hence to cut crime let put that last point in another way prison should not ruin the redeemable it be clear that all too often the circumstance that lead to an initial offence be exacerbate by short stint in prison with offender lose their home break contact with key support network and crucially meet other inside prison who steer they in the wrong direction when they be release just short time later they all too often reoffend fuel by addiction or mental health issue that can not possibly be address effectively in such short space of time the fact be that more than of people who leave prison after serve less than month go on to commit further crime the figure be for those who serve sentence of six month or less however the figure for those who be on suspend sentence order with condition be meanwhile the cost of this be per year per prisoner the taxpayer should not be fork out for system that risk far criminalise offender and trap they in merry go round of short sentence so the government be determined to grasp the nettle and deliver well approach we will legislate for presumption that custodial sentence of less than month in prison will be suspend and offender will be punish in the community instead repay their debt within community clean up our neighbourhood and scrub graffiti off wall we can do this more intelligently with modern solution for digital age can announce today that we be double the number of gps tag available to the court to ensure that offender can be monitor to track they to ensure that they be go to work and also to ensure that their freedom be curtail in the evening and weekend with robust curfew of up to hour day we will make further use of new technology such as alcohol monitor tag this will enable we to strengthen and expand successful step down programme such as home detention curfew which we will keep under active review if offender breach the term of their curfew or other requirement of their suspend custodial sentence or commit another offence they can be haul back before the court and force to serve that sentence in custody what we be not do be get rid of short sentence altogether know from my time as prosecutor that that be sometimes the right and just option prolific offender who be unable or unwilling to comply with community order or other order of the court must know that their action have consequence and they will continue to feel the full force of the justice system build on our antisocial behaviour action plan the home secretary and be look at what more we can do to punish those so call low level offender who be blight on our community for some offender the proper sanction be be afraid the clang of the prison gate we will also remove foreign offender who should not be in the united kingdom take up space in our prison at vast expense to the taxpayer there be over foreign national in our prison it can not be right that some of they be sit in prison when they could otherwise be remove from our country that be why we will extend the early removal scheme so that we have the power to remove foreign criminal up to month before they be due to be release up from month now get they out of the country early and no long cost taxpayer fortune to support that more caseworker will be deploy to speed up removal and the home office will also look at measure to do more to remove foreign national accuse of less serious crime more quickly we will continue to strike new prisoner transfer deal like the one agree with albania ensure that criminal from overseas serve their time at home rather than in britain we will bring forward legislation to enable prisoner to be hold in prison overseas an approach take by belgium norway and denmark in recent year more must be do to stop people spend long period of time wait in prison for their trial as have set out there be now more than defendant on remand in our prison remand decision be properly for independent judge but we will consider whether to extend the discount to encourage people to plead guilty at the first opportunity because when more offender plead guilty that save time in the court and cut the number of people in our prison on remand but most importantly it save victim the ordeal of give evidence in court we will also be review the use of recall for offender on release who infringe the term of their licence it be right that ex prisoner who commit new crime or serious breach while on licence should be return to prison we want to ensure that the system be work effectively to mitigate any risk pose by offender while not have people in prison on recall long than necessary we will take decisive action to address sentence of imprisonment for public protection we put stop to these discredit sentence decade ago but it be true that there remain about ipp prisoner in custody despite their original tariff expiring year ago ipp be stain on our justice system so be look at option to curtail the licence period to restore great proportionality to ipp sentence in line with recommendation of the justice committee report and will come back to the house on that in due course this will not compromise public safety those find by the parole board to pose risk to the public will not be release as have set out we be take decisive action to make our prison work well in the long term we be build more prison place than at any time since disraeli be speak from this dispatch box we be roll out hundred of rapid deployment cell across the country to increase immediate capacity we be go far and fast than ever before to remove foreign criminal from our prison to govern be to choose we choose to lock up the most dangerous criminal for long to protect victim and their family we choose to reform the justice system so that criminal who can otherwise be force into take the right path be not trap in cycle of criminality that be the right long term plan for our justice system and commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank you very much madam deputy speaker and thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement the secretary of state be on his foot for about minute his statement be about word long he do an op ed at the weekend in the telegraph and there have be endless briefing to the medium over the last few day yet in all that verbiage there have be not one word of apology to the british public for fail in the first duty of government which be to keep our citizen safe as everybody know the first stage of rehabilitation be to acknowledge mistake and make sincere apology to those affect and let down by those action or in the secretary of state case inaction his failure to do so today be utterly inexcusable it be damn indictment of this government collective failure our prison be completely full we have be sound the alarm for many year now as overcrowding have skyrocket as of today the public will undoubtedly be less safe although the secretary of state have say that sentencing delay will apply only to those deem low risk he know that in more than offence be commit by those on bail include more than sexual offence so the public need to know what step will he be take to mitigate the risk of increase offending that will arise as result of the delay sentencing how many case in total be we talk about how many of those involve sexual and violent crime what be the plan to reach out to victim and assure they that the convict offender in their case will be take off the street as quickly as possible the reason we be in this position be that the government have consistently break their promise to deal with the rise prison population as far back as the government pledge to build new prison place by the public accounts committee find that they have manage just so the government go ahead and pledge prison place but still with no plan year later they say that they would make it by the accord to the late figure there be no more than place set to be build by the end of which represent shortfall of the government have know about this problem not only for the whole time this secretary of state have be in parliament but ever since the prime minister be the chancellor and they have do nothing it beggar belief that the funding have be allocate but the government still can not get these prison place build so much so that they be look to rent space in prison abroad with no indication of how much that will cost give this woeful record why should anyone believe that the government will build those prison place that we need what update can the secretary of state provide on the number of new prison place that be guarantee to be build before the end of the year will the government consult on the change to short sentence will any such consultation include victim the secretary of state know that the use of community sentence have halve since how will the government persuade the court that these sentence be the solution how can he reassure the public that this be not just green light to offender he will know that this plan will take time to go through parliament what will his government do in the immediate term to address the problem so far it sound as though his plan be to move some prisoner abroad and to let other out early be that all he have get on the deportation of foreign national offender last year the government manage to deport only foreign national offender which be less than third of the total number in our prison and about half the annual number before the covid pandemic why should the public believe the government when they claim that they can get grip on the number of foreign national offender in our prison give that they have fail to do so until now what difference will bring forward the deportation of foreign national offender by six month make to the prison population and by when let we be clear the public need to know that today an offender include potentially sex offender can go to court and be find guilty by jury but instead of be lock up behind bar where they belong the inaction of this chaotic conservative government mean that they can walk free can the secretary of state tell the house today that not one individual convict of serious sexual offence be out on the street as result of lack of prison place as the secretary of state say to govern be interruption order as the secretary of state acknowledge to govern be to choose his government have choose to fail victim and to fail the public and to offer too little too late to turn our fail criminal justice system around what very disappointing response be surprised to hear that newfound interest in lock up rapist lest we forget this government be prosecute more alleged rapist convict high proportion and impose long sentence than labour and ensure that high proportion of those sentence be be spend behind bar it be important to aim off little bit when look at what be say in the chamber by labour members the hon lady refer to foreign national offender but remember very well that back in we want to ensure that plane full of rapist and murderer could leave the country yet letter come to the prime minister say dear prime minister we the undersigned have grave concern over home office plan to deport people it go on to say the flight and all future charter flight must be suspend shall we see who be on that flight madam deputy speaker there be man who have thrust bottle into his victim face leave he scarred for life in what be describe as horrifying be grievous bodily harm another person who have be imprison for attack year old girl twice and abduct she and who have sex with year old then lie about it and vandalise her life accord to her mother be call devious callous and manipulative by the judge the hon lady sign letter ask that he should not be deport we will take no lesson from the labour party in be tough on criminal interruption she seem still to justify sign that letter do she not regret that decision think she might want to think about it again the conservative party will get foreign national offender out of this country we have bring on the large prison building programme since the victorian era cell per week interruption order when the hon member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood be be interrupt stop the interruption hope she will have the courtesy not to speak now from the front bench we will always take the step that need to be take to keep the british people safe in respect of community order the hon lady be right that it be important that they be robust and enforceable that be why be at pain to point out that we be double the number of tag suspect we will go much far and triple the number of tag by the way they be not the old radio frequency tag that be use when be prosecute they be gps tag that mean that judge and those appoint to the bench can ensure the monitoring of where that individual have go to make sure that they go to work and that their liberty be deprive at the weekend that be the kind of robust penalty we support our ability to ensure that people be under curfew for over hour week be in our legislation which be oppose by guess labour party call the chair of the justice committee commend the lord chancellor on his thoughtful consider and serious statement that deserve thoughtful and consider response which it have not entirely have do he agree that it be right and proper that we be frank with the british public that prison be an extremely expensive way of deal with people and that it should be reserve for those who be threat to we not simply those with whom we be perhaps justifiably angry or irritated do the lord chancellor agree that it be right to take on board some of the recommendation of the justice committee report in relation to ipp prisoner those sentence to imprisonment for public protection welcome what have be say about remand which we know be also important as well as reduce the qualifying licence period can he help we little more on what else he will do to take on board the recommendation about ipp prisoner in the report what be the timeframe for move swiftly towards reduce the remand population thank my hon friend for his typically thoughtful and consider response he be absolutely right that we have to make choice about what we do in respect of the custodial estate we choose to ensure that the most dangerous people be lock away for long which be right so that the punishment fit the crime and so that we protect the british people this be not simply political statement but statement of evidence and the evidence not just in england and wales but in the netherlands and elsewhere show that short sentence be disproportionately associate with recidivism of course we should learn the lesson from that my hon friend rightly raise the issue of ipp which be stain on the justice system that point be make even by the person who come up with the idea we will take step and thank the justice committee for take on this difficult issue and for come up with some very sensible proposal will be announce more but the central point about licence length be critical it seem to that this year licence length mean that it be very hard for people on ipp to think they will ever be free have constituent who have be in prison for year under ipp he be due to be up for parole towards the end of the year the secretary of state say he will be bring forward review how long will that take and how will it impact on people await the parole board first make it very clear to the hon lady and her constituent that we will not take step that put the british people at risk the parole board will have to make an assessment in the normal way on whether person be safe to be release if they be consider safe for release the question be then about the duration of the licence period that remain ipp effectively continue to hang over they be look at that particular area at the moment but want to be clear that it be sensitive area we be try to unwind very ill star policy but we have to do so in way that ultimately keep the british people safe commend my right hon and learn friend for his statement in so many way it echo and build on the work we do together in the department emphasise the importance of build technologically sound innovative and direct alternative to short term prison sentence which think this statement presage we need to get on with that work because short term sentence have to be last resort as they clearly do not help to cut crime what more can my right hon and learn friend do to redouble effort to ensure that the prison building programme that start when be in office be deliver on time and that we overcome some of the constant barrier of planning permission and other administrative obstacle pay tribute to my right hon and learn friend talk about tough decision be make in the white heat of the pandemic and he be the one who say that we will not get rid of the jury system on our watch my goodness he be right to say that it be tough call but it be manifestly the right one lest we forget five wells and fosse way have open and hmp millsike be currently under construction go alongside garth gartree grendon spring hill and other prison my right hon and learn friend be right that there have be an issue with planning have say that with an additional million we will identify further site in and get the planning permission well in advance because we can not have situation in which these critical building programme be hold up by the planning process we be change to new approach and we be put on the afterburner to make sure those prison get build declare an interest as an honorary life member of the prison officers association in his statement the secretary of state celebrate the fact that the prison population have rise to when be elect in it be scandal that we be at the level part of the problem be the lack of crime prevention but there be also failure of rehabilitation the statement mention probation but there be no mention of prison staff there be desperate need for adequate prison staffing if we be to secure the rehabilitation of prisoner what will be the staff prisoner ratio in our prison follow these reform be grateful to the right hon gentleman for raise the issue of prison staff as they be ultimately the most important factor beyond the nature of the prison estate in make the difference to whether prisoner be keep safe and rehabilitate we be increase the number of prison staff and think an additional staff be recruit in the last period for which figure be available the other important point be retention and we be start to see positive trend in retention also make the point that those prison officer who stick by their duty during the pandemic and go into work when it be tough to do that when their parent and friend would have be tell they not to do so be the one who ensure there be not complete catastrophe in our prison in term of loss of life and they should take enormous credit for that completely agree with the lord chancellor last point about prison staff during the covid pandemic and be very grateful to he for point out that the approach to fno must continue he will know that between and some fno be deport despite as he so eloquently point out opposition from labour members they be write letter personally to the prime minister and myself what assurance will the lord chancellor give the public go forward this be about the direction of travel on this issue that they be protect and that offender who be out and release back into the community with gps tag do not pose threat to the public he will recall that in when the labour party be in government similar policy be pursue and there be major issue with hundred reoffende and prisoner on the run despite be recall to prison thank my right hon friend no one do more in government to ensure that serious foreign national offender be on plane get out of the country she do an exceptional job and pay tribute to she for that on public protection the whole point of the suspend sentence order be that the magistrate will say to the individual the crime that you ve commit cross the custody threshold be go to impose suspend sentence order potentially with curfew and unpaid whatever the other condition be that order be then sword of damocles hang over the person if they do not comply they be bring back before the court and they serve that sentence in custody the choice for that offender be very clear do what they should and abide by the order of the court or they will hear the clang of the prison gate as home secretary lord david blunkett introduce indeterminate imprisonment for public protection sentence lord blunkett have since say that he regret injustice cause by the awarding of those ipp sentence in february this year of the woman serve sentence in prison be serve indeterminate sentence how many woman be still serve ipp sentence who have already serve their full tariff the hon gentleman be right and remember when ipp come in they be create by the criminal justice act be barrister at the time and remember that under the legislation we be require effectively to apply for they and that judge be require to hand they down there have be an understanding in the intervene year that they have not operate as they should they have create sense of total despair hopelessness and most importantly of all injustice how we deal with this issue be difficult in circumstance where the parole board have judge that people remain danger to society that be the issue there be no easy solution where we say simply let people out because we know in do so that they could commit crime and harm our fellow citizen so we can not do that but what we will do be take every step include provide additional psychological support so that individual can prepare for parole hearing and we will look at the issue of licence we will not compromise on public safety but we will do everything we can to scrub out the stain of those misguided sentence the success of our prison be not about have the high possible number of prisoner in they it be surely about prison rehabilitate offender so that there be few victim of crime in the future strongly welcome the measure that the lord chancellor have announce today especially on not put people in prison who do not need to be in prison do he agree that we can cut crime substantially with much more effective use of technology include the gps tag that he mention create almost virtual prison that will be justice for the digital age under this party rather than for the victorian era which the labour party seem to prefer my hon friend speak clearly and persuasively with the benefit of great experience as magistrate in my experience magistrate court overwhelmingly want to ensure of course that the punishment fit the crime but they also want to ensure that the individual be take away from the path of crime and ultimately rehabilitate so of course my hon friend be right other country have use technology very effectively where there be lesson to learn we should learn they but we will not compromise on ensure that there be punishment we can just deliver punishment with technology even more effectively the home affairs committee produce report while ago on the investigation and prosecution of rape and serious sexual assault and we find that those case be disproportionately affect by the backlog in the court of course few case less than actually get to the court and even those be take too long so with these report that judge be now go to delay sentencing what do the lord chancellor have to say to the victim of rape and serious sexual assault who wait far too long for justice it seem like it be go to be an even long wait the right hon lady be right when she say it be important to try to reduce the period of time that people be wait absolutely get that point but in the interest of balance it be equally important to note the following more people be be prosecute for rape than in and high proportion be be convict the sentence be third long and defendant be spend high proportion of those sentence in custody we have introduce reform that mean that complainant can pre record their evidence we have roll out over independent sexual violence adviser to support people we have create the offence of coercive and control behaviour and have stand up rape support helpline all that we do and more can tell hon member that compare with when be prosecute this stuff the difference in the experience and the right of victim of sexual violence be night and day as say complainant now have the right to make pre recorded evidence they can have court familiarisation visit and they have the right to an isva to seek redetermination in the event that the cps decide to reduce charge and to make victim personal statement we do all this because we care passionately about want to support victim of sexual offence and we will continue to do so strongly welcome the proposal to deport more foreign criminal and also support the idea of find something well than prison for non violent offender will that include wherever possible their need to have job legally and to pay compensation to those against whom they have commit fraud theft and other financial crime my right hon friend make two excellent point it be worth reflect on the fact that since we have deport around foreign national offender huge amount of work have take place and that will continue albeit at an even great pace the second point he make be fundamental judge already have the power to impose compensation order in the event that someone be convict of crime but their ability to do so be determine by the fund that be available to that individual how much well it be if the individual can go out and do an honest day work to generate more income so that they can in small way put right the crime they have commit and the damage they have do thank the minister very much for his statement and his comment be mindful that this be about england and wales but have be contact over the past few year by number of people who have be victim of perpetrator of some of the most bestial crime in the country the government and the minister have reply to some of the question have ask and some of the comment have make to his department but can he tell today whether those victim will be elevate to more prominent position and whether look after they will be give great priority their feeling how those crime have hurt they must be priority for government as be so often the case the hon gentleman be absolutely right we have to ensure that victim be not spectator in the criminal justice process but participant in it that be why we have roll out the victim code which contain core entitlement to ensure that victim can be keep update about the progress of the case and inform about special measure and how they give their evidence as well as the right to court familiarisation visit the right to make victim impact statement and right of review as have indicate we have also ensure that victim funding have be quadruple since we have double support for rape support centre and so on that be over and above create the new offence to ensure that those victim can get justice all this we do and more and we do so because we want to put victim first rape and child rape in particular be an abhorrent crime ensure that those perpetrator serve their full sentence in prison will clearly act as deterrent and reassure the public but what step be my right hon and learn friend take to ensure we have the prison place to lock up dangerous rapist and child rapist in particular so that victim know that those perpetrator be always behind bar my hon friend be absolutely right those be some of the most appalling crime which shatter not just the life of the victim but potentially those of so many other include the victim friend and family and he be absolutely right that we need to make sure there be always sufficient custodial capacity for that to take place that be why be announce today that we will roll out programme to buy the very location we need next year with additional money to ensure that well in advance of the prison build need to come on line we have the planning permission in place so that there be the pipeline of place to ensure that justice can be do to be fair to the lord chancellor from the length of his answer there be no doubt he be against short sentence laughter my question be about overcrowded and understaffed prison that make rehabilitation almost impossible many prisoner now leave jail more criminalised more traumatised and indeed more dangerous than when they first arrive while the measure outline today may make positive impact the government must go far will the secretary of state commit to tackle the crisis in prison officer retention by start with the prison officers association key demand to reduce the pension age which it insist have massive effect on morale and therefore on the retention of prison officer thank the hon gentleman in fairness that be quite good joke it be not bad too long laughter the hon gentleman make some fair point and will get back to he the lord chancellor be clearly well on top of this subject so may bowl he couple of googly what safeguard will there be to prevent deported foreign criminal from come back here if they be not imprison overseas will he be very careful before go down the road of plea bargaining as in the states whereby there be perverse incentive for the innocent to plead guilty because of the huge disparity in the sentence they may receive to take the second point first be so pleased to hear my right hon friend say that there be certain thing that really be important in our jurisdiction first we do not do plea bargaining secondly we do not have political appointment of judge and thirdly we have jury system these be incredibly important thing we do not talk about they enough in this chamber but they be immensely important to our basic freedom be delighted to hear that and yes he can be sure that we be not go down the road of plea bargaining on the point my right hon friend make about ensure people can not come back that be precisely the point it be not just and it be not sensible to have people cost the taxpayer huge amount of money in british prison if when they be out they be never come back anyway that be central to our plan to ensure that as we expand the ers window we put in place every necessary measure in compliance or in consultation with our international counterpart to ensure that once people be out they be never come back the second large prison in europe be hmp berwyn in north wales as of today understand that it house prisoner any solution to the well document problem of violence at hmp berwyn since it open six year ago be continuously undermine by the failure to retain staff because working condition be so extreme will the secretary of state recognise that warehouse offender in gargantuan prison create chronic problem and be not fit for purpose be very glad the right hon member have mention berwyn go to berwyn and she be right that we always want to recruit more prison staff but let we pause for second just to note how fantastic some of the work be in that prison be there in the jobcentre in effect there be jobcentre within the prison and people be have zoom interview with their potential employer on the outside that be one of the reason why reoffende have drop while we have be in government from to and it be one of the reason why crime be down overall she mention the or so people but let say lest we forget that the labour party promise before it leave office that there would be three titan prison with people in they do they happen do they heck ooh order think that be quite mild it be all right it could have be bad there be great deal to be welcome in my right hon and learn friend statement but can unpack the capacity question when he be successful in deport more foreign national offender that will free up capacity when he be successful in the home detention curfew and well use of technology that will free up prison capacity leave the spike as the covid backlog be catch up with create temporary problem in capacity therefore would it not be well to meet it with the temporary provision of cell in the exist prison estate rather than go the whole hog and devastating community such as mine in grendon underwood and edgcott by build mega prison may first put it on the record that no one could be more doughty defender of the interest of the people of buckingham than my hon friend who raise with time and again the concern of his constituent about grendon springhill will continue to have those important conversation with he know fine well that his constituent interest be be vigorously advanced the ministerial code say that all major announcement of government policy should be make to the house first yet half of what have be announce today be prelude by an op ed write by the secretary of state and in briefing to national newspaper over the weekend that be breach of the ministerial code and when ask sir laurie magnus the independent adviser on ministerial interest whether he would investigate such breach he say yes in theory would it not be good idea especially consider that the secretary of state think that short and minor sanction lead to recidivism if there be substantial sanction against ministers who do that and he report himself to the independent adviser be afraid that do not accept that point may say what pleasure it be to hear the lord chancellor statement which represent big step forward for our criminal justice system he and have long share the view that we do not lock up the violent for long enough and there be smart way of deal with the non violent on that note applaud his expansion of the tagging programme have two question first on gps tag do he intend to expand the acquisitive crime pilot currently in police force area every burglar and robber release from prison be gps tag to reduce reoffende secondly while we be not short of sobriety tag which he will know be extremely keen on the problem be that judge be just not use they so what step will he take to expand judicial enthusiasm give how much alcohol drive low level crime my right hon friend do exceptionally important work in ensure that the supply and roll out of alcohol sobriety tag and indeed other tag proceed at huge pace and they make significant difference on his point about uptake plainly sentence be matter for the independent judiciary but do think that more can be do to ensure that judge and magistrate be aware of the sheer extent of the technology available and the step that can be take to properly curtail people freedom in appropriate case by way of punishment and to ensure that they have the tag to steer people away from addiction ultimately that can be the good way to ensure that people be properly rehabilitate and become contribute member of society once again the secretary of state remind of the unfortunate astronaut who by mistake be still circle the moon somewhere out of touch when he only expect to be up there for three month those of we who have be down on planet earth for the last year know about the resource devote to the ministry of justice which have face the bad cut of any department be he aware that we have be promise royal commission on justice three time in the queen speech which will now be the king speech today statement be suppose to be an update on prison capacity he have cover far more than that be he aware for example that joint enterprise be responsible for young people who should not be in prison be in prison why can he not wake up and do something about they know that the hon gentleman care passionately about joint enterprise but must tell he this joint enterprise be the legal doctrine that mean that the getaway driver be culpable or that the person who supply the firearm in murder be hold properly accountable and find guilty those be important tool that the court of appeal consider carefully in the case of jogee get rid of joint enterprise would mean that lot of people who have help or encourage the commission of offence get away in some case with murder declare an interest as the founder and chairman of charity that work in prison very much support today announcement of an expansion of prison capacity and tagging both of which be necessary and right understand that the lord chancellor be inspire by texas prison visit some texan jail and see that they be do two thing right the first be sentencing with tough justice ensure that people get the sentence that they deserve the second thing that they be do in texas to reduce the jail population be get rehabilitation right and crucially rely on civil society outside organisation get access to prisoner before they be release and then support they afterwards think that the government be get it right on sentencing but do the lord chancellor agree that we need to do more on rehabilitation particularly by involve civil society my hon friend be completely correct we in this chamber all know that the context for offending not an excuse but the context can be deep seat problem of addiction homelessness relationship breakdown and so on one thing be pleased about be that the department of health and social care be invest over half billion pound with more than additional staff to ensure that drug treatment be available to those who need it for our part we in the ministry of justice have launch pilot of three intensive supervision court in the teesside and liverpool crown court to ensure that those whose offend behaviour be drive by substance misuse can get the treatment they need to get they off drug and off the driver of their offence as my constituent have point out to there be shoplifting epidemic under the conservative government the police often do not deal with burglary and other such crime because of lack of resource conviction rate for rape and sexual violence be at record low now that our prison be full the government propose to release prisoner early or try to ship they abroad that be all because of lack of foresight and action why be the government so weak on law and order and when be they first warn about crisis and lack of place in prison there be more people in prison than ever before which rather suggest the opposite of what the hon gentleman say he also say that the conviction rate for rape be low but that be completely wrong it be high do he know who be director of public prosecutions before the leader of the opposition despite result in low reconviction rate the use of community order have halve in the last decade so will today announcement start to reverse that trend in try to do so will my right hon and learn friend consider increase the use of pre sentence report and speed up the roll out of community sentence order where we be try to get people treat that be an excellent question in appropriate case pre sentence report be vital because the probation service can provide the sentencing judge or magistrate with all the surround information about the offender so that they can impose sentence that meet the seriousness of the case while also be rehabilitative and appropriate that require train probation officer who be expert in their area that be why we have invest million in addition each and every year to ensure that the probation service have the resource it need know from my time as practitioner that the report the probation service provide be essential to ensure that justice can be do the times report that lord justice edis the senior preside judge for england and wales have order that sentencing of convict criminal who be currently on bail should be delay from today accord to that report the order do not specifically exclude rape conviction which judge have express alarm about give the already abysmal conviction rate of well below what message do the secretary of state think such an order send to victim of sexual violence who be decide whether they have enough faith in our broken justice system to come forward when do the government expect sentencing to restart it be incredibly important that no one from this chamber deliberately or inadvertently give the impression that rapist be not go to be sentence they be go to be sentence the sentence impose will be on average third long than those impose in and they will serve high proportion of those sentence in custody we be prosecute more people for rape than in and as say they be be punish more severely so let the message go out that people who offend against woman and it be overwhelmingly against woman and behave in such barbaric way can expect not just to hear the clang of the prison gate but to be reflect on their action for very long time will my right hon and learn friend give the house guarantee that judge or magistrate will retain the discretion to impose short term custodial sentence in the interest of public justice and public protection in the circumstance do he foresee change to the sentencing guideline for the raft of offence cover by the month sentencing threshold do he foresee that all such offence will now be sentence accord to the one test he have outline my hon friend have be practitioner in the court so he understand as all practitioner do that there be offender who be afraid show themselves unwilling to abide by the order of the court or incapable of do so and even if the court be prepared to say there should be suspend sentence in your case they will breach it in those circumstance magistrate and judge must have the power in the final analysis to send that person to immediate custody we will always ensure that they have that power that be important for the rule of law and to send the message that there will be consequence if person flout an order of the court want to ask about licence condition and particularly those that prohibit the offender from contact certain people or enter certain postcode it be obvious that such condition be about protect victim and their family my concern be that the lord chancellor statement do not make it absolutely clear that breach such condition will lead to return to custody it be important for victim to hear that those kind of transgression will result in an immediate return to custody thank the hon gentleman for that helpful and appropriate query on behalf of his constituent in any case before an individual fall to be release under the sentence that have be apply in other word when they get to the end of the custodial element of their sentence probation officer will sort out in advance the package of licence condition which could include as the hon gentleman indicate instruction not to contact someone directly or indirectly residence condition or condition on contact with probation officer and so on the point be that if they breach those condition they be liable to be recall and here be the important point not just for the period of that release but for the entire balance of their sentence in other word if somebody be sentence to month and fall to be release at the nine month mark but week later they breach the probation condition they would fall to serve the entire balance of the sentence of nine month that be important metaphorically speak that sword of damocles be hang over that offender to ensure that they stay in line and do not commit further offence thank my right hon and learn friend for his statement believe in zero tolerance and long sentence for the most serious crime but also believe in prevention rather than cure with of the prison population be man and many young boy destine to spend their life in and out of prison will the lord chancellor use his position in cabinet to work with his colleague on reduce the number of boy who be on that path will he also back my campaign for minister for man we be let boy and young man down and it simply be not fair on man or woman or on the taxpayer as whole my hon friend be absolutely right that we want to ensure that all prisoner and certainly young man be steer away from crime we now have much well understanding as nation of some of the driver of some offending that be why under our watch when prisoner come into jail there will be neurodiversity assessment to explore their background we could potentially discover brain injury the hon member for rhondda sir chris bryant have go but know that he take an interest in that subject the whole approach we be now take be to ensure that those who can be redeem be redeem but that those who be frankly beyond redemption and be threat to society be lock up and lock up for long that be the right approach in parallel government universe the secretary of state proposal for direct short term prisoner into community sentence might be an idea whose time have come but it require experience probation staff in post properly organise and challenging community work and genuine rehabilitation initiative his government evisceration of the justice system mean that none of that be available and he be do it now only because of their mismanagement of the about to burst prison estate have he not be set up to fail no that be wrong the first part that this be an idea whose time have come be correct speak about this when be back bencher in speech at the conservative party conference of all place have come to this as realisation for some time what be encouraging be that the government be put enormous additional resource into the probation service because reckon that it be ultimately critical to the success of community order it do phenomenal job we be put more resource in and recruit more and we will do everything we can to strengthen the system my right hon and learn friend know that magistrate think carefully before they commit anybody to custody because they know that once somebody be send to prison for short sentence their life can spiral downwards very quickly they can lose their home their job and often their family do he agree that more robust community sentence be need particularly in relation to drug rehabilitation which be the root cause of so much offending will he set out what step he be take to ensure that those on community sentence be suitably supervise my hon friend make an excellent point his observation that magistrate do all they can to avoid send someone to custody and do so only when absolutely necessary be well make the reason why this reform will be so important be that under suspend sentence order the magistrate be say in effect to that individual you must engage in sensible and productive way with drug rehabilitation if you do you will go to prison that provide the most powerful incentive for that individual to break the cycle of offending while not lock they up which as my hon friend indicate would mean they could lose their universal credit not get the mental health treatment they require and break the family relationship that can be so important to keep people away from crime four year ago the secretary of state department announce limit on short term sentencing which be then scrap and now they be back that be four year waste year when ministers sit on their hand ignore crisis of their own making meanwhile prison officer have have to deal with the consequence of health and safety concern overcrowding and violence all undercut by low pay and poor term and condition will he apologise to prison officer especially those in the city of durham and will he lower the retirement age prison officer in the city of durham and elsewhere do an exceptionally important job that be why be pleased to accept the recommendation of the independent pay review body to ensure that the pay uplift be fair and decent and recognise the stunningly important work that they do that be why we have roll out million in prison security to ensure that prison officer have body wear video camera and other security measure to keep they safe we will always do everything we can whether with recruitment pay or help to drive retention to keep prison officer safe and our prison well resource with prison officer my right hon and learn friend will be aware that have be notify that hmp wealstun in my constituency will get new cell will he write to on when those will be complete by and what conversation he have have with the governor on be able to staff they to capacity many of the prison officer be constituent of mine thank my right hon friend for the care and attention he take in respect of this matter will be delighted to write to he in the term he suggest early this year secure westminster hall debate on the criminalisation of ethnic minority and migrant woman who be themselves victim of violence sadly of woman in prison or under community supervision be victim of domestic violence shocking statistic will the lord chancellor commit to amend the victims and prisoners bill to ensure statutory defence for those victim of domestic violence accuse of offend to prevent more unjust conviction thank the hon lady for the care and attention she give to this topic it be worth reflect that around of the overall prison population be woman so it be overwhelmingly man who be in custody on the point she raise she will be aware that there be already defence available duress self defence and so on that can be invoke by individual face charge we think that strike the right balance but be of course happy to have conversation with she about any representation she might wish to make rapist should be prosecute they should be sentence and they should serve that sentence and thank the lord chancellor for make that very clear today in chelmsford we have small number of people who have be charge with antisocial behaviour low level crime and be wait to go to the magistrate court but they be cause havoc on our high street as they reoffend can he assure we that those persistent offender will still be judge know that as an essex mp madam deputy speaker who be here early will have want to know about the situation in our local prison at chelmsford there be prisoner there last night so only empty space but there be cell that could be repair could the lord chancellor possibly look into repair those cell on that last point we have put great deal of funding into the maintenance of chelmsford prison but also hmp liverpool and birmingham in particular on the first point my right hon friend raise about recidivist offender it be precisely because we be concerned about people commit so call low level offending that we want to ensure that magistrate retain the power to send people to prison if people show defiance and that they be incapable or unwilling to abide by the term of the order of the court there be simple answer they will go to prison and they will learn to reflect on their action in custody welcome some of what the justice secretary say in his statement especially on the implementation of the recommendation of the justice committee on ipp sentence they be always terrible idea in my view and they have be use badly however it should not be surprise to anybody that after year of deliberate and savage underfunding the criminal justice system be on its knee and our prison be full to burst if it be right that the senior preside judge lord justice edis be say to sentence judge adjourn sentence be that his fault or be it the justice secretary fault the first part of the hon gentleman question on ipp be absolutely right and be delighted to hear that he agree however he be make bad political point on the second matter and it be not bear out by the arithmetic in the total number of case be around he be shake his head we can argue about opinion but this be fact the position prior to the pandemic be around the position we have at present be function of that pandemic and we be frank about that that be why we be take step not just to increase the number of judge we have recruit an additional but put up to million into legal aid something he should support we will do everything we can to expand capacity in the system to ensure that we can deliver justice for all welcome my right hon and learn friend statement and his focus on protect the public he mention that we be change the law to make whole life sentence the default for the most heinous type of murder he will be aware that one of the case that lead to that change in the law be the release by the parole board of the monster of worcester david mcgreavy multiple child murderer unfortunately last week worcester crown court see the sentencing of another monster of worcester anthony roberts for savage sexual assault on year old woman he have previously be sentence to life for attempt murder of year old girl will my right hon and learn friend meet to hear the concern of my constituent about this appalling case and about the case to be make for attempt murder aggravate by sexual assault to be treat alongside those heinous murder of course will what an appalling case would be delighted to meet my hon friend on the change to whole life order that we have introduce follow the dreadful sarah everard case where there be sexual violence follow by murder it be in such case that we insist as matter of fairness and basic natural justice that someone who behave in that way should expect to end their day in custody that be what the british people think and that be what we think too my constituent be increasingly victim of the scourge of dangerous and antisocial driving they have contact demand tough penalty for those who cause death by dangerous driving welcome the lord chancellor statement that sentence have be increase for offence include death by dangerous driving to maximum of life imprisonment will he confirm that prison capacity be not an obstacle to ensure that dangerous driver serve the prison time they deserve be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that point dangerous driving shatter life and family which be why we think it be right in recognition of the sheer harm that it cause that the maximum sentence should go from year to life make the point gently that we would have welcome support from the opposition which unfortunately we do not get notwithstanding the point that he raise it be important for independent judge to decide on the fact of the case we welcome the fact that the sentencing council be in place to impose guideline to ensure that judge have everything they need to ensure consistency but also condign punishment welcome the lord chancellor statement today and congratulate he on clearly be on top of difficult brief and on confirm today that those serious and violent criminal be be lock up for long could he expand on the reoffende rate of those on short sentence versus community sentence do he believe that the general public and victim potentially might support they because those convict be see as do good when they complete their community service in public thank my right hon friend for get absolutely to the heart of it those who be sentence to short custodial sentence under month statistically go on to reoffend of the time yet for those who have suspend sentence order with condition such as unpaid work or to address mental health issue or commit further offence there be massive reduction we want to ensure that once people have serve their sentence and atone for the crime they have commit they can go on to become law abide contribute member of society last man stand mr deputy speaker no early release for the secretary of state statement would be all the more impressive have it not come after year of continuous conservative government they promise to create extra place by the but we have see net increase of we have lose some place to dilapidation and those that have replace they amount to net increase of only only few week ago we be tell that the government be implacably oppose to early release take it that he have drop his idea of buy place in foreign prison the truth be that the management of the system have be completely chaotic for year when will we see the increase in prison place that the government have be talk about the first thing to say be that our prison programme be the large since the victorian place if may say so that stand in stark contrast to labour jack straw stand at this dispatch box and say we will build three titan prison each one of they do it happen no it do not this be the party that have put the money behind it in fact it be this prime minister as chancellor who do that we be roll they out by the way will make no apology for take offline old and inadequate accommodation and replace it with modern secure decent prison that be something the hon gentleman should welcome my right hon friend will be well aware that people who have be through the care system be overrepresente in our prison as be people with neurodiverse condition as he have mention and many exist victim of crime and abuse it be mark of civilised society that when those people first touch the criminal justice system we take the opportunity to support they to make they function member of society not simply lock they up and throw away the key we have hear all that across the chamber but that message do not survive the retail nature of our politic will he assure that the government will continue to walk the walk and talk the talk on those message more than many people in this place my hon friend combine compassion with clarity of thought she absolutely demonstrate that it be incumbent on all of we to advocate for basic fairness and decency and what work and can think of no more powerful advocate than my hon friend welcome the lord chancellor statement that foreign criminal who by the way cost the taxpayer an absolute fortune will be take out of their comfy cell put on plane and send back to where they come from what assurance can he give that those plane will actually take off the tarmac and not be block by lefty lawyer human right campaigner and silly letter sign by that lot over there as always my hon friend make robust point it be not right that the british people have suffer the crime in the first place should then have to pay for the privilege of lock people up for long at cost of year we will send they back the only people who will try to block it who will try to block rapist murderer and grievous bodily harmer will be the labour party and we know that because they have try to do so already last but not least call james sunderland may thank the lord chancellor for his pragmatic statement also thank the prison minister for his engagement over the weekend really welcome progress with ipp sentencing on which have clear constituency interest but what really want to ask about be custodial sentence of less than month be suspend be there presumption that those need to pay debt to the community will do so in the very community in which they offend what an excellent point to end on it be critical that where community be offend against the offender make that community whole in other word that they do the work whether it be scrub graffiti clear wasteland or planting tree in the community to try to atone for their guilt and to repair some of the damage they have do be delighted that increasingly police and crime commissioner be work together with local probation service to identify the stuff that need do in their community so that when defendant go straight they also look after the community that they have wrong so badly in the first place thank the lord chancellor for his statement and for answer question for just minute short of one hour and minute before we move on to the next statement on transport may make an announcement wendy morton be pull the debate on knife crime this evening we have another two statement to go which could easily take we to or think she have sensibly make the decision that we should have that debate at another time and hope that that can be facilitate as soon as possible zero emission vehicles drivers and with permission mr deputy speaker wish to make statement on how this government be improve the journey that matter most to the british public our path to net zero remain ambitious but we be make that path more proportionate we be back britain driver and slam the brake on anti car policy thank to record government investment everyday journey for more people in more place will improve more quickly wish to update the house on three long term decision we have make to secure bright future start with zero emission vehicle no one should doubt or play down britain progress on decarbonisation world lead be not an exaggeration we have cut emission fast than any country pledge decarbonised transport sector by the first major economy to do so and today we have lay another world lead piece of legislation the zero emission vehicle mandate manufacturer will now meet minimum target of clean car production start with next year and reach by it stand to be one of the large carbon save policy across government and manufacturer be on board they will deliver mandate that they help shape product of partnership between this government and industry that have be not month but year in the making these target be now embed in their forecast and that certainty have inspire investment protect exist job and pave the way for new job too look at the past few month bmw stellantis and tata be expand their electric vehicle operation right across the uk from oxford to merseyside however target can be miss if government fail to take people with they and we will not make that mistake so people will be able to buy new petrol and diesel car until align the uk with the like of canada australia and germany it be fair on british consumer it allow we to grow the use ev market lower cost and increase choice and it ensure we raise confidence in our charge infrastructure in fact public charge point be already up by since last year and set to grow even furth thank to investment from both the government and private sector for many that be the future but today in some part of the country driver be be punish and car vilify the mayor of london expansion of the ultra low emission zone be force driver to sell up or pay hefty daily fine overzealous enforcement practice from yellow box junction to blanket mph zone be turn driver into cash cow for council measure to overly restrict where and when people travel be already be plan in place such as oxfordshire my message to council be simple this anti motorist campaign have run out of road this government recognise that car be not luxury they be lifeline they be how most people in rural constituency such as mine access work education and essential service that be why after listen to the concern of motorist have announce new long term plan for driver with measure that will protect their right to travel how they want where they want and when they want we will use ai technology to keep traffic flow we will build national parking platform to make it easy to find and pay for space we will inject some common sense into enforcement where mph zone be necessary exception with local support not blanket norm where rule be enforce to keep our road safe not to line council coffer and where low traffic neighbourhood rely on public support not on outdated covid guidance how many time driver get from to will be their choice not decide by council none of that undermine our investment in public transport nor in active travel we be pro public transport but we will not be anti car sustainable transport network need both so people can choose to travel in the way that good suit they let now turn to our decision on with decade to wait before it arrive and benefit dwindle it risk crowd out investment in other transport area and no long reflect post pandemic change in travel despite that some argue that we should have carry on regardless that single rail line between handful of city and london be more important than million of everyday journey around the country disagree the fact have change so we be change our approach with work well under way we will finish between london euston and the west midland just last week speak to the euston partnership board on the huge regeneration opportunity that can be unlocked with private investment however by stop in birmingham we can reinvest every penny of the billion save in transport across the country in the road the local bus service and the regional train link all those essential daily connection that people rely on no region will lose out receive either the same or more government investment than under almost billion will go to the north with bradford ignore under previous proposal now get new station and fast rail connection to manchester northern powerhouse rail be now extend to include hull and sheffield separate billion fund will well connect liverpool and manchester and have already speak to the mayors of greater manchester and the liverpool city region to kickstart work on that west yorkshire thank to billion of funding will finally get its mass transitsystem build in full over road scheme will be deliver and crucially we will more than double the transport budget of northern mayors benefit our large city and small town we be also invest in the midland with almost billion ensure the midland rail hub be complete in full increase mayoral budget include billion for the new east midland city region and council from stoke on trent to lincolnshire see long term transport funding settlement for the first time finally the remainder of this transformational investment will be spread across the uk include extend the hugely popular bus fare cap which people will see the benefit of just next month deliver the ely junction project and north wales mainline electrification benefit both passenger and freight and deal with the menace of pothole with billion in new funding to resurface road up and down the country all tell network north be new vision for transport one that create more winner in more place one that prioritise people everyday journey and one that drive the growth and job that this country need will finish with this we will never shirk the long term decision to secure this country future and we will always be guide by the need of the british people when the majority want pragmatic route to net zero we will back they when driver feel unfairly target we will back they when the public want we to focus on the journey that matter most to they we will back they this government be deliver on the people priority commend this statement to the house thank the secretary of state for advance sight of his statement let start by say how shocking it be that our first opportunity to scrutinise the cancellation of europe large infrastructure project come two week after the announcement be make it show sheer contempt for this house and the people affect by this decision it be good to see the transport secretary in his place for change but for once be not hold he responsible know that he be not in the room when these decision be make and he have my sympathy for have to try to make this absurd decision look sensible there be only one man who should take responsibility for the sheer chaos incompetence and desperation that we have see over the past two week the prime minister only he could announce the cancellation of to manchester in manchester only he would have the brass neck to make that decision without consult our metro mayors or any of the community and business that depend on the project only he would announce plan for driver as car insurance and petrol price soar that make no mention of the cost of living and when just six month early he personally have kick every future road project into the next decade only he would insult the north with back of the fag packet plan that he have announce in its place the consequence of this shamble be no joke they be profound there will be owner of small and medium sized enterprise that have bet the house on people will lose their job this side of the general election as result of this decision home farm and business all sell the countryside carve up and euston hole in the ground and for what he have waste billion on line between old oak common and birmingham that no one ask for and that have no business case only in conservative run britain could high speed train hit the slow coach lane the second it hit the north of england we need some answer first be there meeting with simon case before the tory conference in which decision on be take if not why be video record of the prime minister in be he suggest that he follow in boris johnson footstep and record two version just in case and what of the economic impact how many business do the secretary of state expect to go under as result of this decision what be the estimate of the compensation that will have to be pay how much more will phase now cost through re scope how much do the government expect to lose in the come fire sale of the land and what safeguard be in place to ensure that there be not hint of corruption in those sale give that the west coast main line be at break point do he accept that this plan will result in severe overcrowding and set northern powerhouse rail back by decade this level of chaos and economic damage would make even the prime minister most recent predecessor blush and be not alone in that opinion two former tory chancellors have warn that this be an act of huge economic self harm the tory mayor of the west midland have describe it as cancel the future and david cameron have say that it show that we can no long think or act for the long term as country not content with simply cancel the programme the prime minister be now salt the earth by sell off the land and what have we get in its place this so call network north that announcement can be break down into three category project that have already be build project that have already be announce and project that do not exist let we go through some of they shall we there be the extension of manchester tram link to the airport project that open nine year ago there be the brand new rail station for bradford project that have be scrap and reinstate by three tory prime ministers in row and there be the upgrade of the to southampton route that do not exist how can the transport secretary stand at that dispatch box and pretend that there be any credible plan for delivery when last week even the prime minister admit that these plan be only illustrative for once agree with he they be illustrative illustrative of the sheer incompetence of this government illustrative of the contempt with which they treat the north and illustrative of why you can never trust the tories the prime minister promise we revolution in our transport infrastructure but instead we get wish list he have rob peter and he will not even be pay paul community be sick and tired of the broken promise from this broken government do this fiasco not prove once and for all after fail year three discredit rail plan ten of billion of pound of public money waste and thousand of home and life upend that they have no record to stand on no mandate to deliver and no credible plan for the future be it not time they finally accept that they be government at the end of the line oh dear do not know whether the hon lady notice but this be the first day that the house have be back after the conference break and be here at the dispatch box make statement at the if the hon member for manchester central lucy powell will allow to answer the question that her hon friend have just ask without shout from the opposition front bench shall be delighted to do so this be our first day back and have make statement at the first opportunity have have the hon lady make point about the cost of living draw attention to the fact that the bus fare cap be be extend that will kick in as early as next month and it be an important cost of live measure for the many million of people who use bus bus be the most popular form of public transport which be why the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for north west durham mr holden be such massive champion of they the hon lady refer to we be still deliver phase from euston to the west midland which be very significant transport investment and delivery in term of the supply chain and all the company that depend on it moreover it deliver massive increase in capacity to the west coast main line take the number of seat day from to as for the detail in the network north document let point out that third of the saving we be make that be be billion be increase in funding for various mayors across the country the ultimate decision about what be to be invest be for those mayors and have have productive conversation with number of they they will be work with we on the detail of these plan so that they be right for the area that they represent as for the hon lady point about decision making have say this publicly before take the formal decision on the day before the prime minister speech there be meeting of the cabinet on the morning of his speech which approve that decision and the prime minister announce it shortly afterwards notice that the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer row in very quickly and have not disavow this decision he of course have long campaign against and suspect that the fact he row in so quickly behind it reflect that note that on this decision where the prime minister lead the leader of the opposition follow call the chair of the transport committee be grateful to the secretary of state for his statement my committee colleague and will want to scrutinise number of the measure in depth when he appear before we in few week it will be bumper session today however let focus on one issue regard one advantage of the project be that it would release capacity on the west coast main line not just between london and birmingham but right up the line as it be stop at handsacre junction there will be severe capacity constraint on that part of the line there will not be space for extra inter regional service and freight service the high speed train will be in very congested part of the network unless far upgrade work be do urge he to look at that capacity constraint if be not happen on that part of the project what additional measure might be put in place be grateful to my hon friend for his question and as always look forward to appear before the transport committee to answer his question and those of his colleague from both side of the house on his specific question the first thing we have commit to do be invest in remodelle handsacre junction so that those high speed train that go to birmingham then get on to the west coast main line on the fast line the most congested part of the west coast main line be its southern part which of course be have significant capacity upgrade however note carefully what he say and will bear that in mind he should also note that we be invest in the upgrade connection east west in the north of england include from liverpool to manchester one conversation have already have be about the importance of make sure we be able to take freight traffic include from the port of liverpool and those be conversation we will take forward dear almost feel sorry for the secretary of state all the promise about greener fast and more sustainable transport and connectivity be go unless you live in birmingham where people will have the most gold plat express shuttle service in the history of the world there be no real benefit to modal shift or net zero target here but what about level up the cancellation of the golborne link last year highlight that this government never really care about the project serve scotland but the manchester leg follow the leeds route into the bin prove that they do not care about the north of england either as always with westminster for london and the south east money be no object but when large infrastructure project outside the run into trouble the plug be pull gareth williams of the scottish council for development and industry say the lead recommendation in the uk government own union connectivity review be to reduce journey time and increase rail capacity between scotland london the midlands and the north west of england he also say this be very short sighted decision that actually risk make scotland connectivity with london worse there be also no need to push back the date on electric vehicle the government could have make the switch easy and fast have they at any time whatsoever listen to we on issue such as the charge network vat equalisation remove incentive to switch too early or their zero emission bus scheme be entirely unfit for purpose so will the secretary of state guarantee that scotland will receive the consequential expect through now redirect to these other scheme how much money be waste look at golborne link alternative how much consultation take place with the scottish government regard the announcement give that it have absolutely nothing to do with this government whatever will the department now look at different rolling stock option include new high speed tilting option to increase potential speed on the west coast main line the secretary of state recently tweet in japan see the benefit high speed rail can bring to connect community grow the economy we remain fully committed to build build it show we believe in britain can only conclude therefore that he no long believe in britain will he confirm that like to end in consensus so hope he will answer that question in the affirmative the hon gentleman demonstrate in the close of his question the scottish national party obsession with crowbarre independence into every question about everything thus he continue in way not to disappoint the snp never cease to talk about independence at every available opportunity even when it have nothing to do with the question the hon gentleman first point about different region in the country might have some merit if we have just cancel phase of and not reinveste every single penny in alternative transport project across the country as say some of those will take place relatively soon the money for local authority for bus funding and for improve the quality of local road which be top priority for most people will be available next spring the other investment will be available in the same timeframe as the money would have be deliver for phase of which would not have deliver high speed train to manchester until secondly congratulate the hon gentleman for mention the zero emission vehicle mandate that we table which be the single large decarbonisation measure that the government will take notice the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh barely mention it if at all but it be very significant measure in deliver our net zero obligation it be incredibly important and it would be good to have opposition support for it we have the support of the scottish and welsh governments which agree with the plan we have table in parliament today on the point the hon gentleman make about our plan local transport spending barnett consequential will flow in the normal way the road minister my hon friend the member for north west durham mr holden have speak to his opposite number in the scottish government about the as say this plan deliver every single penny that would have be spend on on alternative transport project that think be close to what people want to see when the fact change the cost of the project have rise and the benefit have reduce that be why we have take this decision which will be welcome by people across the country as yorkshire member of parliament have always champion northern powerhouse rail and the trans pennine rail upgrade two out of three be not brilliant but will settle for that it be very disappointing that the leader of the opposition always campaign against as well but we be where we be with network north can the secretary of state confirm that project that improve local connectivity such as the huddersfield sheffield penistone line which go through my constituency and those of my hon friend the members for dewsbury mark eastwood and for penistone and stocksbridge miriam cates be exactly the project that can now be deliver with this cash be invest locally and regionally my hon friend make two good point one of which be that the leader of the opposition have always campaign against interruption if we look at the parliamentary record he absolutely have secondly my hon friend be right that what we have be able to do be free up money to pay for other road and rail project and for example to fund bus know that the rail minister my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman be go to meet my hon friend and the colleague he mention to talk about exactly the sort of scheme we be go to deliver be it not the case that rather than level up the north this be slow down the north will give an illustration not very long ago station in the town of northwich which represent collapse it be now finally be rebuild via insurance and what be be rebuild be the ticket office ticket office that this government be consult on close down that speak volume about how when the government cut their cloth it be always the north that pay the price do not think the hon gentleman listen to what say or read what we say in the document we be go to reinvest every single penny that we be save from cancel phase of in the part of the country where the money be go to be spend just under billion will be spend in the north of england just under billion will be spend in the midland and billion which we be save from the new way that we will deliver euston station will be spend in the rest of the country that be reinveste in transport project that think be close to what people want to see which be why they have welcome the decision we have make after have spend year argue that be wasteful and too destructive and that we could not afford it the government have finally agree with and scrap the line north of birmingham however with the government have previously cancel the eastern leg and now have chop its leg off that leave legless stump through my constituency from london to birmingham which continue to bring daily misery to my constituent and be cost an amount of money that we can not afford ask the secretary of state go for third time lucky whether he will scrap the entirety of return the land that can be return do something well with the community consent with the land that can not be return and then spend that money on the west coast main line and the chiltern line instead give my hon friend constituency interest completely understand why he take the view that he do he be doughty champion for his constituent and never lose an opportunity in this place or in fact every time see he to make exactly those point however give the progress we have make the decision we have take be to complete phase from euston to birmingham deliver that significant capacity upgrade interruption say to the hon member for sheffield heeley who just can not help shout from sedentary position that have very productive meeting with the euston partnership last week to discuss these detail the london borough of camden and the mayor of london be very enthusiastic and be work with we in partnership on those proposal the new development corporation at euston be once in lifetime opportunity to transform that area they welcome these proposal and look forward to work with they constructively on they come back to my hon friend point we be go to complete phase between euston and birmingham which deliver the significant capacity upgrade that the chairman of the select committee my hon friend the member for milton keynes south iain stewart refer to notwithstanding the inconvenience be suffer by the constituent of my hon friend the member for buckingham greg smith if there be any issue we can deal with other than cancel phase be always happy to meet he the secretary of state do not make any specific reference to his comment at conservative party conference about the proposal for minute community that be out there he have however say that the number of time driver can get from to will be their choice not decide by council do he believe this nonsense can he tell the house about any local authority that have ever consider such restriction on local people this be just complete nonsense actually can if the hon gentleman go to the website of oxfordshire county council he will see very specific proposal for think five road that council be propose to have filter on those road and to issue permit enable local resident to only drive down they specific number of time year that be labour lib dem green council or at least it be when the proposal be make if resident exceed that number of permit journey picture will be take of their licence plate and they will be issue with fine we in the conservative party do not support those sort of restriction be put on motorist by local authority clearly the hon gentleman do but we do not and we will not stand for it be grateful for my right hon friend statement phase to leeds be cancel early in the year so do my right hon friend know when the safeguard land through my constituency will be release back that have have big impact on constituent who have see their life blight and have be unable to move forward any news my right hon friend have would be gratefully receive he may want to write to later so that can feed it back to my constituent to help my right hon friend phase safeguarding will be formally lift within week phase safeguarding which cover the area in which his constituent live will be amend by next summer to allow for any safeguarding we need for the northern powerhouse rail project in the meantime we will start take step to lift the blight effect of in area where safeguarding be go to be lift we will obviously set out the detail of that in the usual way there be proper legal process to be follow and we will continue work with local authority in my right hon friend area and colleague in the house to keep they fully informed what consideration have the secretary of state give to allow parliament to scrutinise the propose billion of expenditure in relation to both network north and northern powerhouse rail in the consideration of the scheme now that have be cancel will any of the money that have be save be available to address some basic transport failing in constituency such as mine we have northern rail service on the durham coast line that be frankly not fit for purpose there be lack of capacity we have two carriage once an hour with no notice of cancel service which undermine education and employment leave people strand on the platform these failing represent not only transport crisis but an economic crisis which frankly make mockery of the government levelling up agenda first of all scrutiny of my department spending will be carry out by the transport committee the chair my hon friend the member for milton keynes south be no long in his place but be sure that the committee of which the hon member for easington grahame morris be an esteemed member will carry out that scrutiny process the hon gentleman will be aware that in the north east there be tripling of the money that will be under the control of the new north east combined authority significant amount of extra money in many part of the country will be control by locally elect mayors and local authority thus ensure that transport decision be take close to home hope that he and opposition members welcome that as much as do the secretary of state will know that in it be the anniversary of the world first passenger railway in britain do he share my dismay and frankly shame that in this country year on we be not able to connect our great city when other major country around the world can do so would the right thing not be to address the cost of the scheme and why they be so much more expensive in this country rather than scale back our ambition my right hon friend raise two separate point one be about the reason why there have be cost increase some of this be in place before the project be in construction from planning and issue like that which be worth look at in the long term although that will not help in this case we have also see significant cost increase not least due to construction inflation over the past few year however this be not just about cost increase it be also about the benefit reduction one of the key part of the business case for be that it be for business and business traffic we have see business rail use and commuter rail use halve post pandemic because of the change way in which people choose to travel that have be an essential part of the decision and that be why we have decide to change the way we spend the money not to not spend it but to spend it on transport investment close to the way people live their life we think that be the right decision notwithstanding the fact that recognise that my right hon friend be disappoint by it the government claim that the decision to scrap most of be make due to rise cost yet who be chief secretary to the treasury and then chancellor when the cost be spiral out of control the current prime minister not content with that failure we now know that he also waste shocking billion on the leg of that have just be cancel secretary of state do this entire fiasco not illustrate how little regard the government have for taxpayer money no not at all have no regard for taxpayer money would be decide that project be go to cost too much and deliver too little in benefit and then continue to spend taxpayer money regardless this will not be welcome by everybody and it be not the consensus view but we have decide to cancel the second phase by the way this be about not just increase cost but the combination of increase cost and reduce benefit as say in answer to my right hon friend the member for tunbridge wells greg clark it be about the two thing together and we have decide to reinvest the money in alternative transport project which by the way have high return on investment and will therefore deliver great return to taxpayer that show exactly the opposite of what the hon member for slough mr dhesi say that we value taxpayer money and want to deliver the good return for taxpayer money which be why we have make this change in how we be invest their hard earn money many council apply for grant in order to make change to their local road when consider these application will minister ensure that they do not end up pay for scheme that cut local capacity on crucial road and make driver live misery my right hon friend make very good point about what we should prioritise when fund road he should know that one of the important change have make be to make sure that our active travel team be focus on deliver cycling and walk scheme that increase choice rather than focus on drive people out of their car hope he will welcome that important change the secretary of state say that his party be not anti motorist but it be clearly anti public transport we liberal democrats be not anti motorist either but we be unequivocally pro public transport rail produce less carbon dioxide emission than the equivalent road journey and each freight train remove up to lorry from our road the decision to scrap the northern leg of will lead to up to half million more lorry journey up and down the country result in lot more congestion in our town and city be the secretary of state not concerned that freight that would have go on to the railway will now be force on to the road increase our carbon emission and congestion do not agree with the hon lady characterisation of our view on public transport first we have already put in significant amount of extra money this year and from the saving still more be go into our bus system our bus fare cap be make it much easy and cheap for people to use public transport twice as many journey be make by bus than by rail she should also know that spending be crowd out other important investment one of the thing we be now able to fund be the million project at ely junction that will increase capacity for both passenger and freight to the important port of felixstowe my right hon friend have just mention ely junction and he will know that the great eastern main line taskforce have assiduously campaign for that investment for over decade be grateful for this announcement and we look forward to see the proposal go forward alongside rail which be huge in the east of england can my right hon friend bring his long term plan for motorist to essex by bring forward the dualling of the that scheme have be delay for another two year because of construction inflation which completely understand implore he to look at the business case and see what the scheme would mean for the economic wellbeing of mid essex the ely junction scheme which know my right hon friend and other welcome be well work through scheme that be on network rail list of important priority but we simply do not have the money to fund it we now do as result of this project people can not want to continue build the second phase of and simultaneously want to do all these other thing choice have to be make and we make that choice and think it be the right choice for the country know how important my right hon friend think her road scheme be obviously can not deal with it now but as ever would be happy to meet she to discuss how important it be for her constituent see the secretary of state network north map on twitter feature those legendary northern town of tavistock dawlish and plymouth that might have be mildly amusing have my constituency not be cut in half with the whole of the wirral disappear into the irish sea have we be take off the map because we have no funding for any capital transport project will cheshire west and chester council now get refund for the hundred of thousand of pound that it have already spend on preparatory work for come to cheshire that money now appear to have be waste because of the bungle handling of this contract just to be clear of the money that we be save as result of cancel the second phase of just under billion be be spend in the north and just under billion be be spend in the midland the money be spend in the rest of the country be the money save from the way we be now go to deliver euston station with much more ambitious development build thousand more house and have much more positive impact on the local economy it be sensible to call it network north because that be where two third of the money be go but the billion that be be spend in the rest of the country outside the north and the midland will be very welcome as have say every penny be be reinveste in those part of the country that be go to benefit in the north of england for example we be look at invest billion in the line between liverpool and manchester and at have productive talk with the mayors in that part of the world to deliver transport project that be their priority for the people they represent the allocation of funding to the north east have the potential to have major positive local impact particularly welcome the announcement on ferryhill station and look forward to discuss the timing with the secretary of state however the substantial funding towards investment such as the leamside line be within hour spin by the local opposition as reversal of intent will he make absolutely clear what be be deliver to the north east and how it affect the leamside project be very grateful to my hon friend for his question the reopening of the leamside line be transport north east lead project it be develop business case to connect washington with the tyne and wear metro and we be support it as it develop the outline business case because we have cancel the second phase of million extra be be allocate to the north east mean that the new north east mayor will have billion to spend on their transport funding over the five year from one such scheme could be the reopening of the leamside line interruption the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh say could be we believe in devolution we be give billion to the north east mayor and it will be for the mayor to decide the priority know have talk to one of the candidate for that mayoral office that this be priority for they my hon friend the member for sedgefield paul howell have be champion this project enormously and we can now fund such project because of the cancellation of the second phase of be grateful to my hon friend and will continue to work with he as he champion that case on wednesday hull and humber chamber of commerce humber local authority leader and mp be go to meet the rail minister to discuss the need for transport investment around the humber the prime minister announce at the conservative party conference that rail electrification for hull would go ahead and the secretary of state have also mention that in his remark today of course this have be block twice by conservative government in the light of that and the broken promise over trust be very limited in the north as to whether this government will deliver on what they say to help with that will the secretary of state tell the start date for the rail electrification project to hull be not go to pluck date out of the air it be worth say that phase of be not go to deliver train to manchester until this funding be over significant period of time clearly we have to have the normal process in place where we work through business case and do all of that be not go to pluck date out of the air since we make the announcement have meet both national highways and network rail they be now work through the detail of how these proposal fit in with their planning process we will announce the detail in due course but the right hon lady would not expect to pluck date out of the air we will announce they in the normal way know that my hon friend the rail minister be meet her local authority to talk through the detail of these important scheme very much support this decision on give that the cost be totally out of control the benefit be much diminish from what be originally promise and many of the station in staffordshire and up and down the north will actually receive well service via the handsacre link than ever could have be deliver by phase do my right hon friend agree that people in stoke on trent in staffordshire very much want to see investment go into local scheme such as reopen meir station reopen the stoke to leek line invest in the and the and invest in junction of the be grateful to my hon friend who have demonstrate through his question and that list of value local scheme why invest the money in those scheme will deliver more benefit to more people more quickly than deliver the rest of that be why he and many other people have warmly welcome this decision despite chop off at the knee come at considerable cost about billion from what understand and the statement indicate that the government will reinvest the money from northern leg which be another billion the only welsh announcement can see in the statement be about the north wales main line which the government estimate to have cost of about billion that by my math leave shortfall of about billion will the british government ensure in discussion with the welsh government that wales get its allocate shortfall of billion so that it can invest in welsh transport priority the government retain responsibility for deliver heavy rail we be make an investment of billion into electrify the north wales main line which would have think the hon member would welcome as over the come year we develop the funding for local transport spending wales will get barnett consequential in the usual way there be deep democratic point in all of this the secretary of state be elect at the last general election with the expectation give by the then leader of the conservative party that would be build partly because of the government financial incompetence they be now cancel it prime minister not the secretary of state whose own party do not support he and who have certainly never put himself before the electorate as prime minister be cancel it the current secretary of state be follow scorch earth policy whereby it will be impossible for either the elect mayors who be look for alternative funding for carry on the second phase or an incoming labour government to build out the full scheme with all the benefit it would have that be fundamentally anti democratic will the secretary of state not consider on democratic basis protect the line of the hon gentleman raise two point on the first make no apology for base decision on the fact the fact have change both the cost have increase and the benefit have reduce and pour taxpayer money into scheme where that have happen would not make lot of sense on his second point be now thoroughly confused think the labour party have now accept that be not go to happen and that it prefer all the alternative thing we want to spend the money on it can not have it both way if he and his colleague want to complete the second phase of they must go and tell everybody else that they do not want to spend the money on all those other thing that we be go to spend it on we have to make choice in politic we have make our choice be happy with our choice and will defend it they can not have it both way apology inadvertently call two speaker from the opposition side so will next take two from the government side while be on my foot remind member that we have another big statement and an important debate to come so urge brevity in question and answer when the secretary of state be look at network north which do welcome thank he very much for the benefit in the ribble valley constituency of mr deputy speaker he will be delighted with that name check may encourage he to think about the structure for fund other opportunity there be gap in the market between very large rail scheme and those extremely small rail scheme that be too small for local council to deliver such as at midge hall in my constituency where the train stop at platform and we have the nonsense of customer not be able to get on or off do he agree that we could look at such improvement scheme in network north the rail minister have listen to my hon friend very carefully and will ensure that he meet she to discuss that specific proposal the cancellation of be triple win for newcastle under lyme first we will get fast train to london secondly we will get improvement to junction and the thing that my hon friend the member for stoke on trent south jack brereton talk about thirdly and most importantly will not cut swathe through the south of newcastle under lyme on that point the people who will be most pleased be my councillor gary and simon white who have be represent the people of betley and madeley on this since long before be an mp have number of question from they that will send to the secretary of state but most of all they be focus on the need to ensure that the situation face by landowner who have have their land subject to compulsory purchase can be put right as quickly as possible whether they want to purchase the land or not what reassurance can he give that we will look after landowner whose land have be subject to compulsory purchase as just say we be now follow proper legal process we will set out the detail of that and then landowner who have be impact will know what they can do for we to try to put thing right welcome the work that his two councillor have do in ably represent their constituent as my hon friend represent his the more the government pursue their net zero obsession the less conservative they look the minister without any embarrassment have today announce in fact he have boast of new law the zero emission vehicle mandate which will instruct manufacturer on what they be allow to produce year on year then he tell we that consumer will be allow to purchase whatever car they want until that sound more like stalinist economic plan than free market conservative policy can he tell we what will happen if rational consumer decide that they do not want to buy more expensive car car that take half an hour to refuel be likely to burst into flame or be more expensive to insure what will he do then will he have to introduce legislation to instruct dealer on what car they sell and how to sell they first if the right hon gentleman assume that climate change be problem then we need to deal with it transport be the big single emitter of carbon that be why we have publish these ambitious proposal which by the way be support by the automotive industry several of those in the industry be plan on go fast than we be legislate for on the specific point for northern ireland the plan that we have set out be agree by the scottish welsh and uk governments when as hope we get northern ireland government and assembly back up and run they will have to decide whether they wish to join in with those proposal very much hope that they do thank my right hon friend for his statement and the additional million for south yorkshire which will make huge difference to the region however with the recent closure of doncaster sheffield airport do he agree that the good thing that our combine authority mayor can do be use all his devolved power to work with all stakeholder to secure the opening of our airport and will the secretary of state use all his influence to press the south yorkshire mayor to do the right thing with the additional money and use it to help secure our airport future know that my hon friend and other in that area of the country have campaign in favour of the airport of course the thing about devolution be that mayor be able to decide to use their resource which they now have more of on what they think be their local priority represent the people they be elect to serve it be decision for the mayor and of course my hon friend and other will campaign for that decision to be take the hon member for don valley nick fletcher say that south yorkshire will get million as consequence of the decision make by the secretary of state and the government to cancel will the secretary of state confirm that it be the case that in south yorkshire we can expect million for our region that we would not otherwise have receive if that be the case over what timeframe will we receive it it be extra money go to the region capital funding over the next phase of that capital budget it be over the second phase of the city region sustainable transport settlement scheme have already have discussion with the south yorkshire mayor to talk it through and his official and mine be work through the detail so that he can look at the relevant scheme that he wish to invest in over that period norfolk infrastructure need have often be overlook but not any more just in the last week the department of transport have announce million support the norwich western link road in my constituency for which be very grateful in addition to the million support the ely junction upgrade the secretary of state have mention the increase in freight transport that that allow but be right in think that it also unlock the possibility of increase passenger train between norwich and cambridge along the norwich tech corridor be pleased that we be able to make the decision on the road that my hon friend and other colleague have be campaign strongly for and to communicate that to his county council so that the scheme can continue apace be grateful for his welcome for the upgrade for ely junction and as say in my early remark that unlock both freight capacity and potentially further passenger service that can be deliver network rail will set out further detail on that in due course once it have set out the timetable now that have be able to confirm that the plan be fund early this year ask the rail minister the hon member for bexhill and battle huw merriman what be in place to ensure effective monitoring and oversight of he assure that comprehensive monitoring arrangement be in place now even the prime minister have raise concern about mismanagement of what assurance can the secretary of state give to my constituent in the chilterns that limited and its contractor will be well hold to account on that specific point one of the thing we have do because we be go to continue deliver phase of from london euston to birmingham be to make sure that we focus on both cost and delivery on the current timetable there be now extra member appoint to the board have meet the board to talk through its plan and to hold it to account on both the delivery schedule and the cost budget that it have to hit and will continue to do so if the hon lady have any further issue know that my hon friend the rail minister will be delighted to meet she to talk through they can tell the secretary of state that resident and business in aberconwy and across north wales be delighted to hear that there will be billion put towards the electrification of the north wales main line the last major infrastructure project we have along the north wales coast be in for the conwy tunnel like that tunnel this project will be transformative for our local economy for life and for our connection with the north west of england and down to london will my right hon friend confirm from the dispatch box for resident and business in north wales that billion will be attribute to the electrification of the north wales main line and will he meet and my colleague to confirm that those plan be progress would be pleased to meet my hon friend and colleague and can confirm the money that we have put aside have already discuss the plan with network rail which be start work on detail those plan be happy to meet he to talk they through in more detail have campaign for more than year for the reopening of the leamside line which would enable the metro to come to washington in my constituency year long than the hon member for sedgefield paul howell who be newcomer to that campaign so hon member can imagine my joy when see it in print the day after the prime minister speech only for it to disappear hour later far from it be the opposition who go out spinning it be ministers on the prime minister own front bench who be on the airwave spin that nothing have change after it disappear if it be just illustrative why do it need to be delete from the network north document with other such illustration it be not delete from the network north document the network north document that be publish on the website have not change so interruption the hon member for sheffield heeley louise haigh keep go on about illustrative stuff as have say billion of the billion be allocate to combine authority mayors so what it get spend on be ultimately their decision know that that be priority for the north east so it be one of the thing on which we be work with they on business case be very pleased that the hon member for washington and sunderland west mrs hodgson and my hon friend the member for sedgefield paul howell be both campaign it be always good when these thing be do on cross party basis know that this be priority for region the money be now there to pay for it which be not the case before we take the decision to cancel the second phase of these thing be only now able to happen because we take that decision if the opposition decide that they want to campaign to build the second phase of thing such as the leamside line will not happen if the seaside resort industrial town and rural village of lincolnshire be to expand their economy it be essential that the road network be improve the and be just three example can my right hon friend assure that some of the redirected billion will head towards lincolnshire and will he arrange for and neighbouring colleague to meet the minister with responsibility for road to discuss future plan would be very pleased for the under secretary of state for transport my hon friend the member for north west durham mr holden to meet my hon friend and colleague yes there be money go to all local authority to address the quality of their local road number of road scheme include the major road network and large local major programme be fund in partnership between the department and local authority but we be now able to pay all the cost to bring they to fruition more quickly on specific local scheme know that my hon friend the under secretary of state would be delighted to meet my hon friend and local colleague to talk they through that in more detail building be long term decision for the future investment for decade to come not just to improve transport but to drive the economy of the north which be why my south manchester constituent once again feel let down by this government we now have the bad possible outcome billion spend on half job without those long term benefit for the north that be not long term decision but short term short sighted failure disagree with the hon gentleman first the high speed train be not go to get to manchester until anyway secondly as the fact have change it have become clear that we will receive well return on taxpayer hard earn money by cancel the second phase of and reinveste every penny in alternative rail project in the north the midland and elsewhere we have set out the detail of that plan know that not everybody will agree with it that be okay but those who do not like what we have propose instead have to be honest with people and say that campaign to build the second phase of will mean that those other thing can not be do the choice have to be make we have make the right choice which be to invest that money in thing that will give well return soon and for more people in more part of the country that be the right choice for the country and long term decision for well future be member of the high speed rail crewe manchester bill select committee we have be sit for nine month and have listen carefully to lot of petitioner my view be that have have massive impact on many of those people life how can the secretary of state ensure that the people who have already lose business and property to make way for railway line that will not be build have the option to get they back for fair price one thing that we will do as we work through the consequence of the decision be set out the detail exactly will not do so now because there be important legal consequence for such thing but we will set out the detail exactly for people whose property be subject to compulsory purchase order my hon friend will know there be rule detail what happen when such property be no long need for the purpose for which they be purchase to protect the constituent who be affect we will set out detail of how that will work in due course and will keep she informed be very pleased when the prime minister announce the electrification of the north wales line have be long term advocate of that sort of project in fact as long ago as meet the chair and chief executive of the then strategic rail authority to press for it he say no twenty year later remember the sra motto which be britain railway properly deliver be concerned that the prime minister note figure of billion for the north wales project many commentator think that that be quite insufficient can the secretary of state guarantee that the project will be properly deliver by be properly and fully fund be grateful for what think be welcome for the north wales mainline electrification meet network rail follow the announcement we make and it will now do the detailed work on deliver that scheme it will announce the detail the timeframe and so forth in the usual way and look forward to the hon gentleman support for each stage of the project very much welcome the commitment to ely north junction and also to haughley junction they will deliver major benefit for my constituent include an hourly peterborough to ipswich service and well service to london it will also benefit the midland and the north by well connect the busy sea container port in europe to the rail network haughley junction be much cheap and simple project than ely north junction be there scope to expedite and accelerate the delivery of that specific project which will start deliver benefit on the ground for my constituent soon be grateful for the campaigning work my hon friend have do on push for that scheme it be very clear from the work that he and other colleague have do that it be very important priority can confirm that the ely area capacity enhancement project include haughley junction and we have start the work with network rail it be seize of try to do it as quickly as we can but we obviously have to make sure it be do properly will keep he post in the usual way no matter how much the secretary of state try to back pedal the fact be that the proposal to reopen the leamside line be scrap just hour after it be announce and business and community in the north east rightly feel betrayed who be it who decide that they would water down the proposal who decide that the leamside line be far too north to be worthy of government investment be it the prime minister the treasury or the minister who sell out the north east be not quite sure why the hon lady do not think that an extra million for transport in the north east add up to billion of investment and the fact that we have start work with official in that area on that project should not be welcome think it should be welcome and be sure that she and other colleague who support it will continue work with we on make sure that it get deliver the secretary of state will be aware that blackpool council be consider spend million of pound of taxpayer money on zero emission bus from china instead of purchase british one it be beyond farcical that taxpayer cash intend to support british job and local supply chain may be use to import poor quality vehicle and ultimately end up in the hand of the chinese government will my right hon friend join in urge blackpool council to support british job and investment and to think again it be ultimately for local authority to make decision they be accountable and it be for they to make decision about how they choose to spend the taxpayer money for which they be responsible have hear very clearly what my hon friend have say about where that money should be spend and his local authority will have do so more importantly however so will have his voter and they will be able to make decision about the council future in due course number of year ago the conservative government expressly instruct members local council and other stakeholder not to focus on the electrification of the north wales line as result virtually the entire rail development case for cheshire north east wales and the wirral be build on the premise of have hear the secretary of state correctly that we be go to waste all the time effort and money spend over the year and go right back to the drawing board to paraphrase the hon member for milton keynes south iain stewart what exactly be the plan be not entirely certain exactly what the hon lady question be but we have set out the plan very carefully we be go to deliver the first phase of from euston to birmingham we be go to cancel the second phase and we be go to reinvest every single penny the billion we have save in the north the midland and the rest of the country that be very clear plan and think it be one that will be welcome by the public will the secretary of state confirm that as per the prime minister recent announcement the ivanhoe line will be fully reopen thereby link burton upon trent to leicester be the secretary of state aware that even this week compulsory purchase order be be issue and process in respect of property and land on the now cancel route north of birmingham on the second point which be very important for the hon gentleman constituent all outstanding claim for land that have already be acquire for phase of will still be pay application that be in progress will be handle on case by case basis after consultation with the claimant because people may well have make plan base on the land be purchase and it be important that we follow through on that so there will be proper consultation with claimant before we make decision to try to do the right thing by the people affect the ivanhoe line be go to be deliver welcome sincerely the news of the secretary of state support for cullompton railway station it be not new give that my predecessor as mp for tiverton and honiton neil parish secure restore your railway funding for cullompton station two year ago at that time neil say that construction could take place as early as will the secretary of state tell my constituent whether cullompton station be still on track to open in this parliament it be very important when project be promise that we have the fund to pay for they and it be by cancel the second phase of that we be able to fund that important project which be glad the hon gentleman welcome do not think that the rail minister and in the time we have be in post have have any communication from the hon gentleman campaign for the station whereas my hon friend the member for east devon simon jupp have campaign for it assiduously as have my hon friend the member for taunton deane rebecca pow net zero by with permission would like to make statement on the prime minister announcement on net zero britain have lead the world on tackle climate change we have cut our carbon emission in half over the past year we have boost our share of renewable from just in to almost half today we have deliver the second high amount of record low carbon investment cumulatively across europe over the past five year of all the major economy we have set the tough target and we have exceed every carbon budget target so far as we look forward to become net zero economy by we must ensure that our ambition be practical and achievable achievable by industry which be invest billion to decarbonise achievable technologically as much of the green tech we will need to hit our target need to be scale up and achievable for consumer in particular for the million of household that be currently struggle to make end meet we will not reach net zero over the next three decade unless our plan for the future be pragmatic and viable only of people in the uk currently think that net zero be go to be good for they and their family finance in the near term in europe we be see people push back at clumsy policy that be negatively affect our life it be clear that if we do not bring people with we we risk sacrifice the whole climate change agenda that be why the prime minister set out his plan last month for fairer approach to ease the burden on hard work people and keep people feel optimistic about net zero the prime minister approach include give people the flexibility to choose new petrol or diesel car until remove the requirement that would have see property owner force to spend up to or more on energy upgrade ease the transition to clean heating and raise grant under the boiler upgrade scheme by to that scheme be now one of the most generous of its kind in europe the change will allow we to meet our international net zero target while avoid disproportionate cost at time when global inflation pressure be challenge the finance of many household we be responsible for less than of annual greenhouse gas emission while our emission be down america remain unchanged and china be up by it can not be right that our citizen face punitive cost here when emission be rise abroad as the prime minister say the fear be that if we continue to impose extra cost on people we risk lose their consent for net zero want people to feel optimistic about net zero and connect that with job investment and sense of pride in play our part in global challenge by take more measured approach we will achieve our ambitious target with the public consent meanwhile we be spend ten of billion to transform our energy security and to boost renewable and clean nuclear power we be invest billion to get our carbon capture and storage industry up and run with job support in place such as humberside scotland and the north east and north west of england we will take carbon dioxide from pollute industry and store it under the north sea the uk can lead the world in the provision of carbon transport and storage service with an estimate billion tonne of theoretical carbon storage capacity in the uk continental shelf one of the large potential carbon storage capacity in europe we also have the large operational offshore wind farm in the world and the second large the third large the fourth large and now the fifth large too all deliver under conservative government we will have enough wind to power the equivalent of every home in britain by we will generate enough solar energy to power the equivalent of over million electric vehicle mile every hour by we be world lead in our fusion technology and space base solar project britain nuclear revival be well under way hinkley point in somerset will provide enough secure low carbon electricity to power around million home sizewell in suffolk feature the most powerful electricity generator in the world to power another million home we have launch great british nuclear to deliver our programme and we have accelerate the development of small modular reactor bring all our work together be the energy bill the vehicle for deliver the energy strategy to turbocharge british technology it will liberate billion worth of private investment scale up green job and growth and make britain the good place in the world to invest in clean energy the most important announcement make during my tenure have be about the grid we must make sure that the grid infrastructure be in place to bring new clean secure and low cost power to home and business four time as much new transmission network will be need in the next seven year as be build since so we be bring forward comprehensive new reform to help green energy expand fast we will speed up planning for the most nationally significant project and accelerate grid connection so that those who be ready can connect first later this autumn we will set out our response to the work of electricity network commissioner nick winser demonstrate how we be go far and fast on grid inform by his recommendation on reduce the time take to develop this critical infrastructure for low bill energy security decarbonisation and economic growth we will also set out our plan to reform the connection process so that new electricity generator and electricity user can be connect fast bring more low cost low carbon energy into the system and connect up new economic investment quick we will set out the uk first ever spatial plan for energy infrastructure to give industry certainty and every community say we have so much to be proud of in what we have achieve so far particularly the international leadership that we have show in reduce greenhouse gas emission the climate change committee have assess that there be no material difference in our progress to cut emission by since its last report in june yet the change we have make will make real difference to the finance of many household up and down the country the prime minister intervention mean that we be now on more secure path because it can command public support take the people of britain with we and deliver net zero in practical proportionate and pragmatic way commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for advanced sight of her statement my only disappointment be that she do not read out the multiple paragraph defend the prime minister claim about seven bin which be in the copy send to obviously she be too embarrassed to defend it because it be make up nonsense we profoundly disagree with the secretary of state and the prime minister when they suggest that the answer to the cost of live crisis in our country be dith and delay on build clean energy future for britain it will not work and their approach will make it bad if you want the evidence madam deputy speaker just look at their previous failure the ban on onshore wind do not cut bill it raise they the slashing of home energy efficiency cut the green crap as they call it do not cut bill it raise they the fiasco of the offshore wind auction last month do not cut bill it will raise they it be not go too fast on climate that have cause the cost of living crisis it be the conservatives failure that have leave we expose to the bad energy bill crisis in generation rather than learn the lesson they be double down the definitive analysis of the recent announcement come last thursday from the government own watchdog the climate change committee it say this the cancellation of some net zero measure be likely to increase both energy bill and motor cost for household why do it say that let explain the government now say that landlord will not have to insulate home but as the ccc point out these regulation would have reduce renter energy bill significantly moreover the cost saving would have outweigh any change in rent therefore they be not lower cost they be raise they on electric vehicle the ccc say that any undermining of their roll out will ultimately increase cost that be because the lifetime cost of ev be already cheap than those of petrol and diesel vehicle by the up front cost of ev be forecast to be at parity with petrol or diesel car again the government be not lower cost for family they be raise they when the secretary of state dump other target have to ask who set these target and then fail to take the action to meet they the government do laughably they say that this be about long term decision the big long term cost that the british people face be failure to act at the scale require to tackle the climate crisis the secretary of state say again that the government be on track to meet their target but their own watchdog say in june that they be significantly off track it say this be from last thursday that the government have not offer evidence to back their assurance that the uk target will still be meet there be no evidence that they be on track to meet their target perhaps bad of all imagine be business try to make decision and invest in our country when they literally do not know from one day to the next what the government policy be since the prime minister announcement business from around the world have say that by back off climate action the prime minister be turn his back on the great economic opportunity of the century meanwhile the uk head into yet another winter where people can not afford their energy bill there be still no proper plan for roll out of energy efficiency no plan to properly lift the onshore wind ban and no proper plan to get the offshore wind market back on track finally let say to the secretary of state that the consensus on net zero have be hard win over two decade we have duty to debate it on the basis of fact not falsehood have to say to she that it be deeply regrettable that she use her first major public appearance two week ago at her conference literally to make up complete nonsense about meat taxis which notice she do not defend today and for which frankly she be expose on national television say to she that it demean she it demean her office and it demean public debate the government say that they be go to move on from the premiership of boris johnson but people will be deeply disturb to find that that appear to mean dump commitment to net zero and keep his peculiar relationship to the truth thank the right hon gentleman for his response to my statement he raise number of question that wish to address he mention the prospect of the seven bin policy he have forget that he vote for it the conservatives by contrast come to the good sense to course correct he have take leave of his sens and forget what he have vote for in the past on the question of dietary change the right hon gentleman might like to speak to his shadow climate change minister and shadow chief secretary to the treasury who both have push to treat meat like tobacco in the past the substantial point that would make be that we need to be practical about our net zero policy and to make sure that we be have honest debate we on the conservative benches stand by our record we be proud to be the party that have decarbonise fast than any country and it be regrettable that the opposition can not acknowledge that achievement we be proud that we have secure almost billion of investment in low carbon energy project since and that we have help to secure this country energy independence by back north sea oil and gas protect job can the right hon gentleman be proud of his record he say that we should sacrifice our growth to cut emission and that we should borrow billion in his blind ambition for he support coal before he change his mind and be now against it he also say that grow our renewable sector to be pie in the sky but in the first quarter of of our power come from renewable energy he spend year at gordon brown side and as energy secretary but do nothing to boost british nuclear in his time in government whereas we be forge new path with every operational nuclear power station in this country have start life under conservative government member do not need to take my word for it that our energy security be safe with we because just this weekend the owner of grangemouth make it clear that the threat labour plan pose to the future of the refinery potentially put thousand of job at risk would be danger for energy security furthermore we can not allow oil and gas worker to become the coalminer of our generation it have be say that labour do not properly understand energy with it be self defeat and naive those be not my word but those of the general secretary of the unite union and the head of the gmb furthermore the right hon gentleman talk about uncertainty if he would like to give the business and industry certainty he and the shadow chancellor need to sit down and agree how much money they will actually spend be it billion or billion be it no new money or be it what we hear over the weekend which be as much as billion of new borrowing for gb energy conservative will prioritise energy security we be set on deliver the most ambitious net zero target of any major economy and we will do this all without force family to choose between protect their family finance and protect the planet call the chair of the environmental audit committee warmly welcome what my right hon friend have just say about the focus on the grid and accelerate grid access hope she will be able to pick up on the report that my committee be undertake on that subject and that we can contribute to her deliberation as she will be aware write to the prime minister on behalf of the committee in the week follow his speech offer he an opportunity to put some flesh on the bone of what his more pragmatic approach to achieve net zero ambition actually mean will she confirm when my committee can expect to receive reply to that letter will it include an analysis of the impact of the trajectory of deliver net zero on the five yearly carbon budget and in particular how the announcement we have just have confirm by the transport secretary who be sit next to she on maintain the zero emission vehicle mandate will impact on that trajectory thank my right hon friend and commend his long stand work on environmentalism have be privileged to work with he on this before will be respond to he and look forward to come to speak to his committee in due course we set out unprecedented level of detail in the analysis of how we be go to meet the target early this year also accept the climate change committee analysis which be that the change we have make be not materially different in term of achieve our target we be absolutely committed to make sure that we do so as he rightly point out the big announcement we have make on achieve those target be the one relate to the grid which will allow for much great and quick electrification of society when it come to the impact of other proposal call the scottish national party spokesperson there seem to be no level to which this prime minister will not stoop in his pursuit of culture war apart from the reactionary brigade on his own benches and the flat earther he have anger many across the uk from environmental group to tory donor and even boris johnson these legal target and deadline have be in place for some time and accordingly business active in all these sector will have have investment and disinvestment plan in place for year reduce the uk energy use by by be tough target but we need tough target if we be to rise to the situation the planet face what do the prime minister do when face with difficulty he scrap the energy efficiency taskforce after just six month it be utterly embarrassing if this government be so worried about the affordability of climate measure why be they offer less support than the scottish government for heat pump installation and why do they keep cancel successive home insulation scheme of course all this follow the tories permit new coal mine along with the cambo and rosebank oilfield be the secretary of state at all surprised that two third of uk voter say that the tories can not be trust on climate change scotland ambition in this area be far great and fast scotland net zero secretary màiri mcallan say that the scottish government have be blindside by these announcement with zero consultation in advance and that it be an unforgivable betrayal of current and future generation the prime minister reckless decision combine with the united kingdom internal market act make it extremely difficult for scotland to hit our target last week scotland transfer it would be an export post independence more than gwh of renewable electricity to england many other wind power scheme be in development include the world big at berwick bank which will ensure that scotland be one of the world big exporter of clean green energy we also have two hydro scheme ready to go if the government be to put the contractual agreement in place scot often ask about the cost and benefit of this unequal union of our many will now wonder if water down our climate ambition or the obligation we commit to at be too high price to pay thank the hon gentleman for his question let be clear there have be no watering down of our target we have the most ambitious decarbonise target of any major economy and we have not change those at all we be resolutely committed to they by we will have cut emission by the us be plan to cut its emission by and the eu its emission by the people of scotland will be very proud that we be the most ambitious major economy in the world and we will work towards that together we have work with the devolved administration since the announcement and be due to speak to my counterpart in due course have be in correspondence with he one of the big thing that we will do that will be helpful for the scottish people particularly and that will bring benefit to the renewable energy sector be to improve the grid have speak to more than investor know it be their big ask and it will be very positive not just for scotland but for the whole of the uk call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee even before dogger bank come on stream the uk be lead the world in offshore wind generation hope that in due course we will also lead the world in nuclear generation if we be to charge up all those electric car and power all those air source heat pump we will need an awful lot of electricity at peak time we will also be produce lot of electricity at off peak time do the secretary of state agree that hydrogen will have an important part to play in power heavy vehicle and heating home if we be to do that we need to make sure that our gas grid do not become stranded asset because we might need to press it into service thank my right hon friend and he make an excellent and correct point while make sure that we grow our intermittent energy source such as solar and wind we must also have stable baseload underneath that he be right that hydrogen will play an interesting role and be speak to the sector about how we can move forward it be an exciting policy area and will explore it in many way we also have trial on heating home pick he up on one point we will be use gas for long time even the independent climate change committee acknowledge that we will still be use gas in rise we have another debate to follow will try to get everybody in but will prioritise those member who have not already ask question in previous statement or who do not get in brevity would be much appreciated in both question and answer value the cross party consensus that this country have enjoy for the past year which be responsible for some of the strenuous target that the secretary of state have outline however be disappoint by the prime minister statement and indeed the tone of the secretary of state remark today in the spirit of cross party consensus will she set out hierarchy for the utilisation of the mw of low carbon hydrogen that the government have now commit to so that the limited supply of hydrogen power be deliver first to high energy user such as those in the steel ceramics glass and cement sector who need the extra heat that electricity can not provide the hon gentleman be absolutely right that hydrogen possess enormous potential when it come to our industrial sector will be meet many people from the sector tomorrow and will be look at that point very carefully and would be happy to speak far with he about it when the new select committee on energy security and net zero first meet the first thing we do be to have huge roundtable day with over different stakeholder from the sector time and again those stakeholder talk about the tardiness of get plan approval and access to the grid so absolutely welcome action that will deliver clean cheap and more secure energy also get the point about need carrot not stick for electric vehicle in my constituency those with driveway pay only tax on their electricity but those who do not have driveway have to pay tax that be true all across the country so will the secretary of state join in push the chancellor for those carrot to be fair carrot my right hon friend be huge champion of all environmental issue and look forward to speak to her committee in due course it be really important that we have just and fair transition that be exactly what the proposal we have set out aim to do she will know that tax matter be for the chancellor but again would be happy to speak to she far about those issue honestly this statement take orwellian doublespeak to new level it must have set some record for the large number of mislead statement in the small amount of space do not know how the secretary of state have the gall to stand at the dispatch box and say that this be about ease the burden on hard work people when she know that all the evidence show that what have be announce will increase cost for ordinary people for example we have hear from the climate change committee that the change when it come to landlord and efficiency standard in home will cost renter an extra year the office for budget responsibility be clear that as result of the change that be go to be make our dependence on gas will cost we more if the government really care about hard work family they would not be hand equinor billion to develop the climate wreck rosebank oilfield they would be admit that what the secretary of state be do be rip up the climate consensus for short term electoral calculation and populist right wing propaganda thank the hon lady for that question but if she have any constituent live in property off the gas grid it would be clear to she how worried people be about those policy we have give they this reprieve because we understand that put in some of those technology such as heat pump would have cost they thousand of pound make sure that they have the right insulation in place for example turn to equinor far from we pay that company money that be something that will pay tax into the exchequer unlock green investment and allow people in the wide sector to continue in job across the economy those be job people and community that we will need in the transition to renewable energy because they be the same people with the same skill that will be use it would be right for the hon lady to talk to the people of those community about this issue the secretary of state be right that in order for this to work green product need to be affordable and attractive what study have her department make of the attraction of synthetic and sustainable fuel as another option compare with battery they may be easy for many of these user thank my right hon friend for that question we have speak about this issue before we will be consult on synthetic fuel in particular for aviation and we be look at alternative fuel more widely for example for rural home would be happy to keep up the conversation with he about our progress in the word of my constituent adam in vauxhall these climate policy would help local parent like we to pay our energy bill this winter and keep our child safe and warm without these policy child in london face bleak future as the climate crisis do irreparable damage to the world around they like many other vauxhall resident adam be deeply concerned about the impact of the government delay and about the world we be leave for our child do the secretary of state not understand that these delay run contrary to the aim of make the life of the next generation well than the life that we all enjoy today we do understand the importance of energy efficiency in fact during our tenure we have raise the proportion of energy efficient home from when we come to office to we be also spend billion in this parliament and furth billion up to in addition to the billion that will be deliver through the energy company obligation and the great british insulation scheme this be something that we be take seriously and the hon lady can give her constituent that assurance give that our total emission be less than the increment in chinese emission every year my right hon friend be right to be pragmatic about this at present there be planning application for solar farm ring gainsborough total acre enough to feed the city of hull every year all base on fiddled application for national infrastructure project there be currently planning presumption against build solar farm on land grade or but not but for farmer there be no difference between and land can we change that planning presumption and build solar farm on top of factory and on grey land rather than take good farming land entirely agree with my right hon friend about the need to build solar farm in more appropriate place which be why announce in the last couple of week that it would be easy to build they on industrial rooftop car park and warehouse in the way that he have describe the secretary of state have suggest that many people have not buy into the concept of net zero instead of see that as an opportunity for leadership the government play into misinformation about make up taxis and the seven deadly bin she will be aware that northern ireland be already laggard on climate issue because the assembly be collapse just after it have finally pass bind target and before it have take any meaningful action on issue such as retrofitting plan for renewable and transform agrifood be she also aware that northern ireland rely largely on the all island single energy market for our energy need and be she confident that her government be keep up with their responsibility to ensure that we match the standard of that market we care about climate change which be why we have the most ambitious target of any major economy that be what we have deliver on to date and that be what we will be deliver on when we get to as well as for the single electricity market be familiar with that and we talk to our northern ireland counterpart regularly to make sure that it be work in way that benefit the northern irish people the secretary of state be right we must take people with we on this journey to net zero when it come to incentivise people in the take up of electric vehicle what more can the government do to broaden or turbocharge the provision of public ev charging point by company and council the most important thing that we can do to turbocharge that be get the grid work and look at both transition and distribution which be exactly what we be plan to do in our response to the winser report would say to anyone who want to buy an electric vehicle that if that work for they they will be able to do it and nothing in our plan will change that the cheap energy be the energy that we do not use it be unforgivable that the government have cancel the obligation for landlord to upgrade home to an epc grade rating by at the late comprehensive home insulation scheme would reduce bill and carbon emission this winter be go to make proposal that might sound quite attractive to conservative ear because it be about incentivising and tax break will the secretary of state consider allow landlord to offset spending on insulation against their income tax bill that would benefit tenant by enable they to live in warm and comfortable home set out early the amount that we be spend on insulation billion in this parliament with furth billion to and an additional billion through the energy company obligation and the great british insulation scheme the real world reason for why we do not pursue that policy be that it could have cost property owner up to and we do not want to put further pressure on rent at time when family be really struggle with regard to the hon lady policy on income tax relief suggest that be not necessarily the good response because lot of landlord be pensioner and will not necessarily pay income tax however we will continue to look at everything we can do to ensure that insulation be properly deliver the announcement change two key date that be the subject of lot of work by the previous business energy and industrial strategy committee do the secretary of state agree that in term of the preparedness of the industry affect and the awareness of consumer there be contrast between the automotive sector and domestic heating with far more progress have be make on the former so there be strong case to put back the date on home heating than on the automotive sector do she also agree that if we be to have power available where it be need for electric vehicle and to heat our home we need to speed up the reinforcement of the electricity grid completely agree with my hon friend point about the grid every single person in the sector have speak to have say that the announcement we have make about the grid be the most important make to date in term of electric vehicle if the price get to point where family want to adopt they they will do so nothing in our policy stop they on domestic heating it be right that we have take some space for household that would not be suitable for such technology he be right to welcome the uplift on the boiler upgrade grant have speak to provider such as octopus which have say that it have see fivefold increase in inquiry since we announce the policy it be clear from talk to industrialist about net zero and carbon capture last week that they be exasperate with the government start stop approach to business the snail pace of decision and of course the lack of clarity the chemical industries association have report decline production and say that domestic demand remain low it need ccus its fellow industrialist need ccus and net zero need ccus when will we get some final decision or be those initiative also under threat the hon gentleman be absolutely right to articulate the potential of carbon capture and storage early in the year we set out the billion package large package by international standard we have set out some progress and we be work at pace to ensure that we can set out more later in the year he talk about lack of clarity if he be worried about that gently say that he might want to look at his own party position far to the question from my right hon friend the member for wokingham john redwood synthetic fuel by that mean genuinely synthetic fuel make from green hydrogen and atmospheric carbon capture rather than biofuel or fuel from waste be net zero because the amount of carbon at the tailpipe be the same volume recapture to make the next lot of fuel yet the myopic zero emission vehicle mandate prevent the uk from benefit from synthetic fuel for our road vehicle will my right hon friend show the same welcome pragmatism she have show to the rest of the agenda and revisit the zero emission vehicle mandate we have set out our position on the zero emission mandate however we be also look at synthetic fuel as say we be consult on they for aviation and we can look at they more broadly however we have set out the position on the zev mandate which have be widely welcome give that the rowing back on the commitment towards net zero come on the first day of the parliamentary recess it look an awful lot like there be an attempt to avoid democratic scrutiny the secretary of state have say that she want to take people with she may put to she group of people she could take with she by reverse some of these daft decision private renter when meet family who be rent from private landlord particularly in the marsh area of lancaster hear that their energy bill be far high because of their door and window and how their roof be leaky and not insulate that row back on the standard in the private rent sector be cost family more will she please look again at that thank the hon lady but that take some gall when the labour party leave the proportion of energy efficient home in this country at and we have take it to have set out the multiple billion that we will be spend on insulation which be important to we but at the same time ask family up and down the country to spend on update home would have be pass on in rent and may have lead to more shortage in the private rent sector that be something we absolutely must not see at time when family be struggle too welcome my right hon friend comment on grid connection that be something be concern about and have raise number of time can she reassure business that may be make investment decision right now that when she bring forward her plan those timescale will dramatically reduce be not talk about reduce from the year we have see report to eight six four or even two year be talk about really serious reduction in practical timeframe my hon friend be doughty campaigner for all the industry in her area our ambition be to tackle the challenge with the grid we will be set out for the first time geo spatial plan look at planning and look at all the different connection point to make sure we have an overall strategy for the country which will immeasurably speed up the connection process september offshore wind auction fail to attract any successful bid result that deal severe blow to hope for float offshore wind industry base off the south west coast of wales what reassurance can the secretary of state offer that lesson will be learn from that auction process and that action will be take to ensure that investment in this new exciting industry be secure in future the hon gentleman be right to talk about offshore wind as an exciting industry which have do incredibly well under our contract for difference programme we be look at float offshore wind and he will know the support we have put in place but have be speak to investor and stakeholder and will be make sure that we look at some of the challenge the sector face what role do she see for the concept of minute neighbourhood in help the united kingdom to meet its net zero target the point of our proposal be to make sure that people have choice that we can bring people with we and that people can live their life in the way they want to we can enable they through decarbonise the power grid and give they alternative option so we can make sure that we can get to our net zero target in way that be practical and achievable for family at the democratic unionist party conference on saturday past the ulster farmers union of which declare be member have leaflet on achieve net zero can the secretary of state outline how we will meet our international obligation in term of net zero with this rollback and how firm and farmer that have already invest in green policy and procedure will be able to compete with those who can go full steam ahead with old practice and no incentive whatsoever to change we be not roll back from our target at all agree with the climate change committee assessment that there be no material difference between the projection in june and the recent assessment it make post the announcement welcome lot of the work that many of our farmer be do to pursue environmental goal have talk to many in my constituency who be do quite phenomenal thing at local level they will be support by our agriculture policy the landmark agriculture act and the environment act that we have bring forward in recent year last winter the taxpayer cover around half the cost of british people heat their home that amount to exactly billion of taxpayer money spend between last october and this march at the end of last year of property with loft do not have loft insulation how concerned be the secretary of state about the cost to future taxpayer of row back this government previous insulation plan the hon gentleman be right to point out that we spend billion last year help people with their energy bill pay on average half of people energy bill to support they through that difficult time on insulation would say that when we come into power of home be energy efficient and now that figure be we be spend billion in this parliament furth billion to and billion through the energy company obligation and the great british insulation scheme to make sure that our home be energy efficient welcome the government belate recognition that net zero policy be cost individual in their pocket cost job and of course produce huge profit for the eco industry but be the secretary of state not concerned that by maintain the legal target for she hand weapon to those who want to use the judicial review mechanism either to delay or to stop important decision on airport expansion new road and oil and gas licence delay even some of the policy that she say today she want to delay to save people money we be confident that we can meet those target and we see opportunity in the transition ahead of we we see job investment and opportunity to export british product around the world that be what will focus on in this job to ensure that we make the most of the energy transition and that it benefit all part of our country we also want to do that in sensible way that protect family and household income the secretary of state be explain that she be only slow the government headlong dash to net zero because of wan public support when do the secretary of state think that she be ever go to maintain public support for policy that will make our constituent poor cold and less free while at the same time allow communist china to increase its emission by more than our total emission in every year of this decade as say the climate transition present huge opportunity for this country and the people of this country when it come to job investment and improve our energy security that will be the focus of my work in this role however we will do that in way that protect finance and family from clunky and clumsy unimplementable policy thank the secretary of state for her statement backbench business early years childcare relevant document fifth report of the education committee support for childcare and the early year hc before call the mover of the motion should say that we will have maiden speech and we have very short time for this debate warn those who be participate that there could be maximum time limit of five minute but it might be bit less we will see how it go just want to warn member because obviously there will not be time limit on the maiden speech beg to move that this house have consider support for childcare and the early year be grateful to the backbench business committee for grant this debate early in this parliamentary sitting period and for allow the education committee to continue its work on this vital area of policy be also grateful to my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton recognise the pressure on parliamentary time today for have withdraw her equally important debate hope that she secure another one on that subject when run to be chairman of the education committee propose an inquiry into early education and childcare and be very glad to get the support of substantial majority across the whole house as well as from individual member of the committee in pursue that as the parent of five year old and two year old should perhaps declare special personal interest in this area but there be probably no single subject more vital to the future success of our child than their early experience of education and the stimulation engagement and support they can receive through high quality early year education and childcare as many other have argue there be enormous economic benefit from investment in this space however the last time trouble the backbench business committee for time to debate it be in advance of the last budget when be very glad that the treasury accept the case for major new financial commitment in this area say then that investment in childcare and early education would benefit multiple group parent who wish to work school to have properly socialise child ready to learn child who benefit from well stimulation and those with special educational need with early identification it be win to the power of four our inquiry be launch before the very significant expansion in the government childcare offer and their plan for substantially increase investment in the funded hour it be important to note however that our oral evidence be take both before and after the detail of the announcement become know we hear both the relief of the sector at the scale of the commitment be make and also many of its ongoing concern about the complexity of the many scheme of funding the overall level of funding go into childcare particularly for three and four year old and the many serious and ongoing pressure face provider be enormously grateful to the many expert witness parent provider academic campaigner childminder and nursery practitioner who give evidence to we indeed it be worth note that this inquiry receive more write submission than any other in the life of my committee and in so far as my clerks recall any other inquiry in the history of the education committee put on record my thank to the clerks of the committee and their apprentice who have to handle an unprecedented quantity of material with calm determination and expertise due to the very important list of other debate that have take place today will not have time to re present every one of the recommendation that we make in the report on the back of the more than piece of evidence however want to remind the minister of the press nature of the challenge reflect in the enormous public response to our call for evidence and will focus on three key recommendation the affordability of childcare be key concern for parent and before the budget it be become clear that the sector be face crisis of both affordability and availability have no doubt that the additional hundred of million in funding this year and next will make some difference and that the roll out of funded hour for the under three over the next few year will make big difference for work parent but urge the government to consider very carefully recommendation and as well as overarch recommendation and on the need to work across government to ensure adequate funding the additional billion that the government have commit over the long term will succeed only if the sector be properly support in the short and medium term and if we continue to have strong and thriving early year education across the public private and voluntary sector know the department for education be not able to make decision on taxation but urge my hon friend the minister to consider very carefully the case for our recommendation on exempt childcare provider from business rate and the payment of vat on building cost not only be these taxis false economy for the treasury as the dfe evidence admit these cost have to be take into account in setting funding rate but they be barrier to much need expansion to meet the government own ambition bad many childcare business point out to the committee that the size of their premise be matter not of choice but of meet regulatory standard require by government and ofsted guideline they therefore find themselves have to pay more in business rate not as result of commercial decision to expand but as result of wish to meet the space standard set by public body raise nursery press concern about their rapidly increase business rate bill in previous debate but as our unanimous recommendation suggest fix this problem and create level playing field among provider on rate and vat should not be use as cost save measure it should be use to ensure that more resource be available for pay upskille and retain expert staff in support of this recommendation write evidence from the national education union say business rate for nursery school can be over in some area so the absence of rebate be significant pressure on already overstretch budget write evidence from the national day nurseries association say business rate property revaluation from april have see provider report bill increase of in survey of ndna member nursery across england be ask what they would do if they no long have to pay business rate say they would increase staff salary say they would reduce loss in their business and say they would mitigate fee increase to parent if affordability and quality be as important to the government as availability believe that they should take account of this evidence know my hon friend the minister be passionate about social mobility and the benefit of early year education and urge he to ensure this continue to be press with the treasury we have hear strong argument from the treasury about the benefit to parent of be able to work where there be affordable childcare provision this have be key rationale for the expansion of so call free hour which we have recommend should be call fund hour down the age group it be key rationale behind the very welcome change to childcare cost within universal credit however in that context urge the minister to press his treasury colleague on recommendation for fundamental review of the tax free childcare system to improve both understanding and uptake her majesty revenue and customs tax free childcare report and survey of find that of people find the name confusing or unclear of these say it prevent they from look into tax free childcare and say it prevent they from sign up to the scheme the institute for fiscal studies say that in the four year after introduce tax free childcare the government spend billion less on the scheme than it have plan in the write evidence we receive from parent they say the tax free childcare system be confusing and onerous to use and complicated to calculate childminder tell we not enough parent know about tax free childcare especially not the self employ many parent also find it difficult to set up the payment my big disappointment with the announcement make at the budget be that the tax free childcare system be not touch yet we know that the theoretical benefit of this policy be not reach very substantial proportion of the parent it be design to help worse in answer to my write parliamentary question we have see that even those who have go to the trouble of register or re register for support through the current cumbersome system only around half actually claim anything from it which do not suggest system that be live up to its promise the select committee make number of other suggestion for support affordability for parent not least our call in recommendation for well support for stay at home parent the last area want to press particularly hard with my colleague on the front bench be the logic of our recommendation on offer fund support to parent in training or study the logic be that elsewhere across education policy the government be go out of their way to encourage people to upskill support lifelong learning and invest in the long term productivity of our country by ensure people be well skilled it be therefore counterproductive to disincentivise parent from pursue high qualification by make hour of childcare available only to work family on particular income and explicitly not to those in study the recent report by the all party parliamentary group for student on the cost of living and its impact on student highlight the severe challenge face parent in study address that as part of our recommendation would make massive difference to that group of parent support the workforce expand family hub not just in some area but across the whole country expand the early year pupil premium and invest in early intervention and training to identify and meet special educational need be among the other key recommendation of our report could speak passionately in favour of every single one of our key recommendation and when the select committee meet tomorrow look forward to the detailed consideration of the government response but know many other member want to speak in the debate end by commend the whole report of my committee to my hon friend the minister have serve in the government appreciate that he may not be able to accept every one of our recommendation straight away but hope he will recognise the weight of evidence that sit behind they the incredible importance of get policy in this area right and the immense value of continue to invest in our child our prime minister have describe education as the close thing we have to silver bullet for improve productivity welcome his commitment to make education the main funding priority in every spending review early year education need to be at the forefront of that have work with my hon friend the minister over number of year know how passionate he be about evidence base policy to improve life chance for child close the attainment gap and tackle disadvantage there can be no great impact on each of those than invest effectively in early year be hugely grateful to colleague from across the house who have support the debate and be delighted that we have maiden speech to look forward to from one of the house new member commend this report and debate to my hon friend the minister remind member that this be maiden speech and there will be no interruption thank the hon member for worcester mr walker for secure this important debate on support for childcare and the early year in my constituency of selby and ainsty enormous challenge exist for child who have additional need and who sit at that critical juncture between the early year and key stage one reason for that be the failure to build special educational need and disability school for the selby area of my constituency despite department for education funding have be allocate since that force parent to make an impossible choice they can place their child in mainstream school that do not suit their need educate they at home with little support or have they travel for hour day to attend school in harrogate or scarborough this outrageous situation can not continue and as selby and ainsty member of parliament will fight tirelessly for spade in the ground to provide the send school those child so desperately need if you will permit mr speaker would like in my maiden speech to tell hon member about my beautiful constituency of selby and ainsty but before do so too condemn the barbaric attack by hamas terrorist on israel last week and send my profound condolence and personal solidarity to all innocent civilian catch in the terrible violence that have engulf israel and palestine would also like to take moment to welcome another new member to their place my hon friend the member for rutherglen and hamilton west michael shanks he be person of integrity and intelligence who greatly look forward to work alongside as we learn to navigate this formidable place together and show our constituent the difference that hard work labour mp can make people in my constituency of selby and ainsty represent the good of yorkshire they be community orientated but personally resilient hopeful and proud but grounded and pragmatic willing to give people fair hearing but never afraid to speak truth to power it be that independent minded outlook that believe explain the most exciting political moment in our area past because be not the first by election candidate to cause national upset in our part of the world back in selby resident much like their modern compatriot have suffer through over year of conservative government britain languish under the rule of an unelected prime minister arthur balfour too weak to govern and too lacking in authority to lead broken tory party divide unsurprisingly by britain trading relationship with the outside world the resident of selby look at this tory melodrama and say enough use by election to send liberal joseph andrews to represent they be proud mr speaker that some year later local people in selby have not lose the defiant spirit of their forebear this time vote labour for bright future for their community in modern time the selby constituency have mirror the national picture remain labour from to before be tory hold from to now would like to take moment to talk about my predecessor my immediate predecessor be nigel adams who have the privilege of represent the seat where he be raise and educate mr adams deserve credit for his support for local charity such as selby hands of hope and his work to secure funding for tadcaster flood alleviation scheme in his maiden speech he say that there be no great honour privilege or report june vol than represent selby and ainsty echo those sentiment and thank he for his contribution now turn to mr john grogan who begin the tradition of labour mps represent the selby area john and both fight our first election in selby as young man myself at and john at though be pleased to say that have little more luck on my first attempt can only hope that the similarity continue as john achievement for our area be phenomenal he secure the selby bypass oversee the creation of modern flood defence and achieve funding for selby war memorial hospital pillar of our community upon which so many continue to rely john

thank you be now put four minute limit on speech warmly welcome the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather to his place be sure that he be go to be an absolute asset to his area not many people may know that although be member of parliament in cornwall be bear and raise in north yorkshire therefore wonder why none of the child in his constituency want to go to school in scarborough because think it be fabulous place to go to school understand his campaign however and admire his confidence and desire to stop old people and young people be pit against each other he make feel incredibly old because leave scarborough to move south before he be even bear and have think that would live my whole life there genuinely welcome he to his place thank my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker for secure this debate and also thank the whole of the education committee this be truly important debate and agree with most of his recommendation today this government have make stride in improve the quality of childcare as parent with young child at home she be nine now it be not that long ago that also take an interest in these matter it be important for all work parent and all parent who need to go into training to improve their life that we take this sector very seriously and see what we can do to make thing well during the spring budget statement be incredibly proud to sit on these green benches as part of government who be support childcare and early year put they at the heart of their long term economic strategy it be something that have long campaign for with the chancellor pledge to double the government support from billion to billion by there be no doubt that we be serious about get to grip with this issue feel that can hold my head up high at my daughter school gate in the knowledge that work parent in truro and falmouth will save on average up to year on their childcare bill this really matter to all the people in my constituency it be never go to be straightforward to expand on that scale in what be predominantly private sector lead service that be why also appreciate the pragmatic step that the government be take to ensure the deliverability of promise and to try to take the sector with they the necessary change be make to the staff to child ratio which can be controversial be actually bring they in line with those in scotland and other country believe that give childcare provider the freedom necessary to deliver hour of free childcare in the short term while know that perhaps we need long term solution that be combine with the government work to encourage people back into the childcare sector be excite by that expansion which will have positive effect on the people of truro and falmouth be go to skip quite lot of my speech because we be run out of time want to add to what the chair of the select committee have say perhaps this issue will be for another day but have campaign on it before have further ambition for the sector eventually would like early year educator to be give the same pay status and training as primary school teacher it be my belief that the work do with under five be every bit as important as if not more important than what primary school teacher do there would be cost and an upheaval to the sector to bring that into reality but it be important it would help to solve some of the issue with the grow send sector when thing be little more calm would like real thought to be put into bring early year educator in line with primary school teacher particularly in training but also in their all important career status warmly welcome this debate there may well be few speaker from northern ireland today which illustrate the fact that there be real crisis in northern ireland where we be be leave behind the government talk lot about so call super parity measure in northern ireland but this be an example of super disparity that urgently need to be address we do not have devolved assembly functioning in northern ireland that be an ongoing crisis but this be crisis for household and family and it need to be address urgently by someone with government authority of some kind parent be really struggle with childcare cost in many case they be great than their mortgage cost which we know be challenging that put into context the sheer scale of the problem that family face childcare be vital infrastructure both social and economic it be form of early intervention early education an anti poverty measure and means to improve economic activity long term productivity and gender equality the government have rightly address those thing but we need an affordable and high quality childcare policy we have concern about the free hour scheme that be in place in england we do not feel that it be appropriate it be certainly not the measure we want in northern ireland last week my party publish paper on childcare and what we could do differently in our region we have listen to expert evidence some of which be reflect in the select committee report and recommendation that the free hour approach fail child in low income household distort the market for childcare create issue in the sustainability of supply and centre on parental employment rather than on the child we need to do thing differently around universal benefit which will help to stabilise and enhance the sector and provision the sustainability of the sector be an important factor we should not be in denial about the fact that lot of labour from other part of the world include the european union be vital in sustain the childcare sector that be also pressure point under the new dispensation this be key investment that we want to make in our future and one that the government have to make preferably through restore assembly in the absence of that call on the uk government to intervene because the parent and child of northern ireland can not wait any long for properly resource childcare scheme congratulate my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker on secure this important debate at the outset should declare that two of my three child be below school age we be very lucky that we have find an exceptional childminder and superb pre school that my two son enjoy every day of the school week however from talk to many mum and dad around my constituency know it be not always easy to find the right childminder nursery pre school or whichever set they want and be right for their child when they do find it it be even more difficult to pay for it and to meet the high cost of childcare warmly congratulate the government on the massive increase in spending on subsidise childcare that will apply from to child as young as nine month old and when the chancellor announce it welcome it however whenever there be great announcement such as that there need to be significant scrutiny of the detail we need to iron out any of the gremlin that might be in there in the limited time we have want principally to outline two point through the lens of wonderful childcare setting in my constituency big top nursery in the village of waddesdon which visit early this year the first point relate to the funding rate that we have as of this academic year would really appreciate it if the minister could meet at some point to go through the detail far however inform the house that on the current rate the government will pay compare with what it cost big top nursery to provide childcare it be currently lose an hour on three year old which equate to day for child who go to big top for hour week which be standard placement for that setting the nursery be make loss of per week which across those hour week child add up to loss of every single year that amount of money be not sustainable if that private nursery be go to remain in business and provide the excellent childcare that it do in the long term either we need to find way to ensure that nursery can charge top up with the free hour as they be badge actually rebadge as subsidised childcare not create the expectation that everything be free welcome though the funding be or there need to be another model that recognise that such gap exist across thousand of setting across the country the other point wish to mention very briefly be the way ofsted treat pre school and childcare setting big top nursery be subject to report from ofsted that it deem deeply unfair question to staff be so unclear that staff have to ask the meaning of they and the inspector then give they report that be not fitting for the setting which have parent up in arm my challenge to the minister be to find way to fix that when every single parent want the setting to remain open and to be where their child go as yet there be no mechanism for parent to feed into such process congratulate my hon friend the member for selby and ainsty keir mather on full political speech deliver with real energy style and passion though could have do without the age joke sit on the last childcare bill committee seven year ago and warn then that the plan would not fly because of lack of investment we have just hear an example of that from the hon member for buckingham greg smith the minister all those year ago say that the market would create itself it do not and cost remain high while the number of place available be restrict the spring budget be an opportunity to get that right and welcome the announcement of funding package as well as the extension of the subsidise hour entitlement it be step towards help parent and provider with affordability and sustainability concern but this investment be too long overdue and more will be need to address the structural problem in the early childhood education and care system if the funding increase be to be implement effectively year and year of underfunde early year entitlement have leave provider unable to invest in development and strain to survive child and family in my constituency and across the country deserve equal opportunity to thrive and fulfil their potential the new clause move all those year ago in that bill committee be still relevant today but they be not on the statute book one would have mandate the government to ensure that all three and four year old have access to high quality flexible and accessible early education and childcare provision deliver by well qualified confident and experienced practitioner and lead by an early year graduate sadly that do not happen childcare setting in disadvantaged area be the least likely to be of high quality which be why argue during that bill committee for the government to have the power and the responsibility to ensure that all our child be care for and teach by highly qualified professional instead we have situation in which nursery be unable to pay the wage need to attract early year teacher because of the chronic underfunding of the free education entitlement by the government at the same time university be withdraw their early year teacher training course because they can not attract applicant it be widely recognise that effective early intervention and support be vital to improve the outcome for child with special educational need and disability such child have the same aspiration for the future as other child but they face more barrier across education health and care we need to know that these child need be be meet and not miss despite their failure and initiative the government still lack the ambition necessary to focus on those child whose life chance be be blight from their early year in order to close the attainment gap last week be delighted to hear my hon friend the member for houghton and sunderland south bridget phillipson set out labour plan for the ambitious reform of childcare with taskforce chair by sir david bell labour early year plan will ensure that we have childcare sector that work for family child and the economy and that high standard be not just for those family who can afford they the chief executive of the london early years foundation respond to the policy say as child from disadvantaged background struggle to find access to quality nursery education thereby increase the attainment gap even far we welcome labour new ambitious review to fix what be currently broken childcare system the tory government have break the childcare system from ax huge number of sure start centre to misunderstand how they would deliver the promise provision seven year ago there be no plan then and there be none now it be time for they to move on join in the praise of my hon friend the member for worcester mr walker and his committee comprehensive report we have to year worth of evidence about the benefit of early intervention and improve the first day of child life the report add to that evidence base all too often we have debate focus on get mum and dad back into work when actually the early year should always be about family we should never forget that for some child good early year care be able to go to nursery be lifeline it be chance to escape violent home to learn to have some routine and to eat regularly have quite chaotic home life myself and know all too well how that can affect people the report focus on the quality of early year and childhood care be imperative as be the focus on make sure that parent have parental choice which be something we should all strive to achieve on parent let we be honest we love our kid but they be hard graft this morning say to my daughter that she need to drink her water like mummy and she look square in the eye and say but do want to be like you then my baby throw her weetabix at and snotte down my top and that be before come to this mad place to deal with thousand of email parent be quite literally on the edge because have little child be hard work but add in mortgage level childcare cost the daily juggle thing go wrong my mother in law have break both her ankle and find childcare and it all add up to quite lot of pressure the transition to parenthood be excruciatingly tough on relationship we should not forget that it be one of the few life stage in which relationship be likely to break down cause family breakdown do comprehensive report with onward which give evidence to the select committee and in our recommendation we focus on family and talk about reduce complexity as there be currently eight childcare scheme front load child benefit share parental leave subsidise support in training and really focus on the whole family existence and what we know about the weird and wonderful life of family one of my girlfriend who be currently in the trench with new baby send an article about the south korean government who be basically subsidise mortgage rate people get low mortgage rate if they have child because they be try to deal with their low birth rate government all around the world be try to think creatively for the first time we have government in which the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer have put the early year at the heart of growth agenda take issue with the remark of the hon member for stockton north alex cunningham the labour party do not have plan it talk about have review and about talk bit more put it to opposition members that they have in the committee work review and all the detail we give the workforce the most precious thing in our life yet they feel undervalued and underpaid there be litany of recommendation in the report look forward to the minister comment on the recruitment campaign we must stop call the hour free they need to be fund or subsidise the early year premium for example be per annum and for primary school we need to see tax change on business rate and vat could go on and on madam deputy speaker but will not congratulate the hon member for worcester mr walker on secure the debate and the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather on an excellent maiden speech it remind that my maiden speech as member of the legislative assembly some year ago be on childcare hope that he be slightly more successful than in achieve his political aim member across the chamber have make excellent point about the chronic failure to think big on the issue of childcare and about the series of minor intervention to tinker with sector that be struggle under the weight of complex funding stream such intervention have increase demand on the sector as various promise of free hour be make without any meaningful work on the supply side and so do not add up to any sort of solution as we have hear the uk have the high childcare cost in the oecd northern ireland be fall even far behind because as my colleague the hon member for north down stephen farry say successive executive have fail to take sufficient interest in the issue the crisis be not new as say address it as an mla back in and subsequently establish an all party group which have drive quite substantial policy change and idea however when government be down more than it be up implement those thing be difficult there have be quite bit of progress in people understanding of the issue and credit northern ireland group such as employers for childcare and melted parents ni as well as the federation of small businesses with correctly frame the issue as one of gender equality in the workplace of outcome for child and fundamentally of economic the issue be crucial in tackle northern ireland chronically low productivity and high level of economic inactivity in january my social democratic and labour party colleague in the assembly set out plan for two stage rescue plan to address the acute cost of living pressure that family face include gargantuan and grow childcare bill which as member have say dwarf housing and other cost and to address the recruitment and retention crisis that the sector face we also have long term strategy that would borrow from successful and usually social democratic economy around the world we note at that time the invert pyramid of funding that mean that time more be spend on post primary education than on early year education despite all that we know about the impact of child first day nobody be pretend that this be simple issue but the necessary fix for childcare start from the principle that it be common good yes have child may be meaningful in our life think back to be ask by an indignant morning radio presenter whether this be not just chronic self interest on my part because have big childcare bill but fix childcare start with an acceptance that as well as be meaningful experience parenting be necessary for the replenishment of the human race and the workforce of the future so provide for childcare be matter for we all it start from the knowledge that more equal society do well that mean afford everyone an equal opportunity to thrive in the workplace and understand that give child well and more equal start in life be good for the public purse and for society throughout their lifetime thank the chairman of the select committee for open the debate also add my congratulation to the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather who give an absolutely tremendous speech full of patriotism and love of community which be just what we need to hear from the labour party he be already an asset to this place so welcome he and look forward to the contribution that he will make it be very good thing that the government be commit such significant amount of money to the early year normally do not want to boast about government spending as if it be sort of proxy for good work on its own in this case however double the contribution that be be make from billion to billion be tremendous demonstration of the government belief in early year and family policy so welcome it echo the point make by my hon friend the member for stroud siobhan baillie about the importance of the birth rate and fertility which be great challenge face country around the world and something that our country will have to grapple with with that in mind it be very important that we do put money into family my anxiety though be about the method of implementation and the effect on pre school we be talk about institution that deliver perhaps hour of education and childcare per week increase the funded hour effectively make the state the sole buyer of those place at pre school effectively we be nationalise these school and make they client of the government that might be okay there be nothing wrong with that in principle except for the fact that the government be traditionally not very good at set price if as we see in wiltshire the price that be set be way below the actual amount of money that it cost to run the pre school then we have problem we be distort the market to the point of destruction be very concerned about the effect of that on pre school nursery be able to do well they run throughout the year and be able to cross subsidise and to charge for private place be afraid the effect might well be that we be drive parent into nursery provision which be often of low quality and out of the pre school sector receive letter from little dragons pre school in devizes which go to see the other day it say that the current direction of government policy be towards the state fund impersonal supervision of child by profit motivate business from the age of two be not say that be the case for all nursery but it be concern just want to make simple suggestion probably an oversimplistic one to the minister we massively over complicate the provision of childcare and the way that funding work to the great distress of family and of course these provider we be now put billion year into early year that be per family why do we not just give that money by some mean or another directly to family to use as they see fit in the very early year up to the age of two think that could be in the form of cash direct entitlement to parent to spend as they see fit whether in formal or informal setting for three and four year old there could be voucher system redeemable at any register institution and it should be allow to be top up it be wrong that there should be complete monopoly of state funding in these institution why can charity like little dragons not charge bit extra if it need to of course it will also provide free place to child of family who could not afford any additional fee these school should be allow to work that out themselves with their community of course there be also quite significant universal credit childcare entitlement that should enable people to support that cost think we can be more imaginative more flexible and more respectful of the choice that parent themselves want to make both for the sake of their own family finance and the way they want to live their life but also in order to sustain healthy and vibrant early year sector thank the hon member for worcester mr walker for secure this important debate and welcome my hon friend the member for selby and ainsty keir mather to his place commend he for his outstanding maiden speech he have make his constituent very proud tonight throughout this cost of living crisis countless nursery in my constituency of coventry north west have struggle to keep up with ever rise price at georgie porgie pre school katie the director fight to keep her nursery open after her utility bill triple she be lucky and be able to save her business but countless other nursery across the country have be force to close we need only look in the face of the nursery worker who have lose their job and their security to see that our current system be fail the inadequate level of state funding offer per child leave nursery to struggle with insufficient fund and inadequate support the system fail not only our nursery but the parent and carer who use they closing nursery mean less space for their child pack waiting list and long morning commute but financially struggle nursery almost always mean rise in fee it be not surprising that britain now have the third most expensive childcare system in the world with more than one in five household spend more than half their income on it for woman who wish to return to work soon after the birth of child those cost crush their aspiration three in four mother say that childcare fee be so significant financially that their good option be to stop work altogether know from speak to many family on the doorstep that this be an issue that many of they raise with our system hinder the opportunity and ultimately the freedom of woman who wish to return to work and we can not continue to allow that to happen strongly support my hon friend the member for washington and sunderland west mrs hodgson in her plan for an extensive review of the system believe that any reform we implement must move we close to the example of country such as finland or estonia where there be well fund expand system of care as the shadow secretary of state have suggest that should involve empower local council to deliver their own childcare fill the gap in provision but it should also include more substantial grant offer to nursery which could stabilise the industry while also potentially adopt finnish style tiere system where each family fee be far more closely link to their income while welcome the government plan to expand childcare provision to child as young as nine month old those change be simply not enough to tackle the challenge in our system if we seriously wish to give our business and parent system that work we have to go for far more substantial reform stick plaster solution just will not work urge this house not to turn blind eye to our childcare system but to press ahead with the meaningful long term change that this country desperately need will call jim shannon but do need he to sit down at pm so that can bring in the front bench speaker thank you very much madam deputy speaker it be pleasure to speak in this debate and congratulate the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather on his excellent speech two woman in my life have make big difference the first be sandra my wife who have be marry to for year she bring up our three son she look after they she rear they and she be the person who can take the credit not only that but she be now grandmother and look after our six grandchild with stint at in the morning and numerous stint in the afternoon mention that because that be the difficulty with childcare and early year without my wife assistance my boy and their wife could not afford to go to work what be easily afford year ago be not afford the same way today particularly when parent be work beyond year of age think it be important in my contribution to this debate to say that we can not talk about support for early year and child without highlight the government determination not to raise child benefit threshold since from to now the average increase in the uk consumer price index have be how can any mother and father afford childcare and early year care they quite simply can not if the boss give they an extra on their wage that do not help because it put they over the threshold and they do not get the benefit want to put that case on the record with that increase in cpi family who pay per week for hour of childcare in would now pay per week that be massive for any mum and dad with family to rear there be no way they can do that and if they earn more than they do not get tax credit to help they these be people in ordinary job try their good to make their mortgage payment heat their home and educate their child and they be not get one penny from the government in child benefit that be why an uplift of that threshold be so important will quickly give the house the example of the second woman want to mention not the second woman in my life my parliamentary aide who write all my speech she leave work collect her child from the childminder help they with their homework prepare their meal get their lunch ready and make sure they be healthy as they be not allow any unhealthy food until friday which mean peel carrot make fruit salad and cub cheese she do the housework include the washing and put her child to bed make sure to spend at least minute read with they the point be make be that the pressure on her day be phenomenal finish with this point we must do something now before generation of family be submerge in debt and stress and can not recover they need help with childcare help with finance and help to manage expectation message must be send to working family as well as to single parent family we see you and we will support you that be what this debate be about congratulate the chair of the select committee the hon member for worcester mr walker on secure this important debate today and on the committee excellent report on support for childcare in the early year be grateful to all hon member who have speak in the debate and particularly congratulate my new hon friend the member for selby and ainsty keir mather on truly outstanding maiden speech he have show what brilliant champion he will be for his constituent on the local national and international issue that shape their life we be so glad to have he with we in this place do not have time to mention specifically all the other contribution but we have hear from hon member across the house about the eyewatering childcare cost that family face we have hear about the deficit in government funding for the so call free hour we have hear about the recruitment and retention problem face by early year provider and about sector that be under unbearable pressure child early year be crucial to their development and life chance many of the factor that contribute to the education attainment gap be already present by the time child start school early year education and childcare should be focus on ensure that family have the early support they need to give their child the good start in life and education while also deliver affordable childcare to enable parent to work the current hour base model for childcare funding be fundamentally not work for provider or for family for family it be inaccessible and complex and do not reflect the reality of their life and work pattern nor do it deliver affordability at the same time provider be force to close their door last year due to rise cost the current model be not work for they either parent have see rise cost year on year and grow childcare desert where they can not access the childcare they need there be now two child for every ofsted register childcare place in england create barrier to parent particularly woman take on employment we be see woman leave the workforce for the first time in decade price out by the cost of childcare it be parent of child with special educational need and disability who find it hard of all to find childcare place the government have deliver triple whammy the most expensive childcare in europe an unviable financial model for provider and significant childcare desert it be colossal failure for both family and the skilled professional who work in early year the policy that the government have introduce in response to the crisis after year of failure and only because of intense pressure after the chancellor speak year ago about the need to expand the labour market but mention the role of childcare only once will not fix the problem additional funding be welcome but pump it into system that be already break will not deliver the change family need childcare provider be clear that as thing stand they can not deliver the expand entitlement survey of provider by the early years alliance find that only of provider who currently offer place to two year old plan to deliver additional place under the expand entitlement another say that they be unsure whether they would deliver place under the new scheme that be because the government have no plan for expand the workforce to deliver an expand entitlement in sector already struggle to recruit and retain staff no plan for premise for which there be rightly strict requirement in the early year sector and no vision for quality in the early year childcare must be about more than just mind child while their parent work it should be able to provide every child with high quality early year education labour government will be drive by our mission to break down the barrier to opportunity at every stage include by boost child development with more child hit the early learn goal by labour be determined that childcare should offer more flexibility well availability and high standard for child and family we will draw on the good practice internationally to drive an ambitious and coherent programme of reform with high standard for early education well availability strong regulation of the financial sustainability of provider and clear strategy for the childcare workforce we have commission former ofsted chief inspector sir david bell to undertake full review of the early year sector and help to develop the detail of our early year plan labour government will work with the early year sector to build capacity include by remove the legislative barrier to local authority open new provision we will also work with the sector to ensure that there be plan for the early year workforce that offer more opportunity through high quality training and recognition for the skilled work of early year practitioner we will also recognise that childcare do not end when child

old until they start school as hon member know that will be roll out in stage from april eligible parent of two year old will be able to access free hour from september eligible parent of child age nine month and upwards will be able to do likewise the full hour entitlement will come in from september we be all go to welcome additional funding within childcare and the expansion of service but surely we need very clear workforce plan if we be actually go to deliver all this be grateful to the hon member because be about to come on to workforce however just before do so alongside this we want to increase the supply of wrap around care to enable family to work more or flexible hour we be invest million in start up funding to provide local authority with funding to set up wrap around provision from am to pm in their area more broadly local authority be critical to deliver this expansion of childcare and we be work closely with they to understand the challenge they face and ensure they have sufficient place to meet parental demand we will shortly be appoint contractor to support they in that work there have be some key theme in this debate begin with funding rate by we expect to be spend more than billion every year on childcare we have already increase the funding pay to nursery for the exist entitlement by million this year rise to million next year that mean that the national average rate for three and four year old have go up to an hour and for two year old it have go up to an hour from an increase of third those rate be inform by survey of more than provider that we carry out in order to understand the funding pressure they face that say be very happy to meet both my hon friend the member for buckingham greg smith who raise issue in his constituency there have be increase for provider there and my hon friend the member for devizes danny kruger where there have be increase be happy to continue that discussion on quality and flexibility question it be worth first note that we have some of the high quality childcare in the world with of early year setting rat good or outstanding however we be work with the sector to increase flexibility and remove unnecessary burden in september as my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth cherilyn mackrory touch on we change the ratio for two year old we be push landlord to be more flexible and to allow childminder to operate on their premise and we will shortly announce our response to the recent consultation with the sector about the early year foundation stage where we be hop to make series of change to help practitioner more easily do their job while maintain high standard deliver expansion be go to require significant boost to the workforce so it be key that we be able to encourage more people into this sector to raise its status as my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth touch on in the new year we will launch big recruitment campaign to encourage people to consider work in nursery school or as childminder we be expand the early year professional development programme nearly people be already undertake apprenticeship in this sector but we be look at accelerate apprenticeship and degree apprenticeship and will also be run early year skill bootcamp from next year to try to get more people into the sector start up grant scheme for childminder which will provide for those register with ofsted and for those register with childminder agency will also be start shortly very briefly will touch on some other point make by the chair of the select committee our funding rate do take business rate cost into account and in the autumn statement the government announce freeze to the business rate multiplier tax cut worth billion over five year small business rate relief exist as do relief for charity but be happy to look at the extreme case that my hon friend set out he be right to flag the issue of tax free childcare which can save parent up to per year on the cost of childcare or up to for child with disability we be try to drive up the take up of that through our childcare choices website as for people in education and training big part of this offer be to try to encourage people into work student be eligible for the universal hour for three and four year old and for the free hour if they meet the income criterion and there be also the childcare grant and the parent learn allowance however have hear the point that my hon friend have make think have cover most of the point that people have make number of member from northern ireland have speak obviously this issue be devolve in northern ireland but will just say that next week be chair meeting of the british irish council on the topic of childcare be sure we be go to discuss childcare in both northern ireland and the republic think have cover most of labour commentary would be lot more amenable to criticism from the labour party if it have any policy whatsoever in this area as it do not and all it have do be commission taskforce to tell it what to think will close the debate there question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider support for childcare and the early year protection of dark skies motion make and question propose that this house do now largan rise to speak as the member of parliament for north norfolk constituency bless with huge sky and one of the few place in england where one can see on occasion the northern light such be the significance of my constituency that we have two internationally recognise dark sky discovery site kelling heath holiday park and wiveton down the north norfolk coast be classify as have one of the dark sky in the uk with some area as dark as those in the forest of galloway or exmoor national park which be two internationally recognise dark sky that we all know well we celebrate our dark sky in norfolk and wish to take moment to highlight the fantastic work of the norfolk coast partnership its dark sky festival open up the secret of our night time wildlife and raise awareness of the impact of light pollution should also pay tribute to the former co chair of the all party group on dark sky my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith who be passionate campaigner also want to welcome david smith and shreoshi das from buglife who be in the gallery be proudly wear the emblem pin badge this evening and they have help prepare for this debate they have travel huge way from somerset and scotland to be here to champion the importance of invertebrate nature and our dark sky rise to speak also as the glow worm specie champion that be one of the lesser know fact despite its name here be slight lesson it be actually beetle belong to the firefly family not just the glow worm but many creature along with our dark sky be under threat from light pollution which have so far receive very little action to curb its ever increase expansion into our nocturnal world commend the hon gentleman for bring this subject forward he have talk about light intrusion be bless to live in coastal area and also on family farm so know perhaps more than most what true darkness be like however like many mp have recently have to instal security lighting which certainly have an impact on the animal and bird put they on alert and disturb their sleep do he agree that although we need protection from the darkness to address security concern there be still need to protect our ecosystem and that this must be more widely know and circulate tonight he be ensure just that thank the hon gentleman for intervene on it would not be an adjournment debate without that intervention of course he be absolutely right in what he say and this debate be all about highlight some of the impact on and damage to our nocturnal creature be they mammal or insect later in the debate member will hear about some practical step we want to take to try to achieve an improvement through something so simple light pollution can literally be heal with the turning off of light and there be not many pollution for which we can do that large number of northern ireland members be present tonight ask members please not to let anyone make joke about we be unenlightened for many year there be stunning murmuration of starling in south belfast it be quite something to be see from albert bridge which use to cross every evening as walk home to woodstock road they use to come from across the city and beyond but after some planning change we notice that they have all but disappear apparently because of change in lighting along with other have work with the authority and we be able to make few relatively minor change involve blinker on some light and filter on street light since then we have see the return of some of the starling do the hon gentleman agree that understand the issue and perhaps minor planning change will constitute big part of protect nature the hon lady be absolutely right later in my speech will come to some of the practical measure that be be take by planning authority many be lead the way in be able to put together sensitive way of deal with light pollution and in or minute member will be able to hear about some of those thing that be be do by authority around the country darkness be not only essential to the health and wellbeing of people it be equally important to wildlife huge variety of animal need darkness for feeding for migration or even simply to rest shall say more about that shortly as human we need sleep to recharge and maintain good physical and mental health and so do animal we be probably all aware of the effect of bad night sleep on the rest of our day and after several day without sleep the symptom worsen the same effect be see in our wildlife and they be exacerbate by the increase in light pollution early this year group of international scientist estimate that light pollution be increase globally by approximately every year and have be do so for at least the past year that be an incredible rise in pollutant that have go pretty much unchecked despite concern be raise since the by astronomer whose ability to glimpse the outer reach of our solar system have become obscure more recently environmentalist try to protect nocturnal specie such as invertebrate and bat have be point to light as major issue in the pressure on ecology light pollution as define by the convention on the conservation of migratory specie of wild animal refer to artificial light that alter the natural pattern of light and dark in ecosystem artificial light be of course very useful allow we to recreate some semblance of daylight during the hour of darkness it create sense of safety as we travel and allow work to continue long after sunset as with everything however too much light and in particular too much poor use of light be become block to our ability to meet commitment to save energy reduce cost and rescue biodiversity the solution be relatively simple unlike those involve other pollutant once we remove light the pollutant be go there be no lengthy clean up operation the result be immediate and positive change can happen literally overnight our dark sky be under threat we long ago lose the ability to see the milky way with the naked eye from where the majority of we live in the uk this marvel of the edge of our galaxy greet stargazer on every clear night for generation stretch across the sky but unfortunately sky glow cause by light pointing and reflect into the atmosphere have restrict that vision to handful of place in the country we have become so accustomed to not see the milky way that many assume it be restrict to professional astronomer which think everyone would agree be real shame the commission for dark skies set up by the british astronomical association in have be warn of this loss of star and campaign to raise awareness and secure well lighting to bring back the view that be still out there cpre the countryside charity run an annual star count ask citizen scientist to count the star in the constellation orion this year it discover that only one in participant have clear view of our starry sky however it be not just amateur astronomer who be suffer early this year the royal astronomical society publish research show that three quarter of major global observatory be affect by light pollution this impact be limit scientific productivity and reduce the useful lifetime of those incredibly advanced observatory astronomer be not the only one who be hamper by light pollution there be now substantial body of evidence that show that artificial light impact on live thing it be alter behaviour it be change the physical development of specie and in some case it be cause death when we consider how the natural world have evolve on series of dark and light cycle it be not surprising that nature suffer when we alter those cycle by extend daylight and remove darkness whereas human be quick to adapt and use technology to great effect animal and plant be not so quick to respond to rapid rise in artificial light they simply can not keep pace the majority of animal be active either entirely or partially at night yet our focus be almost always direct to the daytime specie it be important not to forget the thing we do not often see invertebrate for instance appear to be disproport ionately affect by light pollution as we all know our small creature be vital to balanced ecosystem carry out important service such as pollination pest control create soil and filtering water unfortunately they be suffer significant decline from range of source and we must now do what we can to relieve the burden we be place on they seminal paper from researcher in the uk find that local population of moth caterpillar be reduce by due to exposure to streetlight german researcher have estimate that third of all insect attract to light die as consequence either through collision increase predation or simply exhaustion we see insect out of sync with their natural cycle emerge too early from their hibernation or larval stage and miss the flowering of food plant we see evidence that pollination rate be reduce in area expose to artificial light nocturnal pollinator be vital for pollinate crop fruit and flower study by researcher at the university of sussex suggest that nocturnal pollinator be in fact more efficient than their daytime counterpart those be concern statistic my own specie the common glow worm require darkness to carry out its action the flightless female glow magnificent yellowy green which attract the small male to mate they live for only short window of time as an adult and they must lay their egg quickly without the dark canvas on which to perform the male can not find the female and thus the chance of future generation pass by glow worm larvae be ferocious predator and feast on snail and slug help to keep population under control unfortunately we be lose these charismatic creature from our countryside in the same way that we be lose the star mp get to do some pretty fun thing from time to time and the most memorable occasion for be back in the summer at the beginning of july when be fortunate to visit sheringham park in my constituency run around the track on the park run and hour later be scuttle through the undergrowth on the same track to find glow worm be join by representative from buglife who be here this evening by the uk glow worm survey and by the national trust to see these creature in action genuinely the glow cause by chemical reaction in the glow worm body be one of the most fascinating thing have ever witness it be almost other worldly and would encourage everyone to go and see it next summer if they be fortunate enough to have glow worm in their constituency it be fascinating the first time see it it look like an led glow in the dark do not think will ever forget it when the male be attract to the female glow we turn on red torch and almost immediately the male turn away from its female and go over to the new light it be shocking to see just how pronounce the change be in that whole set of behaviour it be no wonder that glow worm population close to light polluted area be dwindle if that be what light pollution will do to their mating habit glow worm be member of the firefly family as say global red list assessment of that group by the international union for conservation of nature show population under threat while habitat loss chemical use and climate change be all contribute factor light pollution be threat that we can quickly do something about to start to reverse that downward trend it be not just firefly that be threaten by light pollution the iucn have list light pollution as threat to assess specie include bird amphibian and even primate the more that we discover about the impact of light pollution the more we realise its role in nature decline hon member be no doubt familiar with blackbird call in the dead of night shall not sing it now but that be an experience that the beatles share in the open lyric of their song blackbird where do it come from that unusual phenomenon which be coin by the beatles be bird singing through the night due to light pollution bird be be trick into think that it be dawn or dusk under artificial light which make they sing out of turn with the normal day and night cycle what do that do it can act to deplete their energy level it stop their call at optimum time and it prevent they from attract mate light pollution as we be already find out be contribute to the death of million of bird attract by artificial light migrate specie such as shearwater petrel and other sea wad bird become disorient they may end up circle in illuminated area it deplete their energy reserve and put they at risk of exhaustion predation and potentially even fatal collision with building turtle hatchling be orient by the natural light of the moon reflect on the sea surface artificial light be confuse they and pull they into fatal direction away from the safety of the sea close to home bat hedgehog and other mammal avoid light confine they to small and small habitat the effect of light pollution impact not only on animal but on people and we be begin to understand that well the report from the chief medical officer warn that pollutant such as light may be adversely affect our health exposure to too much artificial light be alter our circadian rhythm and be think to be contribute to melatonin suppression lead to diabetes heart disease possibly cancer and range of mental ill health issue will not speak on those matter in any great depth but member of the science and technology committee in the other place recently publish report on that and it be well worth look at we have talk about issue relate to human what have happen to our star gaze and the impact on nature but what be the solution how do we solve this problem with so many impact on the natural world the answer which often in this place be so difficult to come by be actually relatively simple but they require leadership and understanding while we can solve light pollution with flick of the switch campaigner be not call for we to be plunge back into darkness instead this be all about use light well we must promote well quality community friendly lighting and we must not artificially light environmentally sensitive location we can reduce our level of light pollution by lower the brightness of our light direct light only to place that we need they and ensure that unnecessary light be not on when we be not use they every simple measure such as shut curtain and blind when we turn on internal light will keep the light where it need to be and prevent it from spill into our garden and wild place local council be responsible for planning and believe that they should have good planning guideline to be mindful of light pollution know that many parish council for instance weybourne blakeney and cley in my area of north norfolk really care about this they have campaign for it to be take seriously even provide their own dark sky policy the person who hit that home for be lyndon swift the former dynamo of weybourne where he be chair of the parish council he be passionate about protect dark sky and remember he talk to about it couple of year ago he be probably one of the inspiration for to be stand here this evening nationally there be lot of good news the good lighting technical advice note for cumbria stem from the dark skies cumbria project lead by the friends of the lake district and produce by dark source and the south downs national park dark skies technical advice note be guidance document that be lead the way they should be utilise more widely across the country there be evidence of more localise action for change but believe that action should be spread across the whole uk to ensure the result be as far reach as possible hope that this debate in one way or another will help my own local council north norfolk district council consider closely how it can implement policy to help with light pollution we must treat light in the same way as we treat other pollutant we need to monitor and set target to reduce light pollution level to one that satisfy our need and those of the planet guidance and encouragement be clearly not enough we need to look at how we can create positive action there be so many gain to be make from do this not least the release of the pressure on nature switch off unnecessary light will save money and energy well quality lighting can improve safety by reduce the contrast and shadow create by poor quality lighting we can restore our view of the night sky and inspire new generation about the science and wonder of space beyond our planet and we can restore the natural canvas for glow worm to perform that magical summer show finally thank the staff at buglife who have help illuminate to the issue and to the wonderful world of glow worm in particular karim vahed and matt shardlow who arrange for my encounter with the specie on that fateful july evening and david smith for help to prepare my speech it be once again real pleasure to speak about such an important topic and to follow such an enlightened speech support by david smith from buglife in prepare for the debate be remind of my little brother who be now many year ago he have glo friend which be sure many of we in this house remember and he be obsess with glow worm he would go down the lane to the river and see many glow worm not worm but part of the firefly family in prepare my speech remind he of his glow worm friend and he say sadly you do see they anymore as my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker state on his website we have see reduction in glow worm such be the urgency of the challenge that he eloquently powerfully and interestingly set out join he in thank david smith and shreoshi das for travel down to be part of the debate hope can reassure my hon friend and the house of the step that we be take to protect nocturnal and crepuscular life and the work that my department be do work with other government departments to reduce artificial light draw the house attention to the environmental improvement plan across its goal it explain the apex target of how we will reduce the decline of nature by and increase nature abundance after we will do that through the fundamental of well quality soil well air quality well water quality and increase habitat it be also important to stress the importance of reduce unnecessary artificial light in the united kingdom we be fortunate that we be able to enjoy the marvel of the night sky my hon friend reference the lake district where live and be very fortunate to be able to experience luminosity level of nigh on zero while we do have some spectacular display of the northern light see as far south as herefordshire we also have some of the good early and large number of designate dark sky area in europe with exmoor national park designate the first sky reserve in europe however in our modern society artificial light play valuable role in provide security as the previous minister responsible for the violence against woman and girl strategy know just how important well light area be to design out crime however an excess of artificial light can as we have hear this evening be very detrimental to both the public and the environment it can also be tremendous waste of energy an extra cost and real source of disturbance and barrier to enjoy the night sky pay regard to my hon friend the member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith one of the co founder of the all party parliamentary group which be work so diligently also thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for his contribution to the debate the evidence base on the impact of artificial light be less advanced than that for other environmental pollutant the technological capability available to we for measure the scope of artificial light remain in development it be an area of concern to the government but we be take significant step as have say we have commit to the halting of the decline of nature by and set out in law the environment act we have also introduce strengthen biodiversity duty on public authority which require they to periodically consider the action that they can take to conserve and enhance biodiversity and then take action furthermore from november ministers will need to have regard to the environmental principle set out in the environment act when bring forward any policy development the hon member for belfast south claire hanna refer to the importance of the department for environment food and rural affairs and all other departments work with each other we be take action to work in particular with the department for levelling up housing and communities we have support internationally agree guideline on light pollution that cover seabird migratory shorebird and marine turtle these have be endorse by the uk and party to the convention on migratory specie in the party adopt resolution on light pollution guideline for migratory wildlife the resolution endorse national light pollution guideline for wildlife include marine turtle seabird and migratory shorebird as develop by australia in the marine environment research be ongoing to measure the impact of artificial light and the threshold at which light exposure cause an impact those threshold will allow for the determination of an indicator for light pollution for the uk marine strategy the eu marine strategy framework directive and at ospar but expert be currently unable to determine what level of light cause an impact this be what we be work hard to achieve pay particular tribute to national highways clearly our road have considerable impact in term of artificial light but national highways be work to reduce light pollution invest in technology that allow road lighting level to be adapt in response to low traffic flow that will help we to well understand where night time accident occur and the impact that road lighting have as contributory factor on more local level light pollution be manage by number of regime in the uk through planning transport and statutory nuisance policy local authority be encourage by the department for transport to upgrade to sensitive led lighting where feasible local authority be also require under the environment act to work with national park authority to conserve and enhance the park natural beauty wildlife and cultural heritage through the collaboration between authority and park we be proud that seven of our protect landscape in england have achieve international dark sky status finally statutory nuisance legislation be amend in to include artificial light as potential nuisance this set out the duty of local authority with regard to artificial light really hope that in the short time have have have give my hon friend the member for north norfolk reassurance that this government take light pollution seriously question put and agree to house adjourn
