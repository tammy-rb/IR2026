thank the minister for her reply and for the excellent work she have do in put together the procurement strategy it have be passion of mine for many year that we do not use procurement just to get extra social value but extra economic value which will help local firm and local growth that be what this statement do and hugely welcome it may ask the minister whether she intend to issue guidance to local authority so that they know how good they can achieve economic value for example they could proactively tell small firm what contract be come up or train they in how to tender which be very difficult for they they could also encourage small firm to break procurement into lot so that they have well chance of bidding finally they could stop require an unreasonable number of year of account to be show before small firm be permit to bid
