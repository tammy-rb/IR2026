by acknowledge the expertise that the hon gentleman bring to the house we be invest in the animal and plant health agency and have commit more than million to the next stage of rebuild our biosecurity facility at weybridge to enhance our ability to understand detect prevent respond to and recover from outbreak that be in addition to support farmer through the animal health and welfare pathway which include veterinary visit to improve livestock health welfare biosecurity and productivity thank the minister for his comment the recent national audit office report be hugely concern and it be clear that the uk be at high risk of and unprepared for major animal disease outbreak post brexit check mean that only of animal be physically check as they come into the uk we know that lot of illegal meat be come in through the port and our farm animal veterinary workforce be overstretch also climate change and antimicrobial resistance be put we at high risk of disease outbreak if disease such as foot

and it be important that we balance our work we have take strong measure to restrict personal import give the threat on the continent as the house will know sadly the epicentre of the uk bluetongue outbreak be in my south norfolk constituency so biosecurity be huge issue for my farmer will we look to lower our biosecurity risk by return to check product at the bastion point inland border security centre at the white cliffs business park which be close to the border point instead of product have to travel nearly mile before they be check thank my hon friend and relatively near neighbour he be right to raise the bluetongue issue which have be deal with effectively by our official his point about border control and check be under close consideration partly as consequence of our new arrangement with the european union many welsh farmer in mid wales depend on be able to move their livestock back and forth over the border with england indeed farm straddle the border the imposition of veterinary hard border between england and wales will be damaging for the farming community in my constituency and the local economy that they support farmer simply can not afford to pay beast for testing and apparently there be not even enough testing capacity for all the livestock that cross the border anyway what step be the minister take to address the situation and to prevent welsh farmer from lose out the hon gentleman be absolutely right to ask that question as just reference the bluetongue issue have be serious and difficult we have make sensible decision for england and the approach we have take have manage to control the spread the decision in wales be obviously matter for the welsh government and be sure that he would understand that respect that decision we be talk about how we can resolve the difficult issue that he have raise be deeply distressed that the government be plan to extend the badger cull because the evidence show that with good testing and biosecurity we can bring down rate of tuberculosis hear what the representative from gatcombe farm say when they visit parliament just couple of week ago will the minister look at the evidence before move forward with badger cull will he look at biosecurity measure that could ensure that we really get on top of bovine tb can assure my hon friend that we be not extend the badger cull we have clear

parliament fully fund and urgent rebuild of apha in weybridge be critical it get no mention at all by the chancellor in the spending review it merely have repeat partial funding from the department when will the government wake up get grip and press on with this vital project as soon as possible before disaster strike the hon gentleman know that take this issue very seriously gently point out to he that this exact situation be point out by the national audit office during the last parliament the previous government have year to get the principle in place so will not take any lesson from the conservatives can tell he that we have million investment this year that be what be ask for can assure he that there will be fund in future because we take biosecurity very seriously chalk streams

fine strawberry and raspberry in leicestershire the hon gentleman be absolutely right to praise our fruit grow sector it have be know for long time that this scheme be come to an end and be afraid the truth be that it do not provide very good value for money we will replace it as part of our new food strategy and announcement on that will be come down the line however be slightly surprised to hear that he be so keen to preserve an eu base scheme who know that there be opposition members still hanker to be in the eu water company fines water restoration fund if he will make it his policy to redistribute fine levy against water company since november to the water restoration fund this labour government have launch the large ever crackdown against poorly behave water company as part of

proceeding on the crime and policing bill which pass through this place this week government members have ample opportunity to accept various new clause and amendment that would ensure strict tackling

to be introduce the new natural history gcse in order to build on the uk unrivalled history and research in this area thank the minister for acknowledge the power of the outdoors should say that have fail to climb many more mountain than ever actually get up many of the lesson learn in the mountain be the reason why be here today the power of the outdoor in build confidence and resilience among young people be enormous be so pleased that young people in rossendale and darwen be right now take part in the duke of edinburgh award scheme that be fantastic for many discover the power of nature can be life change nationally the evidence of the benefit of outdoor recreation be extensive and unarguable yet for too many access to the outdoors remain limited and million people do not live within minute of green and blue space do the secretary of state and the minister agree that key ambition of access legislation must be access for all the government be absolutely committed to extend access which be why we have commit to create nine new national river walk and three national forest the first of which be the western forest which have the pleasure of plant tree in couple of month ago we be also designate wainwright coast to coast walk as national trail my hon friend be right about the duke of edinburgh award scheme which my daughter will be take part in this summer we support the award

be certify to high environmental standard which we believe british producer operate to high standard will be well place to supply both beef and crop farmer in my constituency tell how important it be to produce high quality food and contribute to uk food security can the minister outline what conversation he have have with public body to encourage they to prioritise purchase local british produce and to maximise the social value of uk food production thank my hon friend and relatively near neighbour for her question we be in constant dialogue to achieve exactly that objective she will have notice last week announcement on the extension of free school meal to everyone on universal credit which be key plank of our food strategy it be exactly those kind of initiative that we think will benefit british producer many gb base horticultural company as well as other company want to supply british produce into northern ireland but have difficulty with the bureaucracy and paperwork require by the procedure implement some year ago will the minister operate in concert with his colleague in cabinet and government to eliminate the bureaucratic problem that be prevent those company from

and all across the uk thank my hon friend for her question and understand her concern reassure she that the government will always act in the national interest on these issue thames water must meet its statutory and regulatory obligation to its customer and to the environment it be only right that the company be subject to the same consequence as any other water company the company remain financially stable but we have step up our preparation and stand ready for all eventuality as have say before include special administration regime if that be to become necessary as the secretary of state know my constituency of north herefordshire be very seriously affect by water pollution in the lugg and the wye confess that be disappointed that in both his answer to the hon member for monmouthshire catherine fookes he do not mention agricultural pollution at all that be despite the fact that agriculture be the main source of water pollution in the country as be show in the report of the independent water commission which unfortunately be not allow to look into it in any detail pay tribute to river action which this week win court case force planning authority to consider the cumulative impact of industrial agricultural development and to greenpeace which last week point out the impact of toxic sewage sludge will he confirm whether he be update the farming rule for water

its annual permit tonnage to tonne from the originally approve tonne when planning be approve know the secretary of state be familiar with this as the facility be mere metre from his constituency may ask he whether the environment agency will listen to local resident include his own and to council across sutton merton croydon and kingston and refuse the permit expansion as sufficient incinerator capacity already exist in london as the hon member say do know of this situation because the facility be adjacent to my constituency as well he will know that can not comment on what the environment agency be intend to do because it be its decision none the less certainly agree with he that the ea must listen to constituent and people live in the local area who will be affect by this decision

strasbourg request reset of the european convention on human right to allow national parliaments to remove foreign offender who threaten public safety britain signature be miss in fact we be not even ask to join unfortunately that say everything about the way in which this government be view by other can the solicitor general confirm whether the government will now back that initiative or will they leave it to other to defend the primacy of democratic lawmaking as the lord chancellor make very clear yesterday the uk remain committed to the echr but it be absolutely right that as the

government flagship crime and policing bill will expand police power to conduct more drug test on more suspect upon arrest which will help to direct more drug user into treatment and away from illegal drug use as drug relate death be now at record level particularly because of the increase in synthetic opioid believe that we need to look again at supervise drug consumption facility which be an evidence base intervention that could save life and public spending both the advisory council on the misuse of drugs and the health and social care committee support the idea will the solicitor general consider facilitate legal mechanism here as in scotland under the lord advocate to enable local health and police authority that wish to pilot such facility to establish their efficacy to do so it be absolutely right that we ensure that those who fall into drug addiction be able to access adequate support service and route to rehabilitation as my right hon friend the minister for policing say to the scottish affairs committee recently the government do not have plan to amend the law to permit the introduction of drug consumption facility we be clear however that drug death be avoidable

that people smuggler face the hefty jail term that they deserve my hon friend be absolutely right it be vital that police and prosecutor work together to bring people smuggler to justice and that our criminal justice system send clear message that people smuggling will be meet with hefty jail term be pleased to tell he that an offender who play lead role in an organise crime group that smuggle

with the royal assent act that his majesty have signify his royal assent to the follow act and measures sentence guidelines pre sentence reports act data use and access act uk infrastructure year strategy when this government come to power we be elect on promise to deliver decade of national renewal and from day one we have work to fulfil that promise less than year into the job we have already start to see the result the fast grow economy in the in the first quarter of the year interest rate cut four time and real wage rise more in the first month of our government than they do in the first year under the conservatives however we be under no illusion about the challenge ahead we will be go far and fast to turn the page on year of chaos and mismanagement from the conservative party and to deliver the decade of national renewal that we promise that be the backdrop against which present this strategy to the house today put on record my thank to everyone whose input have help to shape the document include those involve in the review lead when in opposition which result in this strategy and the creation of the national infrastructure and service transformation authority about which will say more shortly infrastructure be key to unlock growth across the country our road railway airport and digital infrastructure connect people to business public service and one another our energy water and housing infrastructure create and support community and our school hospital prison and social infrastructure provide high quality public service and help to keep we safe but good infrastructure mean improve productivity and efficiency in our economy too increase resilience to shock strong public service more job and ultimately high wage for work people from the development of the railway to the olympic game we have proud history in britain of innovate develop and build high quality infrastructure but the reality be that we have now fall behind many of our international competitor too many investor now question our intention and our capability when we say we will build something they will often ask if we will and whether we can that be because for too long the conservatives cut capital investment promise major project one minute then abandon they the next and leave the public estate to crumble for long year from the road we drive on to the school we send our child to they waste money time and effort see decline in productivity and wage and there be stagnant growth and an increase belief that politic can not change thing for the well however with this new labour government we will prove once again that change be possible the spending review last week set out how our government be invest in the renewal of britain allocate an additional billion of capital investment over the course of this parliament with new road and rail project to connect our town and city region that include billion more for the trans pennine route upgrade to reduce journey time between manchester and leeds benefit community along the train line we be also invest in the next phase of the midland rail hub to strengthen connection between birmingham and the wide midland to the south west and wales in wales we be invest million in new rail project in north and south wales over year to connect city town and manufacturing hub with two labour governments work together for the people of wales we will set out further detail on our plan for northern powerhouse rail in the come week this be not just about transport we be deliver the big roll out of nuclear power for half century with billion commitment to our nuclear power future we be provide billion for the affordable home programme over the next decade which be the big cash injection into social and affordable housing in year we be back british industry in its pioneering work in carbon capture usage and storage include with support for the acorn project with benefit feel right across scotland the task before we now be to ensure that this investment be spend effectively and efficiently real change in approach from the conservatives time in government and to plan for not only the next five year but the long term that be the drive force behind the year infrastructure strategy crucially it be our hope that this long term approach will give investor and business the confidence to invest in skill and their workforce hire more apprentice create more job and improve wage rate in every part of the country the strategy be by its nature thorough and detailed but will draw the attention of the house to five key element today first we will provide certainty and stability through increase capital investment we be commit to funding at least billion for infrastructure over the next decade ensure that infrastructure spending continue to grow in line with inflation after the current spending review period at the spending review we commit detailed capital spending plan for each department until to provide further certainty and confidence in our plan we be also confirm funding for the school rebuilding programme to and for the prison expansion programme to this long term certainty need to be translate into real job in every part of the country so ahead of the summer recess we will publish new online infrastructure pipeline it will provide up to date information about what we will build and when and where we will build it give industry and investor the confidence they need to invest in highly skilled job in every part of the country secondly for the first time we be bring economic infrastructure such as transport energy and waste together with housing and social infrastructure include school hospital and prison into one overarch government strategy in do so we will expect stakeholder to think more strategically about the community they be create not just the specific piece of infrastructure they be build for example as part of our review of the green book we have decide to pilot place base business case which will ensure that there be proper co ordination between departments when bid for funding from the treasury know that will be huge relief for community across the country which have rely too often on poor planning on infrastructure and community benefit that be the difference it make to have labour mp who show up and listen and labour government who get it thirdly we be take step to address the soar maintenance backlog in our public estate which be estimate at more than billion be today announce new maintenance fund to provide at least billion per year over the next decade to improve our public service and save money for the taxpayer that include at least billion per year to maintain and repair our hospital so that our loved one can get the good possible treatment when they need it million per year for our court and prison so that justice can be serve and almost billion for our school and college per year by so that every young person get the good start in life fourthly we will leverage the private capital need to deliver this strategy that mean match capital to individual project and use government debt and equity to invest alongside the private sector we will also work with industry to explore the target use of new public private partnership where they can be show to deliver value for money for the taxpayer any new model will learn lesson from the past to secure value for money into the future lastly we have establish the national infrastructure and service transformation authority base in the treasury nista bring oversight of infrastructure strategy and delivery together and integrate assurance design and delivery assessment into treasury spending decision it will ensure that the strategy be implement effectively across the whole country include through formal review of progress every two year align with the spending review cycle it will also work across government to provide expertise and support to delivery partner by design this year infrastructure strategy be technical policy document and we will continue to work with business investor worker and trade union and local leader to drive up ambition and improve delivery however the strategy be much more than that alongside our modern industrial strategy it will provide certainty and confidence in britain as an investment destination and will establish the framework need to deliver the step change in infrastructure investment announce by the chancellor in last week spending review do properly it will result in tangible improvement to the fabric of our country our local road and high street renew so that community be even well place to live our public transport more available and more reliable make it easy for people to get around and access opportunity our school hospital and gp surgery fit for the future to deliver for generation to come and country that will be strong and more resilient community will see the difference as this labour government deliver on the promise of change and decade of national renewal on that basis commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the chief secretary to the treasury for his statement and for provide early sight of it our ability to invest in public infrastructure be positive for individual community and the country as whole and it be right that the new government set out their strategy the last government have to deal with series of economic disruption include the impact of covid the unwinding of quantitative easing across all advanced economy and the consequence of russia invasion of ukraine the global impact be disrupt supply chain increase inflation and raise interest rate notwithstanding those shock under the last government public sector expenditure on capital increase in real term from billion in to billion in an increase of today the chief secretary have confirm expenditure of billion but have provide very little detail there be no project pipeline today will he commit to come back to this house when it be publish in the last infrastructure pipeline analysis include an investment pipeline of project over year period commence from the chief secretary last statement to the house be in very large part restatement of the investment in local transportation project that have already be announce by the previous conservative government will he confirm how many of the project in the previous pipeline will be retain will he advise the house which major project be be abandon and give some insight into his reasoning for do so translate pipeline into reality require labour force of sufficient size and with range of skill in construction project management and engineering for example again the analysis by the construction industry training board indicate that that project pipeline would create labour pressure in many of those skill area since come to office this labour government have increase national insurance and be propose new regulation on employment both of which will disproportionately affect the construction sector do the chief secretary have any concern about the impact of those change on the availability of labour will he advise the house what assessment he have make of skill pinch point and what step the government be take to alleviate they fulfil these plan will require investment by taxpayer and private capital will the chief secretary advise the house on whether there have be any significant change in the mix of private and public investment within discrete sector or overall compare with the last pipeline analysis in the government create the national wealth fund and say that it be their principal investor critical part of the government growth strategy for infrastructure the chief secretary have give the national wealth fund billion but have make no mention of it today why have there be no mention of the national wealth fund we be move through an era with rapidly accelerate pace of change in which the period from technological innovation to obsolescence can be vanishingly short the risk that public investment in new technology solution will become redundant be increase while be forward look the government should also be careful to nurture both exist technology and new but proven one so what be the government priority for technology choice in the energy sector and what action will he take to protect taxpayer from technology redundancy risk the pension schemes bill introduce by this government include reserve power for the government to mandate the investment of pension scheme have the chief secretary have any discussion about or have the treasury do any analysis of the use of mandation power to provide financing to the capital investment he have announce today have the project announce today be assess accord to the revised green book rule if not will they be reassess at some point on the revised basis and what assurance can the chief secretary provide that these project will give value for money to taxpayer as this government have state and as we acknowledge when pressure on public expenditure increase it be frequently capital expenditure that suffer what action be the chief secretary willing to take if finance be tight to protect the budget for the project he have announce today investment in infrastructure benefit from stable economic background clear set of priority efficient delivery and optimal return for taxpayer and investor madam deputy speaker miss the chief secretary in his old guise as chairman of the business select committee when there be less of the rhetoric and the partisanship these big decision need open communication and critical analysis if we be to improve value for money and get project deliver on time and on budget in those endeavour the chief secretary will always have our support as mr fuller know there be three of we on that committee back in those good old day remember they very fondly madam deputy speaker be grateful for your support and for that of the shadow chief secretary to the treasury in his statement today he have ask number of question which will take in turn the first question be about detailed spending allocation between departments today we be make commitment to minimum level of investment in infrastructure billion over year which be rise in line with inflation the detailed spending plan per department get allocate at the spending review we have return to long term multi year spending review which be obviously different from the annual allocation do under the previous government capital be now allocate at departmental level until we will do the subsequent five year detailed allocation in at the next spending review the pipeline will be publish in couple of week in mid july the reason for small delay between the strategy and the pipeline be that we want to integrate the datum from last week spending review and it take little time to do so we have work in partnership with industry skill provider and other to develop the pipeline which as say will show on map of the country which project we be procure when and where that will give investor and business long term confidence about the job that be go to be available so that they can invest in their own workforce the shadow chief secretary be right to highlight that skill be constrain factor in the uk economy we have the strategy and the money from the chancellor we now need to work through the industrial strategy with the department for business and trade and the department for transport and with private sector partner to do all we can to create the great job in every part of the country that will enable we to build the infrastructure we have set out today the shadow chief secretary ask about the role of private capital the strategy set out today contain whole chapter about the role of private capital and the different mechanism that we use with private investor there be commitment to use private capital for economic infrastructure where there be revenue stream and some of the approve methodology for look at those option further work will be do between now and the autumn budget on some very target potential application of private capital for social infrastructure but crucially only where that provide value for money compare with it be fund by the state the shadow chief secretary also ask about the green book the green book review be publish last week as part of the spending review and it will be apply on business case basis as project come through to the treasury for spend approval there be nothing in the strategy set out today that pre approve business case so the new green book will be apply to business case as they come through in the normal way at couple of point the shadow chief secretary ask to explain the difference between this government and the last conservative government to put it simply it be fail promise from the conservatives and promise deliver by the labour government call john grady member of the treasury committee welcome today announcement and in particular the focus on housing and transport because glasgow have real housing crisis in my constituency the busy bridgeton train station do not even have lift for disabled people all taxpayer be concerned about value for money particularly give the huge overspend and utter chaos of under the last government in scotland there be the absolute scandal of the arran ferry will my right hon friend reassure and set out the step that the government be take to ensure value for money in this infrastructure spending will he commit to share the learning with the scottish government who desperately need help on that the key thing will point my hon friend to be the role of the national infrastructure and service transformation authority sit in the treasury the assessment on delivery assurance design and commercial capability for project will be part of the advice now come to as chief secretary and to the chancellor and it will be align with spending decision on budget that mean that if project be not deliver effectively or be not yet ready to start we will not release the money for that project and we will stop fund project that be fail that be key difference from how decision be process previously and we think it will lead to much well discipline in deliver big project call the liberal democrat spokesperson last week the liberal democrats welcome the announcement of investment in public infrastructure and transport project which we have long call for we be glad that today the government be set out year infrastructure plan to realise those project and the liberal democrats will be closely scrutinise it to ensure that it deliver for community across the uk boost our infrastructure be vital give the appalling mismanagement under the last conservative government that leave our school and hospital building crumble while neglect critical infrastructure from transport to renewable energy generation today plan must draw line under the disastrous mismanagement of project such as which promise to connect our country and community only to end up another hollow conservative promise long delay and billion over budget while we welcome the government intention to deliver productive investment we will closely scrutinise its implementation have be concern that ministers have be unable to answer question regard delegate funding from the structure fund such as for hammersmith bridge in my constituency will the minister confirm that specific project have be select and will he ensure that infrastructure funding be distribute fairly for the benefit of all region will he set up crumble hospital taskforce to identify creative funding idea speed up construction timeline and put an end to the vicious cycle and false economy of delay rebuild which lead to rise repair cost as we look carefully at the implementation of these plan the government must ensure that we have workforce equip with the necessary skill to meet these commitment do the minister therefore agree that it be time to replace the broken apprenticeship levy with broad more flexible skill and training levy will the government fulfil their promise to make skills england an independent body with employer at its heart the hon lady be right to point to the fiasco of which my right hon friend the transport secretary update the house on yesterday the complete and utter negligence in deliver on that project over many year have leave we with the legacy of have to pay more for long which have implication for all the other thing we would like to do in the country we commission the james stewart review which be publish yesterday all its recommendation have be adopt and lesson be already flow through this infrastructure strategy so that we never end up in that situation again the hon lady ask about the structure fund which be particular fund that we prioritise because we know that in many constituency bridge in particular often miss out on funding and be in desperate need of it she will have to speak with the department for transport about the allocation of that funding but will make sure that she get an answer from my right hon friend the transport secretary rise lastly the hon lady ask about hospital maintenance there be big commitment in the infrastructure strategy on maintenance maintenance be not sexy and it be not good for election leaflet but it be important that be why we be commit so many billion today to it because there be an enormous backlog nista will be co ordinate across government and across all social infrastructure to make sure that we be prioritise that go forward so that people can see quick real tangible improvement to their public structure in their local community rise order the minister miss the mexican wave that take place behind he it be down to chris vince mostly although probably it be also down to the length of the answer which could be short thank the chief secretary for his excellent work on this strategy which will turbocharge confidence in the investment community while improve the life income and opportunity of my constituent in darlington which be exactly what be elect to do it will not surprise he to hear ask politely for he to outline more detail on his ambition for the place base approach the green book reform and the pilot that he have mention can we have one in darlington the home of many of his treasury colleague will give short answer give the time available we will be set out further detail shortly about where we will be pilot these place base business case it be new process for whitehall it require level of co ordination that do not currently exist but the outcome if we get it right will be people experience co ordinate thoughtful infrastructure spending in the place they live in way that make sense for how they live in those area be sure my hon friend will continue to bid for darlington as we decide where to pilot those place base business case in due course the chief secretary to the treasury mention the midland rail hub he will know that the previous government commit to the billion project there have be pause and paragraph of the spending review state that the government will fund its progression in the spirit of short answer can he tell exactly how much money have be commit to it the difference from the last government be that they promise thing with no money and we be promise thing with actual money the hon member point to the midland hub in the spending review document that be about development funding one of our different approach under this infrastructure strategy be that instead of just allocate the total estimate spend at the start of the project and let the project get on without proper oversight we be issue development funding early and more often so that we can have properly cost business case with proper assurance that mean we can guarantee member of the public that we will deliver on our promise unlike his party welcome this investment strategy many of we have see at first hand the broken infrastructure we be deal with the chief secretary will know my concern that many of the organisation we will be ask to tackle these problem be also deal with the legacy of the private finance initiative which see building and project cost three time more than the actual asset themselves the plea that many of we make to the previous government to tackle these legal loan shark of the public sector fall on deaf ear and know that this chief secretary will not make the same mistake would he be open to meet those of we who be keen to learn the lesson of the private finance initiative in particular can we cap what private company can make on military contract child care home and other social infrastructure project so that we do not see our public sector savage by these company in future be always happy to meet my hon friend can confirm that in the design and funding of nista have fund particular team to work on the management of dispute under the old pfi contract scheme to make sure that we be get the good outcome and good deal for the public sector can not believe it but agree with the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy it be shock to the system but the chief secretary have announce the return of the public private partnership the last labour government be byword for disastrous contractual negotiation and that lead to the infamous lightbulb give that labour be so bad at these contract negotiation last time around what confidence do the chief secretary have that he will be any well this time around be usually confident in my ability to be frank we will be consult on some of the design detail we will be use private capital for social infrastructure only in particular potential use case we mention in the strategy today certain type of primary neighbourhood healthcare centre we will be transparently consult on that detail and we will only allow such capital to be use in way that be value for money we will not be return to the pfi contract of the past welcome the chief secretary statement as someone whose parent and grandparent grow up in and live in council housing and benefit from that opportunity particularly welcome the record investment in social and affordable housing under the previous government the uk be out of oecd country for business investment and it be regularly at the bottom of the for the combination of public and private investment will the chief secretary confirm that this strategy today will begin to turn that terrible legacy around agree with my hon friend on our extremely ambitious plan for council house or social and affordable house as we call they now he will know that too grow up in council flat now represent the constituency of bristol north west and over people in the city of bristol be wait for secure housing be very confident that our billion commitment on build affordable and social housing will make huge difference to the life of people across the whole country my hon friend ask about unlock private capital the good news be that plenty of investor want to invest private capital in the uk but they have tell we through the british infrastructure taskforce and other vehicle that they do not invest for many year because they think that we have lose the plot in this country whereas we now have clear strategy we have stability both politically and economically and we will now work with those investor to provide opportunity across the country to bring money to community that have miss out for too long welcome the chief secretary comment on maintenance he may be aware that huge maintenance project be about to begin on the most beautiful stretch of motorway in the country the at lune gorge eight bridge under and over that motorway will need replace in the come year will he have look at the resource that be be make available to mitigate the impact on the local community the plan be to close the northbound exit and the southbound exit consecutively for three year and to close the bridge connect kendal to tebay will he make sure that there be resource to ensure that there be temporary slip road so that local community be not cut off be sure that the hon gentleman make very good case which ministers in the department for transport will need to answer but be pleased to know that the liberal democrats think maintenance be sexy after all through my work on the public accounts committee have see just how severe the public estate maintenance backlog have become in fact the conservatives have their head so deep in the sand on building maintenance that be surprised they do not apply for planning permission can my right hon friend confirm that york public building will benefit from the billion maintenance fund that he have announce my hon friend be absolutely right one of the challenge that learn on come into government be that the last government do not even ask what the maintenance backlog be in certain department there be not clear set of datum that tell we which asset the government own and the quality or state of they so we have some pretty basic work to be get on with through nista as we allocate the money which will go directly to the school hospital and other public sector building that have be ignore for many many year the creation of another new authority will be meet with an eye roll sigh in scotland because although it be call the national infrastructure and service transformation authority very shiny title the reality be that it will have little oversight in scotland the plan announce today will generate barnett formula money which will go to holyrood and disappear it will go into ferry that do not float and thing like that in my constituency the road be piece of critical national infrastructure it service the ferry port to northern ireland and it be vital for all the country that make up the united kingdom will we see any money come for that road through today innovation or will the money once again disappear into the coffer in holyrood politely point the hon member to the fact that previously there be two function in government and have close both of they and create one so we be actually down by one he ask about the devolved government which have devolve responsibility we will not interfere with the devolution settlement but think that he and agree that scotland need new direction and hope the people of scotland will vote for anas sarwar and labour at the election next may welcome the uk government bold year infrastructure plan and the swift action they have already take to green light project such as the third runway at heathrow however sadly for my constituent infrastructure policy and delivery in scotland be in the hand of the fail snp government government who can not dual road or build ferry we be in the grip of housing emergency in west lothian and they be not build the home that we need do the minister agree that there be much that the snp scottish government can learn from the uk government about get the country build again agree very much with my hon friend next week will be meet finance ministers from the devolved government in scotland northern ireland and wales we will put forward today update on our infrastructure strategy and seek to partner with they as well we can to deliver for people and place across the whole of scotland but give the track record of the snp government be afraid that do not have huge amount of confidence the denial in this statement be truly breathtaking this uk government could not come up with year strategy that would survive first contact with reality on anything and the statement come against backdrop of challenging cut off the back of the poor while we be fit million new door to the house of lords and provide billion for not very fast railway that will not be finish for some time there be nothing for scotland in the chancellor spending review there be nothing for scotland in this statement and there be nothing for scotland in the uk year infrastructure working paper on that latter document it be interesting to note that it do not mention devolution wales scotland or northern ireland once do the chief secretary to the treasury think that simply mention acorn will make private capital hang around and wait for the government to put number on it how much of this will be rerun of labour disastrous private finance initiative project which scottish council be still haemorrhage money on and why be he herald work with the welsh government but not the snp scottish government be he democrat or not that be stream of slightly incoherent question if may say so point the hon gentleman to the document that we have publish today which do mention scotland quite few time he say that this labour government have not deliver anything for scotland will just point he to the large real term increase in funding since devolution begin his snp colleague might want to think about how they could spend that more wisely for the people of scotland that be in addition to the supercomputer in edinburgh the development funding for acorn and for carbon capture usage and storage and our defence spending include on the clyde could go on and on the only people in denial be those in the snp warmly welcome this statement after year of neglect it be quite clear that our infrastructure have be creak and that opportunity have be miss that be particularly the case in the east of england where the government inherit per head of population spend that be less than the uk average may ask the chief secretary please to look at the ely junction project where for every invest there would be return the project would help not only my constituency but dozen in the east of england and help drive economic growth in our part of the world thank my hon friend for raise the ely junction the great thing about the multi year spending review in the year strategy be that the department for transport and its partner be now able to plan ahead so encourage he to talk to transport ministers about that particular project he be right to say that we be absolutely in the business for high value for money case that unlock growth and opportunity in every part of the country long term approach to spending be really sensible and as northern mp particularly welcome the treasury review the green book to make sure that regional inequality be not far entrench by future spending stepping hill hospital in my patch have report repair backlog of million so be really interested to hear the chief secretary talk about the pilot of place base business case can he say bit more about how the treasury will review those pilot and do it mean that stepping hill be more likely to get the funding it need so that my constituent get the hospital they deserve hope that stepping hill will be able to bid into the new long term maintenance fund so that we can get work do more quickly than it have be do in the past on the place base business case pilot under the green book review we have not yet make any decision about where we will pilot they or how so we now have to do that work as say in my statement to the house the intention behind they be to look across different type of spending to make sure that we be create function place that have the relevant public service infrastructure transport infrastructure and house building in one place we will be able to come to the house with more detail on that in due course know that my constituent in north east derbyshire will warmly welcome the infrastructure strategy because we have be on the sharp end of government departments fail to co ordinate when build infrastructure can make bid for place base business case pilot in north east derbyshire our unique mix of urban rural and semi rural community as well as the fact that we be in the east midland and close to south yorkshire and sheffield make we an ideal area for pilot it seem that have list of bid for place base business case pilot which we will take away and consider my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight why this issue be important when the government be spend lot of money on particular thing include through industrial policy or defence spending we need to ensure that that translate into good job and good pay with housing and good public infrastructure so that people can access those opportunity and help drive the economy forward as one of my constituency neighbour the chief secretary will be aware of our local infrastructure need such as upgrade junction and on the fix the original severn bridge and upgrade westerleigh rail junction the west of england have often be overlook in the past so how will he ensure that the funding be distribute fairly and for the benefit of all region note that need to manage carefully my conflict of interest as minister and constituency mp would just point the hon lady to the announcement make the other week think it be very good about nearly million of devolved funding go to the mayor of the west of england helen godwin allow she to get on with lot of the transport upgrade that in the past we wait many year to get fund be encourage by the minister statement which be plan to rebuild britain from the mess leave by the conservatives can he inform the house how constituency such as mine can take advantage of the new place base business case as part of the government green book strategy thank my hon friend who be champion for secure investment in her constituency the approach with the green book have be change to make sure that we be invest in the place that have be leave behind for too long it will be for local leader to work together to bid for the type of funding that will enable they to deliver on the government mission whether that be house building economic growth or help public service get back on their foot we will certainly be open to bid from her constituency and region in due course welcome this announcement and while there be aspect that do not support particularly welcome the government investment in vital flood defence as the minister know these be critical in ensure that we be well protect against the impact of climate breakdown with the met office warning this week that we could reach temperature in the current climate clearly the effect of climate breakdown be already here do he agree that protection need to be fully integrate into every aspect of our economy from housing to transport and farming and do he also agree that it be good idea to put climate resilience and preparedness on statutory footing by require all major infrastructure provider to carry out climate risk assessment in order to make we all safe thank the hon member for raise those important point adaptation and sustainable development be at the heart of this infrastructure strategy and they have to be for all the obvious reason he may like to know that as part of our new approach to spatial strategy in government we be already integrate datum from the department for environment food and rural affairs on flood risk heat risk and water availability with datum from other departments for example the ministry of housing communities and local government to ensure that we be plan properly for the future welcome the green book review of the co ordination of join up infrastructure thinking thank you so much promise have previously be make to local place affect by major infrastructure project that they would see some local benefit with that in mind and with the low thames crossing come to gravesham will he meet to see how gravesham could be pilot for this place base study and to really help with the affordable home that be also desperately need thank my hon friend for her question be always delighted to meet she and we should meet colleague from the department for transport to make sure that where we be invest billion of pound whether that be public or private capital in important infrastructure such as the low thames crossing people benefit from the wide effect of that investment last week something amazing happen actually find myself in agreement with the labour mayor for york and north yorkshire when he say that spend review announcement fall well short and that this government have real chance to show it be serious about rural area but it miss it do the chief secretary to the treasury agree with that one of the good way to invest in new infrastructure would be by dualle and electrify the line between leeds and york via harrogate in order to unlock growth in our part of yorkshire thank the hon member for his question as he will have see from the chancellor previous statement we be increase investment in transport whether rail road or bus specifically in the north and the midland so there be plenty of opportunity to bid for the project he mention and be sure he will talk to transport ministers to make that case thank the chief secretary to the treasury for his statement and for the national infrastructure strategy it be particularly welcome that after the dither and delay of the last government who fail to get important project such as the low thames crossing which have be mention over the line this government be finally set out plan to do so do he agree with that invest in infrastructure set the foundation for growth across the whole country so that there will be not only job in north kent reduction in congestion and opportunity for small business but majorly enhance connectivity for business in the midland and the north with our channel port my hon friend be absolutely right and he will see in due course when the industrial strategy be publish that we have be think across government about the role of infrastructure as an enable investment to unlock other type of investment and to create great opportunity for people and economy where they can afford to live and be able to get around to access those opportunity the chief secretary statement make no mention of rural area when it come to infrastructure welsh rural community have for decade lose out with lack of investment in both our physical and digital infrastructure unfortunately the million on rail do not come anywhere near rural wales what be the government do to prioritise investment in disadvantaged rural area in wales thank the hon member for her question without want to go through the entire infrastructure strategy or spending review there be significant money come to all part of the country the chancellor have increase day to day spending by billion and capital spending by billion so be confident that the hon member constituent will benefit from an improved national health service improve road maintenance and improve digital infrastructure there be very long list of thing people will be able to experience and they will see the difference make by labour government as we deliver on our promise of change be hop that the next question will be as entertaining as his constant chuntering call alan gemmell thank you very much madam deputy speaker it be very nice to finally be recognise by the chair do the minister agree that this approach to investment be fundamentally different from the conservative chaos that lead to crumble school hospital and road and light year away from that of the snp government whose profligate waste of public money have lead to billion ferry fiasco in ayrshire my hon friend be absolutely right to point out the failure of other government both the previous government at westminster and the current government in scotland when prepare this work in opposition be very take by investor say when can invest anywhere in the world if the uk say it be go to do something and germany say it be go to do something be probably go to bet on germany over the uk that have to change because britain be brilliant country with lot of opportunity the long term stability we be set out in our strategy our long term spending plan and our commitment to stability be unlock that investment to create great opportunity for people across the whole country include in scotland hope the minister appreciate just how insulting it be to welsh ear for we to be tell that we be get fair deal on railway funding when we know that we have be cheat out of billion of pound due to the classification of several project as england and wales project wales be get only five railway station between newport and cardiff that be hardly national renewal be it will he bet on wales and commit to project outside that belt such as project across mid wales and west wales or the electrification of the north and south line there be key difference under the last government wales do not get penny but under this labour government work with the labour government in wales it have have not only the large real term increase in spending since devolution begin but million for rail infrastructure nearly million for coal tip safety and many other thing that be the benefit of two labour governments work together to deliver for the people of wales and the hon gentleman may want to be little bit more grateful in future thank my right hon friend for his very welcome statement in

authority by cabinet to co ordinate spatial strategy across government that mean that departments will have to think between themselves about make sure that they put thing like gp surgery and hospital in the right place when they be build significant number of new home our long term plan be have an immediate effect in south norfolk over million for the thickthorn junction million for the norfolk and norwich hospital and upgrade to four gp all of which will support the constituency of the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew as well would not be do good job as the mp for south

constituency be sure his constituent will be deeply indebted to he now and in future election know he will continue to make the case for investment for his constituent warm home discount with permission wish to make statement on the action we be take to cut energy bill for work family three year on from the russian invasion of ukraine which send price soar people up and down the country be still feel the impact everywhere go in this job and from every person speak to hear how the wage that use to support family be be swallow up by sky high energy bill month after month after month the truth be that for as long as we remain dependent on gas and volatile global market british people will continue to pay the price and we will continue to be hold back as country that be why we be finally end our exposure and our vulnerability by sprint to clean affordable energy that be control by we we know that in the meantime we must do everything we can to support family who be under huge amount of pressure with their energy bill today we be set out how we will help million more household with their bill this winter by expand the warm home discount previously around million people receive the rebate off their energy bill but million of people live in home not classify as hard to heat be exclude as result of criterion introduce by the previous government in we believe those criterion be unnecessary and unreliable we believe that it can not be fair to have two family in almost exactly the same circumstance with one receive help and one not that have be raise repeatedly by consumer and their advocate since the change be make in and absolutely understand their concern that be why we be abolish this restriction this winter every single household where the bill payer receive means test benefit will be eligible for the warm home discount which mean further million low income household will get that vital support in total more than million household one in five family in britain will get the help they need this winter this expansion will help we meet our goal of tackle fuel poverty which be critical to the work of my department it will increase the number of fuel poor household that receive support with coverage improve from under the current scheme to around in total million fuel poor household will receive support have meet people on the frontline of the energy bill crisis up and down the country so know for fact that there be family out there right now breathe sigh of relief because this measure will ease the huge amount of pressure they be under with the cost of living one issue that be often raise with be that family can miss out on the warm home discount because the person who receive the means test benefit be not name on the energy bill to be eligible the means test benefit recipient their partner or their legal appointee need to be name on the energy bill encourage all family who receive means test benefit to check that and if necessary to contact their supplier people need to ensure that the benefit recipient their partner or their appointee be name on the bill before the warm home discount qualifying date which be august at the same time we be go far to put the energy market back in the service of work people take step to restore confidence and faith in the energy market which have be shake as it stand too many complaint against energy company go unresolved or take too long to fix whether it be supplier not respond quickly enough or fail to adjust direct debit when family use less energy which lead to situation where consumer often do not access the compensation they be entitle to due to an overly complex complaint system this government be absolutely committed to stand up for consumer who have have bad experience of the energy system and we be work hard to ensure that the system work in the interest of consumer we have already make real stride in improve condition for customer follow the secretary of state intervention and month of government work with the sector ofgem announce million of compensation for victim of force prepayment meter in may and we will continue to go far this be government willing to use every tool in our arsenal to fight for work people by move at speed to deliver clean power and with the spending review set out the big investment in the domestic clean energy industry in history we will take back control of our energy system and do the job of protect consumer that be why we have waste absolutely no time in drive forward our clean energy mission in our first year end the onshore wind ban consent more than gw of renewable energy launch great british energy fund new golden era for nuclear kick start carbon capture and hydrogen industry and invest billion already to upgrade up to home with billion commit in the spending review to upgrade million more this be how we will rebuild our energy network and protect family across the country by support more people who need our help this winter by restore confidence in reform energy market and by bring bill down for good with secure reliable clean energy we will ensure that every family in this country have the security of home they can afford to heat now and in the future commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of her statement what delight it be to receive an update on the warm home discount on this the warm day of the year know that the minister be tireless champion for the people of peckham and for the most vulnerable and thank she for all the work that she do behind the scene for those cause exactly one year ago today the chancellor say great british energy publicly own energy company will cut energy bill by up to what have happen since bill have not fall by as be promise so many time by the prime minister the chancellor the energy secretary and labour mp in fact bill have go up by almost the opposite of what they all promise just year ago on top of that this government take the winter fuel payment away from million of pensioner through cold winter this announcement will provide support for some but it be nothing more than stick plaster the fact be this government energy policy be make people cold and poor the minister have not say single word about how this expansion will be pay for it be million commitment but there be no detail in either the government press release or the minister statement about how it will be fund will the warm home discount still be fund by levy on everyone energy bill if so this policy mean that energy bill will increase for the majority of bill payer yet the minister do not say so in her statement will she therefore inform the house whether she have ask her department to calculate by how much levy on everyone bill will increase to pay for the million of extra spending if so will she inform the house so that our constituent know how much their bill will increase by under this labour government the government press release say that the expansion of the scheme will be offset by efficiency saving across the energy system but we have no detail about what those efficiency be or how much money will be save in fact the system be become less efficient the national energy system operator recently say that the cost of balance the grid by pay wind farm to switch off when it be too windy increase by to billion year warn that this will triple to billion year by as this government rush to build more wind farm and solar farm on agricultural land than ever before that be what this government be deliver more subsidy more levy more payment for wind farm to switch off more tech import from china and more cost add to everyone bill will the minister share some proper detail with the house on exactly how much this will cost the british people suspect the answer will be resounding no this be statement devoid of detail because it be design simply to distract from the fact that this government energy policy be in chaos and drive bill high and high this be government drive by the ideology of net zero not by make energy bill low for family across britain it be government of broken promise think the hon lady have some cheek give the previous government record on energy bill when under their watch family across the country be pay sky high energy bill with people still pay the price of that today the idea that the conservatives would try to lecture we on energy bill be pretty rich let take the hon lady question directly yes we be commit to reduce energy bill by we have pass the legislation on great british energy and the institution be up and run we be do the job of drive down bill we stand by that commitment and the way we will deliver it be through investment in clean power it be very clear that our reliance and dependence on global fossil fuel market under the conservatives watch be ultimately what lead to bill rise labour will not make that mistake which be why we be invest record level in renewable that be the way we will drive down cost in the system and drive down bill this policy be not about ideology it be about family across the country the status quo be not tenable we do not think it be acceptable to have bill at the current level and to leave family expose which be why we be take action the hon lady ask specifically how this policy will be pay for the warm home discount be pay for under the price cap we be very clear that we do not want other family bill to increase in order to pay for this change we have work with ofgem to look for saving within supplier operating cost for instance give that debt spike under the energy crisis mean that all household be currently pay bit on the debt allowance we be also work with ofgem to get that debt burden down we will use the saving there to cover the cost of this policy we be very clear support for those who need it protection for all household welcome the minister statement think the shadow minister be right to highlight this statement be make on the warm day of the year this be government announce warm home plan to literally fix the roof while the sun shin which the conservatives fail to do this announcement will benefit nearly million family no doubt help thousand in hampshire include many in my constituency first on datum sharing one reason it be tough for many family and household to access these benefit be the inability to access datum between the supplier and the government secondly give that the legacy of the previous government be to leave we with the high electricity price in europe can the minister confirm that the government be continue to look at way to bring down electricity cost for both consumer and business as always my hon friend put it perfectly will pick up his point on datum sharing which be critical my department and the department for work and pensions have be work over the past few month on the sharing of mean test benefit datum so that this will be automatic come this winter all eligible consumer will receive letter inform they that they will be get the warm home discount it will be transfer on to energy bill as credit direct payment for consumer because we have do the groundwork to put that in place on my hon friend critical second point the relative cost of gas and electricity be incredibly high and we know that be problem for both household and business particularly as we try to make that transition to clean energy we be continue to do that work be very clear that we need to deal with that question in order for example for our plan to upgrade home to have the bite and traction they need and we be absolutely committed to do so call the liberal democrat spokesperson we welcome investment in warm home follow winter in which million of household be live in fuel poverty the crisis be exacerbate by the government cut to winter fuel payment and we welcome the turn on that too the former conservative government stop start on home insulation policy leave thousand of vulnerable people in damp cold and unsafe home with low energy efficiency standard and high bill during an energy crisis give that home in this country be among the old and least energy efficient in europe will the government commit to an ambitious year plan for home insulation for which the liberal democrats have long call will they ensure that household on low income will be eligible for free insulation as part of that plan and follow the government accept the campaign of my hon friend the member for cheltenham max wilkinson for solar panel to be mandate for all new home will they now look to introduce full zero carbon standard for all new home and solar for car park as put forward by the liberal democrats in amendment to the planning and structure bill could not agree more the record of stop and start on home upgrade and home insulation be one reason that we fail to insulate as many household as we should have do from the energy price spike we be committed to long term plan to upgrade million of home across the country that be what the warm home plan will do we be delighted that this have be back by the chancellor with billion of investment and we be now work on how we draw that out across the country we will make sure that we have the right solution for every household use combination of insulation solar and heat pump we want every household that get an upgrade to have home that be warm and much much cheap to run that be our absolute focus and priority on the future home standard we have be work very closely with colleague in the ministry of housing communities and local government and consult with developer we be absolutely committed to drive forward standard we have set out our ambition to make sure that future home be fit for the future use solar and clean heat solution we can not have the situation that we have have in the past where we build home that need retrofit few year later we be committed to our ambition and we will be set out more detail in the warm home plan warmly welcome my hon friend announcement which will mean that people in scotland will benefit to the tune of directly from the uk government know that she will be have conversation with our scottish counterpart and be sure that if snp members be here today they would also welcome this announcement as she be have those conversation may encourage she to talk about what she be do and how it differ from the snp approach which involve independence thermometer and housing dashboard what this labour government be do down here be practical tangible example of how we can directly impact the life of work people my hon friend be absolutely right we be engage with the scottish government today expansion create more resource for the scottish government to ensure that direct bill support be provide to more household alongside that there have to be plan to upgrade home and to make sure that we be deliver home that be warm and cheap to run we will have plan here and we expect that with the additional funding and the example that we have set the scottish government will follow suit but we be long past the stage of warm word and light action we need to get on with it because there be people across the country include in scotland who be struggle it be the responsibility of government to get grip and start to act yesterday as the minister probably know food bank group associate with the trussell trust lobby very effectively member on both side of the house my local group the waterside food bank impress on the gap between the which the government believe single person be estimate to need to survive and the that the food bank believe be necessary for single person to be able to survive alone can the minister give an indication as to what extent the gap between those two figure will be close as result of this initiative thank the right hon member for very good question we know that family be struggle with the cost of living we know that family be in poverty and that many be have to make the choice between heating and eat we be try to put in place range of measure and the warm home discount this be part of it we have extend free school meal to family on mean test benefit we be roll out breakfast club there be range of thing that we be try to do as government to ensure that people who be struggle and who have be struggle for long time be lift out of poverty we be very clear about our ambition every time labour come to power our record be that we lift people out of poverty and we will continue to do that welcome the minister statement as will nearly quarter of million people across scotland who will benefit from this warm home discount for the first time we always appreciate these measure little bit more in scotland because our weather be bit cold we have to keep remind people of that even today do the minister share my pride in this government expand support for more people who need it most because we be turn the tide on failure and build strong economy on the back of clean energy could not agree more with my hon friend the legacy the inheritance be woeful do not need to say that because people feel it across the country we as the incoming government have responsibility to ensure that we be do everything that we can to lift living standard everything that we can to support family who we know be struggle share my hon friend pride in our be able to expand the support because we know just how much it be need none the less there be more that we need to do we will not stop here if we get the roll out of the warm home plan right and if we be upgrade home we will be take up to off bill the big plan that we must take forward will help we to deliver clean power so that we can reduce bill for everyone this government be clear about the task of improve living standard it be core to what we need to do and to what we need to achieve as government and we be get on and deliver it will the minister confirm that park home resident in north west norfolk and across the country who pay their bill directly to the site owner will also benefit from the extended discount and that when they apply funding will not be limit so that everyone who be entitle to this payment will receive it thank the hon member for really good question park home be currently support through industry initiative and the warm home discount we will continue to make sure that park home be support there be obviously work that we need to do because we be conscious that there be some customer who be not receive the discount and we be work with industry to resolve that warmly welcome my hon friend statement today on the expansion of the warm home discount it will mean that people across scotland include many thousand in paisley and renfrewshire south will receive directly off their energy bill from this uk government will my hon friend say little more about the work be do to accelerate proposal to introduce debt relief scheme which would target unsustainable debt build up during the energy crisis my hon friend be right to mention debt relief and the huge burden of debt that we have see over the course of the energy crisis we see debt increase to more than billion for many of those household in debt there be no route to pay it off we have be work with ofgem to put in place debt relief scheme use combination of write off of debt and repayment plan so that we can ensure that more people be lift out of energy debt and be in position to afford their energy the minister know that have lot of time for she and welcome her announcement today but it will be of little relief to those who be live with spray foam insulation that be inadequately instal and there have be no support from the government to fix that put that aside wonder what government support be available for off grid household in rural area to ensure that they do not miss out and be include in these plan rural consumer who be on mean test benefit and link to an energy supplier should be support in the right way we know that there be some off grid rural household that be not with particular energy supplier and that that be more difficult this be why we be work with industry there be discretionary amount within the warm home discount that allow industry to find and target those people to provide support think all labour member warmly welcome today statement particularly those in scotland where family will benefit from off their bill this winter that include thousand of work family across my constituency do the minister agree that this be another case of the uk labour government make manifesto commitment and deliver on it my hon friend be completely right promise make promise deliver that be what labour government do we be very clear about the change we need to deliver in the country unlike the conservatives and the scottish government there be no warm word or faffe around we be get on with the job of deliver change today announcement of the expansion of the warm home discount be extremely welcome and will benefit many people across west cumbria one of the first meeting have with ministers after the election be with my hon friend could she set out more detail about how the really welcome warm home plan will build on this discount to create permanent lasting solution for family in my constituency who face some of the draughty home in the country to give they real financial benefit fuel poverty be an absolute scourge that we must work hard to eliminate there be two thing we must do to achieve that on the one hand we must deliver bill support the expansion of the warm home discount be so important because more household in fuel poverty will receive it on the other hand we must make sure that we be do the job of upgrade home this year we have invest billion to deliver upgrade but that be not enough we have to massively increase the number of upgrade so that we be deliver million over the course of this parliament we have commit to billion and we be now do the work of set out how we will drive the shift and change that we need to see across the country we must ensure that the household that need it have insulation solar panel battery and heat pump so that their home be warm and ultimately so that we can lower bill by up to today announcement be very welcome and will make real difference to many of our constituent be glad to hear the minister reaffirm today that in addition to support with bill the government recognise the urgent need to ensure that every home be well insulate and affordable to heat genuinely warm home and be do that through both hugely increase standard for new home and insulate exist home she have reference the billion government commitment to the warm home plan which be welcome though not enough but why do the spending review document show that more than third of that billion of the billion be money that the government expect to get back presumably to be repay by household think the hon member be refer to some of the financial transaction mechanism we will deliver the warm home strand through government support to some household as well as by work with energy company whether it be supplier or distribution network operator in order to ensure that we be drive upgrade part of that will involve the government provide loan to supplier which they will pay back over time think that be what the hon member be refer to we be very clear that we need up front investment as catalyst and we be clear that we need to upgrade million of home and crack on with the job welcome the minister statement this announcement will mean that over half million more londoners will benefit from discount on their energy bill this winter do she agree that along with our free breakfast club the per year increase in the minimum wage and free childcare in school today announcement show that labour be put money back into the pocket of work people in ealing southall and across the country my hon friend be spot on member on the conservative front bench be chuckle away in front of but it be no joke we inherit an absolutely atrocious set of circumstance family across the country be pay for their failure with the cost of live at record high level go across the country to speak to people and see the impact of the conservatives failure on people life we be not willing to accept that what we inherit be the status quo that be why we be take decisive action whether it be the expansion to the warm home discount and free school meal the increase in the national minimum wage or our record investment in social housing this government be get on with the job of lift living standard in order to fix the mess we inherit from that lot thank the minister for her statement and her answer in the short time she have be in her role she have always deliver good news and that be quite talent so say well do and thank the government for that double the number of household in the united kingdom will get off their energy bill and that be very welcome for those on mean test benefit however with one in four child live in poverty in northern ireland it be essential that this announcement apply in northern ireland too will the minister confirm that northern ireland be include in this help for the vulnerable and those in poverty will it come through barnett consequential or another way northern ireland run its own separate scheme we be in very close contact with the northern irish government in fact be in northern ireland yesterday we be make sure that our work to deliver clean power which be our route to lower bill and critically our work through the warm home plan be co ordinated the hon member be right that there be people across the country who be struggle at the moment and it be absolutely our responsibility to take action to support they thank the minister for this announcement as she will recall we meet back in september to discuss my concern about fuel poverty in my constituency include the number of child live in cold home we specifically talk about this measure she have take it away do the hard graft and deliver so thank she for that as she say in her statement there be people who may not get the discount because they do not know that they be entitle to it the government will know which people be receive the warm home discount and which people be on means test benefit and be not receive it will she consider write to those family to make sure that everybody know the good news that this government be put more money into their pocket thank my hon friend for the work he have be do to champion this agenda can confirm that we will be write to all household in receipt of means test benefit to let they know that they be eligible for the discount for the vast majority it will be automatic they will not have to do anything and the discount will turn up as credit on their bill there be bit of action to take for people who be not the bill payer we will get the message out that they must ensure that they be include as the bill payer in order to get the automatic support thousand more of my constituent in glasgow will have money off their energy bill this winter as result of this labour government decision welcome the minister statement and ask she to assure that the government will continue to work hard to deliver low energy bill for family in glasgow can commit to that the conservatives tell we that our fight to deliver clean power and our work to upgrade people home be ideological it be not ideological it be down to bread and butter issue we know that there be family struggle across the country we be not willing to accept what we inherit as the status quo so we be get on with the job of reduce energy bill because improve living standard and deliver the change we be elect to deliver be core priority for this government the minister be right that because the conservatives leave our country expose to fossil fuel price people wage be be swallow up by energy cost it be right that we be sprint towards clean home grow energy as long term solution and the tension in the middle east demonstrate why that be so important we must also get support to people right now in bournemouth east welcome the fact that family across the south west include my constituent will benefit from help this winter but my constituent want to feel bit of breathing room to live not merely survive will the minister confirm that tackle the cost of living be our no priority as government and set out the way in which the government be target the cost of living crisis my hon friend be absolutely right to talk about the cost of living he be also right to point out that we have huge exposure to global fossil fuel market and at point where we be see tension and conflict in the middle east energy security become so critical so we will continue despite the naysayer on the opposition benches to sprint to deliver clean power but while we do that we be take action to reduce the cost of living so whether it be the expansion of the warm home discount or the expansion of free school meal or increase the national living wage or the action that we be take to roll out breakfast club or the action that we be take to build record amount of social housing the labour government be commit to better living standard not talk about it but get on and deliver the change that we be elect to deliver many family in portsmouth north continue to face pressure from energy bill and the cost of living so congratulate my hon friend and the government on support those on the low income this winter particularly through the change in the warm home discount the credit the warm home plan and the additional fund that we have give to the household support fund help people like portsmouth north resident amee who meet yesterday and who lose out under the last government unnecessary unreliable and unfair criterion will the minister join in urge that alongside our government energy provider and council include portsmouth city council do more to promote and advertise what resident must do to access these vital support to raise their living standard so that family who be entitle to it get the help that they need my hon friend be absolutely right there be clear obligation on energy supplier to do everything that they can to support vulnerable household meet with supplier regularly to emphasise that people be under pressure and that they absolutely must discharge their obligation my hon friend be also right to point out that we have to work with local government regional government and partner on the ground to ensure that the support that be available we will continue build on that support get to the people that absolutely need it thank the minister for her statement which will help quarter of million household in the east of england may say from personal point of view it be so encouraging to hear government focus on green energy solution believe it or not madam deputy speaker it be over year since be at school learn about the importance of green know will she reflect on the decision that this government be make include remove the ban on onshore wind and how they will continue to benefit resident in my constituency of harlow can not believe it be year ago that my hon friend be learn about green energy we have be sprint to deliver clean power when we come into government we set mission to do it by there be naysayer and there continue to be naysayer but we be not deter by that so whether it be remove the ban on onshore wind whether it be record investment in nuclear or whether it be record renewable auction we be very clear that we be put in the investment we be put in the hard yard the hard graft to deliver clean power why be we do that not because of ideology but because we recognise that we inherit an energy system that be not work on behalf of consumer we recognise that people be under huge pressure status quo that we be not willing to accept we will deliver clean power so that we can bear down on bill and ensure that we drive down energy bill for good that be the end of the statement so will allow the front bench few moment to shuffle over as we continue the business for the rest of the afternoon bill presented deprivation of citizenship orders effect during appeal bill secretary yvette cooper support by the prime minister pat mcfadden secretary shabana mahmood secretary hilary benn secretary ian murray lucy powell secretary jo stevens and dan jarvis present bill to make provision about the effect during an appeal of an order under section of the

uefa women european football championship licensing hours order which be lay before this house on may be approve this summer the uefa woman european football championship commonly refer to as the women euro will be host in switzerland be pleased to report that both the england and wales woman national team have qualify to participate in that prestigious tournament the draft contingent order before the house today propose temporary extension of licensing hour across england and wales should either england or wales or both progress to the semi final or the final of the competition specifically if either team reach these stage have to say from my limited following of football that it seem the woman team have reputation for do far well than our male team the order would extend licensing hour from pm to be on the evening of the semi final which be schedule for and july and the final which be due to take place on july as member will be aware section of the licensing act empower the secretary of state to make such an order in recognition of event of exceptional national significance the decision to lay this draft order follow public consultation conduct by the home office early this year significant of respondent support the propose extension of licensing hour for the semi final and for the final should the home nation qualify respondent also agree with the propose duration of the extension until am and support its application to both england and wales there be also consensus that the extension should apply only to the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premise the order will therefore allow licensed premise to remain open until be without the need to submit temporary event notice as northern ireland mp wish to convey my good to the english and the welsh lady team although the order will not apply to northern ireland that will not stop we cheer on the english and the welsh team on different timescale in our pub our restaurant and our cafés it be always good to see solidarity between the four nation thank the hon member for display his usual courtesy in express his good wish to the two woman team be just about to explain that the reason we be take this order forward be to reduce the administrative burden on both business and local authority save time and resource for all involve as leeds united supporter feel the need to ask what semi final or final be welcome the order do my right hon friend recognise the benefit that the increase opening hour will bring to the pub and entertainment industry and hopefully if we get that far the impact that will have on the community that support they be just about to say that business in the hospitality sector particularly pub and bar stand to benefit from this modest extension which would allow they to accommodate increase demand during these high profile fixture fully accept that the hospitality sector have have difficult time over the past few year and that this be helpful measure it be right to acknowledge that police representative have express some concern regard the potential for increase crime and disorder while operational decision on deployment and resourcing be matter for individual force be confident that appropriate measure will be take to mitigate any risk as have happen in similar case notably there have be no significant incident of large scale disorder link to previous licensing extension which be testament to the professionalism of our police service to which we owe our thank also emphasise that this be limited and proportionate two hour extension it apply solely to the sale of alcohol for consumption on the premise after pm and do not extend to off licence supermarket or other premise license only for off sale to clarify one final point if neither england nor wales reach the semi final the propose extension will not apply on or july similarly if one or both team reach the semi final but do not progress to the final normal licensing hour will apply on july also make member aware that my hon friend the member for wrexham andrew ranger be sponsor private member bill support by the government which seek to make such order subject to the negative resolution procedure in future that mean that less time will be spend particularly on the floor of the house have to agree such measure the bill have complete its committee stage in the house but will not be enact in time to apply to this summer tournament hence the need for this order to be bring before the house today should this order receive the support of the house as hope and expect it will it will reinforce the argument that debate such measure may not represent the most effective use of parliamentary time in conclusion this order have be bring forward in recognition of the significant public interest in the forthcoming tournament and in particular the hope and expectation surround the england and wales team on that note take the opportunity to wish the player of both team the very good of luck be sure they will do themselves their fan and their nation proud and commend the order to the house call the shadow minister we be delighted to support the temporary licence change as be sure be member on all side although to be fair do not think would have much choice on the matter for if ever stand at this dispatch box and oppose more time in the pub to watch football my dad would probably disown the change as the minister have outline will extend licence by two hour for venue that already have licence until pm and apply if england or wales the two qualifying team in the uefa woman euro reach semi final on or july or the final on july there be no reason we should doubt that they will reach that threshold because we be the defend champion after england magnificent performance at the tournament host in the uk at wembley the final see victory and of course it be make all the sweet by beat the germans this be fantastic time to support our local as well as our national team it be also worth take the time however to note that since the autumn budget the hospitality sector be sadly report spike in the number of pub closure that be no surprise as the chancellor raid on pub have cost they at least per full time employee sixty per cent of pub say they have cut job and three quarter say they have increase their price as direct result therefore even though the licensing change mean we might all be able to go to the pub for little long it will cost we bit more for pint and sadly for many the local might not even be in business any more now more than ever we need to support our local such as the pub that be nominate in my fylde pub of the year competition which be win by the coach horses in freckleton be sure that the two grahams who run that crack establishment will be delighted with shout out from this dispatch box but they will be even more delighted with the minister for have bit of extra time to sell some more pint of ponkys ale that just leave to finish by wish the england and wales team good luck though of course be biased and hope to be raise glass to england once again thrash germany just before call the liberal democrat spokesperson it would be remiss of not to mention my local football club crowborough and that we be family of gooners england lionesses have brilliant track record and not just on the pitch they have continue to win heart change attitude and redefine what woman sport look like in this country from their historic euro win to reach the world cup final last year they have spark cultural shift that have touch every community include mine in north cornwall in town and village across cornwall we find woman lace up their boot take to the pitch and build the next chapter of the game team such as bodmin women bude town ladies kilkhampton ladies and countless other be part of grow movement to put woman sport on an equal footing with man can not stress how vital our national team and local grassroots side be to inspire young girl to dream big when girl in place such as bude or padstow see the lionesses celebrate on the same scale as the man team it send clear message this game be for you too and you belong here that be why this licensing change really matter it might seem technical but it carry symbolic weight it will also have really positive impact on our hospitality industry at time when it be struggle with increase national insurance and business property relief change it tell the country that woman football deserve the same celebration the same energy and the same place in our national life as the man game visibility alone be not enough however at school level where lot of the passion start and lifelong love of the beautiful game be ignite only around two third of girl be get the chance to play football during physical education lesson that be unacceptable we liberal democrats believe that every young person should get at least two hour of quality physical education week back by proper facility and the right funding we also need to ensure that grassroots club such as those in north cornwall and across the country have the coaching resource and safe space they need to thrive have see the appetite in our local community at first hand we just need to match it with the support the karen carney review in offer road map for long term progress but progress must also mean equity and treat woman sport not just as an add on but as an essential part of this country culture collectively be sure that all member of this house will join in get behind the team in our village town city and school encourage the future of woman football to be write on school field and local pitch by the next generation take this opportunity to wish both wales and england the very good of luck for the tournament question put and agree to backbench business incontinence beg to move that this house have consider the matter of incontinence thank the backbench business committee and its chair the hon member for harrow east bob blackman who help secure this debate be delighted that we be debate this vital but often ignore issue during world continence week the definition of taboo be subject so difficult repulsive or offensive that it can not be mention in polite conversation and can be articulate only in hush embarrassed tone once menstruation be taboo and we be not suppose to talk about it once cancer be taboo and in some community it still be once mental health be taboo and people cover it up we can now discuss those thing more openly without embarrassment we can seek the right medical advice and treatment and we can offer support to one another and fight for decent healthcare for every aspect of the human body how do get here in this chamber talk about human bodily function this have be journey for speak in the westminster hall debate on woman health in february as physiotherapist talk about pelvic health and the importance of rehabilitation and pelvic floor exercise my word seem to have strike chord colleague resident and professional all email to thank for speak out and to share their experience it start to snowball and ask myself why be we talk about this more be advise that this be the first ever general debate on this topic in the chamber so congratulate the house what be we actually talk about we be talk about the involuntary loss of faece and urine which can be cause by pregnancy neurological condition multiple sclerosis spinal cord surgery musculoskeletal condition disability menopause prostrate relate condition and many more reason the crippling fear for patient be that it might happen at work in public or in social setting patient have tell that they feel like prisoner in their own home catch by condition that mean people avoid other do not go out can not go to work do not have relationship and feel crush sense of shame people mental health suffer to the point of serious illness our language reflect society attitude wet your knicker pee your pant or ruder variant that will not say yet we be talk about range of condition that affect million of our resident do you know madam deputy speaker that bladder and bowel incontinence be more common than hay fever the nhs estimate that million people live with bladder problem one in five of the population and it be man as well as woman the nhs say that million man experience involuntary loss of urine third of woman live with these condition right now that right third yet this be another aspect of health that be woefully unsupported and push off the agenda it affect million child and young people one in child across the uk battle these debilitate symptom include bed wet chronic constipation and soiling half million adult have bowel condition that lead to the involuntary loss of faece we have population that be get old and survive complex condition such as cancer and that will increase the prevalence of bladder and bowel dysfunction when it come to bowel condition we be talk about the involuntary loss of faecal matter which can be because of irritable bowel syndrome crohn disease or other condition such as bowel cancer have not even touch on what people suffer when they be doubly incontinent our nhs collect datum on anything and everything the number of patient with continence care need to be routinely publish and it be not my first ask of the minister and have several be why not the house will note notwithstanding the title of the debate that avoid the term incontinence and continence have speak to so many people with bladder and bowel condition and my feeling be they be the wrong word to use and they carry too much stigma to give justice to the debate have conduct roundtable with expert and patient and have share anonymous survey dawn share her story with she notice some urinary leakage year ago when she be now at the age of she speak to about her journey she do not go to the gp because she feel ashamed it get bad and she begin to see the gynaecologist she get the strength to speak to the gp who give her tablet three round of tablet do not work her symptom get bad and she be unable to leave the house the gynaecologist refer she to physiotherapist and specialist nurse ask what go wrong here it be the lack of prevention prevention prevention prevention be key physiotherapy be recommend as an integral part of woman health especially with pelvic floor dysfunction accord to the nhs long term plan physiotherapy be by far the most cost effective intervention for prevent and treat mild to moderate incontinence and prolapse insufficient physiotherapist number mean that woman who experience pelvic floor dysfunction or prolapse wait month or year or miss out on treatment entirely woman often end up need surgery that could have be avoid with early intervention dawn eventually receive specialist care and her symptom have vastly improve she only get the odd leakage here and there her advice to other be see your gp do leave it and ask for referral to see specialist have the privilege of see one such specialist service in my constituency dudley adult bladder and bowel service know as dabbs where meet patient and practitioner like ola rawlins team lead and clinical pelvic health physiotherapist who share her story which be eye opening patient tell how gps ask about bowel but seldom bladder patient leanne say she feel ignore fobbed of and misdirect one feel like prisoner ola patient feel like ball bounce around different part of the system man especially those with prostate cancer be reluctant to take part in self help group and many man do not even know they have pelvic floor and think only woman do yet symptom can be easily treat with the right intervention treatment and course of rehabilitation research show that for every spend on woman health service there be return of thank to reduction in emergency admission few miss day at work and well long term health outcome know the department of health and social care be consult on the man health strategy and trust that the minister will ensure that this aspect of man health be front and centre the dabb service call itself cinderella service the testimony of patient and professional be humble to hear but it make so angry we be let too many people down so what must change we need to talk about the taboo and we need action we need renaissance of public toilet to maintain the one we have open the one that be closed and build new one want to see bin in both man and woman toilet so people can throw these product in the bin support the boys need bins campaign by prostate cancer uk and congratulate the all party parliamentary group for bladder and bowel continence care for its work ask that this place be pioneer in this space by place bin in all man toilet we also need well food labelling so that fibre be list on product and people can understand how they can get well bowel health we need to ensure that the ai and robotic revolution in healthcare do not miss bladder and bowel care we need join up service between gps hospital clinic and patient group perhaps we could have more sympathetic and subtle signage in healthcare setting product provide outside healthcare setting could have simple label on shelf such as body care instead of incontinence product that tackle the embarrassment of be see by friend or neighbour buy they in the shop urge the minister as the year plan near publication to ensure that bladder and bowel care be include much need to change but today have five concrete ask for the minister first we need public information campaign to raise awareness and smash the stigma as recommend by dr sara webb of the royal college of midwives the nhs rightly spend million on campaign such as cancer screening the use of and sepsis awareness will the minister commit to campaign on bladder and bowel care many year ago when work in the nhs the board try to save money by change the incontinence product that people use the product be not quite the same which cause lot of distress for the people who use they as well as lot of inconvenience for the health professional work with patient particularly the district nurse team in the end it do not really save any money do my hon friend agree that it be important that people get access to the product that work for they agree that product need to be readily available and that be one of my recommendation secondly beyond awareness be prevention we need real understanding and want bladder and bowel health to form part of the school syllabus enmesh into the curriculum that be recommendation from surgeon dr robinson from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists let we give teacher the tool to teach it want this to form part of the training of all healthcare professional so that medical profession understand bladder and bowel care from their early time in the job we need specialist workforce that include physiotherapist nurse surgeon and many other can the minister commit to place this issue high on the agenda for school and to build specialist multidisciplinary workforce who have the relevant skill and knowledge thirdly we need enhance research and development on bladder and bowel condition and their treatment that do not necessarily mean vastly increase spending it could mean look at how resource could be well prioritise we can not diagnose treat and rehabilitate or look into future medical intervention if there be limited research fourthly this recommendation be from dr ashish pradhan chair of the british society of urogynaecology can the minister commit to ban mislead advertisement that send the wrong message product subject to no regulation be advertise and patient be tell to live with their symptom fifthly have recommendation from patient meet leanne could we have one stop shop in which all service be under one roof care that be close to home and cheap incontinence product they be exempt from vat if they be purchase for personal use or use by register charity but what if they be purchase by care home those be my five demand back by expert five thing that will ensure real progress look forward to the minister response lastly let say this to man woman young people and child listen to this debate you be not alone and there be no shame this subject be often surround by silence it be subject that people do not want to talk about or do not know about and that the nhs do not do enough about that end now and it end here incontinence be no respecter of person and no respecter of sex and it be male incontinence that rise to speak about the wry old joke be that man do not know they have prostate until their other half read about it in the daily mail campaign newspaper such as the daily mail and charity group like prostate buddies in my dumfries and galloway constituency have do power of work to make man aware of prostate disease and prostate cancer just as well give that prostate cancer be the most common cancer among man one in eight of we will be diagnose with it and that figure rise to one in four for black man it be well recognise that early diagnosis be key but it be less well know that as many as of those treat with surgery will face urinary incontinence outwith surgical intervention prostate cancer uk say that one in man age over will experience some form of urinary leakage every year the scale of the issue and the number of people face the problem who report feel shame embarrassment and isolation be great than many suppose the guardedly good news be that far from be alone people suffer incontinence be very large portion of society it have be another silent epidemic and people have be leave to suffer in obscurity today be part of the solution to that congratulate the hon member for dudley sonia kumar on secure the debate give her medical background defer to she for advice on what can be do to relieve the physical symptom of incontinence and much can be do accord to the american urological association well prostate treatment be cut the number of man who suffer incontinence after prostate treatment pelvic floor exercise can help both man and woman as can bladder training but what can government do aside from make health policy decision on treatment for incontinence in all its form be it suffer by man or woman and be it post op prostate relate or childbirth relate small step can help when the hon member for cheadle mr morrison ask whether there have be discussion about provide bin in man toilet for disposal of sanitaryware make necessary by incontinence minister in the department for environment food and rural affairs give rather technocratic answer promise health and safety executive review of workplace regulation date back to on the provision of disposal facility in workplace toilet in due course hope the minister can today confirm that the consultation can be fast track hope that we have take giant stride in this place today by strip away some of the stigma merely by give an airing to the issue of incontinence there have be much talk recently about parliament at its good but surely this be parliament at its good consider unfashionable yet critical issue today we bury the myth that this condition be somehow shameful with this first ever debate on the subject we take modest but significant step towards improve the life of those who struggle with the burden of incontinence big thank you to my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar for secure this extremely important debate be fascinated and not little shocked to hear that this be the first full debate in the chamber on this subject and it be absolutely tremendous that we be talk about it because we need to as everyone have recognise it be subject that people rarely talk about despite the fact that million of people be affect by bladder and bowel control issue will try to use that phrase instead of the term incontinence after hear the point that my hon friend rightly raise be scribble away when she say that for much too long this issue have be treat as private embarrassment something to whisper about not act on be strike by what she say about the number of people who get in touch with she cry out for this subject to be discuss and for we to take action we need to take action because as well as be very important health issue it be almost social justice issue and an issue of dignity far too many people and family face daily struggle that have be quietly ignore as be say it be estimate that one in three woman in the uk experience urinary control issue but the issue affect man too it be important that man speak in this debate and be very pleased that the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper do as for my city london recent survey for prostate cancer uk find that of all male londoners have experience urinary control problem more than one in four symptom as early as between the age of and that contradict the widely held view that bladder condition affect only old adult then of course we come to bowel incontinence which be more closely associate with age of those age over and live at home be affect and the figure be even high for man and woman live in residential and nursing home of course we also have to think about bladder and bowel condition affect child and young people and especially those with disability whose voice be often the last to be hear anyway and particularly the last to be hear on this subject disabled and other child with these condition can miss out on education friendship and an ordinary life because of lack of basic provision family feel ashamed when they ask for help because they think that no one else be face the same thing that bring we back to the importance of we discuss this matter in the house today many family face this issue we need to make it safe to talk about it and safe to ask for support as say bladder and bowel condition be not only health issue but social justice issue and it be time we treat they as such because that be not what happen now despite the evident human cost and the prevalence of these condition across society support and service remain inadequate and those affect and their family be leave to scramble for help they face stigma they too often endure isolation yet as my hon friend the member for dudley set out there be simple straightforward solution that would make huge difference to those who live with bladder and bowel control issue we can start by destigmatise the issue that be what we be do today as have be say at national level we need public health campaign lead by the department of health and social care that make it clear that these condition be normal treatable and nothing to be ashamed of let tell members about one of the very few people in either house that have hear talk about these condition go to meeting on assist die one of many such meeting which colleague of all party have be to at which hear from disabled member of the house of lords and other people who be disabled and wheelchair user they speak in very matter of fact way about be incontinent that be the word they use they make it quite clear that it be perfectly possible to lead normal and fulfil life with that condition when be grow up old people would say to the one thing dread above all be be incontinent think take my life if that happen it be very inspiring for to hear member of the other place talk about their situation and talk about it release all of we from particular challenge when it come to reflect on assist dying my hon friend the member for dudley mention prostate cancer uk boys need bins campaign there be other include the end bladder shame campaign by tena the maker of incontinence product these thing show what be possible if people feel hear but they need more support alongside public health campaign let we have more investment in infrastructure that mean more modern accessible public toilet with clean safe disposal facility for man as well as woman which have be long stand request from charity like age uk we need to make sure that every school mainstream school as well as specialist school have train staff who can support child with bladder and bowel condition not as an afterthought but as part of their core pastoral care we have minister from the department of health and social care on the front bench but hope she can pass on the message to her colleague in the department for education that they should make sure school toilet be accessible hygienic and inclusive with disposal bin lock and space with dignity build in finally would like to see we integrate bladder and bowel care into national health strategy they should be core part of nhs england work on long term condition ageing and preventive care not an afterthought look forward to that be reflect in the year plan and hope in the forthcoming man health strategy well bladder and bowel care will save man woman and their family from stress it will save child from shame and the feeling of be leave behind and wonderfully as my hon friend the member for dudley say it will save public money it be public good and if we take this seriously it will make huge difference to lot of people life let we give this issue the attention it deserve and do right by every person who have be live with these condition in silence for too long rise order significant number of member want to take part in the follow debate so we be play beat the clock will not introduce rigid time limit at this stage but if members could confine their speech to no more than six minute we should get everybody in get the front benchers in and give adequate time for the next debate welcome you to your place sir roger it be pleasure to see you there again it be pleasure to speak on this issue as my party health spokesperson thank the hon member for dudley sonia kumar for set the scene so incredibly well the patient and client council report accessibility and quality of continence services in northern always give perspective from northern ireland estimate that some half million people in northern ireland live with bladder control problem and some quarter of million with bowel control problem with many experience both when we remember that northern ireland population be million it put that figure into perspective the national institute for health and care excellence estimate that of man in the general population experience low urinary tract symptom and some of woman live with urinary incontinence commend the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper for focus on prostate cancer it be one of those thing that we menfolk do not wish to think or talk about he be right it be probably the wife who say to we when we have pain somewhere do you go and see the doctor about it we most definitely should go and see someone about it this debate be about raise awareness it be not topic that be openly discuss as the hon member for dudley refer to because people often feel uncomfortable discuss their symptom and problem give the personal nature of the issue have to say that feel tad uncomfortable as well as result many suffer in silence or wait long time before discuss their incontinence issue with healthcare professional only of those affect go on to seek treatment with many maybe not recognise their issue at first continence issue can be significant contributing factor to social isolation whether we like it or not many people will feel uneasy about these issue so they will withdraw into themselves and seek to deal with their problem alone which can prevent they from have normal life it be clear that we need to do more to remove any feeling of shame from continence issue include by have public conversation be very thankful that my local council ards and north down borough council serve on ards council at one time provide sanitary bin in accessible toilet across the borough include some male toilet these bin be part of wide initiative to make public toilet more inclusive particularly for individual experience incontinence or with stoma need this debate be also about those with stoma need be surprise by how many people meet who carry stoma bag they have manage to deal with that but it be not easy it scar the wit out of have to say ard and north down borough council have upgrade of its accessible toilet with feature such as shelf hook mirror and bin to accommodate stoma care my council have take that action already additionally the council be work to address the need for sanitary bin in all public toilet include male toilet where they be not currently legal requirement ard and north down borough council have already do that because it recognise that that be the right thing to do the council do this at its own cost and on its own initiative not because it legally have to but because it recognise the need this help to address the stigma but it must be uk wide approach and not simply the decision of individual council we commend ards and north down borough council it do that because it be the right thing to do not because it have to do so one in five people be affect by these issue and yet it be silent topic so it be good that we be speak about it today with the compassion the understanding and the carefulness that it require inadequate management of incontinence can lead to escalate cost due to morbidity and unnecessary hospitalisation those be the side effect it be good to see the minister for secondary care in her place because she always respond helpfully to the question we ask some million adult in the uk suffer with some form of bowel problem so it be imperative that we do thing well one in child will suffer from continence difficulty whether it be bed wet daytime wetting constipation soil or difficulty with toilet training the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman refer to that issue and it can not be ignore improve catheter care in the community would reduce attendance and hospital admission which fit well with two of the secretary of state three shift hospital to community and sickness to prevention can the government commit to implement that in co ordinate strategy colleague have flag the many change that be need and know these can not be make immediately but it be important that we move forward that we have this discourse and that we dispel the darkness of shame and shine light for those who feel isolated in the shadow today be the first step in this journey and look forward to participate in further journey thank my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar for bring this issue to the house for debate unlike she be not an experienced health professional so will narrow my contribution to the issue of public toilet their availability and their importance to those with incontinence there be people who do not go out last week and who may not go out today or next week they be those whose trip be always challenge by the lack of or uncertainty about the availability of public toilet not just those who be incontinent but those who experience any sort of urgency those with irritable bowel syndrome crohn disease or ulcerative colitis those who need to use the toilet more frequently because of age or pregnancy or because they be menstruate have have prostate cancer have stoma or other disability and those who be care for those with disability very few of we will not be affect by these vulnerability at some point during our life and we want our country to be one in which we be able to ensure dignity and the ability for those visit public space to have access to public toilet local authority have power to provide public toilet but no statutory duty to do so and this lack of compulsion have contribute to the decline in the number of public convenience as former local councillor know how stretch local authority budget be decimate through long decade of austerity and the political decision to centralise funding in my constituency which encompass the lake district national park we be very aware of the importance of good quality public toilet to support tourism and yet even there at prime visitor site such as the start of the keswick to threlkeld railway path fantastic facility for those with disability to enjoy the lake district there be insufficient money to provide public toilet just two year ago this house consider appoint commissioner for public convenience and make it statutory duty for local authority to have public convenience plan be not sure why something so simple would require the creation of commissioner but like so many plan under the last government it never come to pass ask the new government to look again at establish statutory requirement on local authority in the meantime invite hon member across the house to lobby their own local authority to ensure that they create review and scrutinise public convenience plan and make public space accessible to those for whom quality public toilet be the difference between inclusion and exclusion recent survey by the association for public service excellence find that over third of local authority have reduce their provision of public toilet over the past decade we know that provision have be decline even before then but it be not all bad news half of the council that respond in the survey do provide change place toilet congratulate the campaign organisation change places which have lobby so long and so hard to seek provision for the quarter of million people in the uk and their family and carer who have for so long be condemn to loneliness at home by the lack of accessible public toilet facility the late count of change place toilet in the uk be the campaign will have be instrumental in the building regulation require all new public building to put in large and well equip toilet facility many local authority have ensure provision in creative and economical way through community toilet scheme and payment or rate reduction for business that open their toilet facility to the public local authority can make planning permission lease and premise licence subject to the provision of public toilet and they can hand facility over to community operator these be not always suitable or appropriate substitute for standard public toilet provide and maintain by the local authority but as part of portfolio of provision they help to increase access and often help to circumnavigate some of the issue of graffiti and inappropriate use that present problem for some community urge all hon member to engage with our local authority and impress upon they how important it be for the public to be adequately provide with high quality well maintain facility look to member participate in today debate to join in call upon this government to draw up statutory measure provide public toilet that support the most vulnerable people in our community should be duty not an option congratulate my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar on secure today important debate have recently become the chair of the appg for bladder and bowel continence care and there be much to be do as someone with background in early year be sure that any parent of young child will confirm that we be probably the people who talk about wee and poo the most in this world they tell we vital health information from the early day of have baby it be crucial bladder function be one of the sign of good health and maintain that through adulthood lead to the prevention of incontinence the importance of talk about wee and poo can not be overstate as any three year old will tell you that be because it be funny wee and poo be the funniest topic in nursery classroom up and down the country and it be funny right up until the point that it be not when wee and poo stop be funny it be devastating it impact on people mental and physical health their dignity and their very independence in some case it can prove fatal it be also entirely preventable sadly poo and wee be not funny for around million people who have continence and incontinence issue that figure alone hide some of the issue of deal with the enormous range of health condition in the field of continence the figure of million be base on datum gather in and no recent datum be available continence status datum be not record as standard on enter the nhs the scale of the problem be simply unquantifiable the nice guideline have not be review and the finding of the report excellence in continence care have not be fully implement we need strong mandate and great focus on training for incontinence need across midwifery dementia cancer care and health visit team literally from cradle to grave and we need to provide that care in our community to avoid the need for crisis intervention in today will highlight just couple of the complication from fail to provide robust continence service despite spend large amount of my time surround by and occasionally cover in poo and wee do not arrive in parliament intend to take on this role have be make aware for many year of the woeful lack of help for those with continence issue the poverty cause by buy continence product and the rationing of four pad day have face the frustration of parent who have no continence service in warwickshire at all until may have be aware of the trauma face by parent especially those whose child have special educational need and disability attend with their child constipation which have reach agonising and dangerous level it be however elissa and ivan story that motivate to take on my role and campaign for more humane systemic change to prevent the bad impact of continence issue so many simple thing can be do to protect the dignity and independence and improve the quality of life of these million people when ivan arrive at he be scream and in pain his stomach be distend and he be severely underweight for his age he have spend month in pain attend around four time week he be discharge without treatment but elissa do not leave she do not accept the shocking assessment from consultant that disabled child just scream she push back and with sheer luck one of ivan other consultant happen to see they and give instruction for an ray on the final day they evacuate nearly kg of stool from kg three year old child elissa believe that that day save ivan life other have not be so lucky in people with learn difficulty die from constipation when under continence care out of all the death of people with learn difficulty more than quarter be also suffer from constipation and bowel issue that would be worthy of note unsurprisingly we do not even hold the datum for the wide population on these issue continence and constipation issue be increase in our young population at worrying rate with strong correlation between constipation continence issue and neurodiversity one in four of our child who start school be not yet ready to use toilet independently and on average hour of learn time be lose every day in support child go to the toilet toilete issue even in nursery cause embarrassment and anxiety which often lead to functional constipation damage the bowel and cause lifelong continence issue get it right from the start be hugely important child with continence issue be often exclude from school activity and parent be require to take time off work consequently eric charity that specialise in support child with continence issue whose representative be coincidentally here today to celebrate and draw attention to world continence week note that in the of baby be out of nappy by month new research identify the benefit of child who start potty training early and be out of nappy by month but the health visit team number be at disgraceful all time low that be national shame as be the outdated nice guideline the message be not get through and parent simply do not know where to turn for the right support especially in place like warwickshire where continence care be simply unavailable hospital admission for childhood continence issue and constipation have increase by in over decade with child admit this year alone the decimation of health visitor number and school nurse and the demolition of institution such as sure start leave carer and family without the infrastructure and support need to train child to toilet independently and for constipation to be recognise before it become life threatening increase data collection be essential and the nice guideline need to be heavily review and mandate in healthcare so that we can make saving in crisis team if we intend to move care to the community and move from crisis to prevention continence care have to be central focus of that mission thank my constituency neighbour hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar for secure this important debate and for attempt to remove the stigma and silence that too often surround this key area of healthcare as have be mention in the uk over million people experience bladder leakage and more than million people around one in struggle with bowel control however those figure be probably not true reflection of the reality as many individual choose not to disclose their symptom often because of embarrassment or in the mistaken belief that incontinence be simply an inevitable part of ageing want to talk about how woman suffer from incontinence have be treat in the past because we need to focus on the availability of proper treatment option for the future for far too long vaginal mesh surgery be widely accept as the so call gold standard to treat stress urinary incontinence in woman between its introduction in and when its use be pause in it be believe that over woman in the uk underwent mesh implant procedure sadly many of they be not properly advise about the alternative option available to treat stress urinary incontinence such as the physiotherapist supervise pelvic floor exercise that my hon friend mention nor about the risk associate with use vaginal mesh and some of they sustain life change injury before become an mp work as solicitor specialise in represent woman who have be affect by vaginal mesh implant and pursue claim for compensation for they base on clinical negligence come across woman who be leave in constant pain unable to work or participate in daily aspect of life their personal relationship be affect and their life be change forever by treatment that be suppose to help they commend the work of baroness cumberlege in her landmark july report first do no harm which recommend that the government should immediately issue full apology on behalf of the healthcare system to the family affect by mesh she also propose set up scheme to meet the cost of provide additional care and support to those who experience avoidable harm and network of specialist centre to provide comprehensive treatment care and advice for those affect by mesh implant subsequent report by dr henrietta hughes release in february through the patient safety commissioner recommend government financial and non financial redress scheme for all those affect by mesh look ahead it be critical that current recommend treatment for incontinence be subject to the high clinical scrutiny and that we take step to ensure that no more patient be harm in the pursuit of quick fix or one size fit all solution at the heart of every treatment plan must be the dignity safety and informed choice of the patient treatment must be tailor to the type and severity of each individual condition not determine by cost effectiveness alone patient outcome not just financial metric must be central to how we define value in care for incontinence patient we must break the stigma surround the issue recent study find that around of woman have experience urinary incontinence yet only of they have seek professional help poor continence care as have already be mention can lead to complication such as infection social isolation and in some case hospital admission each of those outcome be completely avoidable with early intervention and treatment which be something that we must aim for in our healthcare system only by tackle the taboo invest in well treatment pathway and listen to the voice of those affect can we ensure that people live with incontinence be able to access the support they need and to do so with the dignity that they deserve commend my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar on secure this important debate it be great to have her experience of have work as an nhs physio in the chamber and she bring unique perspective to the issue thank my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss for mention the pelvic mesh scandal soon after my election as mp for harlow number of woman who be victim of the pelvic mesh scandal come to see now over dozen woman have approach about it and that be just in the harlow constituency so that give we an idea about the huge number of woman who have be affect by this terrible scandal do not want to focus on the pelvic mesh scandal alone not least because my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west do it far more justice than would whether people be the victim of national scandal or they have bladder and bowel issue for any of the other reason that my hon friend the member for dudley mention nobody should be make to feel embarrassed talk to the woman who be victim of the pelvic mesh scandal be strike by the journey they go on when they initially have bladder and bowel problem they feel really embarrassed and it be only when they get to the point where they be in almost constant pain do they feel that they could come forward what terrible situation for people to be so embarrassed that they feel that they can not come forward to the gp we have to end that stigma be not go to do so but as we be in safe space have decide to mention my own experience of suffer from ibs as young person it be almost joke when we go on must make sure we be near toilet so that chris can go actually that should not be stigma it be medical condition and people should understand it support it and give other the support to deal with it to show solidarity with those who suffer from bladder and bowel issue urinary incontinence impact an estimate million in the uk as many member have say already if people suffer from such issue they should not think that they be the only person to be suffer from they quick math calculation tell that that equate to roughly people per constituency so significant number of our constituent will suffer from those issue the cost to the nhs to deal with these issue be roughly billion year and wonder whether that bill would come down if we give confidence to people who suffer from they to come forward soon have allude to some of the symptom but there be loss of dignity and independence and sense of social isolation my hon friend the member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours mention people who no long go out because they be embarrassed what terrible situation for they to be in and one that be entirely avoidable if we could help to reduce the embarrassment and stigma that people feel join my hon friend the member for dudley in ask the minister about the collection of datum on those impact by the issue and support the need for public health campaign thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for mention stoma young friend have stoma and have speak to she about it be sure she would welcome end the stigma associate with that want to briefly mention woman health recognise the vital contribution make by the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper about the impact on man but welcome the fact that health ministers in this government have champion the importance of health equality hear number of story from woman in harlow who feel that they be not take seriously and hope that we can address that and that the minister will respond to that in she sum up finally thank my hon friend the member for dudley for bring this hugely important debate to the house agree with sentiment raise by member from across the house that this be the first step in end the stigma hope we can work together to end the stigma and embarrassment know that this be just the start thank my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar for bring this debate can not quite believe it be the first time that the house have debate this issue also fully endorse her suggest recommendation to improve bladder and bowel care and hope that the minister will also endorse they as we have hear today incontinence affect people of all age across all community it be still shroud in stigma and embarrassment and it disrupt so many people daily activity such as go to school go to work go out for the day go out for the night and go on holiday it really need to be tackle at so many level to echo the remark of my hon friend the member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours one way in which we need to address this issue be by ensure that we have enough accessible toilet in public place workplace and school with the necessary facility include sanitary bin for incontinence product for all user in my constituency we have just restore one of the set of toilet in our main public park castle park after justified outcry at their closure adequate public toilet provision be just one response to this complex crisis but as my hon friend the member for dudley say other measure be need to tackle it again congratulate she on be the first person to bring this issue to public attention in the house and look forward to work with she on it thank my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar for secure this incredibly important debate it have be absolutely wonderful listening to how it have be conduct as have be say this debate be often overlook and it be occur in world continence week bladder and bowel control issue be taboo and embarrassing so thank my hon friend the member for harlow chris vince for share his experience he will not be alone and be sure there be many in this chamber who have suffer the same thing as have our constituent we need to talk openly about this issue we can not hide it in silence as it affect so many people one in three woman in the uk have urinary incontinence issue and half of those be likely to suffer from it due to pregnancy childbirth or hormonal change link to the menopause another taboo topic let we go through the stage and where some issue still remain how be bladder and bowel control issue detect and diagnose refer to my hon friend the member for dudley for her expertise but the university of aberdeen have find that invasive bladder pressure test which be often painful and incredibly uncomfortable be not necessarily necessary researcher have find that non invasive testing include the thing that my hon friend have describe such as pelvic floor exercise should be make more available to patient that be just one of the issue another issue be surgical implant refer to my hon friend the member for wolverhampton west warinder juss for his incredible expertise on this topic and thank he for the work he do to help to protect woman the complication that have affect hundred if not thousand of woman who be rightly outraged have be describe as barbaric we must do more to see that those woman be compensate but no amount of compensation will ever make up for the year of pain and physical and emotional damage this issue need to be treat with respect and care and the treatment option need to be empower so that people feel they can be empower to prevent these thing from occur pay tribute to the boys need bins campaign which have speak with it have be absolutely incredible because man too suffer from incontinence we need bin in public space how can we help people to live their life to the full my hon friend the member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours who be no long in his place make the point that austerity and cut to local government mean that many public toilet have be close thankfully in my area of gravesham the local council have increase the number of public toilet include by open one by the bus hub so that people know about they and can plan regular break if they be need we need to ensure that there be space so that people feel empower and confident to leave their home because we can not have more people who stand alone pay tribute to my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar for raise this very important subject my hon friend the member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours and other mention the importance of great and well provision of public convenience do my hon friend agree that we need to encourage cafés and other organisation in town centre to make well provision for people suffer from these issue perhaps some of the campaign that have be allude to can help to make those space available they should by no mean replace what public convenience should do but have such place in town centre can assist vulnerable people agree the community toilet scheme in gravesham have be good success however the issue of course come down to vandalism council can not see this as an easy way to cut money it need to be statutory duty so support the bid of my hon friend the member for penrith and solway to make it statutory duty to provide public toilet in those space no one deserve to be lonely or lock in at home so hope that this debate be the first step to open the door again thank my hon friend the member for dudley for bring this issue to the attention of the world call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be pleasure to see you back in the chair mr deputy speaker thank the hon member for dudley sonia kumar for secure this important debate and for outline the issue so well in her opening speech particularly the importance of break down the taboo surround incontinence and the social isolation that can result from it have carefully scribble out the term incontinence all the way through my speech and hopefully replace it with bladder and bowel control if have miss one recognise the importance of prevention and specialist treatment the hon member for dudley highlight the benefit to both individual and taxpayer from invest in woman health up front and echo that call there have be lot of excellent contribution but thank the hon member for wolverhampton west warinder juss for raise the scandal of pelvic mesh implant thank he for highlight that issue and the need for redress there incontinence or bladder and bowel control issue can have hugely detrimental impact on person wellbeing and sense of dignity as we have hear despite affect million of people across the uk it be the subject of stigma and the need of those with bladder and bowel control issue be not properly consider in many aspect of life all too often people suffer from these issue be leave without the right support whether that be the uncomfortable bladder pressure test that the hon member for gravesham dr sullivan refer to or the lack of access to sanitary bin in public and workplace toilet it have be widely assume for many year that sanitary bin for man be not require in public toilet facility as we have hear many million of man be affect by bladder and bowel control issue the absence of sanitary bin have wholly unnecessary and damaging impact on their self esteem cause embarrassment and stress and as we have hear withdrawal from public place and the workplace the cost be tiny but the benefit for those affect can be significant there have be progress in this area thank to the work of campaign such as boys need bins by prostate cancer uk but there be much furth to go that be why it be crucial that we support all individual with the condition by ensure access to service such as public toilet and sanitary bin as unfortunately that be not the case under the last government of public toilet facility nearly lose their local authority maintenance and funding between and alone liberal democrat research from council find that the number of public toilet have fall by from to many local authority be on the verge of bankruptcy and do not have the spare capacity for these vital service proper funding of local authority to provide service such as public toilet and sanitary bin could make truly meaningful difference for people with bladder and bowel control issue and hope the whole house will agree that these individual deserve access to basic facility there be also clear need for more research into develop well treatment and mitigation for people suffer from bladder and bowel control issue crucially these should avoid unnecessary discomfort or invasive procedure as such support what the hon member for gravesham have say the university of aberdeen have find that woman with ongoing urinary incontinence can avoid invasive bladder pressure test and that non invasive assessment work just as well in guide treatment an emphasis on respect people dignity and reduce discomfort should be at the heart of how we approach the testing treatment and mitigation of these issue we also know that these issue particularly bowel incontinence can place significant strain on family carer carry out personal care who be often under support and suffer from ill health themselves many care request go unmet last year the king fund estimate that nearly third of request for local government funding result in no support for care at home this mean that there be many thousand of family struggle with the reality of care for love one with bladder and bowel control issue which can include not only feeling of shame and embarrassment both for they and for their love one but difficulty with lift and move family member to clean they and in access the equipment necessary to cope that be why deal with the crisis in social care should be top priority for the government when the secretary of state phone and presumably the other national party health spokespeople over the christmas break to let know that he be instigate the casey review and cross party talk to find long term solution to that crisis be hugely encourage since then the casey review have be delay and the cross party talk have apparently be cancel must stress that each party give its view to baroness casey be not the same as sit in the same room and agree long term funding plan the review term of reference will not deliver meaningful reform until the next parliament and there be huge risk that again nothing will be do by the government of the day in this case despite they have huge majority to achieve whatever they want meanwhile the number of people need care increase every year and the step change require to transform the sector become large and less politically palatable as such urge the minister to speak to the secretary of state and help he to recover the enthusiasm for change that he show over christmas because he will have my full support however there be simple step that can make difference now such as hospital work with family carer ahead of discharge to ensure that they be equip to carry out heighten personal care need in many place that support be not deliver let alone ongoing support and meaningful respite care wait time for continence assessment vary across the country it can take week and week improve those wait time would ensure that the right care and equipment be available much soon there be also chronic shortage of speech and language therapist who can make real difference in help people with limited or no speech to more easily communicate when they need the toilet or want to be change or wash that be particularly essential in case in which those people suffer from bladder and bowel control issue incontinence be not properly reflect in how we organise pay social care for instance too often the pay for domiciliary carer and the time they be expect to care for any one person do not reflect the fact that someone need for care might vary hugely from day to day any embarrassment frustration and discomfort for the person be care for will only be make bad if their carer be rush stress and overwork and if spend long at one house could mean that those carer be effectively have to work for free also want to highlight the importance of good care in hospital setting nhs england excellence in continence care guidance state that pathway of care should be commission that ensure early assessment effective management of incontinence along with other bladder and bowel problem such as constipation and urinary tract infection and their impact on social physical and mental well be highlight this because my constituent trevor collins die on may as result of aspiration pneumonia and small bowel ileus due to small bowel obstruction cause by constipation the coroner conclude that neglect at royal shrewsbury hospital and failure to manage mr collins constipation contribute to his avoidable death it be essential that healthcare setting follow the nice guideline that be in place not only to preserve dignity but to prevent serious harm and in the bad case even death liberal democrats recognise the seriousness of the issue surround all type of incontinence and bladder and bowel control issue and the critical importance of ensure that people with those condition can live in dignity the minister will have hear the call in my speech hope she will commit to repair our broken social care system reinstate cross party talk and wrap up the casey review this year so that we can make the reform that be necessary for long term stability in the sector and the dignity of all those receive and provide care call the opposition front bencher thank you very much mr deputy speaker welcome you to your place today it be an honour to speak in this debate on behalf of his majesty opposition and pay tribute to the hon member for dudley sonia kumar for secure it her speech include the wealth of experience that she bring to the topic and especially congratulate she on put this issue so clearly on the agenda today in the house it be powerful and wide range speech that demonstrate the wide range of issue and condition that can lead to incontinence as the hon member for nuneaton jodie gosling tell we early incontinence be condition that affect around million people across the uk yet too often it remain misunderstood under discuss and worse still dismiss one in three woman experience urinary incontinence and half million adult live with bowel incontinence incontinence do not discriminate whether bladder or bowel temporary or chronic or mild or severe it touch people of all age background and walk of life it affect new mother people recover from surgery those with neurological condition the elderly and even child however too many suffer in silence hold back by stigma isolation or the belief that nothing can be do like other member receive some heartbreaking story from my constituent in farnham bordon haslemere liphook and the surround village incontinence be medical issue not personal failing it be not something to be ashamed of it be something to be address through compassion awareness and proper care the impact of incontinence can be profound it affect people confidence their work their relationship and their mental health that be why continence week which we be currently mark matter we can not expect people to reach out for help unless we first create culture where they feel safe and support in do so we also need to ensure that service be in place to respond when they do seek help that mean well access to continence nurse urologist and physiotherapist such as the hon member for dudley it mean invest in community support and in research and innovation and recognise that continence care be core part of our health system not an afterthought therefore welcome the government state ambition to tackle inequality in woman health and to address condition such as incontinence more seriously but warm word and long term ambition be not enough when so many continue to struggle for example the excellence in continence care guidance first publish in be groundbreaking piece of work but we now need clear next step funding and measurable outcome we must not allow this to drift for another seven year while million suffer in silence under the previous conservative government we deliver real and lasting progress in this area in we publish england first ever woman health strategy genuine turning point shape by listen to more than woman voice that strategy commit to trauma inform care expand research and crucially improve the quality and accessibility of information on the nhs website so that woman could make informed choice about their own health under our leadership woman health hub be launch with clear mandate to exist in every integrate care system bring service close to community and break down barrier to care we also ensure the creation of specialist mesh centre across england deliver multidisciplinary regionally base care for woman face the severe consequence of surgical complication at recent roundtable attend with lecturer from bath university on mesh primodo and valproate it be clear that there be still more work to do to support these woman and to learn from the past thank the hon member for wolverhampton west warinder juss and for harlow chris vince for raise the mesh scandal so passionately early on incontinence the conservative government back national institute for health and care research funding for vital research into patient report outcome measure empower patient improve clinical care and ensure that the live experience be properly reflect in decision making as my hon friend the member for dumfries and galloway john cooper so powerfully elucidate early man be often forget in this area on the opposition benches we support any culture and any step that will help man with incontinence as the hon member for strangford jim shannon mention we man be pretty poor at go for diagnosis and treatment and that need to change the scale of the issue remain significant nearly half of woman experience incontinence after childbirth and one in experience faecal incontinence yet only seek help that be often because they be tell subtly or directly that it be simply part of ageing or the price of motherhood that attitude be unacceptable then and must not be tolerate now when third of woman suffer pelvic floor disorder after give birth and still face barrier to care when man live with incontinence be afraid to leave their home and when people be force to depend on charity for access to basic hygiene product it be clear that we have public health problem that transcend mere inconvenience will the department commit to publish an update excellence in continence care strategy this year with clear timeline and accountability will we see dedicated funding to expand woman health hub far so that continence care be core service not bolt on will the minister also bring forward plan for well health service for male incontinence will nhs england guarantee national consistency of access to continence service and product end the unacceptable postcode lottery will the government protect and grow funding for continence research to improve treatment for man and woman finally pay tribute to the organisation include bladder and bowel uk prostate cancer uk and the urology foundation that be break taboo and support patient so tirelessly but it be not their responsibility alone the government must lead we conservative make start and we now need the current government to have the same urgency ambition and delivery to ensure that these hard win improvement be build upon so that no one be leave to struggle in silence it be pleasure to see you in the chair mr deputy speaker you have do an excellent job of make sure that all back benchers get to contribute to this afternoon important debate will have to cut some of my comment but hopefully will get to address everybody point we be have this debate during world continence week and congratulate my hon friend the member for dudley sonia kumar on secure it there could not be more appropriate time to raise awareness of this issue million of man woman young people and child be live with bowel and bladder problem incontinence be an issue that robs people of their dignity as we hear from my hon friend the members for chelsea and fulham ben coleman and for harlow chris vince and too many suffer in silence as my hon friend the member for dudley rightly say this subject be taboo and congratulate she on secure her first debate in the chamber it be great to have her expertise in this area all continence problem can be debilitate and life change they affect wide range of care group and can be particular concern for old people in recent year public discussion and awareness have open up the advertising of product have become slightly more commonplace help people to normalise these issue with which so many people live from day to day however we be still very long way from be society that support people with incontinence to live without stigma as these issue affect people of all age we need to recognise that different approach be require we hear an excellent contribution from the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper who raise that point as do the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford the hon member for strangford jim shannon talk about child and my hon friend the member for nuneaton jodie gosling talk passionately about people with learn disability there be no one size fit all approach to manage incontinence but dignity and compassion must be at the heart of the care provide that be why we be introduce reform to put the patient at the heart of the care pathway and the decision make process around it the year health plan and its focus on the three shift need to deliver modern nhs move from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention will benefit people at risk of develop incontinence and those already live with it for example prevent type diabete or help people into remission will help to reduce the number of people who develop continence problem as they go through life we have hear many contribution about woman health nhs england have establish perinatal pelvic health service which focus on the prevention identification and timely treatment of range of issue antenatally and for at least month after birth the initiative aim to support woman who experience trauma during childbirth include condition such as urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse as note by my hon friend the member for gravesham dr sullivan in addition

parliament many member of this house support woman through the horror of mesh implant and we be move that issue forward by move from sickness to prevention the government want to shorten the amount of time people spend in ill health and to prevent illness before they happen although prevention be extremely important we must also ensure that those live with incontinence receive the good possible care wherever they live key part of that involve the nhs provide high quality guidance on how to care for people live with incontinence the national institute for health and care excellence have

problem these pathway will take account of the impact of urinary tract infection on social physical and mental wellbeing to reduce expensive pad usage high cost complication and unnecessary hospital and care home admission as we have hear our focus on the shift from hospital to community will drive more joint work in neighbourhood between primary care pharmacy community healthcare and social care to help people manage incontinence at home this will help they to access the right self care and the right professional support so they be not pass from service provider to service provider it will also reduce their need for emergency hospital admission as we hear from my hon friend the member for nuneaton my hon friend the member for penrith and solway markus campbell savours make some

committee for grant the opportunity to secure this debate and all hon member who support the application for it the debate be particularly poignant because this week we mark the royal life saving society national drowning prevention week it be timely moment to speak not just of tragedy but of our responsibility and of opportunity every year over people in this country drown many of they just metre from safety in the last three year alone almost child have lose their life by drown that be the equivalent of five full classroom of young people their future snatch away by accident that in so

range of stroke and demonstrate self rescue technique but if that alone be enough we would not be here today debate this issue under the shadow of so many lost life the policy on the national curriculum be of course welcome but policy be only as good as the difference it make so how effective be it sport england report estimate that just of child now leave school able to swim metre that be down since before the pandemic the gap be one not just of ability either but of social class only of child from low income family can swim metre compare that to of child from more affluent background the result be that child from the most deprived area be twice as likely to drown thank my hon friend for give way and for raise the important issue of teach child to swim like he represent coastal community two year ago in hastings and rye the silverdale primary school pool close many child and parent miss that facility and hundred of parent have join in support the campaign to get the school pool at silverdale back open do he agree that we need an increase in school swimming lesson and facility not their roll back thank my hon friend for make that salient point have no doubt that occurrence like the one we have hear about in her constituency be part of the reason why few child be now able to swim wish she every success in her campaign thank my constituency neighbour for give way want to make similar point to the hon member for hastings and rye helena dollimore number of school in my constituency have close their pool over the past year when grow up in lewisham have access to school pool do he agree that we need to work together on national policy to ensure that although some school pool will still close our young people can access their local leisure facility at discount rate through local government thank my constituency neighbour for make that point there be great need to work in partnership we simply do not have as many pool as we use to be they local authority run or within school themselves but we should be work towards either increase the number where possible or share these vital resource in our community add to those inequality there be ethnic inequality statistically black child be three time more likely to drown than white child water safety education can not be leave to chance or to postcode it be vital provision for every part of an island nation such as ours and should not depend on the lottery of family income school funding or private access to lesson let tell the house about joe abbess joe from shole in southampton be bright responsible and fit year old young man he be an ambitious trainee chef at the local college and work part time at southampton football club he be the kind of teenager that any parent would be proud of someone who follow the rule and lead by example he be caring and loyal friend who be well know in his friendship group as the dad figure on may joe and his friend go for day at bournemouth beach they be swim waist high in the sea as joe who be strong swimmer have do many many time before they be between the safety flag in full view of lifeguard but in an instant rip current turn their fun into tragedy the water be very suddenly over their head joe get into difficulty and be pull far out into the water before disappear beneath it eleven people be rescue from the water that day because of that rip current and commend the emergency service for their action however tragically joe and year old sunnah khan do not survive the coroner report that it be an accident devastating and fatal act of nature however the coroner also report that rip current can occur anywhere along the uk coastline at any time how many people especially child know that how many member in this chamber would understand recognise and rightly respond to rip current on sunny day such as those we be enjoy at the moment many will rightly want to enjoy our river and beach we must do everything we can to ensure that they can do so safely commend the hon gentleman for secure this debate he be right to bring up the issue of water safety education sometimes even strong swimmer can unfortunately get into difficulty do he feel there be role for education ministers and local council to identify where the problem be whether they be in the sea surround the united kingdom or in our lake unfortunately some people have jump into the lake in my constituency without know there be obstruction in the water to give one example do the hon gentleman feel that there should be great partnership work between the department and council to identify those problem so that those who go swimming know exactly what to watch out for thank the hon gentleman for the very relevant point he make will come on to the issue of how we can ensure that education be locally target each of the situation we face in our constituency will be that little bit different so it be important that on top of compulsory expectation there be locally target campaign we would not let someone drive car without first pass their theory test so why do not we comprehensively and consistently teach our child about water safety before they enter the water to have fun this be not about take away that fun it be about be aware of the hide threat and therefore have the power to do something about it pay tribute to joe mother vanessa abbess who be pleased be present in the gallery today ness have become tireless campaigner send hundred of letter to local school work with the royal life saving society and the royal national lifeboat institution and push for improved signage in bournemouth she bring her powerful story to parliament early this week when we establish the all party parliamentary group on water safety education ness have do all that in the hope that no other family should suffer as the abbess family have the coroner report be submit to the secretary of state in october last year the coroner say an ideal opportunity to warn and inform all member of the public would be through educate child of the risk the lack of provide education to child around these risk through the national classroom curriculum could lead to future death the report also state that urgent action should be take to prevent future death and that the department for education have the power to take such action warmly welcome the secretary of state response to the coroner report in which she commit to look carefully at what more can be do to support school to provide water safety education to all pupil and to give full consideration to include requirement that all pupil should be teach about water safety include the water safety code urge the government today to uphold that commitment and to go far as have become clear we need to do more than just teach swimming as hon member have highlight access to pool be uneven lesson vary in quality and duration and too many child especially in deprived or minority community be be leave behind the department for education state all pupil should be teach to swim and how to be safe in and around water well yes they should but be say they should really enough at this point do not believe so we can and we must go far we need to mandate classroom base water safety education in every school pay tribute to many people who have campaign on this before include rebecca ramsay from chorley who secure some concession under the previous government however she have recently say that change be not come quickly enough for her son dylan for joe for sunnah and for too many other ask the government to tackle this issue with the urgency that it deserve the royal life saving society have already create high quality classroom resource that be cost effective and prove to improve child understanding and confidence around water it reach everyone through its water smart schools campaign its splash safety at your pad campaign and its lifesaving training accreditation and award regardless of background or access to swimming pool these resource offer lesson for life let we not leave it to chance let we bring those resource into the heart of our curriculum look forward to the minister response although recognise that her responsibility lie within education include in the recommendation be some wide point that ask she to convey back to government first there be currently no minister for water safety or drown prevention in the uk despite have ministers for fire safety road safety and other preventable public danger and despite scotland and wales have dedicated water safety ministerial role why do england not have such role the national water safety forum and the world health organisation have both urge the uk government to appoint such ministers and echo that call today the coroner note that one in four child still do not receive any swimming education and that number have almost certainly worsen since the pandemic secondly ask the government to commit to national swimming and water safety strategy base on up to date evidence about child access across this country to swimming lesson and water safety education thirdly my major request be that when the national curriculum be update follow the current review and be then teach in every school as mandate in the children wellbeing and schools bill will the government use that opportunity to enshrine water safety as core compulsory part of every child education the point of the curriculum be not just to pass exam it be to prepare our young people for life if labour mission be to break down barrier to opportunity here be just about the great opportunity that we can offer they the opportunity to learn and to live do the hon member agree that there be more to this than just teach child to swim hope cove life boat in my constituency save about people from drown every year and many of they have be sweep out to sea because of wind and tide understand the nature of the sea and how dangerous it can be be crucial it be not just about know how to swim but about know how to survive at sea fully agree with the hon lady as commend the emergency service that rush to the scene on that fateful day in bournemouth commend the project that she have mention in her constituency in closing no child should drown simply because they be not teach how to recognise the danger it be essential to teach child how to swim yes but it be not enough we must teach they how to survive in different context the coroner warning be chill in its clarity further death will occur unless action be take so today ask the government please to act now and make classroom base water safety education compulsory part of the national curriculum not an optional extra not postcode lottery but guarantee lifesave entitlement for every child in every school in every constituency in every part of the country the time to act be now before any more life be lose rise order this be very important subject there be some member at least who wish to contribute to the debate allow eight minute each for the wind up and couple of minute for the hon gentleman who have just speak think we be look at time limit of about five minute each will not set formal time limit at the moment but if hon member try to stick to that we should get everybody in take your steer on that mr deputy speaker thank the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey for secure this debate and declare an interest as new vice chair of the all party parliamentary group on water safety member will know that there will always be moment in our career that will forever be etch in our memory we can only hope that they be moment of joy but sadly be here to talk about moment of tragedy that moment be on december which will always remember this moment of great tragedy impact my constituent in meriden and solihull east on that day four young boy be play near babbs mill lake which have be ice over they be finlay butler eight year old samuel butler his brother six year old thomas stewart year old and jack johnson year old they be play near the ice feed duck as the coroner later report jack be with one group and finlay sam and thomas be play together with another group one of the boy decide to go on to the ice it be finlay who fall in first and then thomas and jack try to help sadly nobody see samuel fall in the boy be shout for help but the witness could not reach they in time pay tribute to the emergency service who reach the location within minute they ignore their own safety advice take off their body armour and take out their baton and they use their fist to try to break through the ice one officer who jump in be neck deep in the water and have to be treat for cold water shock as the coroner and the police report any moment long and we could have have another tragedy on our hand the water be too deep and sadly none of the boy survive what strike be the suddenness of this tragedy that be why be talk about it today suppose all tragedy be sudden but this be december two week before christmas be not sure any of we can fathom what the parent of the two brother or the family of the other go through and do not know whether they will ever be able to come to term with it what happen be particularly important to my community in north solihull because in kingshurst fordbridge and smith wood which use to be in my constituency the community come together remember go to the vigil and tribute in the week after these boy be massively central to their school community and the wide community and could see how much pain and hurt they be go through everyone come together and the collective grief pain and sadness have stay with be remind of it every year because sadly every christmas still hear of child play on the lake when it be iced over as the coroner report the temperature that day be around remember where be and it feel lot colder the water be lot cold than the hon member for southampton itchen talk about education be key and agree with all the request he make want to put on record that will work very closely with he on this because believe it to be cross party issue it be certainly not partisan issue cold water shock be something that know very little about the coroner say that within minute the boy would have suffer fatal brain damage which be what happen when the tragedy happen remember come to the house have do lot of medium interview remember after one interview when the story break that one of the child have just perish member across the house come to pay tribute to the community in north solihull that include the prime minister who within minute of the story breaking have call to find out whether there be anything that could be do he also pay tribute to the community at prime minister question for this be really personal debate because see the pain when people in solihull talk about this incident there be not anyone in the midland or across the country who when talk to they about the four child do not remember what happen when be talk to member about why would be speak today and about those four lad who pass away in solihull it be clear that everyone remember what happen ultimately this issue come down to education write to sir nick gibb in the previous government and speak to he about try to update the curriculum but sadly we be not able to get that do write to the education secretary few month ago and do not get response so hope the minister can give some indication of action in this area or perhaps the hon member for southampton itchen when he wind up can do so this issue be so important and know that the minister agree be really keen to ensure that we get the curriculum change so on behalf of my family in north solihull and the family of finlay sam jack and thomas will the minister please work to ensure that we avoid these tragedy in future welcome you to your place mr deputy speaker be very grateful to my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey for secure this debate water safety education be particularly important for my constituency of oxford east for several reason we have many body of water in oxford which can be very cold as in many other constituency because of hide depth we also have in many case poor access for rescue vehicle and many of those body of water contain submerge obstacle we also have in oxford young population that be exuberant and fun loving of course that be wonderful thing but celebration in my city too often turn to tragedy as we see most recently with promising student wesley akum ojong regrettably can not mention every tragic case from oxford but mention he because understand that he have aspire to become britain young prime minister and have to say that judge by his many achievement do not think it would have be long before he would have be elbow we out of the way he be an incredible young man pay tribute to he and to his friend and family and to all those who have lose love one in my city from drown oxford be also highly prone to flooding and it be often difficult for people to assess how deep floodwater be and where obstacle be submerge well education about the potential danger of the water be imperative it need to be part of broad suite of initiative from effective signage to access to supervised swimming like oxford city council free swimming programme for and where required and feasible physical restriction there be in my city be sure this apply in other constituency represent here vigorous debate over the right of wild swimmer to access waterway that have be deem to be unsafe understand wild swimmer contention that they will often be swim together that they do not tend to dive into the water and that they be experience swimmer but they be of course still at risk include from effluent discharge and algal bloom in any case would urge anyone consider wild swimming to consult the environment agency information on water quality and above all to educate themselves about the danger of the water even if they think they be experience because no matter how experienced swimmer be if they be in unsupervised waterway with the water temperature below they could experience cold water shock or the other hazard mention the chair of the national water safety forum have say that drown can occur anywhere and to anyone so far in oxford we have see particular effort from the oxfordshire fire and rescue service to educate people about the danger of the water that have be really positive along with the water safety code and simplify message such as call tell throw and float to live my hon friend the member for southampton itchen speak passionately about ensure that our school be always reinforce that message as he say water safety and swimming be mandatory within pe in primary school but that be subject to problem of access and disparity relate to social class and ethnicity becky francis curriculum and assessment review for the government have show that it be difficult for many school to prioritise pe because of the accumulate challenge that they face there be particular issue at key stage hope that as she work towards the full review she can look at the specific issue of water safety in more detail also hope that the government will consider it carefully know that the minister would want to be do that as they be review the relationship sex and health education draft statutory guidance know that organisation in oxford be really keen about that so that they can have join up approach with local school with well signage information and so on finally it be really important in undertake this work that wherever possible young people themselves be include in the conversation because they know what will be most effective lot of the time with their peer believe that one of the most effective measure in my city be striking memorial paint to hussain mohammed year old who die after jump from donnington bridge in very sadly he be not the only person to die from that cause thirteen year later that bridge still feature the touch mural that remind people of hussain and hopefully recall the need to stay water safe thank the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey for secure this important debate today as we have hear every year in the uk more than life be lose to accidental drowning in fact it claim more life each year in the uk than house fire or cycling accident that must be wake up call we have an opportunity and responsibility in this house today to bring those number down the problem be as clear as it be urgent too many people grow up without be teach how to stay safe around water swimming must be core life skill as we have hear and yet accord to the royal life saving society uk one in three child leave primary school unable to swim properly that statistic should concern we all of course child from the most disadvantaged background be most likely to miss out in other word those at great risk be the least protect this be not just about learn to swim although that be essential it be about know what to do when thing go wrong when someone panic when cold water shock set in and when every second count every summer every bank holiday and every heatwave like this week the risk increase river lake canal and coastline become magnet for young people and far too often life be lose my constituency of esher and walton have see three tragic drown death in the past four year two of they occur during the fierce heat of the summer of heartbreaking testament to the risk that rise with each heatwave these be tragedy with unimaginable pain for the family and profound effect for school emergency service and the wide community as base constituency we owe it to our resident visitor and local business to prioritise water safety the risk be all around we particularly this week the thames thread through our town the river mole run through our park and reservoir sit at the heart of our community address the root cause be so important one of my constituent nell hickman take up the cause by lead local water safety campaign along stretch of the thames between thames ditton and hampton court which have hear refer to by school child as the barbados of south west london determined to prevent further tragedy nell partner with the rnli elmbridge borough council and other stakeholder together they instal safety signage and emergency throwline they also expand water safety training advise swimmer to stay parallel to the riverbank instead of swim across the river thames that be powerful example of community lead action back by the right support save life there be more that we can do the rnli play vital role in my constituency and pay tribute to its tireless work some school in esher and walton be already lead the way by teach key life skill through personal social health and economic education and citizenship however we must do more to ensure that water safety be embed in our child education especially in area such as mine with river and open water be greatly pleased that this debate be take place in my constituency and within somerset and north somerset the whole of somerset there be mile of river rean and stream which from somerset would take we as far as singapore that level of water coverage present danger not only for those who swim and need to be teach to swim but for young people who should understand very clearly what to do should the vehicle in which they be travel go into water there be specific rule around how to save ourselves if the car or vehicle we be in go into water do my hon friend have comment about that thank my hon friend for bring attention to vehicle go into the water in my constituency the thames provide our border with london so it stretch along the entire constituency and of course car could go into the river in area like ours where river and open water be daily part of life it be essential that our child be teach how to be safe in the water would the minister consider ensure that water safety be integrate into the secondary school curriculum so that every young person leave school equip with these essential skill for their safety it be now in heatwave when gcse and level have just finish that our child be most at risk know that because this week sense that my year old after finish his gcse be go to do just that and it take all my parental bribery frankly to ensure that he do not organisation like the royal life saving society alongside the rnli provide expert guidance from recognise dangerous current and raise awareness of cold water shock to assist people in distress in the river by work with those partner we can build generation that be not only confident in the water but capable of save life these be not just water safety tool they be universal lifesaving skill that can make all the difference in emergency of all kind country like australia rightly treat water safety as national priority child grow up surround by water there so they be teach how to navigate it just as our child be teach to wear seatbelt and how to cross the road the uk an island nation flow with river should be no different let we work towards future where few family face heartbreak and finally make water safety priority thank my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey and the backbench business committee for secure this important debate also thank michael wardle who be royal life saving society uk lifeguard and his team at the helly hansen watersport centre in salford for their dedication to save life in salford have the pleasure of meet they and their passion for educate about water safety be inspiring in salford quays countless life have tragically be lose as young people head to the water unaware of the danger within it be ship canal so it be incredibly deep and litter with underwater obstacle the area be now monitor by cctv camera and joint council and police patrol in hot weather catch jump from bridge or illegally swimming will receive police warning and adult will be issue with fix penalty notice but that still do not stop people crowd to the quay on day like today look to cool off or have fun with their friend the sad thing be there be supervise open swimming area in the quay area that can offer safe swimming environment but they be only open at limited time and be not free which bar too many young people from they there be one simple thing that the government could do to ensure that my constituent be safe and that would be to provide just little funding to open up these supervise lifeguarde swim area to the public for free and for long during the summer month that way no young person be tempt to risk their life in dangerous area when they can have full access to supervised one secondly as we have hear water safety education be critical while it be statutory requirement that child be able to swim metre by the time they reach year evidence sadly suggest that the number of child receive swimming lesson be decline in the royal life saving society estimate that over child leave primary school without these vital lifesaving skill there be also inequality in those statistic staggeringly sport england find that of child from low income family could swim metre in year compare with of high income family barrier to the statutory provision include limited pool access transportation cost logistic staff shortage and cultural and religious barrier it be critical that the government secure water safety education on the national curriculum for england as statutory requirement but also that they ensure school be provide with dedicated ringfenced budget so they can meet that requirement thirdly would like to draw attention to quite staggering fact meet my local fire service in salford recently and learn of the amazing work its dedicated firefighter do to save life and keep we safe meet the water response team which think naively like much of the general public be just part of its service it be not they do it because they be good people not because they be fund to or require to while there be public perception that the fire and rescue service be responsible for respond to water rescue incident and engage in water safety education and prevention there be no statutory duty on it in england to do so however statutory duty do exist in wales the fire and rescue service respond to call and inland water rescue incident use its exist general power and resource it scrimp and save from exist budget to try to resource the lifesave equipment it need rather than that be allocate as result the resource and the coverage be patchy and firefighter often train in water safety on their own time call on the government to urgently adopt the national fire chiefs council recommendation on this issue to consult on establish statutory responsibility in england for inland water rescue response and prevention to provide capital alongside continuous funding to support any new statutory duty introduce to establish clear lead department with accountability for water safety prevention mirror at local authority level and to update the reporting requirement of the incident recording system to more accurately record water relate death and injury to conclude no parent should ever receive that phone call and no person should ever needlessly lose their life when the ask on government be so simple hope the government will do all they can to urgently implement the measure that and other have outline it be good to see you in the chair sir roger congratulate my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey on secure the debate he genuinely be an hon friend we serve together on southampton city council we have both be education lead member and now we be constituency neighbour know that he consistently stand up for the great people of the great city of southampton and in particular the constituent he have mention today pay tribute to joe mum for the work she have already do and the work she will do in future to make sure we lose few people on our waterway across the country although the hon member for southampton itchen and share southampton water which be the busy part of the waterway around and into southampton also have in my constituency the entirety of the river hamble which come off southampton water the river hamble be internationally know as one of the most difficult river to navigate for our sailing and boat community it be know as an international sailing hub but also as one of the most difficult tidal waterway to navigate across the world we see that unfortunately in early in my career here as the member of parliament for eastleigh which be in the same area emily lewis who be on fast boat in the solent be tragically kill after be catapult out of it when it hit netley buoy she be travel at mph and two charge be eventually make of manslaughter and failure to ensure safe navigation against the person who charter the boat the hon member for southampton itchen be absolutely right that we need to have water safety education put it to the house and the minister that we also need to have proper education for not only those who enter the water through our seaside lake and river but also people who use the water on daily basis as say we have the whole of the river hamble in the constituency of hamble valley and vast array of people use our river and southampton water sailor motorboater kayaker paddleboarder and rower many people use the river as they should be able to because that be intrinsic to the identity of those who grow up and live in my constituency give the hot weather this weekend intend to go out on the hamble on saturday to kayak but be aware of the intrinsic danger of river such as the hamble it be vital as the hon member for southampton itchen say that we educate from very early age also want to outline and make colleague aware of the role of our independent lifeboat hamble lifeboat in my constituency have already be call out over time this year we must raise awareness of these service because they play very important educational role for many people in our constituency be delighted to be found member of the national independent lifeboat association which look after our independent lifeboat alongside our former colleague anthony mangnall who be the member for totnes encourage all member who represent area with independent lifeboat to get in touch with nila and to raise awareness of water safety the hon member for southampton itchen highlight the key variation in access to swimming pool and water education as indicate in my intervention we will both be aware from our time lead the education system in southampton of the number of school there that have have closure this be not political point at all because we have both be in control of the administration and we have have national government of different colour but he will be aware of reduction in funding for our education system from local authority whereby many school have have to close their pool partnership that allow kid to be take to local leisure centre for school lesson have be reduce as well remember be young person use to be young once grow up in lewisham the council school bus would come and take to lewisham swimming bath every week for two hour swimming lesson that have diminish and it be vital that we work on cross party basis to get swimming lesson and water education deliver to people across the uk as say this be not just about young people brief story couple of summer ago be out on my kayak when see an old gentleman cling to kayak in very cold water he have lose his energy and would have die that day have and my friend jerry not go past and rescue he he be not wear life preserver he be very cold and he be run out of energy cling to his kayak we manage to take he out of the water and save he and get he medical attention frustratingly such thing still happen which be why any measure take forward by the minister need to be attentive to not only young people but all user of the river and waterway across the uk congratulate the hon member for southampton itchen and all member who will speak in today debate he have my commitment alongside that of my hon friend the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti and be sure the shadow minister that this be cross party issue that we all need to work on wish the hon member well in his endeavour thank my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey for secure the debate and for all the extremely important work that he be do on this issue extend my compliment to his constituent in the gallery who we hear at the appg early in the week give the circumstance her campaign be extremely brave and her word be very inspiring so want to put my tribute to she on the record too come to this debate because of situation that occur within my constituency of west ham and beckton very recently which receive quite lot of press publicity do not intend to go into the detail it be still very fresh event but lose an year old constituent in the river thames early in the spring that be huge trauma for her family and put on the record know the whole house will share in this my deep condolence to they also extend my congratulation and thank to the emergency service search and rescue and actually local people who step in to try to help on that occasion which obviously have huge impact on the community too this debate be very pertinent for my constituency because be surround by water in east london have the rode to the east the river lea to the west and significantly the river thames border the south of my constituency also have huge amount of dockland include the royal dock which be very large open space of water build at time when we have lot of shipping with that come lot of open wharf and causeway many of which be still in use which be another aspect of water safety we have reserve industrial space and education be need on that people often forget that lot of the thames be still work river we have lot of industry at my end tate lyle and tarmac use large shipping in addition to all the other boat that go up and down the river education be therefore hugely important for where be include education on safety and wide range of thing we need to take advantage of the huge opportunity to work with school youth club community group and young people group to try to get that education across be lucky to have active sea scout and sea cadet in my area those group touch only small number of people but there be people out there who can deliver such education be of an age that can remember public information film make by the central office of information that disappear in and we do not have the same sort of programming see some smile around the chamber from member of similar age who remember such thing be teach to cross the road by kevin keegan remember it be jimmy who throw his frisbee into the pylon so do not do that and it be the spirit of dark and lonely water who warn we about still pool the fact that can remember all that year down the line if hon member be interested many such film be now online and often see as nostalgia show that that type of campaign work because it stick in the mind we seem to lack national campaign on such issue ironically those campaign happen in pre digital age but they lend themselves to the age we now live in with social medium tiktok and all the rest of it we could produce information to share with school and youth group so that they could take advantage of such campaign hope that we get back to be able to produce such campaign that could be widely share so that child will remember and tell their child far down the line second issue that would like to touch on which be raise by my hon friend the member for salford rebecca long bailey but be outside the scope of the minister for education be about statutory duty at the appg meeting this week we be tell by fire chief that there be lack of statutory duty which seem like gap in our service there have be number of incident on waterway in my constituency both accident and sadly suicide attempt where the fire brigade attend the london fire brigade be always absolutely magnificent it turn out and do an exceptional job however the fact that there be no statutory duty seem to be gap to so that be an important change that need to be make the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes talk about the weather that be currently forecast the marine police unit of the metropolitan police service which receive over call year on water safety highlight that the risk grow in the summer and in hot weather certainly near at the royal victoria docks we have child jump in all the time so this be pertinent debate now and as we move into the summer with the hot weather the issue be press will finish with couple of ask for the front bench can we look at how we can put in place comprehensive education programme work with school but also on national level perhaps take advantage of modern technology can we also look at the need for statutory duty for fire and rescue service so that it be enshrine in law as perhaps people expect it be not but it be not at the moment by do that hopefully we can take couple of step towards ensure that no family have to go through the kind of incident and heartbreak that my constituent see early this spring thank my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey for secure this important debate shrewsbury be famous for be loop by the beautiful river severn it be source of beauty nature tourism and livelihood for my town but also unfortunately the scene of death in the last year overwhelmingly those death occur at the weekend or in the evening by man sometimes after night out or because of mental ill health and sometimes because of those two factor combine in april there be two river death in quick succession toby jones and nathan fleetwood those death bring the town together to say that we have have too many such death and that we need to look at the issue as community to see what could be do our local stakeholder and council come together and launch water safety campaign they set up the new water safety action group fund by west mercia police we set up safe route signage along the river get fund for increase solar lighting and rescue throw line set up free online water safety course for school college and club and we have poster campaign in pub and club my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser will be delighted to hear that we create video to be broadcast in pub and put out on social medium that tell the story of what could go wrong we also educate bar staff about not overselle alcohol when too much be too much and we train they in mental health response work with our street pastor we have free training from the rnli on waterside response scheme help our local business we get fund for cctv and we set up the shrewsbury ranger scheme and taxi marshal to help people to get home safely late in the evening be really proud of my town of how we take this issue on and say we do want this to

which chaperone the hugely busy motorway of boat up and down our city the rnli be an excellent charity and thank it for its hugely important educational work its volunteer be incredible can not fail

during drowning prevention week will speak of not just the risk of wild and open water swimming but the enormous benefit that it can offer when do safely and responsibly specifically would like to address concern about the lake at the former shoal hill quarry which be in the neighbouring constituency of stone great wyrley and penkridge and about chasewater reservoir although that reservoir fall within the constituency of my hon friend the member for lichfield dave robertson it be much love site that be frequently use by many of my constituent particularly those in my home village of norton canes they feel very strong sense of ownership over what be for many year before rebrand know as the norton pool my hon friend have hop to be here today but due to constituency commitment he have not be able to join we for this debate however he share the concern will raise about chasewater in his constituency as the evening grow long and the day get warm place such as shoal hill quarry and chasewater become popular destination for family seek to cool off appeal though it may be the risk of swim in dangerous body of water can strike anyone they include cold water shock current that drag people down due to the depth of the water rip current that drag people away from the shore lack of safe exit from the water cut cause by hidden object underwater lack of preparation or way to call for help and aftershock be safe and well prepared before swimming be crucial accord to the national water safety forum an average of people year drown when swim in open water and know that every member in the chamber today would want to make sure that none of our constituent become one of those tragically six year ago year old man drown in chasewater while save nine year old girl from the water his bravery should not be forget nor should the circumstance that lead to such loss from memory believe that this incident involve an inflatable like the one use in swimming pool which in deep water and with high wind be pull some to metre out into the reservoir however later that summer and in summer since we have again see young child on inflatable in chasewater know might come across as be killjoy but this be genuinely threat to life especially for child as such take this opportunity to urge my constituent not to swim in chasewater unless it be with an open water swimming group which will come to later at shoal hill quarry near cannock too it be simply not safe to enter the water risk lie hide beneath the surface include sharp debris submerge machinery and toxic contaminant weed bed and rubbish create an unforeseen web of entanglement while sheer sudden drop off along the quarry floor can turn step into deadly fall but this be not about discourage people from enjoy the outdoors quite the opposite when open water swimming be do properly it can be incredibly rewarding people can stay safe while open water swimming by check the weather be aware of where to exit the water make sure they have kit prepare wear brightly coloured swimming cap and know their gear chasewater open water swimming group offer one to one coaching compulsory tow float and the national open water coaching association safety system that wristband system allow immediate access to emergency detail with safety and training of this kind available people can enjoy open water swimming and trust that they will be safe while do so also pay tribute to all the other business and group that provide safe activity on chasewater include chasewater activity centre chase watersports centre pier watersports and the chase sailing club with the beautiful hot weather upon we it be vital that we continue to talk about way to make wild water swim as safe as possible by increase awareness and educate people in high risk area we can start to bring down the number of these tragedy no one should lose their life from moment of fun and no family should suffer the grief of death that could have be prevent this be not about stop people enjoy the outdoors whether at chasewater shoal hill quarry or anywhere else across the united kingdom it be about give they the information and tool they need to do so safely and confidently thank my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey for secure this important debate it be timely debate particularly with the hot weather we be see and the number of people who will be go into the water this weekend be proud to represent the beautiful constituency of bangor aberconwy it be coastal scenic and home to some of the most stunning beach lake river and waterfall these area be rightly cherish by resident and visitor alike but sadly people in my constituency know all too well the pain and devastation that be cause when something go wrong do not think there will be single person across my whole constituency whose life have not be touch at some point by tragedy involve drowning those accident and fatality be obviously devastating not just for the individual family and community affect but for the emergency service and organisation include the coastguard rnli and mountain rescue team that be task with respond so much of that painstaking work of search and rescue be carry out by volunteer who give up their time for free and want to put on record my thank to they as well as my deep condolence to everyone who have be affect by these incident

which be be promote as hide gem but people be unaware of the danger understand that the education minister respond today be not necessarily involve directly in online safety but it would be wonderful if the government could address that issue perhaps the minister could discuss with colleague how social media platform could be encourage to act other member have talk about the potential for social medium campaign which can be influential especially when we be talk to young people would like the social medium platform to be more aware of their responsibility in highlight water safety education and the danger and perhaps to work with content creator we definitely want people to come and visit north wales and to enjoy our beach lake and river be in no way blame anyone who ever call for help have two teenage child and they will be out enjoy the water this weekend as will many other just want to make sure we have cross societal and cross governmental approach to water safety education if the minister could raise that with colleague within government would be grateful because we should all be pay attention to this issue online as well as in the real world sam haycock be name that most member in the chamber will not have hear before today but it be my job to make sure that that year old legacy do not end four year ago when he be swim in south yorkshire reservoir with his friend want

lindsy james who live in and work across my community she be world champion duathlete who have only recently learn to swim as she have fear of water she have show how swimming can build resilience and confidence give the amount of water that we have the most important thing be education because we can not protect all the different site that have talk about that be why be so proud that my water safety bill have reception this week the bill would make compulsory water safety education part of this government legal duty which would save life that be the reason we be here today our job be to enrich life to save life and to protect life sam haycock story do not need to end on that day four year ago there need to be legacy he may not go on to fulfil all the dream he have on the day he finish his gcse but his legacy can and will allow other to fulfil their dream thank my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey for secure this important debate declare an interest early this month host an event by future lidos peer network across the uk and ireland that be work together to bring outdoor swimming pool to more people in our community be also chair of local group call splash which be work to restore and reopen the outdoor tidal pool in the town of saltcoats in my constituency lidos and outdoor pool provide safe space and opportunity for people to learn to swim outdoors and tidal pool get people use to swim in cold water fully support the campaign to open more lido throughout the uk although we must make they affordable so that people can access they sadly scotland have the high accidental drowning rate of all the uk nation it be about three time the rate in england the risk tend to increase with age peak in the to age group surprisingly people who plan to go into the water be not always at the high risk it have be show that accident can occur among walker and runner who can slip into the water and drown which be why it be vital that everyone learn to swim in scotland there be no statutory requirement to provide swimming lesson and provision be determine on council by council basis learn to swim be not required part of the curriculum unlike in northern ireland where swimming be part of the minimum content or in england as we hear early in scotland there be learn to swim framework but significant number of child still leave primary school without learn to swim and this must be urgently address by the snp scottish government as young girl learn to swim in the local outdoor tidal pool at the age of four thank to my mum who be swimming teacher and swimming have always be important to swimming and water safety skill be vital and we need to ensure that all child have the opportunity to learn to swim as well as ensure that these skill be reinforce throughout people life in order to protect old people too it be really important that people be encourage to learn to swim at all age not just from safety perspective but for the many benefit that swimming offer for health and wellbeing both physical and mental pay tribute to my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey for lead today debate as many member of this house will know be someone who spend many hour out and about on britain river and lake as keen whitewater kayaker regardless of whether it be on move water along the coastline or in our lake spend time on and in our water be tremendous joy but it come with risk regrettably we have see number of tragedy in and around my constituency over the year in donna greenall from horwich in my constituency be sadly find drown in rivington reservoir more recently in april last year year old joseph hold die after get into difficulty in the river croal in bolton have lose control of his canoe we must learn from these incident to prevent similar tragedy from happen again with that in mind will make the case for further investment in education to unlock the immense potential of safely be in on or near water after all we owe it to donna joseph and everyone who have lose their life to drown or who have lose love one to continue make improvement to water safety awareness drown remain one of the lead cause of accidental death particularly among our young people yet our approach to water safety remain fragmented we have national strategy for road safety for fire prevention and for public health yet none for water safety as an island nation that be proud of our maritime history it be time to change our approach indeed it be high time the government develop comprehensive national water safety strategy that bring together civil servant local authority school water company the emergency service and voluntary organisation in order to raise awareness and critically to prevent future tragedy there be already some brilliant campaign that show how simple positive messaging position in the right place can have demonstrable impact in reduce incident in particular commend to colleague the paddlesafe campaign run jointly by paddle uk and the rnli as good example of what can be do that summer safety initiative contain five key message to raise awareness of how to prepare for any type of paddle and to stay safe on any kind of water those message be simple and easy to remember always wear buoyancy aid tell someone where you go carry mobile phone check the weather know your limit have see at first hand the danger of not heed those message which be why know that education must be at the heart of our response every child should leave school with basic water safety knowledge how to recognise danger how to act in an emergency and how to enjoy our water safely it be why be passionate advocate for swim remain key component of the national curriculum as my hon friend the member for southampton itchen mention austerity hit access to swimming lesson as evidence by the fact that of child from low income family be able to swim metre unaide compare with from affluent family do my hon friend agree with that mandatory requirement for swimming and water safety should be in the national curriculum for all primary school entirely agree with my hon friend remark about improve education and how fundamental it be to do so indeed support call from the outdoors for all campaign to ensure our young child learn essential outdoor life skill such as risk benefit assessment self sufficiency navigation and swimming in early year learn and throughout their schooling that campaign be support by organisation such as the canal river trust the outdoor swimming society surfers against sewage and swim england be particularly pleased recently to see an awareness raise stall at horwich leisure centre to mark drowning prevention week make sure that both child and parent be aware of the risk and how to manage they prevention go hand in hand with responsibility our waterway be place not only of recreation but of environmental and economic value and access be too often restrict confusing or inconsistently enforce all that that encourage be irresponsible and frequently dangerous access if people want to go for dip on hot day like today we have to assume they be go to find way to do it so we need more proactive role for landowner and land manager in assess and manage risk appropriately as my right hon friend the member for oxford east anneliese dodds mention finally we can not ignore the role of investment our rescue service include our hard work volunteer in coastguard and mountain rescue team such as the bolton mountain rescue team base at ladybridge hall in my constituency do tremendous work as do our training provider and they need sustained reliable funding whether it be well signage improve safety equipment at popular swimming spot or strong enforcement against polluter who degrade our water or fail to maintain safety measure proper funding be essential to conclude improve water safety have three core component first improve education secondly improve safety and thirdly improve and secure access that will ensure our child whether they want to swim or spend day in and around water be able to do so in safe manner thank my hon friend the member for southampton itchen darren paffey for bring forward this critical debate we think lot about water safety in the ribble valley constituency indeed the river ribble be in its name in the river ribble catchment which cover my constituency and some lovely neighbouring constituency we also have the hodder calder darwen douglas and wyre the ribble rivers trust be lancashire base charity work to improve the river ribble and all its tributary for people and wildlife along with the lancashire fire and rescue service it do phenomenal job in advocate for water safety as well lancashire be one of the county in the uk with the high water safety risk which be likely due to the geography as we have coast river canal reservoir and quarry one thing that have change lot in this country in recent year be that people move around much more grow up in ribble valley so it be build into not to swim in open water or reservoir or we at least know where the really dangerous area be however with more transient population across the country it be far more critical to have universal education to ensure that people who have not grow up around water understand its risk another thing be keen to raise be that alongside the excellent case be make for lesson in school it be critical that child be able to learn water confidence through their own exploration and play as other have say that require local accessible pool for they to explore be grateful to those work with locally to begin campaign for proper public swimming pool in the town of longridge in my constituency which be one of the thing that be most request on the doorstep there finally take this opportunity to encourage all adult who have never feel fully comfortable with swim to learn because it be never too late never learn to swim as child but few year ago when my daughter at quite young age start dive under the water something could not do realise that could not be encourage she to be confident if could not do it myself it be humbling thing to be something take swimming lesson but be grateful to legendary preston swimming teacher karen smith for her patience the first time swam length be very special moment and be grateful that now as parent

child should not only learn how to swim but understand how to stay safe around water as have be say today warn and inform that be why welcome labour continued commitment to the pe and sport premium with million for which school can use for teacher training and to top up swimming lesson labour new children wellbeing and schools bill will mean that all state fund school include academy will be require to deliver the national curriculum which will include swimming and water safety in addition the interim report from labour curriculum assessment review recognise the urgent need to rebalance priority especially in pe for our old pupil however if we be to teach child to swim we need to ensure we have access to facility affordable facility in which to have lesson be pleased that hilsea lido be have revamp for local use but we need to help school work with local facility be they private or council to ensure that pool and transport be real option and be really affordable also want to echo the praise for and the promotion of the royal life saving society for the work it be do to help to educate we its resource be brilliant and there be no need to reinvent the wheel have see the great work of my local national independent lifeboat association alongside portsmouth rnli lifeboat and lifeguard portsmouth southsea voluntary lifeguards and our local police and fire service they all go the extra mile raise awareness help inform and warn but it need to be put into practice to save life as my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser note also remember the childhood public service broadcast some year ago they do work and it would be great and positive use of our online medium platform in portsmouth north where child live near the sea pond shoreline and marsh these reform to water safety education and swimming be not optional but essential fully support the government step to ensure that every child leave school with essential lifesaving water skill fully support the extra call from my hon friend the member for southampton itchen pledge to work with he and other on behalf of our constituent to make national strategy for water safety reality for our kid

other hon member make on the importance of be prepared to spot the danger and react to they and to be ready when thing go wrong which be just as important as be able to swim in the first place other hon member have raise important point and detail even in short intervention and be particularly pleased to see so many colleague from across the house who have attend recent debate on rural and coastal community in their place there be clearly theme building here the hon member for southampton itchen speak about call for ministerial responsibility think that could fit very well within the portfolio of minister for coastal community and look forward to explore that possibility with he far member who have pay close attention to my past speech in this house might have notice that north norfolk be proud coastal community by our nature we have lot of water and our beach and sea be belove by resident and tourist alike although for those who be not confident in the water they can also be incredibly dangerous norfolk inland waterway be also very special with the norfolk broad and fantastic river and chalk stream like the glaven bure and stiffkey this be serious concern not just to but to imogen who attend primary school in my constituency and who write to with her concern imogen say all around north norfolk there be lot of river which be wonderful apart from that if people do know how to swim they may fall in and drown this be tragic problem which affect people all around england if people be on walk around river or lake and accidentally slip in and inhale the water their family would be distraught be not ask for law that people know how to swim but be request your attention so that you can review the problem if it persist it may be good idea to think about how this affect england as whole she close by say know there be lifesave ring dot around but feel there be not enough and that few more life could be save if there be more that can be use swimming lesson be charge quite high make it hard for people to be able to teach their child to swim which may be part of the problem be sure hon member will agree that imogen despite be in primary school have summarise this problem and highlight the issue just as well as any of we could have water safety be an issue that could affect any one of our constituent potentially when they least expect it as imogen point out agree with she that we need to take serious look at this across the house and hope that the government will be able to provide not just reassurance and answer but promise of action to imogen and everyone else who be concerned about this issue the liberal democrats be commit to mandatory swimming lesson in school and be call on the government to ensure that identify swimming skill gap be urgently address the fact that of to year old be unable to swim more than metre be real worry for those of we in rural and coastal community who worry for the safety of our young people in our river and sea to address those issue we have to invest more in our local swimming pool be delighted that in north norfolk in the past few year we have build the reef leisure centre swimming pool in sheringham real state of the art facility which be great asset to the community be equally delighted that the lib dem council have secure funding for multimillion pound expansion and refurbishment of fakenham leisure centre which will include new metre swimming pool in the constituency of my neighbour the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew rise on that note have see the hon gentleman in his place will give way to he fir congratulate the hon gentleman on his first outing on the front bench he be do very good job secondly will not quibble over who it be who obtain the

development of have swimming pool in fakenham do he agree that that will go long way in help people in fakenham and the surround area to learn to swim let absolutely clear everybody involve in secure that bid deserve congratulation totally agree with the hon gentleman be that the hon gentleman next point intervene too soon laughter think the point the hon gentleman be make be that many in fakenham as well as the nearby village in my constituency be delight by the news and thrill with the hard work that have go into secure it liberal democrats also want to end the closure of swimming pool by designate they as critical health infrastructure which would enshrine protection in law mean that central and local government would have legal duty not to cut these service and to maintain adequate funding to keep they open of course people be not just swim in pool as many people enjoy gain confidence through wild and open water swimming however in order for they to be able to do that we have to clean up our river and sea after year of scandalous sewage dumping for those look to swim only of river and lake in england be in good ecological health last year water company dump sewage more than time into area with bathing water status that be unacceptable we must crack down on the year of unchecked profiteering and environmental damage that the water company have cause we must bring in tough new law to protect our environment and the health of those who enjoy it in north norfolk we will not stand for it moment long to conclude to secure the water safety that we need we must have strong education enable by strong facility and clean environment if we do that then imogen and people of all age can enjoy the river and sea in north norfolk and around our beautiful country with confidence and safety for year to come let pay tribute to the hon member for southampton itchen darren paffey for lead this important debate and for do such good job in set out all the different issue at stake

seem to have see the hon member for bangor aberconwy claire hughes then bring we bang up to date by talk about what social medium could do in this space the hon member for shrewsbury julia buckley make the crucial point about the importance of not drink and swimming and the critical danger there the hon member for cannock chase josh newbury remind we of the benefit of be able to swim outside

doncaster east and the isle of axholme lee pitcher make powerful speech talk not just about sam and his father but about his private member bill the water safety bill we also have really interesting contribution from the hon member for north ayrshire and arran irene campbell who have beautiful constituency which associate with seaside holiday as child and as an adult surprising fact in her speech be that this subject be not on the curriculum in scotland which seem like an obvious first step the hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland luke myer talk about the awful case of the miss child in his constituency we of course hope for the good for that family will turn in moment to talk about some of the thing that the previous government do do so not to say that everything be wonderful because of course it be not but because think that it might be way of prompt further reflection on what more we could do to go far as have already be mention it be the previous government who update the national curriculum in to add swimming and water safety education it be surprising that it be so late that be where we get this rule that pupil should be teach to swim at least metre few people have talk about facility the previous government announce the first million and then million to open up access to pool in school as it be obviously very sad to see good facility not be use after school hour we enable school to open up their pool more than they have be do and we want to do more of that we work together with some brilliant organisation in the national water safety forum include the rnli swim england the royal life saving society and many more we have hear from number of member about important local and individual campaign that can be so powerful and pay tribute to all the people involve in those be involve in use the sugar tax to create and then expand the pe and sport premium which have provide more funding for pe lesson in school in we double the funding that primary school receive to improve the quality of their pe and sport provision include water education it go up from million to million however there be still much more to be do because about third of adult about million people still can not swim must pay tribute to the hon member for ribble valley maya ellis for lead by example and learn to swim as an adult good on she for do that all of we be affect by these hugely important issue member might think that since my constituency be as far away from the sea as it could be the main risk be normally people with metal detector fish in the canal

to the minister for give way have know she since she first come to the house and she know that she have my respect and regard swimming be critical it be true that people who can swim still get into

swimming facility across the whole of our nation the right hon member be right to recognise how fundamental swimming be but it be really important to recognise that it be not enough as have come

cold water will make you gasp uncontrollably breathe in water and you will drown if you just float until the cold water shock have pass you can control your breathing and have far well chance of stay alive evan follow that advice and manage to hold on to consciousness for minute until he be rescue he feel incredibly grateful to be alive because he know that many people do not have that opportunity he do not learn that information at school but from public information campaign will therefore take away the ask that have be make they be not necessarily for my department but for the government more

make and question propose that this house do now jones rise today to discuss an issue that be sure affect not just my constituent in edinburgh west but many of our constituent across the united kingdom since thousand of civil servant teacher doctor nurse police officer and firefighter have be wait for the compensation they be entitle to through the mccloud remedy after the judgment in the court of appeal which rule that change to public sector pension unlawfully discriminate against young worker that impact huge number of dedicated public servant include at least civil servant and more than half million teacher in scotland more than police officer be impact and be due remediation as be around nhs worker accord to figure produce by the scottish government it be understandable that with so many people need remediation there could be delay particularly for more complex case or old case that need to be examine manually but these be have significant impact on people life motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now jones as say these delay be have significant impact on people life thank the hon member for secure this important debate have have number of case come into my office as well my constituent gavin templeton who serve year of dedicated service in the fife constabulary be force to return to work because his incorrect pension be so low do she agree that it be time we do much more to support hard work public servant like gavin to receive the full pension they work so hard for thank the hon member for raise very good point which will come to later agree completely this have be particularly difficult for many people in the light of the crisis we have face in recent year with the soar cost of living and sky high energy bill this be what have happen to my constituent in edinburgh west who have come to with their issue with the administration of the remedy not the remedy but the administration of it and the possible future impact on other pension scheme one of my constituent who be affect be retired police officer who serve year his pension scheme be forcibly change in to the care career average revalue earning scheme which be find to be discriminatory he retire in february with his lump sum on the assumption that the remedial scheme would be in place by october that year he estimate that he be now owe more than in term of both his commute lump sum from the new scheme and the low monthly pension he be also one of thousand of immediate detriment officer still wait for their remediation letter from the pension authority despite claim that the number of retire officer receive these have accelerate include in scotland another constituent start work for lothian and borders police as it be in and retire in know he would only receive his pension for his service between and while the remedy be calculate he be tell at the time that he would receive his remediable service statement by april three year after his retirement he also estimate loss in pension income of more than give that seven year of his service to our community be not count when he first retire third constituent of mine have raise possible issue that he face when retire with an nhs pension the government approach to nhs pension remedy mean that pension growth will be calculate under an old scheme from even if he believe this rollback leave those in the middle of their career vulnerable to artificial breach of the annual pension allowance and significant income tax charge because of the set up of the scheme use for calculation congratulate the hon member on secure the debate speak to she beforehand to ascertain her focus which be clearly on the mccloud remedy the mccloud remedy will have implication on tax for some member with some need to pay more tax she have outline three and other be entitle to refund my constituent in strangford be experience the same issue as those in edinburgh west and be in similar position of uncertainty do she agree that discussion with financial adviser be essential and for those who do not have access to financial adviser the employer the national health service in the case of my constituent must provide workshop to ensure that worker can understand what their choice will mean in reality the hon gentleman raise very good point this issue have affect all our constituent in different way his be exactly the sort of point that hope the minister may be able to address all the case that we have mention show the impact that the remedy process have have on people who have dedicate their life to serve our community it be unfair and must be tackle in write answer to myself and other hon member ministers have say that it be up to individual pension scheme and their manager to implement the remedy rather than the relevant government department but that seem to allow the scheme to delay or leave they without the resource and support that they need to process claim at pace will the minister outline how the government work with these authority to ensure rapid delivery of remedial pay what step will the government take to ensure that pension authority can also deliver rss notice to speed up the process of calculate and award remedial pay that be particularly important for police pension as there appear to be severe backlog in issue those notice to retire officer to allow they to make their choice under the law that be leave my constituent in edinburgh west and other face year of further uncertainty on their finance as the hon member for strangford jim shannon reference and lose out on money that they be entitle to for their work as policing be devolve in both scotland and as the hon gentleman know in northern ireland how be the government work with the devolved administration on these pension scheme to share good practice across departments provide increase resource and finally give these public servant who have serve our community teach our child and keep we safe for so long the safety security and financial stability that they deserve for their retirement surely that be what they be entitle to congratulate the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine on secure this debate be grateful for her speech and agree that the people we be talk about keep we safe and well and show true dedication to public service absolutely understand the point that she be make will talk little bit about the background to mccloud before talk about the progress that have be make to date and what far step the scheme manager still need to take as the hon lady outline the mccloud remedy be by its nature complex undertaking as be sure she will appreciate it apply to public service pension scheme in the uk and the scheme manager for those scheme be responsible for ensure that the remedy be administer properly and in accordance with their statutory provision this issue as the hon lady say arise out of the introduction of new pension scheme for public sector worker in when introduce those pension scheme the government at the time give what be call transitional protection to old worker but as she set out in the court of appeal find that those protection give rise to unlawful discrimination on the ground of age race and sex in the government announce that they would address that discrimination through the mccloud remedy there be two main element to the remedy the ongoing difference in treatment between old and young worker be remove by close the old pension scheme and move all active member into the new pension scheme in relation to employment after march however address the discrimination that occur between and be considerably more complex as hon member will appreciate because whether individual member be well off under the old legacy scheme or new reform scheme will depend on their individual employment history and circumstance and in some case will not be certain until they retire the remedy therefore give choice over legacy or reform scheme benefit which be give at the point of retirement for active and deferred member and be in the process of be roll out for member who have already retire deliver the remedy to more than million affect scheme member be also an intensive administrative challenge there be many different element to it but the most crucial be that all those affect must be provide with individualised information about their pension entitlement during the to remedy period through what be know as remediable service statement or rss in addition small group of member whose tax position during the remedy period may have change need to be provide with remediable pension saving statement an rpss give the complexity of the mccloud remedy scheme be also provide significant level of guidance and online resource to help member understand the information they receive and the decision they need to make that information be often very complex as hon member know because many have be in the position of receive it there be also dedicated hmrc digital service to allow member receive an rpss to understand their tax position there be process in place to allow member to pay additional tax or as will be the case for the majority of member to claim either tax refund or compensation from the scheme where refund be not possible provide these statement to member together with the other aspect of implement the remedy be the responsibility as the hon lady will know of pension scheme manager for the large public service scheme include the nhs scheme in england and wales the teacher scheme in england and wales and the civil service scheme across the uk the scheme manager be the relevant secretary of state the local government police and fire scheme be administer locally which mean each responsible authority force or brigade have its own scheme manager who be responsible for the operation of the scheme in that area the devolved administration this be pertinent to the concern raise by the hon lady the hon member for strangford jim shannon and my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie have responsibility for administer their scheme the scottish government through the scottish public pensions agency have responsibility for the police fire nhs and teacher scheme in scotland the welsh government be responsible for the firefighter scheme in wales pension scheme in northern ireland be establish under separate legal framework and be the responsibility of the northern ireland government this mean that the picture on implement the remedy across the different scheme be complex and may be subject to particular factor that affect one scheme but not necessarily another the remedy itself vary across the scheme reflect the fact that the scheme themselves be specific to each workforce and have different benefit design this can be see in the differ level of progress that scheme have so far make be aware that across the police scheme in england and wales around of the total number of rss have so far be issue and understand that the picture be similar in the police scheme in scotland with of deferred choice and over three quarter of immediate choice rss already issue although that be not yet match by other scheme significant progress be be make elsewhere for example the civil service scheme in england and wales have issue around of immediate choice rss and the teacher scheme around it be always anticipate that provide rss to member would be challenging and that be specifically recognise in the legislation govern the remedy in particular the public service pensions and judicial offices act set out that for the provision of rss there be deadline of march or here come the qualification such later day as the scheme manager consider reasonable in all the circumstance in the case of particular member or particular class of member give that be ask about delay think it be worth reflect that hon member have raise concern about their constituent who be experience delay in receive the remedy be stand in for the pensions minister my hon friend the member for swansea west torsten bell but use to be the pensions minister myself so have some knowledge of the issue and encourage scheme manager to take every step possible to resolve those case as quickly as possible and to prioritise case where individual may be in particular need the hon member for edinburgh west reflect on number of such case in her excellent contribution assure anybody in this position that where there be an uplift in interest on pension payment interest will be pay on arrear so they will not lose out financially as result of the delay but do understand that the delay be frustrating as the hon lady will be aware the overarch principle of the mccloud remedy be to put people back in the situation they would have be in if the discrimination have not occur in order to do that it be necessary to apply interest where payment should have be make at an early date whether by the scheme or the member in this debate we have hear more about the delay of the scheme towards the member interest be apply at when the scheme owe money to the member where the member owe money to the scheme interest be apply at the direct saver rate which be currently hope that reassure the hon lady to certain extent we think it be right that these decision be make by scheme manager as they be the only one with full possession of all the relevant information as have say with that information and the variety of different factor the situation be complex have say that the government be commit to ensure that all affected member be provide with the remedy they deserve as quickly as possible include ensure that member already in receipt of pension benefit or approach their retirement be prioritise where scheme manager have exercise their statutory discretion to extend the deadline for provide some member with an rss it be therefore important that appropriate new deadline be set out and that robust plan be in place to ensure the new deadline be meet scheme manager must ensure that the plan be properly communicate to pension scheme member to provide they with certainty the pensions regulator must also be keep inform of plan and progress and know that scheme have be have these discussion with the regulator similarly there have be delay in other aspect of the remedy such as the provision of the rpss to those who need they as set out early that affect small number of people however it be difficult for those people if they be keep wait it be important that scheme keep member inform and provide they with appropriate resource and support although be pleased to say that the process of send out rpss in england and wales be complete and that some scheme have send they to all affected member know that there be issue in other part of the country as say this be very complex area if have not answer all of the hon lady question be happy to write to she give the importance of deliver the mccloud remedy effectively the pensions minister have recently write to responsible departments request detail of their plan to issue remain rss and rpss to all affected member all those affect by the mccloud remedy can be assure that robust and complete statutory remedy have be put in place and that scheme be work to ensure that member receive the information and support they need do though note the point that the hon lady have make about the impact of the delay on her constituent they will have the opportunity to decide whether to receive legacy or reform scheme benefit in relation to their service again thank the hon lady for bring this matter to the house question put and agree to house adjourn
