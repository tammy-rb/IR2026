oral answers to questions energy security and net zero the secretary of state be ask energy transition projects scotland what step he be take to support energy transition project in scotland what step he be take to support energy transition project in scotland we be support scotland through the north sea transition deal contract for difference for renewable energy and more than million of net zero innovation portfolio funding thank the secretary of state for that response particularly in relation to cfds will he commit today to clear pathway for the true commercial scale development of tidal stream energy ringfence in the cfd auction be welcome but it be only scratch the surface of what the industry can deliver investor in project be stall as they need long term visibility the industry and indeed all of we need this technology to succeed let we unlock this predictable renewable power and create an industry and sector that we can be proud of and that can be make on these island we need commitment today that the ringfenced budget will increase to allow cost to fall and true scale project to be deliver if we want energy security here be the pathway we be mean to be ask question not make statement fortunately the answer be pretty straightforward as the right hon gentleman mention we be do tidal power in this cfd round that be to be welcome and we look forward to this industry expand in the future as some of the technicality and technical difficulty be resolve know that the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie have visit recently to see this in action energy storage be vital to manage demand as we switch to renewable electricity pump storage hydro be the most efficient large scale storage method uk capacity could be more than double by six project across scotland that have be shovel ready for more than five year they take long time to build so why be the uk government not support investment in infrastructure that be critical for our future energy security have discuss this matter with sse in relation to that particular hydro storage project and my hon friend the under secretary of state meet msp yesterday to discuss the subject as well we be keen to have this kind of hydro storage which be why our plan allow for it to be take forward however have to say to opposition members all of they that it be no good just have one kind of storage or one kind of tidal power we also need to protect the scottish economy with oil and gas to make sure we be not subject to putin or any other dictator hold we to ransom over our energy security it be good to hear that the secretary of state be support the economy in scotland but my question be how be the uk government invest in grid capacity in wales in wales such investment be crucial if we be to support energy transition project such as the holyhead hydrogen hub minesto morlais bp mona lightsource bp and of course new nuclear at wylfa grid capacity in scotland wales england and northern ireland be at the top of our list the winser review have do lot of work to look at how we can speed up the delivery of that capacity give the big transition that be go on and this country big lead in renewable which make that necessary call the scottish national party spokesman on pumped storage hydro it be as though the secretary of state just do not get it it increase energy resilience and would reduce the billion balancing cost that be get pay out at the moment the gw coire glas scheme can be deliver in seven year and it would power million home for hour period the government have find million for sizewell and they have implement cap and floor mechanism for interconnector so why be he not have proper discussion with sse about cap and floor mechanism the secretary of state do in fact get it because we support the idea of have thing such as hydro power again have to say that there be choice where taxpayer money be spend it have to be do competitively in the round to be talk merely about storage and not the generation include nuclear power which be key part of this country energy security future simply mean that the overall view that the snp have be unbalanced when it come to how we power our nation the secretary of state have prove he still do not get it he be not have proper discussion with sse if we move to carbon capture and storage the climate change committee progress report identify risk and significant risk associate with industrial cluster and carbon dioxide storage which prove it be nonsensical to have acorn as reserve when will the government announce the track cluster and provide parity for acorn when do he envisage acorn start construction that be vital to meet the target as the hon gentleman know we have already pump million into acorn it be on the reserve list he ask when the answer be this year for track and track expansion so say it again the secretary of state do get it energy intensive industries decarbonisation what step his department be take to help energy intensive industry decarbonise the government be invest billion to support the development and deployment of carbon capture utilisation and storage hydrogen and other decarbonisation technology and have range of policy support industrial decarbonisation such as the industrial energy transformation fund and local industrial decarbonisation plan there be clean steel project across europe but none in the uk meanwhile the uk be the only country in the where steel production be fall other country recognise the importance of their domestic steel industry and they recognise the importance of invest in low carbon steel why do this government not support our steel as the hon gentleman know well this government do support the uk steel industry on his broad point which he mention in his original question uk industrial emission have fall since and we be make significant investment in industrial decarbonisation not least the billion announce at the end of march which will contribute to decarbonisation through ccus and help the steel industry do ministers agree that the government competition for small modular nuclear reactor will help provide the volume of energy we need for energy intensive domestic industry and over the long term at low cost than previous nuclear power station thank my right hon friend for his question there be enormous enthusiasm on the government side of the house for the potential of nuclear include small modular reactor we be determined to see that go forward as quickly as possible which be why the new organisation great british nuclear be do rapid down selection of technology this year precisely in order to unlock the benefit that my right hon friend so correctly highlight call the chair of the energy security and net zero committee on decarbonisation many organisation such as the institution of civil engineers be ask about the government net zero growth plan which say the public will play key role in the transition and therefore we will set out further detail on how government will increase public engagement on net zero can the minister clarify when that detail will be publish thank the chair of the energy security and net zero committee he be right that as well as top down government policy we must unlock the huge public desire of people to play their part and make sure we have the right information in place that will be provide and produce as soon as possible the minister will welcome measure that many business be already undertake simply because they be the right thing to do include traditionally carbon intensive industry such as cement manufacturing cemex in my constituency be invest to use decarbonise raw material and trialle the use of hydrogen in the combustion process which will significantly reduce the amount of generate by every tonne of cement manufacture in rugby my hon friend be right and he be right to champion those industry that be work so hard to decarbonise already as my hon friend say we have the net zero hydrogen fund which will provide up to million by to support the development and construction of new low carbon hydrogen production plant which will be able to assist in cement as well as other industry lithium ion battery storage facilities regulation what assessment he have make of the adequacy of regulation for industrial lithium ion battery storage facility it be priority for this government that all net zero energy infrastructure be build operate and maintain in an appropriate and safe way my official work closely with the industry lead electricity storage health and safety governance group to ensure an appropriate robust and future proof health and safety framework be sustain as storage deployment increase we need to increase power storage but the potential fire risk associate with lithium ion battery storage facility be now become widely acknowledge what be my hon friend do to ensure those facility be not build in inappropriate location such as basing fenn in my constituency which be site sandwich between rare north flow salmonid chalk stream and hospital thank my right hon friend for her question and her tireless campaign on this important issue as discuss in that very positive meeting that have with she yesterday have be work with colleague across government to establish the appropriate treatment of these facility in planning and environmental regulation every site should be consider on its own merit and be decision for our local authority will this government stop chuntere on about battery and battery storage all the time will they get down to jcb and see its innovative new hydrogen fuel car and heavy good vehicle be it not about time that we realise that hydrogen be the future and that this government should be build pipeline of hydrogen throughout the country will not be draw on chuntering on by the hon gentleman but let just say that it be this government who allow jcb to proceed with that technology and to develop it at commercial scale be pleased to tell he that the secretary of state will be visit imminently float offshore wind supply chain what step he be take to help increase the potential benefit of float offshore wind for the supply chain the government be commit to place the uk at the forefront of the float wind sector be delighted to announce that the crown estate will be provide an update to industry this morning on gw leasing round in the celtic sea and have already commission the survey work require to support it the development of float offshore wind in the celtic sea be once in generation opportunity for my aberavon constituency for wales and for the entire united kingdom last week the climate change committee rightly blast the government for fail to deliver on their net zero commitment be profoundly concerned that float offshore wind will be squander due to the lack of grip and direction that the committee describe when will the minister be bring forward an industrial strategy for float offshore wind which will ensure that welsh manufacturing and welsh job be place at the heart of turbine and substructure fabrication start with the vital seabed licensing process thank the hon gentleman for his question we be the world leader in float offshore wind and we be determined to stay there in order to realise the industrial benefit which he rightly champion and the opportunity in wales the float wind demonstration the labour front bench team really do not like to hear this do they the fact that we have cut our emission more than any other major economy on earth under this government be what lead those on the labour front bench to sense their own inadequacy because they know what they leave behind that float wind demonstration programme be support innovation with million of government funding match by million from industry float offshore wind and all these exciting generation technology be wonderful but all of they will come to nought unless we can increase the speed and capacity of the grid connection to get the electricity onshore and to the user who need it what be the minister do to sort out the national grid and to speed up the way in which grid connection be make because without this we will go nowhere my hon friend put it so well it be so true whatever the generation if we can not get the electron where they need to go we be frustrated that be why we be determined to speed up the connection that be why from the pick report on offshore wind to the nick winser review this government lead by the under secretary of state for energy security and net zero my hon friend the member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie this be the first time that this country have have network minister be absolutely focused in laser like way on make sure that we speed up and get the delivery of the infrastructure that we need to deliver the green transition onshore wind proposals community engagement what step his department have take to ensure local community engagement in onshore wind proposal the government want community to participate in and benefit from onshore wind propose in their local area on may the government issue consultation for onshore wind partnership in england propose improvement to the current system of community engagement and benefit some energy firm give discount to those who live near onshore wind farm when the wind blow unfortunately though that be not the case everywhere will the minister look again at this policy nationally so that my constituent such as those who live in ulley near penny hill wind farm and even myself live in harthill near loscar wind farm will see the benefit of clean green wind power reflect in their energy bill the consultation on onshore wind partnership propose that the government work with renewableuk to update the industry wide community benefit protocol for onshore wind in england an update protocol would seek to encourage more innovative approach for example through developer support local energy bill discount the consultation close on july be not sure there be much point in community engagement when there be no onshore wind we do not have any onshore wind last week we hear the climate change committee devastating report on this country commitment to net zero when will this government unlock the barrier to onshore wind completely refute the suggestion that we have no onshore wind onshore wind contribute gw of power to the uk national grid as we speak and of course we support the deployment of onshore wind with community we come now to the shadow minister the minister be sort of right that there have be some onshore wind turbine build just recently two since february so there be not much chance of community engagement there to be honest in december the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities promise that the onshore wind ban would be completely lift by the end of april this year why have the government break that promise will take no lecture from the labour party on develop renewable electricity when labour leave office in they do not like to hear this but when labour leave office in less than of the grid be account for by renewable now it be think maybe the government should take lesson from labour it be now generally understand that the government consultation be likely to lead to only minimal relaxation of planning rule and that onshore wind will effectively remain ban tory peer lord deben chairman of the climate change committee say of the consultation on saturday that it be simply unacceptable that the government be still discuss whether they be in favour of onshore wind or not when it be widely recognise as one of the cheap form of energy generation he be right be he not really wish the labour party would stop talk down what we be do on renewable electricity remind the house that the consultation on onshore wind finish on july energy and trade intensive industries what assessment his department have make of the adequacy of additional support for energy and trade intensive industry wholesale energy price have fall significantly since the peak of the energy crisis so the energy bill discount scheme strike balance between provide support and certainty to business and limit the impact on public finance thank my hon friend for proper derbyshire answer can she give more information on how the government be work to help wedding venue and hospitality in general with extreme cost for electricity and gas particularly where business have sign long term contract in the face of fall world price thank my hon friend from south derbyshire it be great county to live in with great hospitality for her question business include the hospitality sector have already benefit from the energy bill relief scheme which end on march and provide billion of support we be mindful of the fix term contract which be supplier issue and we be constantly engage with stakeholder and supplier on that last week attend the opening of the first phase of new solar farm at newcastle airport it be fund by the regional development fund which post brexit we no long have access to the further three phase be vital to ensure that the airport meet its net zero target and the government meet their solar target so what be the government do to ensure that those further three phase will be support in some way by the government thank the hon lady for that information with your permission mr speaker will take that question away and find out more detail call the shadow minister the director general of uk steel say this week there be huge question mark over if government really want to sustain steel the backbone of british manufacturing or just leave it to shrink and rely on other nation supply he be right to say that it be four year since the government promise the green steel fund but not penny have be pay why be the government fail our steel community so comprehensively that be absolutely not true we be legislate for that at the moment it be incredibly important to the government that we combat that and support the energy and trade intensive industry the committee on climate change say last week that the government have high ambition for decarbonisation but no policy to deliver it we have be slow to react to the us inflation reduction act and to the eu propose green deal industrial plan the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may who for the benefit of the minister be not from the labour benches say where the uk once lead we be now fall behind when will ministers snap out of their appalling complacency and come up with the strategy and timeline that we need to support the uk in the global race for green job and investment we have meet all our carbon target and will continue to do so the government have make the commitment to continue hit and progress on those target clean energy projects planning system what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities on the adequacy of the planning system for clean energy project my department have be work closely with the department for levelling up housing and communities on deliver the proposal in the publish action plan for reform and speed up the nationally significant infrastructure project planning process an important part of those reform involve update and strengthen the national policy statement for energy last weekend james robottom the head of onshore wind at renewableuk say that he do not expect much from the government consultation on planning he say that obstacle to new onshore wind development would severely hinder investment in the onshore wind industry and its supply chain due to the high level of risk and uncertainty they create we be be deny the opportunity for thousand of new job and billion in private investment in the meantime that be cost english family per year it mean damage to the economy damage to the environment and high bill for family be it not time that we get this useless government out of the way so that we can sort it out this useless government who have deliver renewable on to the grid would much rather take our record on renewable than the labour party any day of the week the consultation on national policy statement close as the hon gentleman know on june and the government remain on track to present they to parliament and bring they into effect by the end of local authority have presumption in favour of solar and quite right too but should they not also consider the cumulative effect of solar farm wiltshire be the second large county in england for solar farm if the new red barn project at kington st michael be add it will be one of the large solar farm in britain we be cover our good agricultural land with solar farm in county such as wiltshire when the forthcoming planning policy guidance be reconsider will the minister undertake to include presumption against solar farm on grade and agricultural land food security be incredibly important and we will of course prioritise less productive land for the deployment of solar farm our reform aim to ensure that infrastructure developer consider at the outset of their programme how project can address the legitimate concern of affected community engage regularly with they throughout the pre application phase and beyond engage with statutory consultee early during the pre application stage will also benefit local community and farmer through high quality application energy security gas import from russia what recent assessment he have make of the impact of end gas import from russia on energy security end russian import in april have show that russian gas belong in the past our system be well supply last winter by north sea gas and reliable import far cry from labour energy surrender plan sponsor by just stop oil which would put we back at square one and in the hand of despot such as putin and his tyrannical regime welcome the secretary of state answer could he explain what step his department be take to ensure that no country will ever be able to hold the uk to ransom through our energy supply it be about have balanced energy supply which mean renewable nuclear power and yes where necessary oil and gas licence to do without they put the security of every single person in this country at risk and mean that household bill will go up sadly that be exactly the policy of his majesty official opposition recent report by the energy and climate intelligence unit show that regardless of ministers plan to expand domestic oil and gas production import of gas will continue to rise significantly unless we tackle demand new oil and gas licence simply will not deliver energy security as the oil and gas be sell at global price on international market they will cost the taxpayer dearly while be disaster for the climate will the government finally do what be need by rule out new licence and commit instead to measure that will genuinely make the uk energy secure include nationwide street by street home insulation programme unblock onshore wind and instal new solar on every roof we have go from of our home be insulate under the previous government to nearly will be this year and we have set up an energy taskforce to reduce the usage of energy and make it more efficient however the policy of the hon lady party and that of the official opposition of import all the oil and gas that we require and not provide new licence be simply insane it mean that every single family in britain will be subject to the next tyrant like putin and that the carbon use will be double what be take from the north sea it be bonker policy net zero target population increase what assessment he have make of the potential impact of increase in the population on the ability to meet net zero target population growth be take into account when set our decarbonisation goal specifically it be account for in our baseline emission projection which help determine the effort require to meet our carbon target do my right hon friend accept that in on present government policy we will have million more people in this country than there be in the base date for carbon dioxide emission he obviously accept that high population lead to high global emission but can he also say that when it come to climate change it would be good idea for this government to concentrate on net migration policy rather than net zero as my hon friend know the prime minister be absolutely determined to bring net migration down to sustainable level would also point out to he that the uk do not set decarbonisation target per capita because all country need to reduce emission in absolute term we be determined to play our part in do that to move to net zero but in pro growth pro business manner it be not simply about empower future generation but those that exist that be why the roll out of smart metering be important the late quarterly statistic claim that of uk household have smart meter but that mask the fact that only four out of scottish local authority be above in the roll out of smart metering five be below and three island council be below all those be also the area with the high fuel poverty as we approach march when radio teleswitching will go off how will we ensure that people have access to smart metering enable they to get off peak tariff the hon gentleman be right both to enthuse about the importance of smart metering and the benefit it can bring even more so as we move forward in the come year and to highlight the importance of ensure as ever that something so important be equitably distribute or colleague would be happy to meet he to discuss how we make sure that the issue he have rightly raise be address rooftop solar panels what step he be take to increase the use of solar panel on build roof and if he will make statement the government be support the installation of rooftop solar in numerous different way financial incentive performance standard and the solar taskforce for year now have be try to persuade government of all colour to change building regulation to require all new building to be fit with solar panel that would have the benefit of secure supply reduce household bill considerably and help we towards net zero so why do we not do it assure my hon friend that be great enthusiast for solar panel have have they on my home for the past year and they perform very well want to see more people do that in fact over that period we have go from virtually no renewable in our in the last quarter be very keen for that expansion to go far and fast we need to ensure that it be part of the building code but we also want to make sure that other form of renewable can be instal so it be balance between not be too prescriptive and make sure that we make speedy progress particularly on all the commercial rooftop in this country few week ago have the pleasure of visit an innovative housing project in rumney in my constituency which have solar panel in nearly all the new building but also ground source heat pump electric vehicle charge point and battery technology in the house bring down bill for the resident while contribute to net zero will the secretary of state join in praise cardiff labour council and the welsh labour government for the work they have do on this issue and will he explain what we be do to ensure great manufacture of those technology in this country of course be delighted that the barnett formula stretch so far in provide some of the excellent addition to those building just want to repeat that no government have go far and fast in the than this one in introduce renewable and ensure that they now power very significant part of our grid we want to go far and fast still and we will make sure that thing such as building code help with that plan net zero projects skill what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the adequacy of workforce skill for deliver net zero project we recognise that have the right skill within the workforce be critical which be why we establish the green job delivery group the climate change committee have express concern that the uk be fall behind on range of net zero commitment include on skill skilled workforce alongside new green job be key component of the green new deal but the workforce plan be not due until in the light of the urgency of address climate change will the government commit to bring that forward to some time later this year we be work as quickly as we can on ensure this the new skill that will be require be really beneficial for the uk economy so we be keen to work with the green job delivery group and the department for education in look at apprenticeship and how we can push this forward as quickly as possible clean energy technology private sector investment what step he be take to encourage private sector investment in clean energy technology what step he be take to encourage private sector investment in clean energy technology our power up britain plan seize opportunity from the transition to decarbonised energy system our policy back by billion of pound of government funding but more importantly leverage in about billion of private investment will support up to job in enfinium be build new energy from waste facility in my constituency which will process nearly tonne of waste to generate electricity for more than home and business each year will the minister join in welcome this investment in renewable energy and outline how the government be support energy from waste facility across the country thank my hon friend and be delighted to join she in welcome this new investment which will be huge asset to her community as well as have positive national implication energy from waste with combined heat and power be support through pot of the contract for difference scheme our auction system we expect to announce the result of the late round in early september and hope the house will watch that announcement with great interest what assessment have the minister make of the role of tariff support mechanism to encourage short term private sector investment in deep geothermal to support level up there be no great champion than or anyone in this house with half the knowledge of this as far as can tell my hon friend in support the potential of deep geothermal when the prime minister respond to his report know he thank my hon friend for all the work that go into it can confirm that geothermal technology that generate electricity be eligible for the contract for difference scheme we be also support and encourage the development of geothermal heating project through the green heat network fund which support the development of low carbon heat network under the leadership of my hon friend be confident that geothermal have positive future private sector business in the humber be ready and willing to invest billion in carbon capture storage and decarbonisation project however this be be put at risk because of the eight track carbon capture and storage project select not single project be approve for the humber despite the humber be the large carbon emitter in the country and the fact that of the uk license storage capacity be accessible from the humber when will these business get the clarity they need when the track expansion process be launch will both humber pipeline be approve thank the hon lady for her question and she be right to be frustrate because of the enormous potential both to decarbonise and to unlock industrial benefit for the area we be move as quickly as possible have already say that the viking project and the scottish cluster be in the favour position and the team be move as quickly as possible this year to provide more certainty and unlock further investment private sector investment in clean energy be vital but do the minister agree that one reason that the united kingdom despite have the high tidal range on planet earth after canada still use so little of it be lack of public sector leadership area such as morecambe bay which could contribute to tidal energy bring down people bill and protect we against putin be something that we could move forward will the minister agree to meet and other mps around the bay so that we can bring forward plan to get the most out of our tidal energy be not an expert in the hon gentleman history on this topic but hope it have be consistently in favour of tidal energy and therefore different from so many other area of policy share his enthusiasm for the potential of tidal energy that be why we be the world lead nation in the deployment of tidal range and why tidal power be eligible for the contract for difference scheme notwithstanding so many issue would be happy to meet the hon gentleman community energy projects what step he plan to take to support the development of community energy project the government be support local authority and community energy group to work together to develop project within uk growth funding scheme such as the uk share prosperity fund ofgem also welcome funding application from the sector to the industry voluntary redress scheme why do the government remove amendment from the energy bill last week that would have support community energy and local energy trading as we have outline previously the government do not support the amendment that be table in the lords and believe that the issue raise should be consider as part of wide market reform however we be proactively work with parliamentarian and the community energy sector to discuss whether further support from the government for the sector be need and if so what might be feasible prepayment meters what energy cost support his department have provide to customer on traditional prepayment meter the government have provide support to customer on traditional prepayment meter through the energy bill support scheme and energy price guarantee very much welcome the measure that the government have announce to support those on traditional prepayment meter but many resident in southend west such as those live in trafford house in leigh on sea be on communal heat network they be still face high price and have no control whatsoever over their heating what be the government do to encourage heat supplier to apply for the energy bill discount scheme ahead of the deadline at the end of this month which will benefit my constituent who have no control over their energy bill my hon friend be great advocate for all her constituent and she will be interested to hear that the government be commit to support domestic heat network customer with their bill that be why we introduce the energy bill discount scheme heat network support which aim to ensure that heat network customer do not face disappointingly high bill compare with customer in equivalent household can the minister tell we the value of prepayment meter voucher not cash by the june deadline what can the government do to ensure that support reach those people who be eligible to get it all hon member will know how abhorrent we find the use of forced entry to people house over prepayment meter however we have work hard and consistently to ensure that all those on prepayment meter be treat fairly and give support small modular nuclear reactors what step he be take to introduce small modular nuclear reactor into the energy mix when his department plan to complete its competitive process for small modular nuclear reactor technology be pleased and indeed proud to say that great british nuclear will be hold competition for small modular reactor because we want to attract the good design from both domestic and international vendor the government ambition be to select the lead technology by autumn provide co funding to any viable new technology our commitment to nuclear programme and to great british nuclear will enable the uk to be on path to achieve its ambition to become global leader in nuclear energy and small modular reactor as member of the welsh affairs committee hear during visit to the united states in january small modular reactor should play significant role in transition alongside large scale nuclear project do the minister agree that while north west wales have excellent scope for large scale project part of north east wales would be outstanding prospect for an smr site as well as capitalise on the region amazing manufacturing and engineering capability to drive that part of the energy mix forward the government recognise the support for nuclear power across north wales great british nuclear will work with the government on access to potential site for new nuclear project to achieve our long term ambition as first step towards the development of the new national policy statement for nuclear we will consult later this year on propose way forward for determine how new nuclear development include smr might be locate the minister will know that this country have be produce small nuclear reactor for our submarine for more than year do the minister understand that while he be dither around with his time waste international competition those international competitor be out there in the market get the order and selling back to the hilt by their own government be this go to be yet another great british development create by our scientist engineer and skilled trade but allow to slip away by blinker civil servant and weak ministers who can not make decision rolls royce be great british company which be why we previously make up to million available from the advanced nuclear fund to rolls royce smr ltd to support the development of its small modular reactor design great british nuclear will launch the first stage selection process for small modular reactor which be expect to attract the good design from domestic and international vendor which will be great for this country by the way we be go three time fast than any comparable country on this project energy cost support for households what plan he have to support household with energy cost in winter the government be commit to cheap energy for all last winter we cover half typical energy bill through the combined support of the energy price guarantee and the energy bill support scheme since october with typical household save around by the end of june there be huge gulf between the reality and the practice of the government the public accounts committee have warn this tory government about their lack of planning on support for consumer with the cost of energy this winter lack of preparedness seem serious ailment within this government give that sense research have find that more than of disabled people be cut back on their use of medical equipment when will we get proper plan from this government instead of the profiteer off the back of the most vulnerable as we see from so many energy company we be of course make plan and do not accept that we be not plan we be also talk to stakeholder and ensure that we be give the good support we can to all those who will be vulnerable in winter topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility next week will mark the day anniversary since putin launch his invasion of ukraine and begin try to blackmail the world on energy as ever britain stand strong in the face of tyranny and be pleased to report that from saturday just past energy bill be fall by an average of for household we be committed to power britain from britain despite some alarming energy surrender plan come from the opposition the climate change committee report publish last week find that of the policy and consultation that be the responsibility of the secretary of state department no less than be overdue he can not blame anyone else will he now own up to the government appal failure the actual datum argue the opposite way we have meet all our carbon budget to date the climate change committee last week say that the chance of reach carbon budget be slightly increase we be confident of meet it and we have set out our plan for carbon budget and have to say that give that this country have the good record in the world among develop nation for get carbon under control it be surprising to hear the opposition view our domestic nuclear sector and our military be struggle to recruit and retain enough nuclear engineer what discussion be the minister have with the sector and the department for education to create long term workforce plan to solve the issue since day one the skill challenge that we face have be top priority for which be why my department be work closely with the ministry of defence the dfe and the sector to tackle they with the employer lead nuclear skills strategy group we have deploy joint plan of skill action to support the civil and defence programme but would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far call the shadow secretary of state six day ago the climate change committee deliver its most scathing assessment in its history on the government record say that they be off track on out of key target it say that we have go markedly backwards in the past year on the secretary of state watch who do he blame for this failure as have be discuss more than once in these question and answer we have take this country from have only renewable energy to over we have decarbonise fast than any other nation and we be on track for carbon budget have already overdelivere on carbon budget and base on our record to date we be do pretty good job that answer be total complacency from secretary of state who have just be prove to be fail on every major aspect of his agenda that be why lord goldsmith resign lord deben have say he be fail and the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may have say that we be lose the global race be not the truth now that even the tories do not trust the tories on the climate crisis this be one of the problem with not be prepared to follow the datum which show we overdelivering on the commitment of carbon budget and and that we be more likely to meet carbon budget than we be year ago if the right hon gentleman want to ignore all that and still roll out his pre write question that be how we get to his conclusion the truth be that the government be deliver on the issue of climate change while protect every single household in the country from putin tyranny be afraid that have already be surrender by the right hon gentleman who subscribe to the just stop oil approach order can just ask the secretary of state to please not take advantage this be topical please tell if you want to pick member who you do not want to be able to ask their question will the minister tell the house what his late assessment be of the full financial cost to the united kingdom of reach net zero and if the uk reach net zero what difference that would make to global temperature we estimate that the

of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs if he will make statement on the violence in the west bank the accelerate cycle of violence in the west bank risk another round of bloodshed and the government be do everything possible to urge the de escalation of the situation the late operation by the israel defence forces in the jenin refugee camp in the northern west bank on monday be the late episode in conflict that have become more worrying as the year have progress while the uk firmly support israel right to defend itself and its citizen against terrorism we urge the israel defence forces to demonstrate restraint adhere to the principle of international humanitarian law and prioritise the protection of civilian while the security situation today remain fragile the uk welcome israeli and palestinian engagement at meeting in aqaba on february and sharm el sheik on march we be clear eyed that those meeting have not be silver bullet but they be an open meaningful channel of communication between senior israelis and palestinians at time of strife this be important in assist de escalation and reduce violence we have consistently engage with both the israelis and the palestinians to urge they to de escalate tension and to support effort towards renew negotiation my right hon friend the foreign secretary speak to the israeli foreign minister eli cohen on june when they discuss the security situation in the west bank have speak to the palestinian prime minister mohammad shtayyeh on june can confirm that the minister for the middle east lord ahmad will be discuss the evolve situation with the israeli ambassador later today far to discussion in recent day he also speak to the palestinian foreign minister riyad al maliki on may our ambassador in tel aviv and jerusalem regularly speak to both the israeli government and the palestinian authority to urge de escalation and to make clear our expectation that all side avoid unilateral step that move the party far away from dialogue let finally draw the house attention to the statement that the foreign secretary make jointly with his canadian and australian counterpart last friday the uk oppose israel announce proposal to expand settlement across the west bank and we ask israel to halt and reverse its policy of support settlement expansion settlement be not the only obstacle to peace but they be an important one and our concern about these recent step be clear the life lose in this wide conflict be tragic there be an urgent need for all party to avoid further escalation in the west bank and gaza now and in the day ahead the past hour have see horrifying military assault by the israel defence forces on the overcrowded refugee camp in jenin the un refugee agency say that about people live in less than half square kilometre in the camp yet we have all witness on our screen the israel defence forces launch air attack include attack from drone and they have send in hundred if not thousand of ground troop in the large military action in the west bank for year news agency be report death of palestinians include three child and palestinians injure while the palestinian red crescent say that it have evacuate people the un vanessa huguenin have say we be alarmed at the scale of air and ground operation that be take place in jenin the world health organisation have say first responder have be prevent from enter the refugee camp meanwhile the palestinian authority leadership have resolve to immediately petition the un security council to implement resolution and the relevant resolution on provide international protection to the palestinian people stop unilateral measure and impose sanction on the occupy power the uk currently hold the presidency of the un security council and be therefore responsible for guide its response to request make by the palestinian authority may therefore ask the follow question what be the uk government do in their capacity as president of the un security council how have they respond at the un to the palestinian authority call for international protection what have the foreign office say to its israeli counterpart about the israel defence forces prevent medical staff from access the jenin refugee camp or fire tear gas into hospital shelter child and elderly resident finally what step will the foreign secretary take to review whether the idf have make any use of uk arm sell to israel in this attack will he immediately suspend all arm sale include surveillance technology and will he ban collaboration between the uk and israel armed force and military industry as result of this horrific attack on civilian thank the hon lady for bring the urgent question to the house this be matter of deep concern to we all we will continue to urge the israel defence forces to demonstrate restraint in this operation so that all party can try to avoid further escalation in the west bank and gaza as have say while the uk will always support israel right to self defence the protection of civilian particularly child must always be prioritise and we expect the armed force conduct always to be in line with international humanitarian law we therefore call on israel to adhere to those principle of necessity and proportionality while defend its legitimate security interest call the chair of the foreign affairs committee we stand on the precipice of the gaza crisis of and the third intifada yesterday an israeli military incursion into the jenin refugee camp result in the death of more than refugee hundred be injure and as the hon member for cynon valley beth winter say the ensue gun battle have prevent civilian from get the aid and medical care they need today five israeli civilian be kill in terrorist car ram and stabbing and we be in an endless cycle of violence we need return to the diplomatic table jordan and egypt have be try to facilitate that and stand ready to continue to do so but they must see meaningful effort to stand up for the agreement reach at previous meeting such as the one in aqaba therefore call on the government to try to secure the following the israelis must stop the expansion of illegal settlement we be see that continue and it must stop they agree to do that at aqaba we must see hamas end its terror attack on israel they be wrong they be terror attack and although we have no influence over hamas we must use our voice to make it clear that it must immediately stop as the uk can we urge our israeli friend to show restraint can we appoint middle east peace process envoy who can be task with spend their entire time work with our ally around the region to de escalate the situation our voice be unique and will be hear and we have role to play in the peace process finally will we use our un security council presidency through that role we can shed light on what be take place thank the chair of the foreign affairs committee for her salient and wise comment as always may reiterate that on friday the foreign secretary make joint statement with the canadians and australians to set out very clearly our opposition to israel announcement of the expansion of settlement across the west bank we be ask israel to halt and reverse that policy of settlement expansion with immediate effect more widely of course we recognise the very real security challenge face israel and the palestinian authority and condemn all terrorist group plan and carry out attack but we mourn the loss of innocent life indeed the injury to civilian and particularly child be deeply concern we will continue to speak and our colleague be speak to our israeli team today about the urgent need for all party to de escalate and prevent the further loss of civilian life we must all be extremely concerned about the situation in the refugee camp in the city of jenin as well as the ongoing deteriorate situation in the conflict as whole israel have the right to defend itself against militant group but that right must be exercise proportionately and in line with international law be therefore very concerned that report suggest there be significant civilian casualty in jenin be also aware that statement from the spokesman for the united nations secretary general suggest that this military operation have not be conduct within the parameter of humanitarian law the secretary general be say to be deeply concerned about the situation on the ground likewise be extremely concerned about the break news of suspect car ram in tel aviv where late report suggest that at least five people be injure can the minister provide an urgent update on the situation we will always condemn act of terrorism which only make peace hard to achieve on jenin be concern about report that emergency health team have be prevent from enter jenin to treat the injured and to help people in general and that two hospital have be damage the world health organisation have report that three child have recently be kill be sure that everyone in the house will agree that it be truly appal that child palestinian and israeli continue to be the innocent victim in this conflict do the minister agree that all civilian death must be thoroughly and impartially investigate and that there must be meaningful accountability let be clear that the opposition will continue to be strong and consistent advocate of justice human right and international law in this conflict we also condemn the unacceptable use of violence against civilian in all circumstance in our view there will be last peace only when there be negotiate diplomatic settlement to the israeli palestinian conflict the only real solution will be settlement base on two state safe and secure israel alongside viable and independent palestinian state we strongly oppose action that make this two state solution hard to achieve so my fundamental question be what of substance be the minister and the government do to bring this immediate conflict to an end and to lay the foundation for two state solution do not have the late information on the tel aviv attack but understand that hamas be claim it as one of theirs we absolutely condemn hamas use of indiscriminate violence and attack of this nature there can never be any justification for such act of violence and we will continue to call on hamas and other terrorist group to permanently end their incitement against israel importantly ministers and our ambassador will continue to work very closely today and in the day ahead to urge the de escalation of the present situation in jenin understand that this come in the context of for year israel building settlement that block the route to settlement of this dispute and understand that israel be fail to show restraint fail to follow international humanitarian law and fail to protect civilian what be the government actually go to do as say the statement that the foreign secretary put out with his canadian and australian counterpart last week set out clear message to the israelis about stop the settlement expansion we will continue to work with our friend and ally to make that message clearly hear call the snp spokesperson violence on all side must be condemn however contrary to what the minister say illegal settlement be barrier to peace yet the uk government continue to fail to take any meaningful action towards prevent that this violence represent serious escalation of tension on the west bank as we have hear palestinians and israelis have lose their life what assessment have be make of the potential chain reaction of violence that this could unleash it have be confirm that thousand of people have be displace from the camp what discussion have the minister have with international colleague on how to minimise the suffering of those refugee civilian who have now be displace twice this morning un aid agency voice alarm at the scale of israel military operation in jenin report that water and energy supply have be damage so will the uk government commit to work with partner to provide additional humanitarian funding to restore these vital supply for people there the uk position be clear settlement be illegal under international law and they call into question israel commitment to the two state solution so we have urge israel to halt that settlement expansion which be threaten the physical viability of palestinian state to the hon gentleman point we be work with our partner the united states france germany and italy to strongly oppose these unilateral step be afraid that do not have the late information on humanitarian funding but our team work very closely through the united nations relief and rehabilitation administration and other humanitarian organisation would be happy to ask the relevant minister to update the house later on what the late commitment be clearly this morning car ramming be only the most recent of the terrorist attack that have emanate from the city of jenin so far operation house and garden have result in the destruction of three lab hundred of improvise explosive device and thousand of grenade underneath the mosque there be two tunnel with hundred of weapon and people have be arrest clearly the terrorist activity be go to be severely limited behind all this be the islamic revolutionary guard corps hamas and the jenin battalion do my right hon friend agree with that this be proportionate attempt to reduce terrorism against the state of israel as say while the uk remain absolutely resolute in its commitment to israel security and we condemn absolutely the use of indiscriminate force by hamas and other terrorist group we call on all party to maintain proportionate balance so that we can de escalate the exist situation and ensure that civilian be not catch up in this any more with water and electricity service in the jenin refugee camp damage as result of the violence camp resident be unable to move from their home many be in urgent need of food drink water and medical support but the ambulance have be prevent from reach the wounded will the secretary of state raise with the israeli authority the issue of access for ambulance and medical team to the jenin camp the fcdo minister for the middle east lord ahmad will be listen to the debate and will be able to give an update in the other place later today about his ongoing discussion with israeli counterpart let we be clear any loss of innocent civilian life be one too many but let we also be clear that the palestinian authority have lose control over jenin and it have become safe haven for terrorist terror group have fortify the area with ied and last week they fire rocket towards israel from inside the camp iran have also boast about arming training and fund the palestinian terror group that operate there do the minister agree that it be in the interest of both the palestinians and the israelis that terror group cease these operation which only far destabilise the palestinian authority and the region with innocent people die as consequence we recognise the real security concern face israel and the palestinian authority while they try to deal with those terrorist group and we condemn absolutely terrorist group plan and carry out attack to my hon friend point on the loss of innocent life every loss be one too many and there will also be serious number of injury to civilian we continue to be deeply concerned by the cycle of violence in the west bank the urgent need for all party to de escalate to prevent that loss of life remain critical unless and until we acknowledge our own role in this develop tragedy anything the minister say at the dispatch box be essentially go to be meaningless the increase in violence by the idf and the expansion of settlement in the west bank happen because we and other country in the west do nothing to hold israel to account so could the minister tell we now will she commit to support an international criminal court investigation into what be happen there will the government here now set timetable for the recognition of the palestinian state this government and members on both side of the house do not waver from the two state solution that we all wish to see as have say settlement be illegal under international law and we will continue alongside ally and partner to make that point clear as for the ongoing activity today hope that lord ahmad will be able to pick up on that later today as progress be make with our counterpart in israel but have our strategic partnership with israel announce in this house afford we any leverage over israeli policy in the west bank our strategic relationship with israel be strong and long stand one we work with israel in many area from security to trade it be an important partner that do not negate the fact that we want to see de escalation of the current situation and to ensure that the loss of civilian life be minimise share the distress of other at the loss of civilian life islamic jihad have already claim several of the dead as islamic jihad fighter and as we have hear the israelis say that the camp be use as hub for terrorist operation do the minister think any more can be do to prevent terrorist from embed themselves among civilian particularly in place such as refugee camp we recognise the security challenge that be face and will continue to be face not only by israel and the palestinian authority in this case but elsewhere in the world where innocent live in refugee camp be use as cover for terrorist wish to cause harm we all have to continue to tackle that not only in the west bank but around the world importantly in this situation we will all continue to urge de escalation to reduce the risk of any further civilian casualty or loss of life this year have see more palestinians kill than in any other year more settlement start announce than in any other year more demolition in east jerusalem than in any other year and more violence in general we be on the precipice of another intifada at the minute it look to as though israel be act with impunity and this be an all out assault on palestinian life so what action will the government undertake not just conversation to bring this dreadful escalation in violence to an end we be absolutely committed to work with all party on the challenge associate with demolition so that people remain calm and avoid provocation but we be clear that in all but the most exceptional of circumstance demolition and forced eviction be contrary to international humanitarian law the practice cause unnecessary suffering to palestinians and be harmful to effort to promote peace in particular we be monitor development at masafer yatta closely and we have make our view clear to the israeli government on that matter constituent have write to about their grave concern for the welfare of civilian and health worker in the jenin camp they like know that the israeli army enjoy climate of impunity because the international community never hold israel to account for its action israel continue to breach international law include the fourth geneva convention as we have hear already today settlement be war crime under the rome statute so my question for the minister be what specific action will the government take to ensure that israel adhere to international law and that its leader be hold accountable for its war crime as say we have be clear on this my colleague in the other place will speak with the israeli ambassador later today to ensure that we put forward the uk view that de escalation be urgently require in this difficult situation and that we continue to tackle the question associate with illegal settlement which be contrary to humanitarian law when the russians have bomb predominantly civilian area result in the death of civilian we have rightly condemn it as war crime why have the government not condemn these action which be result in the loss of civilian life as war crime have the government call in the israeli ambassador to remind she in the strong term possible of the legal responsibility that israel have to protect civilian the uk support israel right to defend itself and its citizen against terrorist activity but we be clearly urge the idf to demonstrate restraint in order to prioritise the protection of civilian as say lord ahmad will be speak with the israeli ambassador later today we all condemn attack on civilian regardless of which community they be from the action of the idf in jenin be indefensible and have result in be one of the most lethal year for palestinians the uk have long claim to support two state solution endorse un security council resolution and recognise that settlement be illegal under international law so after yesterday appalling move to block action by citizen and public body to stop illegal occupation and settlement have uk government policy change as say this government will continue to stress the importance of the adherence to the principle of necessity and proportionality when israel defend its legitimate security interest as well as the importance of continue to provide appropriate protection to the palestinian civilian population particularly child at around am yesterday year old majdi younis saud ararawi sustain gunshot wound to the chest and nouruddin husam yousef marshoud who be just be shoot in the head by israeli occupation force their name join list of more than palestinian child kill by the israeli regime since the beginning of the ultimate cause of those senseless killing be israel brutal and illegal occupation of palestine which have go on for over half century give that last night the government vote for legislation ban peaceful mean of protest against this abomination and give britain humanitarian and historic responsibility to the palestinian people what action have the government take the minister have duck the question so far but will give she another chance to answer what action will the government take to ensure that israel adhere to international law and its leader be hold to account as have say we be engage both with the israelis and the palestinians to urge they to de escalate those tension lord ahmad will be speak to the israeli ambassador later highlight and demand that under international law access to medical care and staff be allow so that those who be injure in the jenin refugee camp be able to receive the medical care that they require the use of aerial bombardment and armoured assault by thousand of troop in refugee camp familiar to the people of gaza be now extend to the west bank alongside settlement expansion it be part of the annexation of the occupied palestinian territories by israel far right government occupation be the cause and context of these late war crime will the government acknowledge that and respond by recognise the state of palestine as say across this house we continue our long stand position of two state solution we will continue to work with partner across the world to find solution that allow that to happen in the meantime we be deeply trouble by the level of violence and we continue to call on israel while defend itself and its citizen to demonstrate the restraint require to ease the situation in jenin today my thought go out to the people affect by the horrific attack on the jenin refugee camp we must be clear that this be violation of international law and that the occupy force in particular have responsibility to end the violence will give clear suggestion of possible action will the uk government send clear message of condemnation by bring to an end the importation into the uk of good that be produce in those israeli settlement that be deem illegal under international law as say we will continue to make call on good make in the settlement be not allow to be import and that continue to be the case we continue to grow the work that we do on trade with israel the palestinian authority and the opt and know the department for business and trade be focus on that development report july vol do not think the minister understand the power of office today we have hear comment and some warm word but we have see no action the uk currently have the power of hold the presidency of the united nations security council so will she call the security council together to act now on the atrocity that we have see in jenin what other measure will she take to stop further atrocity occur as say we continue to work on the peaceful two state solution later today lord ahmad will provide an update in the other place on our continue activity this year have already be the deadly for violence in the west bank since what assessment have the minister make of the impact of rise israeli violence against palestinian civilian will give she another chance do she not agree that civilian death should lead to investigation and accountability as say we continue to be deeply trouble by the high number of palestinian civilian who have be kill and injure as the hon lady highlight while israel have legitimate right to defend itself it be important that israeli force exercise maximum restraint especially in the use of live fire when protect that legitimate security interest draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests peace be word we often hear in relation to israel and palestine but how can peace be achieve when palestinians be subject to systematic and deliberate oppression and discrimination by israeli authority the people in the jenin refugee camp have already flee their home and they have be displace yet again can the minister set out what be be do by the international community to help those who have now be displace twice will she condemn the denial to access medical care for palestinians in jenin and will she join in call out israel behaviour for what it be as state in report by amnesty international israel be commit the crime of apartheid against palestinians as say lord ahmad will be speak to the israeli ambassador later and will be make clear that we want to ensure that medical supply be able to get into refugee camp to provide the care that be need to those who be injure as result of the violence of the past few day report from jenin be shocking particularly report that medical team be unable to get access to civilian in need support what the chair of the foreign affairs committee the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns say about have step towards solution and an ending of israeli settlement the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs report there have be at least attack by settler against palestinians in the west bank this year which be an average of three attack day what be the minister do in discussion with her counterpart on tackle israeli settler violence as well as on the issue face because of new palestinian militant group action be need now to de escalate the situation as well as look again at the international funding for the united nations relief and works agency which be vital to support palestinian refugee as say we condemn settler violence in the strong possible term and we urge the israeli authority to do what they can the foreign secretary statement publish with australia and canada at the end of last week highlight the very clear demand that the government of israel reverse their decision to approve over new settlement unit in the west bank and change the settlement approval process we will continue to work with ally to achieve that the escalation of violence in the west bank over the past year and the killing of innocent civilian include child in recent day be devastating the two state solution which many of we hope will bring peace and stability to the region seem far away than ever what be the government actively do to stop the killing of innocent people and to ensure that two state settlement be still diplomatic reality as have say we continue to work with partner and ally on the two state solution indeed we call on all those catch up in the violence today to show restraint and to de escalate the situation so that the violence can come to halt and we can ensure that those casualty be able to receive treatment my good and hon friend the member for cynon valley beth winter be absolutely correct in her remark and thank she for secure this urgent question visit the refugee camp at jenin in and see some of the clinic and school to say that the condition be grim be an understatement what we have see over the past day or two be an attack by israeli security force on refugee camp use missile against child parent the elderly and the vulnerable this be not about israel defend itself even the white house have state that it be tyranny when will the uk government intervene not just with word to condemn those action but with something in practical term to support the palestinian people undergo such appalling oppression the uk position on the middle east peace process be clear and we will continue to support negotiate settlement which lead to safe and secure israel live side by side with viable and sovereign palestinian state base on the border in the short term we be call very firmly as be all partner around the world on israeli defence force to show the require level of restraint to ensure that the violence cease in jenin refugee camp as soon as possible thank my hon friend the member for cynon valley beth winter for secure this urgent question it have be report that medical team have be prevent from enter jenin will the minister condemn that now from the dispatch box will she express to her counterpart that palestinians must have medical aid and can she then return to the house to update mps on the medical situation as have say international humanitarian law require access to be make available for medical team to treat those in need of care so we be urge israel to allow that as soon as possible know that my colleague the minister for the middle east will be raise that particularly urgently with the israeli ambassador when he speak to she this afternoon will ensure that an update be provide by the department in due course the last time that we see tension rise like this we experience month of hate with incident of antisemitism rise to an all time high and horror trope on the street of london do the minister agree that while discussion be take place to de escalate the situation we all have duty to temper our language to make sure that jewish resident such as my constituent do not live in fear of abuse graffiti racist convoy and ultimately violence we all have duty to try to tackle this behaviour on the street when we see it we all have duty to ensure that antisemitic voice be not allow to cause distress or violence we will continue to ensure that those who feel anxious get the support they need we provide great deal of support and be very proud of the work that the home office do in support of many of our jewish community this year we have see record number of settlement unit approve the israeli finance minister have instruct ministry to prepare for an additional settler on the west bank we have see palestinian child kill while the government urge restraint and we get the same weak answer time and again from the dispatch box israel be act with impunity think the minister say it slightly wrong early on but it seem that she be say that trade with illegal settlement be now deem illegal by the uk government be that the case let reiterate again that the uk position on settlement be absolutely clear those settlement be illegal under international law and indeed they call into question that commitment to the two state solution to which the uk be commit we will continue to urge israel to halt that and ensure that the trade relationship that we have with israel and the occupied palestinian territories can progress as they need to many of my luton south constituent have be in touch to say how distressed and angry they be about the increase in violence on the west bank many have set out that the access to supply clean water and powdered milk for child be at risk so beyond conversation can the minister confirm that there will be additional support for healthcare and medical organisation on the ground so that they can help civilian once my noble friend lord ahmad have have discussion with the israeli ambassador will ensure that further information on how we will continue to support unrwa and other humanitarian group focus in particular on this incident be afraid that do not have more information to hand at the moment one eye witness in an interview with cnn have compare the impact of the incursion with natural disaster in term of the destruction of infrastructure such as road water system and electricity what role can the british government play in help reconstruction to reduce further humanitarian suffering be it the policy of the british government that the state of israel should pay reparation for damage to civilian infrastructure in the occupy territory as result of military activity as have say we have see the violent activity today on our tv and we call on the israeli defence forces and the israeli government to demonstrate the restraint that be require to prioritise the protection of civilian and ensure that we can see both medical support get into the jenin camp and de escalation of the violence as soon as possible wish to pass on my thank to my hon friend the member for cynon valley beth winter for raise this issue today will give the minister one more chance before we end this urgent question can she set out with far far great clarity than she have do so far what action the government will take as president of the un security council to ensure that israel adhere to international law and that its leader be hold accountable as set out early this week the foreign secretary speak to the israeli foreign minister eli cohen on june and to palestinian prime minister shtayyeh on june such conversation be go on day after day lord ahmad will be able to give an update on his conversation later on in the day in the other place israel be clearly in breach of international humanitarian law as well as multiple un security council resolution the minister have duck the very specific question on the security council on multiple occasion as president of the security council the uk have particular power to convene the security council and indeed the responsibility to do so can the minister give we very clearcut answer will the uk government convene the security council on this issue yes or no as have say the government continue not only to have close discussion with the israelis to try to ensure de escalation of the violence that we be see today but to work closely with our ally and partner to ensure that we continue to support and give the clear direction of international partner on the question of the two state solution thank the minister of state for her measured and careful answer to the urgent question it be important that her interest in this matter be put on the record will she outline what discussion have take place with our israeli ally to renew peace talk to allow both state to co exist beside each other without the tit for tat action that have become normalise and yet be truly horrific and heartbreaking for all those who be lose love one in this conflict thank the hon gentleman for his question he be right that when this violence occur the great tragedy be that civilian be catch up in it especially where the israeli defence forces be legitimately try to defend themselves and indeed palestinians from the terrorist threat the foreign secretary continue to have strong focus on this and we be work with leader and our ally around the world to try to find solution the minister mention that the government have urge the israeli defence forces to demonstrate restraint and have urge de escalation to protect civilian but action speak louder than word can the minister say what it will take for the government to suspend arm sale to israel until we can be sure that they be not be use to violate international law and perpetrate war crime and human right abuse would appreciate it if the minister could give well think out answer to the question instead of refer to pre script note in folder will continue to state the fact that these violent activity be ongoing and colleague be in discussion right now with israeli counterpart do not wish to disturb those discussion in any way be here to update the house on as much as we know it be an ongoing situation but know that when my colleague lord ahmad respond to an urgent question later in the day he will have more information to share in the other place have listen carefully to the minister but since the government have sell million worth of arm to israel and uk arm have be implicate in previous atrocity against palestine can the minister say categorically whether any of that military equipment have be use in israel assault on the jenin refugee camp do not this attack again show why the government should suspend all arm sale to israel until it abide by international law the government take our defence export responsibility seriously and we operate some of the most robust export control in the world reiterate as colleague have hear say before in previous role that all application for export licence be assess on case by case basis against strict criterion and we will not issue licence if there be clear risk that equipment might be use for internal repression the government will continue to monitor closely the situation in israel gaza and the west bank and if extant licence be find to be no long consistent with those criterion those licence will be revoke point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker my dad god rest his soul say to that there be not many lever to tackle injustice but boycott be one of they that be why could not vote for the government economic activity of public bodies overseas matters bill yesterday which ministers and lawyer have say would likely place the united kingdom in breach of international law obligation the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns have inform she that will be mention she say in an intervention on the minister the foreign office own legal advice state that the bill could breach unsc how be be tell repeatedly from the dispatch box that that be not the case when that be what government lawyer be say themselves she say please do not repeat that this do not change anything when the government lawyer themselves say it do official report july vol conservative members seem to have be inform that the bill could breach international law while government ministers state the opposite be minded to believe the hon lady but could you advise madam deputy speaker on what can do to ensure that the government place all their legal advice in the library so that we can all have read and discover who be tell the truth thank the hon lady for give notice of her point of order no the chair do not have the power nor have it ever in the whole of our constitutional development to require the government to place any document in the library and certainly not legal advice the hon lady who be well verse in these matter have rightly use the opportunity of point of order to put her opinion on the record and be sure that it will have be hear by those on the treasury bench as say she be well verse in these matter and she will know it have be the long stand practice of government of every political persuasion not to publish their legal advice that be the normal course and certainly have no power from the chair to compel the government to do otherwise on point of order madam deputy speaker last week in justice question the justice secretary conflate the conviction rate and the charge rate for sex offender and allege rapist in the uk every day woman will be rap and only three of those rape will end in charge what can the house do to emphasise to ministers that conflate the conviction rate with the charge rate in the court be basic error the secretary of state should know well and not repeat the sloppy practice of mix up the two especially on the very sensitive question of rape conviction as mr speaker and the deputy speakers have say many time from this chair the interpretation of statistic be not matter for the chair one person look at statistic and come to one conclusion while someone else look at those statistic and come to different conclusion the hon lady have make her point well and be sure that those on the treasury bench will have hear it republic of somaliland recognition motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require his majesty government to recognise formally the republic of somaliland to make provision in connection with the establishing of diplomatic relation with the republic of somaliland and for connected purpose draw the attention of the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests the fourth of july be often know as independence day for particular country but be not here to talk about the united states be here to talk about the republic of somaliland on june britain grant independence to the british protectorate of somaliland it be in the euphoria of that moment that somaliland few day later enter into union with the old italian trust territory of somaliland union that prove deeply unhappy while it start in hope and optimism that union end in tragedy it see the rise of brutal military dictatorship base in mogadishu whose next step be the persecution and genocide of many somalilanders over the follow year that union see genocide unfold with the loss of many life be talk about not just ten of thousand but hundred of thousand of life in the capital city of somaliland it see somali air force jet rise to the sky to drop bomb on the people of hargeisa some of the city be completely destroy and there be destruction in many other city right across somaliland that union also see many of the nomadic tribe of somaliland persecute with their well their only source of life which provide they vital water be poison hundred of thousand of people die in that genocide and sadly much of the world do not notice or pay attention the impact be not just on the people kill every single family in somaliland be touch by that violence and many family either be displace within the border of somaliland or have to flee to neighbouring country such as ethiopia and djibouti we in this country should take pride in the fact that we welcome so many of those somalilanders to our shore and that they make we their home as so many somalilanders have do in the past it be that connection connection that go back long before independence that tie our two nation together out of that genocide out of that civil war we see the emergence once again of an independent country in somaliland be able to declare itself free of somalia it be able to stand proud and independent away from the persecution and genocide that it have suffer for so long somalilanders have ask the world for recognition for more than year now they have ask the world to recognise what be there on the horn of africa they have listen to country such as britain the united states france and germany which have turn to they and say we expect certain thing democratic process parliamentary and presidential election and judicial process we expect you to educate your boy and girl we expect you to be welcome and safe place for people to visit and somaliland have deliver that yet it still wait for recognition from country such as britain the united states france germany and so many other that wait be too long somaliland be country do everything that it believe people expect democratic free country to be do but it ask for something in return the people of somaliland have over so many decade be willing to look to britain as friend in fact when we be in our great need during the second world war the people of somaliland join with we in our battle against fascism they fight side by side with british soldier when be in hargeisa visit the commonwealth war grave cemetery where see british name and the name of somalilanders blood be spill by both our nation for those common value and interest we now need to step up as nation and do something more than just be there it be time to recognise somaliland for too long we have resist that we always find excuse for inertia and inaction now be the time for we to start be brave and reward the people who be do the thing that we as nation ask they to do somaliland do not live in the easy of neighbourhood it have difficult neighbour but it be democratic country that want to educate its boy and girl and have fair and robust judicial system those be thing that we need to reward we need to put they on pedestal and say this be an example that we want other to follow say that if the government will not take the action that be require let it be the british house of commons that lead the way if the foreign commonwealth and development office be deaf let we show the will to recognise what be nation country that have its own judicial process election and every other function that we want in democratic nation if the government be reluctant to take action let this house do it let we ensure that we reward those who be do what be need as we look at somaliland we see country that be develop and that have investment come into it thank the british government for the investment in berbera port and the highway north to hargeisa but by the simple act of recognition we could transform the life of million people make every single one of they more prosperous and enable somaliland good ally of this country to play big role on the world stage and vital role in support the value that we in this house hold dear somaliland may seem far off place and recognise that nation of million perhaps do not seem significant to britain but it be it play pivotal role in africa urge this house to take the action that be require to support the republic of somaliland and ensure that we deliver for its people as they have defend what we value so dearly democracy and freedom question put and agree

current purpose as set out in hc of session further resource not exceed be authorise for use for capital purpose as so set out and further sum not exceed be grant to his majesty to be issue by the treasury out of the consolidated fund and apply for expenditure on the use of resource authorise by opperman call the chair of the work and pensions committee to open the debate be very grateful to have be grant today debate about dwp spending will focus in particular on universal credit whose roll out start year ago in the dwp be forecast to have by some considerable margin the high expenditure of any government department at billion in this financial year follow by the department of health and social care at billion dwp spending be the large by considerable distance of course the dwp forecast be uncertain almost all its funding count as annually manage expenditure it be hard to forecast demand lead spending dwp admin spending departmental expenditure limit be low in real term this year than in universal credit spending be forecast to be billion this financial year which be billion high than forecast in these estimate last year reflect the recent much need uprating and high case load in february million household be receive universal credit payment key argument in the business case for universal credit be the prospect of reduce fraud and error nearly quarter of the billion net present value gain expect over year from introduce universal credit be due to come from low fraud and error in fact fraud and error have be much bad than they be for legacy benefit the department statistic show that the universal credit overpayment rate decrease but from an astronomical in may to last year know that the department be set out to address that problem and that it have obtain resource from the treasury to do so underpayment be at their high ever record rate last year at hope the minister will be able to tell we about plan for tackle those problem an additional reason that it be so important to get decision right at the moment be that universal credit be passport to cost of live support payment there be strong case for merge the various benefit into universal credit and the success of the system in get urgently need support out effectively during the pandemic be very important and very impressive however there be some big problem above all the problem of the five week wait between apply for the benefit and receive the first payment with legacy benefit the first payment would usually arrive week and half or so after apply with universal credit have spend hundred of million of pound on what we be always assure be agile technology the same thing now take five week that be fundamental and unnecessary flaw the security be absent from social security in january the government reject the select committee recommendation to eliminate the wait and instead pay all first time claimant of universal credit starter payment equivalent to three week of the standard allowance just to tide people over the government response point out that claimant can access advance but of course those be loan repayment reduce the already low monthly award and repay advance be major driver of the explosive growth in food bank demand that we have see our colleague in the other place those on the lords economic affairs committee with its conservative chair succinctly highlight the consequence of the five week wait in july last year the five week wait for the first payment drive many people into rent arrear reliance on foodbank and debt as such ask the minister once again whether the government will reconsider our recommendation or whether we have to wait for different government for that fundamental flaw to be address be very pleased to say that one area in which the government have listen to the committee be reimbursement of childcare cost for people claim universal credit warmly welcome the lifting of the cap and up front payment for childcare announce in the budget and hope that our future report will have comparable level of success those change will support people to be in work in future last week the child poverty action group publish fascinating report call you reap what you code highlight area where the universal credit computer system do not deliver what it should it give the example that legislation and guidance allow some group to submit universal credit claim up to month in advance but the system do not allow that nor be there an adequate workaround outside the digital system as such some care leaver and prisoner expect release can miss out on an entitlement that they be due for all its success in the pandemic be unstinting in my recognition of that success the rigidity of the digital system be problem can the minister tell we whether fix be plan for that problem of early claim which the child poverty action group highlight last week do the level of benefit meet need in the way it be suppose to do benefit represent value for the taxpayer the committee be conduct an important inquiry into benefit level in the uk and will report in the first half of next year benefit level be very low the joseph rowntree foundation and the trussell trust tell the committee that the basic rate of universal credit its standard allowance or equivalent in previous now at its low level in real term in almost year cpi adjust and its low ever level as proportion of average earning they estimate from pretty careful research that single adult need per week to cover essential food utility vital household item and travel that be exclude rent and council tax universal credit standard allowance be per week for single adult over that be shortfall of at least per week and deduction for advance payment for example often pull actual support well below the headline rate the joseph rowntree foundation and the trussell trust call for an essential guarantee they make the point which have be suggest this week in the press that we might get below inflation uprating of benefit next year make those problem even bad would be grateful if the minister give an assurance on that front because that would be very bad news indeed do the chair of the select committee agree that the government need to resist the temptation to try to plug the gap with one off payment they should actually look at the wide more structural problem that they have with the social security system rather than just try to plug gap when the system be fall apart at the seam the hon gentleman make an important point and very much value his contribution to the work of the select committee he be quite right and hope that we will be able to look at some of those structural issue over the course of the inquiry if universal credit do meet basic need other demand include on food bank would decrease when the week uplift to universal credit be introduce there be significant drop in food bank use when that uplift be remove food bank use go straight back up again universal credit be intend to make work pay but how can it achieve that aim if people do not have the mean to pay bus fare for example in evidence to the committee the trussell trust the joseph rowntree foundation and the public law project all highlight not be able to buy public transport ticket as significant barrier to work as far as we can tell the government have make no assessment at all of whether benefit level be adequate if be wrong about that would very much welcome the minister tell we but there be certainly no evidence of such an assessment ever have be make hope the department will look very carefully at the finding of our report when they be publish in due course one other point be highlight in briefing for this debate prepare by the charity barnardo that charity describe the two child limit as the single big policy driver of child poverty in the uk and say that end it would be the most cost effective way of reduce child poverty lift quarter of million child out of poverty and ease the poverty of further child the cost of do so would be billion per year must say that be puzzle about the justification for the two child limit it presumably reflect belief that parent should not have more than two child but as far as understand it that be not the government view indeed government members be understandably start to worry about our fall birth rate so why do we refuse to provide support for child beyond the first two be it not time to just scrap that limit which do not seem to make any sense another reason for high dwp expenditure this year be the continuation of cost of live support expenditure be forecast to increase by just over billion this year due to high in this financial year compare with last year and high take up those payment have be crucial but they do not fully meet need particularly the disability support payment last month maddy rose of mencap tell the select committee that the payment be clearly not commensurate with the extra cost that those eligible incur and we have hear other strong evidence to the committee along those line helen barnard of the trussell trust tell we last month that the cost of live payment have certainly help the family that have get it but of course it be flat payment it be not calibrate for the number of people you be try to feed so it have clearly go less far if you be family with child than if you be single person or couple that be one of the reason why the trussell trust datum show fast rise in food bank demand among family with child than among family without the lump sum nature of the payment be problematic citizens advice speak for many tell the committee that increment to universal credit would be well than one off payment our colleague on the treasury committee call on the government last december to provide monthly payment over six month period to give more household support at the time of their great need and reduce the severity of the disincentive to work the government reject that proposal essentially due to the limitation of the it system but as we know from the pandemic monthly universal credit can be increase overnight the need to meet specific qualifying period for each payment window have lead to what evidence to the committee have describe as cliff edge where receive nil uc award one month maybe due to sanction or high salary due to backpay or bonus cause recipient to become ineligible for the entire cost of live support payment in that qualification period be look forward to discuss cost of live support far with the minister responsible for social mobility youth and progression the under secretary of state for work and pensions the hon member for mid sussex mims davies at the committee tomorrow morning very important aim in achieve effective spending be transparency over how the money be be spend and what be be achieve the department have have very poor record in recent year so warmly welcome sign of new commitment to transparency since the appointment of the new secretary of state keep thing hide which have be the department practice have the short term advantage for ministers of avoid have to answer sometimes awkward question but over the medium and long term people depend on the department form the impression that it be conspire against they the result be terrible mistrust cause the department very serious problem over time for example the very serious lack of confidence in the dwp among disabled people at the moment it do not have to be like that but change thing require deliberate effort on the department behalf none of the recently introduce employment support initiative have regular performance report on introduction warmly welcome the minister announcement of six monthly performance report for the restart scheme that be one of the sign of welcome change in the department approach but it should be the norm and part of the arrangement build in at the outset not something that have to be drag from the department kicking and scream subsequently great openness could deliver wholly different relationship between the department and the people depend on its service with the department see to be work with those it serve rather than conspire against they an interesting suggestion in the child poverty action group report mention early you reap what you code be that the source code for the universal credit computer system should be publish there would no doubt be some security concern about do that but could not small team with expert from disability group citizens advice and software expert be charge with review that software and propose improvement perhaps in an annual report little bit along the line of what the social security advisory committee do at the moment let briefly say word about different aspect of the committee work we have be worry by the cut to the funding of the health and safety executive and one result have be drastically few inspection of workplace asbestos we publish report on this last year and call in particular for two thing target to remove all workplace asbestos within year together with plan to deliver it and central digital register of all workplace asbestos and of its condition the government reject those recommendation although do welcome the agreement of the under secretary of state for work and pensions the hon member for mid sussex to meet group of we together with three industry group and the health and safety executive to discuss far the idea for register that meeting will take place later this month very warmly welcome the launch of the campaign by the sunday times at the weekend draw attention to the continue scale of the tragedy be inflict by asbestos even now quarter of century after its use be ban it be still the big source of workplace relate death the sunday times campaign headline in particular our two recommendation and do hope that ministers will now recognise the need to act welcome the fact that the sunday times will be run this campaign on consistent basis again thank the backbench business committee for recommend today debate would be very interested to hear from the minister specifically how minister be assess whether the different cost of live support payment meet need and whether they be reach the right people and also how and when ministers will decide whether payment along these line will be need next year look forward to the debate we be about to have it be pleasure to follow the chair of the work and pensions committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms this be an opportunity for we to scrutinise the spending of the dwp as whole and think it be important to reflect as the chair do on the amount of money that we be talk about spend on pensioner benefit equate to billion and spend on universal credit and equivalent benefit equate to billion and that be before we look at disability and carer benefit housing benefit incapacity benefit and the one off cost of living payment we be talk about significant amount of money but we be not just talk about it in the whole or in the round be sure that all of we here as constituency mps know that casework associate with the dwp take up significant proportion of our casework team time frankly that be usually because of error in the system we know that every constituent circumstance be unique but the theme be the same and the consequence for people day to day life and living circumstance can be significant will highlight survey carry out by the waspi women against state pension inequality campaign that report that nearly one in three woman who have be impact by change to the state pension have fall into debt in the last six month that be people day to day life give the amount of money spend on the dwp think we all on cross party basis would want the money that be spend to be use effectively and efficiently want to use my time this afternoon to highlight some of the inefficiency in the system and seek update from the minister on point that hope he will address in his concluding remark on the state pension it be important that we recognise that those who be most reliant on the state pension be those who be least able to work for long want to highlight the current leap legal entitlement and administrative practice correction exercise for underpayment of the state pension and to ask the minister to confirm whether the government be still on track to complete those correction by the end of in february they have pay out only million of the target of billion also want to highlight the uptake of pension credit the institute for fiscal studies have advise that there be policy proposal on the table look at combine the housing allowance and pension credit system it believe that that would increase uptake of pension credit which know the pensions minister the under secretary of state for work and pensions the hon member for sevenoaks laura trott have be work very hard to do if that be the case why be it potentially be push back to home responsibilitie protection error be discover last year and mention in the dwp annual report when people have accrue hrp under the old state pension there be error in convert it to national insurance credit in the move to the new system and that leave people with incomplete record and underpayment when say people it be generally woman we be still wait for the report to set out the scale of the problem now and how the dwp plan to fix it would be grateful if the minister mention when that correction exercise will start urge that it start in parallel with the current correction exercise rather than be delay until after the current exercise be finish again lot of these issue tend to be for woman it feel to that the way system be set up sometimes mean that they do not recognise the situation of woman who have be in the workplace the decision they make for family and other reason and their caring responsibility want to mention the miss national insurance credit for people who receive universal credit the minister confirm to in letter in march that the automatic system for update the record do not work because the format of the uc datum send to his majesty revenue and customs do not work with its system so that be suspend this have mean that ni record be be manually update with error be make as result think this tie in with the chair of the select committee comment about it and the problem that legacy system sometimes have we all remember that the uplift in universal credit be never see by those on legacy benefit and the initial reason give for that be that the it system could not cope and that be never address do the minister think that all those correction to ni record will be make by the end of and may we have an update on the number of pensioner who be still miss out on their full entitlement if we want work to work and to work effectively we must acknowledge that we need to do more on pension for startling statistic be the fact that most people be not in work year before their pension age for variety of reason people be not work and they be therefore wait for their state pension recent dwp reporting put the gender pension gap for private pension at staggering do the government have an estimate of the gender pay gap if they include people who have no private pension entitlement at all suspect that if they have not be include the gap will be somewhat large will the government make it departmental statutory objective to close the gender pension gap that bring we back to woman because that change portfolio of career that woman potentially experience will increasingly be the case for many people think about my own background before come to this place increasingly people do not stay in one organisation for plus year and then draw down their pension from that organisation they instead do variety of different job in different place as result the pension dashboard that be introduce by the pension schemes act become even more critical so that people can keep track again would be grateful for an update from the minister on that roll out let return to benefit and the insufficiency of income number of we be present at the statement on the disability cost of live payment and there be general acknowledgement certainly on this side of the house that insufficiency of income be at the root of that dwp datum show that in one in six people be in relative poverty and one in five after account for housing cost while be in absolute poverty and after housing cost the resolution foundation estimate that that figure will rise in to after housing cost keep people in poverty have negative outcome when people be financially insecure they be more likely to have health or mental health problem and more likely to struggle to get into work it become self fulfil prophecy echo the comment of the chair of the work and pensions committee on the uprating of benefit the previous uprating which be welcome be simply to keep up with inflation if the problem be insufficiency of income not commit to do that go forward just make the problem bad co chair the all party parliamentary group on end the need for food bank and our cash or food inquiry deal specifically with how we well support people and ensure decrease in the use of food bank in my constituency indeed this be something the scottish affairs committee be look at the rural poverty premium be real the chair of the committee mention transport cost and go from east neuk in my constituency to the jobcentre in levan cost on the bus when talk about the small amount of money that constitute universal credit we can quickly see where that money go and that be before someone potentially have to go shop in premium local shop as oppose to aldi and lidl money go very quickly the hon lady make good point about benefit and the key role that they play in create wealthy society she may or may not know that there be an interesting ted talk call where in the world be it easy to get rich the answer be in norway sweden and denmark where they have identify that one of the key aspect of create wealthy society be good benefit system that enable worker to go around with some security and society and child to have security as well if we want to have millionaire and billionaire we need very good benefit system thank the hon gentleman for that contribution absolutely think we all look to the scandinavian country to see how they promote quality of life and support individual and we must think about how we can well support that indeed the public generally tend to support that they be comfortable potentially pay more in tax to have well service and that debate must continue to be have be pleased that my carer leave private member bill be now the carer leave act and it will for the first time give employment right to unpaid carer one of the huge challenge when be engage with unpaid carer in my constituency have say this in the chamber before be the number of people who have leave work because of their caring responsibility and therefore they would not benefit from provision in the act sadly it be fact that too many unpaid carer and the people they care for be live in poverty carer uk estimate that unpaid carer be provide care worth billion year and when we contrast that with the cost of the department through the estimate debate we can see the comparator without unpaid carer our economy would be severely strained some of unpaid carer be estimate to be unable to afford their monthly expense and two third of those who receive carer allowance or the universal credit carer element say that they can not meet their monthly expense the level of carer allowance need to be increase urgently have call for that before and will continue to do so we must also think about how we taper carer allowance care never stop and we should not have people fall off cliff edge in relation to hour work frankly that be disincentive for people go into work because if they have the choice between work or care for their love one they will choose their love one every time for young carer be not just concerned about their education be also concerned that we will never get they into the workplace if we do not provide they with the support to get there be conscious that some unpaid carer decide to step out of the workplace for some time and then their caring responsibility end potentially through the loss of love one what be we do to support unpaid carer who might have be out of the workplace for some time to get back into work there be similarity with issue such as parental leave and other decision and we should be look at that body of people who frankly be some of the good multitasker know give their skillset and how we can help they into work finally this be an issue that other member will be hugely aware of child benefit threshold be become an increase problem particularly give some of our frozen level of income tax it be tick timebomb family do not apply for child benefit if they know that they will not be entitle to it but because those level have never change that be increasingly an issue for stay at home parent again those be usually woman there theme who then miss out on accrue national insurance credit for the state pension they do not realise that if they do not apply for child benefit payment even to be tell that they do not apply they can not pick up the national insurance credit and that can be real issue will the minister consider review the scheme for accrue credit for stay at home parent or at the very least do an awareness raise campaign as have be do for pension credit and other thing this be good opportunity whether member have an interest via the committee or otherwise but as constituency mp want and my casework team want the dwp to be work as effectively as possible so that those who need help get it and those who can get into work be support to do so it be pleasure to follow the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain find myself resonate with her comment on carer and the lack of support that exist in so many different way but particularly through the social security system and the billion multiple billion that be provide in equivalent support to this country that we sadly do not adequately recognise also pay tribute to the chair of the work and pensions committee my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms for all that he do in the plethora of different inquiry that the committee have hold over the past few year be particularly pleased about the work that we be do on the adequacy or inadequacy of the social security system and the important thing that will reveal when it be publish early next year this debate be about dwp spending associate with that be what it mean for the priority of the department and in particular the government priority for social security as whole will focus my remark on the fall in support for working age adult we need to recognise that particular group and the impact that fall be have on so many different family across the country we have have two major welfare reform act in and will refer to the latter in moment but the cumulative impact of those up to the pandemic be the equivalent of reduction in working age support which in cash term be about billion that be only slightly offset by the temporary increase in universal credit during the pandemic although welcome the uprating last year and support what my right hon friend the member for east ham say about that it do not at all make up for the last or year of significant cut that have have an impact on relative poverty across the uk just under one in three child in the uk be grow up in poverty and in my constituency the figure be nearly one in two we also know that just under two third of child grow up in poverty live in family where at least one adult be work the implication of these cut for those child be not insignificant we now have the high ever level of in work poverty what on earth do that say about this country it be shocking many people who know will know how strongly feel about the impact of these cut on disabled people one in three disabled people be live in poverty which be twice the rate for non disabled people it be totally unacceptable these be the most vulnerable people in our society and we be fail to recognise their need and support they know that the minister will come back and say actually poverty have reduce the joseph rowntree foundation reflect that in its annual report which come out at the beginning of the year yes poverty level have go down but that reflect the fact that during the pandemic we see reduction in overall income and with relative poverty that be the position importantly the joseph rowntree foundation say that it be also about different choice that the government make at the time as much as we be talk about now we must recognise that that week of additional support make difference to those poverty level poverty be not inevitable it be about political choice again hope we can reflect on that when speak to my constituent in oldham east and saddleworth and indeed people across the country they tell that they feel our current system no long provide the safety net that it be set up to provide in the post war settlement with the british people and they be right it be inadequate follow on from their first hand experience during the pandemic polling show that two third of britons think that universal credit be too low not only have the adequacy of the uk social security system diminish over time in term of average weekly income it be approximately half of what be provide after world war two but it be also low than most of our european neighbour with datum from show that our social security spending as percentage of gdp be below and oecd average we must never forget that the post war labour government create the nhs and the welfare state as we mark the remarkable achievement of our nhs with its anniversary tomorrow we must reflect on the principle of universality and access for all which would like to see reflect in our social security system too like our nhs our social security system should be there for all of we in our time of need whether that be result of illness or disability of be unable to work anymore because we have reach retirement age or for any other reason it should provide basic financial support and should be value for the safety net it provide that be not the case now and that be why be advocate for new social contract that define the future of our social security system good starting point would be the essential guarantee that my right hon friend talk about that have be propose by the trussell trust and the joseph rowntree foundation but wide coalition of charity have advocate for it they find that of low income household on universal credit be go without essential such as food electricity and clothe that inadequacy be the main driver of food bank need with almost million food parcel distribute between april and september that be just unacceptable in the fifth rich country in the world an essential guarantee would ensure that the universal credit standard allowance meet level that provide basic security for family need the charity calculate that at week for single person and week for couple the guarantee would bring we in line with our european neighbour and provide safety net in the same vein as our nhs it would also reduce the poverty that too many be experience and which have lifelong impact on child some member will know that chair the all party parliamentary group on health in all policy and have do so for number of year in just before the pandemic we commission review of the welfare reform and work act to analyse the impact it be have on child and disabled people anybody watch or listening be welcome to have look at that on my website one of the big and most worrying figure that we find be that each increase in child poverty be significantly associate with an extra infant death per live birth about third of the increase in infant mortality between and can be attribute to rise child poverty that be publish in one of the peer review medical journal understand the impact that that have have on so many family be devastating it be yet further evidence that far more need to be do to provide an essential guarantee the flipside of that be that we have one of the high tax burden in year but be hearten to see member of patriotic millionaires they be all multi millionaire come out and say we recognise the impact that not have wealth tax on we be have on the fabric of our society we do not want our child grow up in society where there be not the fairness that we grow up with in our country it have come up with the proposal of wealth tax that would fund the essential guarantee for that group espouse what we as nation can be in contrast this take back to what other hon member have say there have be rather nasty element in the medium when we look at dwp spending we must remember that half of it rightly go on the state pension that be the big slice of the spending the next big be on housing benefit we need to recognise that nobody would criticise dwp spending on our pensioner urge responsible journalist to recognise that we should not criticise social security spending on people who be disabled or not able to work because of illness we must be well than that as conclude madam deputy speaker because do promise that would be very brief repeat that poverty order for clarification be not put the hon lady under any pressure as far as be concern she have all the time in the world well that be an offer that definitely will refuse this time as say poverty and inequality be not inevitable they be political choice and believe that like our nhs our social security system should be there for all of we in our time of need call the snp spokesman may start as other have by send my thank to the chair of our select committee the right hon member for east ham sir stephen timms for secure today debate and for set the scene so well the debate take place against the backdrop of an ongoing westminster make cost of living crisis that affect the livelihood and life of people across scotland and these island the harsh yet inescapable reality be that people in scotland can no long afford to pay the price for the economic mismanagement of westminster government they do not elect indeed we have not vote by majority for the conservatives since in may cpi be still at price be still soar and the cost of live under westminster control be still far too high for many family who be already struggle to get by after long brutal year of tory cut brexit and economic mismanagement we know that inflation disproportionately impact low income group such as single parent who spend relatively high proportion of their income on food and fuel indeed new trussell trust research show that family be go hungry as result of the westminster make cost of living crisis with one in seven people in the uk face hunger in the last year due to lack of money minister often tell we that the reason for food bank usage be complex it be not complex it be because people do not have enough money the joseph rowntree foundation late cost of live tracker find that million low income household be have to cut down or skip meal because they do not have enough money for food while the number go without item such as food heating and basic toiletry have remain at about million for more than year all of that in the sixth large economy in the world the average interest rate for two year fix term mortgage have rise to the resolution foundation have say that average annual mortgage repayment be set to rise by for those renew next year in short that be the eye water westminster mortgage premium that scot be pay for the pleasure of tory government they do not elect what be more analysis by the consumer group which show that the price of popular family meal have rise by in the last year the irish and french government have reach agreement with major supermarket retailer to reduce food price while the tory government be sit on their hand it be those low income family represent in parkhead shettleston and baillieston who be pay the price for the sheer intransigence of conservative ministers here in london even at this late hour in the cost of living crisis urge the british government to use all the power at their disposal to tackle that crisis on the scale that be require that do mean that they will have to be bold and radical and the same be true of the pro brexit labour party turn specifically to universal credit which be obviously the main focus of the debate in short the british government continual refusal to fix the extensive and know about problem with universal credit be unacceptable and it be without doubt subject some of the most vulnerable people in our community to additional and unnecessary hardship with the three main party in this place now agree on the principle of universal credit there be an opportunity so we should put our head together to look at what we can do to fix it will start with the level of universal credit jrf research show that support have erode over decade and that the basic rate of universal credit be now at its low level as proportion of average earning indeed the jrf late cost of live tracker warn that about nine in low income household on uc have go without at least one essential for the third survey in over year for most people refer to food bank in the trussell trust network the design and delivery of the social security system be major contributor to their inability to afford the essential the majority of people indeed some to food bank in the trussell trust network receive means test benefit such as universal credit but that do not provide they with enough to cover the cost of the essential as the right hon member for east ham say jrf and the trussell trust be together call on ministers to implement that essential guarantee to ensure that at minimum the basic rate of universal credit cover life essential and that support can never be pull below that level be not another problem the insane part of the system where people pay back money because of advance and the level of deduction more than month be be deduct from my hon friend constituent and my constituent universal credit that envelop that cycle of poverty be grateful to my hon friend for put that point on the record he be my predecessor on the select committee and follow this work well will come to debt and deduction because that be one of the big issue raise in the evidence that the select committee receive certainly by the stakeholder that we meet he be spot on to draw attention to the from each of our constituent that be pay back to the government when it could be spend in our local economy new cpag research find that the digital aspect of universal credit routinely lead to wrong amount be award to claimant often those who be most vulnerable and to breach of rule of law principle that be why have repeatedly call on the government to reverse their cut to universal credit and work tax credit let we not forget that this be the big overnight cut to welfare in year inflict hardship on people who be already struggle to have do that as we come out of the tooth of the pandemic be particularly cruel rather than offer one off payment to shore up struggle family income the dwp should reverse the damaging policy that be impact on the most vulnerable people it should reinstate the uc uplift at per week and of course extend it to legacy benefit let we not forget the million disabled people so ably advocate for by the hon member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams who be cruelly leave behind without that uplift during the pandemic the government also need to remove the benefit cap and the two child limit with its associate rape clause they also need to halt the punitive sanction regime so that all household be lift out of poverty now and in future turn to the benefit cap as the poverty alliance point out the cap design mean that those who require the high level of support from the benefit system be the most likely to be affect that be simply unjust base on the late departmental figure uk household have have their benefit cap and of those be family with child the benefit cap disproportionately impact lone parent family the majority of whom be woman point make by the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain as well as large and ethnic minority family the same be true of the two child limit thousand of family with child will be push into poverty because ministers on the treasury bench refuse to scrap the two child limit on child tax credit and universal credit new london school of economics study find that the policy impoverishment of large low income household have help few parent get job instead its main function have be to push family far into poverty and to damage their mental health wonder why minister be so furled to the two child limit the vast majority of they be actually quite embarrassed by it and that be before we get to the associated rape clause or as the government like to call it the non consensual sex exemption when this government go around lecture people about the value of global britain be pretty sure they do not tell folk that the state will only support the first two child in the family but if someone can prove that their child be bear as result of rape that be okay indicate dissent the parliamentary private secretary be shake his head at that but probably because he be so embarrassed the five week wait for first payment be needlessly push people into hardship the issue could easily be fix by implement the scottish national party proposal to turn advance payment loan into non repayable grant after the claimant have be deem eligible the trussell trust which reference early have consistently show that the five week wait for universal credit be key driver in the need for food bank both during those five week and after the payment have start want to draw attention to the young parent penalty in uc which ministers must end it deny single parent under the age of the same level of social security as those above that age and it push those affect into real poverty let we not forget that when go into aldi lidl morrisons or whatever supermarket they do not get discount on their shopping because they be under find that ministers have an obsession with that the hon gentleman have campaign on this issue as have do he agree that the response receive from the previous secretary of state on this point that be treat differently because they tend to still be at home with their parent be pretty spurious argument and excuse from the department that be right it be not unusual for the previous secretary of state to say thing which after some scrutiny might not make sense the hon lady be right for ministers to hide behind the housing crisis cause by this tory government as some kind of justification for ensure that people under get less support do not stand up to scrutiny that point be hammer home to on friday when be in drumchapel visit the christians against poverty debt centre to meet staff and volunteer there to whom pay enormous tribute for their sterling work accord to one parent families scotland as result of the young parent penalty young couple parent be around bad off per month than single parent and around bad off month than that research find that of child with mum under be in relative poverty and be in absolute poverty let we never forget that those statistic be the result of the structural inequality put in place by intransigent ministers although certainly welcome the change whereby people on uc will now be able to claim childcare support upfront be afraid that do not change the fundamental issue that the amount of uc that people receive be simply not enough family will still be require to make up the shortfall in their overall childcare cost under uc rule an issue that continue to come up in evidence at the select committee be that far too many household face destitution because of dwp rule that push they into debt through sanction and reduction point make eloquently by my hon friend the member for glasgow south west chris stephens aberlour children charity produce report that state that half of family with child in scotland who receive universal credit be have their income reduce by the dwp to cover debt to public body hope the select committee will be able to drill into that bit more it be increasingly problem and be sure be not the only mp who see people raise it regularly at advice surgery it be well establish and on record that the snp completely oppose the widespread use of sanction as there be clear evidence that they do not work indeed evidence from the department report admit that sanction have minimal effect on move people into work instead people who be sanction end up earn less than those who have not be sanction or simply become economically inactive the hon gentleman be make such important remark do he agree that the impact of sanction be detrimental to people mental health we be face mental health crisis if we want to support people get into work we need to make sure that they be not struggle on the breadline the hon lady be spot on sometimes ministers overlook when they take those decision yes they might be drive by focus group and such thing that the state bear the cost if somebody hit period of mental ill health or be make homeless the health service or the local authority will pick up the piece it be not without cost for the state would like ministers to have the wide picture as they pursue sanction because the research show that they do not work the hon gentleman be be generous do he agree that the issue of poverty be so concern for small child because it impact on the development of the brain and how well they will be able to learn if child have good five year at the start of their life that will see they through life so many child in desperate poverty who do not know whether they will get enough food be also in receipt of the anxiety their parent be in as they battle those stressful situation be proud that the scottish government invest in thing such as the good start grant the baby box and free school meal to ensure that young people get the good possible start in life my local authority in glasgow be spend million of pound on holiday hunger programme to ensure that child who receive free school meal during school term time be still be feed it be damn indictment on the state that we have to spend money from local authority budget feed child because their parent do not have enough money that be the situation we be in in the fifth rich economy in the world remarkably as be sure we will hear when the minister respond to the debate ministers be still force more people into the sanction regime which far demonstrate the fundamental issue with the british government attitude to those on low income prevent vulnerable family from receive the social security they be entitle to and most importantly when they need it the most before draw my remark to close want to turn to the local housing allowance the freeze of lha rate for three consecutive year be place additional and needless pressure on tenant and housing association and be likely to increase poverty and inequality that be why ministers should protect household income and support renter by restore lha rate to the percentile as minimum the snp have long call for the british government to fix those fundamental flaw in our social security system but as be so often the case it fall on deaf ear each and every time to the extent that every time take part in one of these debate it feel like groundhog day the blunt truth be that the scottish government can not change those policy while of welfare expenditure and income replacement benefit remain reserved to this institution here in london that include universal credit by all mean be happy to take part in debate and make suggestion about how we repair the social security system but it be difficult to conclude anything other than westminster whether the tories or the pro brexit labour party have zero appetite to genuinely step in and sew up system that be fail some of the most vulnerable people in society for that reason the only way genuinely to bring about that compassionate fair and dignified social security system in scotland be with the full power of independence frankly that can not come soon enough call the shadow minister this have be good important and timely debate congratulate my right hon friend the member for east ham sir stephen timms the chair of the work and pensions committee on bring the debate to the floor of the house he rightly open it by place in context the size of the department and its central place at the heart of economic policy and discuss the work of his committee which have be substantial on look into some of the department very significant flaw give the economic situation the country now face the work of the committee have never be more important as he mention it have publish very important and significant review and some of the recommendation have be adopt by the government so applaud he for secure the debate my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams in her usual way explain the manner in which poverty harm people not just in their financial life but in every single aspect of their life the government would do well to listen to she want to make some brief remark with an emphasis on brief as many good point have already be make and will not be repeat they all want to get to the heart of the point that have be discuss in particular on universal credit have be in this house long enough to remember the country before universal credit so be able to compare and contrast the system we have before with the one we have now offer this reflection base on that experience on its introduction universal credit be claim to be kind of cure all which would release everyone from the so call trap of poverty do not think that that be go to be true when it be introduce and do not think it be true now the department for work and pensions in its spending and policy choice have to be far more than just universal credit and social security important though they be as much as the pension side of the department be huge part of its spending and very important it must also be the department for dignity the dignity of work and the dignity of well function decent social protection those two area of policy must work hand in hand to ensure that the up and down of life do not upend life chance when unfortunate thing happen we should be use good work and social protection to help people to move on and move up in life the chair of the select committee and other member have provide good survey of what be happen in the department at the moment would argue that on both work and social protection it be fail on work to put it simply we have few people in work now than before the pandemic that can not be success we have business cry out for staff yet unlike in other country our employment rate have not recover from the pandemic that be huge failure pay the money in people pocket have be stagnant for the past decade we think about the promise make about universal credit and all the department do so what question have the minister ask about that what research have he commission to get underneath why pay be so stagnant we have have review of in work progression the government have claim that they want to tackle our productivity crisis what research and evidence have the dwp actually publish to show despite the claim make about universal credit support people to escape the so call poverty trap that conservative members feel previous government have create why we have have such stagnant level of pay it be arguable that the department policy choice might have exacerbate the labour market crisis so ask the minister again what policy do he have now today to help people escape low pay work for all the government have talk about the possibility of universal credit why have it deliver so very little in term of the money in people pocket and their chance of get on have universal credit really deliver all that be promise on all those area work incentive the chance family have to do well pay progression and support employer to get the skilled staff they need look at all the department do and have many question about the disappearance of that promise success we have have series of fail employment scheme kickstart fail to deliver what it be say it would deliver we hear from member about restart and the work and health programme and all we do not know about what they be do look at the labour market and everything that the bank of england have say about the consequence for our economy of the state of the labour market do the minister really believe that the dwp be help or be it hindrance would love to hear he talk about publish evidence that the department policy be actually help finally on work one major challenge for our economy be the imbalanced labour market business in many town across the country be cry out for staff yet we have an unemployment challenge some town and city have area where unemployment be twice the national average how can that be right in country that have such need for staff do the minister really believe that his department spending and policy choice be help work should be the way that all of we achieve our hope and ambition just wish the department be able to live up to those ambition as many people have say social security should be the backstop that put floor beneath family yet at almost every step over the past decade the conservative government have make that hard at every turn the political turbulence they have create have have an economic cost for our country as whole and for family up and down the country the inflation we now face make life hard for everybody but not equally if we look at the money family must now find to put food on the table and pay their bill we know that the choice make by the tories have make life hard for those who be already find it tough their failing on energy have make life much hard in particular for people with disability who pay significant extra cost it be well evidence phenomenon that people who face illness or disability have significant challenge with the rise cost of energy the conservative government have never take their need into account enough agree with comment make by both my colleague on the select committee that the relationship between the department and people with disability be not nearly good enough to achieve what we would wish for they the evidence of failure be all around we whether it be the open door of food bank or the closed door of business who have be unable to survive this crisis of inflation and staff shortage on the housing crisis would bet anything be not bet woman but would none the less bet anything that almost every member have see rise in their housing case load even those with relatively low case load have see it rise in relation to the recent housing crisis one fact above all shin out of the department account rise ill health which be have economic consequence for all of we and disastrous consequence for people who be try to earn money to keep their family house and feed over the past decade or more the tories have be not just not up to the challenge they have actively make it bad it be an honour once again to present the case on behalf of the department for work and pensions in an estimate day debate have lose track of the number of time have do this but have certainly do so on numerous occasion during my seven year at the department it be first of all my privilege to thank all dwp staff whom regard as massive help and not hindrance as some may have suggest for the fantastic work that they do up and down the country will the minister give way no the government have never pay more for the pension that we support in this country we have never pay more for the benefit support that we provide in this country we have never pay more for the housing support that we provide in this country and we have never pay more for the disabled in this country as we celebrate the anniversary of the national health service let also put on record my thank to the nhs have have my life save twice by the nhs once after collapse in central lobby in get into politic because of my attempt to save my local hospital and be proud to have visit hexham general hospital this week to see the amazing new maternity suite that have recently be open much have be say today about variety of issue but want to try to put the debate in context the government clearly understand the pressure that household be face we be all familiar with the root cause of our high cost include the global factor the illegal war in ukraine bring about by vladimir putin the aftermath and consequence of the pandemic and the furlough scheme and the other support that we set out in great detail and the country provide at time of difficulty we be committed to deliver on our priority of halve inflation which will help to ease those pressure for everyone and raise living standard alongside that work we continue to implement significant package of cost of live measure to support the most vulnerable during we have increase benefit and state pension by and raise the benefit cap by the same amount so that more people feel the benefit of uprating for low pay worker we have increase the national living wage by to an hour that represent an increase of more than in the gross annual earning of full time worker on the national living wage that increase and the increase that we make in the national minimum wage in april have give pay rise to about million worker to help parent we be deliver significant expansion of childcare support include increase in the maximum amount of universal credit childcare payment as say in the house last week that be dramatic increase in addition where there be gap in provision notwithstanding the above cost of living payment the million extension of our household support fund into mean that council across england can continue to help family with grocery bill and other essential some universal credit claimant can apply to have the housing element of their universal credit pay directly to the landlord however report by the child poverty action group on the discovery phase of manage migration identify delay or error in the setting up of direct payment and poor communication between the dwp landlord and claimant lead to people fall into arrear that be clearly serious state of affair for anyone to find themselves in will the minister tell we what the government be go to do about it will ask the minister who be responsible for that to write to the hon lady however her intervention bring to the issue of housing which be raise by several member in the government be project to have spend billion to support renter that be of gdp member may have criticise that sum but they should be aware that it represent the high spending on household rental support in any country in the oecd the next high be of gdp that figure be clearly high than the figure that obtain when we come to office moreover there be million more home than there be then and more home be meet decent home standard could go on employment now stand at million it be up on the month and on the quarter and vacancy be down down on the month in may and down on the quarter today meet representative of ukhospitality and host of hospitality provider at the department to discuss some of the long term vacancy issue that they wish to raise believe we can continue to work with jobcentre throughout the country to try and address that and to increase the overall employment rate which be up by on the month and on the quarter with unemployment down by percentage point on the month as of may economic inactivity be down by percentage point on the quarter and down by since the general election it be clear that the pandemic have impact and the progress in certain area be not as quick as one would like but we have make huge effort to turn that around and all the indication from all the labour market statistic release by the office for national statistics in may be that the trend be in the right direction will the minister give way no will not have already give way to the hon lady let say something about cost of living payment we be build on and extend the one off cash payment that we provide in when we make more than million worth of cost of living payment include the disability payment to million people for more than million household on mean test benefit and an additional on top of the winter fuel payment for more than million pensioner household that put hundred of pound directly and quickly into the pocket of million of people criticism be make of universal credit as principle the first and simple point that would make which think be acknowledge by the chair of the select committee be that the legacy system would in no way have be able to provide the degree of support that universal credit provide during covid and it would in no way be able to provide an ongoing degree of cost of live support universal credit as we see provide massive amount of support on an ongoing basis which be target to help those most impact by rise price throughout this financial year will the minister give way there be about dozen point make by the right hon gentleman to which be go to respond but will give way once again be grateful to the minister when do he expect to make decision on whether the cost of living payment will continue for further year when this year be that decision likely to be make because the right hon gentleman and have work together for many year and emphasise will know that have be humble junior functionary at the department for work and pensions for very long time never to rise any higher let also say to the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain that have have the privilege of serve under three female secretary of state before the present secretary of state think be now on my seventh secretary of state these matter be monumentally above my pay grade and as be sure the right hon gentleman know have do my job and many other job in the government they will be decide by the chancellor and the prime minister at some stage over the course of the come year interruption have much to be modest about to be honest as have say these matter be above my pay grade and beyond my knowledge but they will be consider there will be an autumn statement in november which will be the obvious time for decision to be telegraph if not make the right hon gentleman raise number of point and will try to answer some of they in the time that have he mention prison leaver the department recognise the need for prisoner and carer to be able to make advance claim for universal credit and there be working process in place to support that have meet the prison minister my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds who will welcome any question that will follow during the justice debate and the social mobility minister my hon friend the member for mid sussex mims davies who look after most aspect of matter relate to prisoner on several occasion to try to drive forward universal credit take up however it require the individual to desire to do that and that be clearly complicated and not easy it be work in progress but it be very much something that we be aware of know that the social mobility minister be give evidence to the select committee tomorrow so will not address in too much detail the issue the right hon member for east ham raise on the health and safety executive which be one of the few brief have not hold in the last few year he rightly raise the issue of transparency and would respectfully say that agree with he the present secretary of state have transform the position in that regard the right hon gentleman know my strong view that save where we have to provide datum on monthly basis under labour market statistic we should have six monthly provision of the vast plethora of datum link to the two fiscal event of the year but that be work in progress the department be definitely review all aspect of those thing the right hon gentleman raise the flexible support fund and particular issue about people take bus to work want to take issue with that because there be absolutely no doubt that jobcentre can use the flexible support fund to support bus or other transport fare for agree work relate activity if it be for work relate activity that support can be provide as it be in other context childcare be the one of which he will be particularly aware would certainly very much hope that the individual jobcentre that he refer to would be aware of that on fraud and error the right hon gentleman will be aware that huge amount of effort be be make by the minister for disabled people health and work who take control of that particular part of the portfolio and by the secretary of state in multitude of different way we have large number of extra staff who have be bring in to address fraud and error accord to the late national statistic it have fall to from and overpayment from fraud be down to compare with in universal credit loss have fall by nearly over similar period bluntly we be try to crack down on those who be exploit the benefit system and we want to make it very clear that we be come after those people we want to ensure that the maximum amount of support go to the people who need it the targeted support include support for people on mean test benefit such as universal credit with up to three cost of living payment total up to we have deliver the first payment to million household in support worth billion the two further payment of and will be make in the autumn and next spring to help with additional cost we have pay the disability cost of live payment to million people as well as pay the winter fuel support payment huge amount be be do in jobcentre whether that be through the in work progression offer the support of extra work coach the support the administrative earning threshold support or the new district progression lead who be work with key partner include local government employer and skilled provider to identify and develop local opportunity and to overcome barrier that limit progression the hon member for north east fife raise number of pension matter clearly continue to defend the action of the labour government and the coalition government on the rise in state pension age she refer to both the leap exercise and what have happen at hmrc and they be both work in progress do not believe there be any fundamental change to that of which she have be previously advise on pension credit she will be aware that there have be an increase in excess of think in application there be slight backlog but that be come down dramatically on the gender pension gap she will be aware of the change to the new state pension which be massively advantageous to woman and of the fact that successive government start with the labour government and the turner commission and then the coalition have bring in automatic enrolment specifically to address that particular issue the hon lady raise final point about those who change job in later life can not overstate the importance of the project for which have be press for only five and half year now which be the mid life mot be delighted to say it be now be roll out across the country whether that be online in jobcentre up and down the country or more particularly in the three private sector body that be trialle particular process if she be not yet acquaint with that would strongly urge she to become so particularly because in her area of scotland in north east fife there be know provider that be offer that process can provide she with the detail aviva and other be do very good stuff there be conscious that have be speak for some time but the practical reality be that we believe we be remove the barrier that prevent people from work we believe that we be reduce the number of people who be economically inactive with fifth consecutive month when inactivity have decline accept that there be more to do and be determined to leave no stone unturned in take the decisive action need across government to see that downward trend continue in conclusion believe that we be tackle inflation to help manage the cost of living we be provide extra support the economic trend as show by the labour market statistic be head in the right direction and with the government ongoing significant package of cost of live support that be worth over billion in excess of the rise to state pension and benefit we be protect those most in need from the bad impact of rise price by put more pound in people pocket and commend these estimate to the house to conclude call sir stephen timms let reiterate my thank to the backbench business committee for enable we to hold the debate and would like to thank everyone who have take part in the debate as well the hon member for north east fife wendy chamberlain speak in the debate last year as well be pleased to say and want to pick up one point she make about the gender pension gap join she in welcome the fact that the pensions minister have now come forward with definition of that so that we know what we be talk about but also agree with she that we need target to reduce it and hope that we will see that in due course as well thank my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams for all her work on

tribute to the work of the organisation christians against poverty which be very valuable it be do very impressive job all over the country be grateful for the intervention we have have from my hon friend the member for wirral west margaret greenwood the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens it be good to see he back on this beat and the hon member for na eileanan an iar angus brendan macneil be grateful to the minister for suggest that we will perhaps hear about the plan for further cost of living payment in the autumn statement think they will be need my hon friend the member for wirral south alison mcgovern be absolutely right to make the point from the opposition front bench that in many respect the security have be remove from social security that be lamentable feature of the last few year the level of benefit be much too low and it have not be properly uprated want to renew my appeal we do have proper uprating this year thankfully but we need that again next year we be talk about historically low level of benefit that be the major reason why food bank demand be still rise if we do not have full uprating next year it will rise far be glad the minister have confirm that the department be review arrangement for transparency be grateful to he for that and the confirmation he have give of the direction of travel and the work in progress be also interested to hear about the staff be recruit to tackle fraud and error the committee would be very interested to follow progress on that and perhaps to table some question about how many staff there be be very grateful to have have the opportunity to have this debate madam deputy speaker and to everyone who have contribute to it question defer until tomorrow at seven standing order no ministry of justice his majesty prison and probation service motion make and question propose that for the year end with march for expenditure by the ministry of justice further resource not exceed be authorise for use for current purpose as set out in hc of session further resource not exceed be authorise for use for capital purpose as so set out and further sum not exceed be grant to his majesty to be issue by the treasury out of the consolidated fund and apply for expenditure on the use of resource authorise by mann it be pleasure to open this important debate and be grateful to the backbench business committee for give we the opportunity to debate this part of the ministry of justice estimate be glad to see the minister and the shadow minister in their place want to raise succinctly but in some detail number of press area that trouble the select committee on justice despite the funding increase that have recently be achieve there be background that cause real difficulty to the prison and probation service will highlight four area in particular where the minister ought to seek to persuade the government to prioritise and increase their effort for the sake of both those who work in his majesty prison and probation service and the offender it be mean to manage and hold safely but humanely with view to reform wherever possible will flag up the following issue prison capacity the project prison population and overcrowding the quality of the prison estate the prison and probation workforce and workforce shortage and the youth custody estate the select committee have look at these matter on number of occasion and we be currently carry out an inquiry into the prison workforce be grateful to everyone who have give evidence so far and appreciate the engagement we have have with ministers will start with one of the most pressing issue face the prison service today we now have the late prison population projection and the reason for their increase the reality be simply that the prison population have grow substantially over the past year as of last friday there be some people in prison the number have change bit even since then despite the government effort to manage the population england and wales have the high imprisonment rate in western europe and of course it be project to grow far we see no sign of the imprisonment rate fall at the same time as have one of the high imprisonment rate in western europe we also have one of the bad reoffende rate successive government have fail to address that ironic dichotomy the hon gentleman the minister and the shadow minister know my bona fide on matter of law and order bad and dangerous people should be in prison to protect the public but we do not talk often enough about prevention and rehabilitation it would cost far less to keep people out of prison and to stop they go back into prison than to keep they in prison could not agree more the current lord chancellor have say previously that prison be there for the people of whom we be entitle to be afraid not for the people with whom we be annoyed or angry that be an important distinction because prison be there to deal with those who be danger to society or who have significantly harm society it be not there in an ideal world to deal with people who for any number of reason have get their life into mess such people can be nuisance to society but there be surely well way to handle they than incarceration in the closed estate at cost of some year the justice committee hold an inquiry into the prison population back in there be about reduction in the prison budget between and and it be find that have an impact on the safety and decency of the estate follow reduction in the number of prison officer between and in truth there have be underinvestment in prison and would argue underinvestment in the whole justice system for decade under government of all complexion because the ministry of justice be both an unprotected department in budgetary term and downstream department it often pick up the consequence of thing that have go wrong elsewhere in society and elsewhere in government the ministry of justice be particularly vulnerable in we see there have be increase in the prison population over year and future projection indicate growth to there be at that time transformation programme commit to expand the prison estate by place and to close outdated prison sadly the truth be that the programme be not fully deliver the public accounts committee report that just place be deliver by the programme in the ministry of justice decide not to deliver the prison estate transformation in full because of budgetary pressure around place be remove from the programme but nothing have be do to reduce demand indeed number of change to sentencing policy have in fact increase demand in number of area the inquiry find clear evidence that the reduction of spending in prison have have major destabilising effect reduce staff number put more pressure on remain staff and the way in which facility management service be outsource through block contract mean the operation be very remote and very unresponsive to the day to day need in prison it be very frustrating for governor who be frequently find that it take month to get basic repair do the nature of the contract be seriously at fault do not have problem with contracting out in the right circumstance but the way it be do be extremely inefficient six year on the prison service face largely the same issue the population have continue to increase there be still an issue with the recruitment and retention of staff and the estate still have capacity pressure there be another prison expansion programme in and the prisons strategy white paper say the provision of prison place would make more modern and secure estate there be an ambitious target of additional prison place as part of that programme but we now know that planning permission have not be grant for three prison either it have be refuse or no decision have be make and the ministry of justice be have to appeal those planning decision that be hardly join up government surely the risk of delay in planning should have be foresee at the outset on behalf of the committee write to the permanent secretary at the moj follow the publication of its main estimate and be grateful to she for respond yesterday disappointingly only new prison place will have be create and make operational by may we be about short of the government target of by the give that background be the minister convince that the current prison expansion programme be genuinely deliverable when be we go to get to the place what step be be take to speed up rate of delivery that so far will not get we there prison in england and wales be reach breaking point the growth in the adult male population have force the government to use police cell to accommodate prisoner through operation safeguard the government have say that would be in place for no long than be necessary but how much long do the minister anticipate that will be how frequently be operation safeguard be use mention the change to sentence policy which have put more pressure on prison for example we have see change to magistrate sentence power there be an increase to two year and then suddenly temporary reduction back down to one year that be not good lawmaking and it be not fair or just sentence policy to have lottery whereby when defendant appear before the court decide whether he be deal with by the magistrate or commit to the crown court as we all know that move be do not because magistrate sentence more heavily there be no evidence to suggest that but because if people be send to the crown court for sentence as the magistrate deem their power insufficient it will take long before they end up in prison there be bit of sleight of hand here as that be do to ease out the demand in the prison system push people arrival in prison back down the road bit in the hope that somebody else will have leave by then and so bit more space be available that be not the right approach and it put more pressure on another part of the moj responsibility the crown court because more case be then be send to they when they could have be deal with more quickly by the magistrate the government need to address that situation what be go to be do to deal with it how long do the moj envisage this reduction in sentence power last what be be do to consult the judiciary on whether that be proper approach to the use of judicial resource and sentencing policy know that there have be temporary response in respect of rapid deployment cell which may offer some support it may be of some assistance but what be the long term plan how long do we envisage those cell be in use what be the plan eventually to integrate they with the rest of the estate we have the plan for the prison place but the delay be significant that mean there be significant overcrowding in the estate which be the second point want to address the overcrowding be such that it be difficult for prison staff to carry out rehabilitative work which be one of the objective of prison that feed into that high rate of recidivism and reoffende that have refer to it also create real challenge on our basic duty of care towards both prisoner and prison officer when the state remove someone liberty for the broad public good it have the duty to commit to keep they safe and in decent condition equally the state have duty to provide decent safe and reasonable working environment for those who supervise the prisoner and run the prison fear that in number of our prison we be simply not get there at the moment we be simply fail in that and repeat report from his majesty chief inspector of prison have flag that up the growth in the number of urgent notification that have be issue by the inspector to the moj be also evidence of that appreciate that the minister have always respond promptly to those urgent notification procedure and be grateful to he for that but it speak to an underlying problem that need to be resolve suspect that that can be do only through sustained investment and by think about whether we be use the alternative to prison effectively to go back to the point make by the hon member for st helens north conor mcginn we need to make sure that we use it for those who be dangerous where there be no other safe mean of deal with they and we can not use cheap and often more effective rehabilitative alternative we still have many victorian prison the local prison as they be often call some of which be in very poor state they have be describe as not fit for purpose and dilapidate there have be historical under investment in maintenance and we have backlog of maintenance work in the prison in march this be estimate to be about billion worth his majesty prison and probation service be regularly take prison cell out of use because of their state of disrepair in the decade between and some prison cell be permanently out of use for fail to meet the require standard the lack of money go into basic maintenance therefore add to the capacity crisis the chair of the justice committee be make an excellent critique of the system there be something ironic about prison be so undermaintained and need billion spend on they such that their accommodation be not available when some billion be be spend on new prison at the same time it look as if we be just forget the one that we have particularly the remand and the local prison have lot of sympathy with that point the irony be that the chief inspector of prison in his annual report describe some of those old prison as cold dark and shabby cell often plague by damp and cockroach leak pipe and toilet and break or miss furniture and window but at the same time as we have already observe the new prison building schedule be way behind and because of the planning situation so far we have no assurance about when those space will be deliver in any event they will not replace the dilapidated prison as we have originally hop but will simply increase capacity because we have tap that nobody seem able to find the mean of properly turn off in term of those come into the system the original plan be to close old prison as part of the prison estate transformation programme but that have not happen in the minister predecessor say that they would need to be keep open well how long do we expect to keep those prison open what be the long term plan for those prison what be the plan to ensure that the risk in relation to planning permission and restrictive covenant which plague the potential redevelopment of holloway for example be recognise and sort out well in advance of the commitment of the capital it be worth observe that we have have an increase in the capital departmental expenditure limit for prison which be welcome but if we be spend only fraction of it so far as recall it be about billion and we have spend about billion so far clearly we have resource be allocate by the treasury that we can not have confidence that the ministry be able to spend and use to deliver in timely fashion what step be the minister take to deal with that what reassurance can he give we what be the plan to speed up that programme and get the resource spend where it be need the other issue want to deal with be the operational workforce as say the committee be currently run an inquiry on that pay tribute to the man and woman who work in our prison they do very tough job which probably no one in this house would want to do they do it on behalf of society frequently in difficult and unpleasant condition sometimes unacceptable condition and at some risk to themselves they deserve to have the recognition that do not think they always get on behalf of the justice committee recognise and salute they for what they do but we need more than just recognition and warm word we need some real support for they as part of the inquiry the justice committee undertake survey of serve prison officer some staff respond to it which be decent number the response be strike we find that half of band to band staff do not feel safe at the prison they work in feel safe at work be surely basic right for anyone half be frightening statistic report from the inspector and the independent monitoring board have highlight the grow number of assault both on staff by prisoner and between prisoner that be result of the cramped overcrowded and stressful condition in which many prisoner be hold so perhaps it be no surprise that the prison officer feel so concerned about that band to band and band be the key operational grade the frontline people who do job on the wing only of band operational staff feel they have proper regular training of band to band staff say they have regular training that mean the majority of staff do not think that they have such training surely train people be basic part of make sure that we professionalise and keep the workforce up to scratch we be bring in various protective equipment for they they need to be train to use it it be no surprise that morale be low more than of staff in band and of staff in band to say that staff morale be not good at the prison in which they work if that be the position with the frontline staff be it any wonder that we have problem not just with recruitment but with retention it be clear that there be real issue with experienced officer leave the service when thing get difficult in prison when those tension threaten to boil over and when there be potential dispute or violence on the wing it be exactly those experienced officer the old hand the man and woman who have be around the system who know how to deal with sometimes quite damaged and challenging individual their experience be more necessary than anyone to calm thing down and to prevent thing from escalate therefore unless we have proper strategy for retention we be create potential powder keg for the future ultimately we have both to retain and to increase the number of staff unless we do that we will not get the purposeful activity that be necessary to make prison beneficial otherwise we end up just warehouse individual with no benefit at the end of it that pressure on staffing and overcrowding in prison be reflect in the concern of the president of the prison governors association andrea albutt who say that the prison system face an immediate crisis and could run out of prison place as early as mid july what be the minister assessment of that do he agree with the president of the prison governors association that in few day time we could run out of space if so we be in very grave situation indeed what too about the observation of the shannon trust be very grateful for its information point out that statistic from the office of national statistics hm prison and probation service and the voluntary sector suggest that some of all those incarcerate have literacy level low than an average year old give that we have some people in prison that potentially equate to about people who have real literacy deficit without that be put right what be their hope of get job on release how do we then get they out of that cycle of reoffende because it be so difficult to carry out education activity in those cramp and inadequate facility and to attract staff to do the tough job of education work in prison all too frequently the level of course be not be deliver in the way that be intend what will the minister do to increase the amount of education and purposeful activity that we see in our prison we all say that it be the objective but so far we be not deliver on it in any consistent manner let look beyond prison to the critical issue of probation which be sometimes fear regard as the poor relation of the two the bulk of the budget go on prison because of the very high fix cost but probation be essential and we should pay tribute too to the probation officer who work so hard it be essential to give alternative to prison in the first place and secondly to have proper mean of transition prisoner back into society when they be release without the risk of reoffende when we carry out our inquiry we find high staff vacancy overloaded probation practitioner work overcapacity poor staff retention and inaccurate risk assessment all of which be flag up by the chief inspector of probation who say that many service be experience exceptional staff shortage with half the position at key grade in some area be unfilled it be no wonder therefore that thing be be miss that be risk not only to prisoner but potentially in the bad case to the public as well what be be do to deal with staff pressure in the probation service we meet many probation officer they want to improve their service but they need decent and sustain funding to do so you can not have it be switch on and off like light switch we know that three fifth of the hmpps expenditure be on prison we need to concentrate on and not forget the other two fifth of the budget as well will the hon gentleman give way will give way one more time and then shall move on be sorry to intrude on the hon gentleman again he be make an excellent speech think he will agree that the privatisation of the probation service be disaster and it be right that that be be reverse but that do not mean that probation can not work with the private and voluntary sector particularly around employment there be some great example of that with firm such as timpson the voluntary sector and organisation such as the prison advice and care trust it be important that the service work collectively with all those group to ensure that we stop people from reoffende and help they rebuild get on and be successful in their life yet again the hon gentleman be spot on join he in pay tribute to timpson for example the work of the timpson family and their firm have be consistently quite exceptional over long period have constituent who benefit through their endeavour and many other in the house will have similar case the hon gentleman point be an important one the justice committee be critical of the way the probation service be privatised as he know do not have an ideological objection to privatise service in the right circumstance and in the right way but the simple truth be that the way it be do in probation be absolutely the wrong way to do it split up and dislocate the service with mixture of that which be retain nationally and that which be with various outsourced company it be wholly unsatisfactory and create some dire result pay tribute to my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland who when he be justice secretary take the tough but right decision to reverse the process and unify the service once more that be welcome none the less that privatisation be still affect morale it have affect retention and it have create considerable dislocation in datum sharing between various service it also break number of the local tie that have be develop between the probation service and local authority and other provider in the area ironically as the hon member for st helens north say there be role for the private sector the privatisation of probation be intend to have more private sector group come in to the provision of probation work and more small scale charity what happen instead be that it go on bulk contract to some of the usual big outsourcer and defeat its own object we need to work hard now to ensure that we give charity not for profit and small scale organisation real access to provide service where they can bring unique perspective again would be grateful for the minister observation on what the government will do to encourage those provider into the sector where they can work collaboratively with the new unified service we currently have people on probation and staff in probation the service have be through any amount of upheaval it now need stability and support both practical financial support and recognition for the work that it do have only couple more point mr deputy speaker turn now to the youth custody estate youth custody it should be say have be real success we imprison far few people now than we use to that be real win that all side involve can take credit for the service do not face the same pressure of number and we have see steady decline in the number of child in custody one be tempt to say why if we can do that for child largely because of more holistic approach and far more early intervention can we not apply the same philosophy to the adult estate as well the principle be not different it be get in early when we see the first sign of the problem in someone life that be likely to make they more vulnerable to fall into offending if we can do that successfully for youngster why should we not at least do much more of it in the adult estate too however although the number be not an issue safety be real concern in the youth estate staff retention be problem in the youth estate too which have an impact on safety lack of staff and training be also matter of concern and recent inspection report from his majesty chief inspector of prison have raise concern about education in the yoi safety concern extend beyond physical harm if the institution fail to provide adequate educational programme vocational training and rehabilitative regime young offender will not receive the tool they need to reintegrate into society instead they will be all the more vulnerable to be suck back in to the leadership model of their criminal friend on the outside whom in many case they join up with because of the gap elsewhere in their life write to the minister in may about the woeful finding in relation to his majesty prison cookham wood in the urgent notification procedure there and be grateful to the minister for his response however it be pretty disappointing to see yet another urgent notification be issue in relation to fail prison particularly one where child be involve we must see improvement for those child they have be entrust to the state care and we have duty to they to ensure that they be safe and that when they leave those institution they be in well place than when they go in recognise the government attempt to stabilise prison and probation by inject funding but they be try to make up for the great deal that be take out early recognise the minister commitment and appreciate the personal courtesy and determination in his word recognise in particular the commitment of the new secretary of state who understand these issue very well from his own professional background they will both know that we have lot of ground to make up to get prison and probation back to where they should be the fact that there be some increase in the estimate be good news as have demonstrate but fear first that it may not be enough and secondly that we need an assurance that funding will be sustain over period of year and that the ministry have the capacity to spend the money wisely and successfully to deliver on all that hope that the minister will respond on those matter with his usual care and courtesy but we need not just word but clear programme of action frankly we need to increase and raise the extent and awareness of public debate about the prison and probation service as we need to with the whole criminal justice system it ought to be decent prison system and probation system means of protect the public but also of rehabilitate those offender who can be rehabilitate and that ought to be as central mission to any government as decent education health or social care system it do not get the same level of attention perhaps this debate will help if only in small way to flag up some of the issue we all have duty to talk about those issue with our constituent in measured and calm way more than perhaps we currently do it be real pleasure to follow that forensic speech by the chair of the justice committee the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill he take we through many of the problem particularly those in the prison service will be rather more selective about the issue speak about but will concentrate in particular on prison condition three week ago visit wormwood scrubs prison in my constituency it be prison that have visit on and off for the past year as an mp councillor and criminal barrister despite meet many dedicated officer and determined governor have never change my mind about it be an unsuitable institution in the century particularly for the rehabilitation or indeed the punishment of offender on my most recent visit see that many of the man be share one person cell with unshielded toilet make their living condition cramp and unpleasant with no privacy in addition the scrubs like many prison be still operate hour lock up regime in which some prisoner get only one hour day outside their cell be it any wonder then that self harm and poor mental health be at high across the prison estate recently ask series of write question of the minister department mainly on the topic of time out of cell the moj respond that it do not hold those statistic centrally and that it be not practical for it to record the datum how do the moj hope to have an overview of the wellbeing of the prison population in its care if it do not know what each prison time out of cell regime be follow up to inquire about why the moj do not collect that datum centrally and be provide yesterday with response that say that the moj would need to record datum for each prisoner individually base on his or her movement each day to understand time out of cell for each prison if may say so that be ridiculous response and the minister have misunderstand the question not intentionally hope to get an understanding of each prison time out of cell regime the moj need only ask each prison to report that datum to it as the data be about the time out of cell rather than the individual schedule of prisoner it will be much simple to collect than the ministry pretend interruption the minister be chuntere from sedentary position be sure that he will when he respond deal with that point in more detail couple of week ago at justice question also ask about the overcrowded condition in prison that datum be hold and publish by the government but do not think it be an accurate representation of what be and be not an overcrowded prison for example when visit wormwood scrubs the governor tell that she have just be ask by the moj to increase operational capacity how will we ever know if prison be overcrowded if the moj keep move the goalpost of operational capacity if the moj keep ask prison to increase operational capacity overcrowding will become an even big problem as well as something of hidden one prison be overcrowded single cell be be use to house two people and most time out of cell regime be oppressively restrictive what necessitate much of that be an insufficient number of staff on the wing prison need more staff but they can not hire more staff if their budget do not allow it prison officer be leave the profession in their drove and it be not hard to see why it be very dangerous job prison officer be at very real risk of physical injury it be also emotionally tax see prisoner at some of the low point in their life and get very little assistance by way of productive work education and other support the pay do not do the job justice and be proof that the moj have insufficient regard for the profession it waste thousand of pound train new prison officer who then leave within the first two year due to the condition it be clear that something be go very wrong and the government need to fix the problem as well as prison officer will my hon friend join in pay tribute to prison chaplain particularly at his local prison of wormwood scrubs where father gerry mcflynn be the chaplain for long time he be now the director of the irish council for prisoners overseas my right hon friend the member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell will know he father gerry celebrate his golden jubilee just last week he be year an ordain priest and have dedicate his whole life to prison and prison chaplaincy be sure my hon friend will join in send his regard to father gerry as will all members be very glad to have take that intervention agree that prison chaplain prison priest prison vicar and prison imam we have an excellent imam at the scrubs be in many way unsung hero do fantastic job alongside the other staff be afraid that often the problem be the moj itself which be seemingly always one of the first government departments to offer itself up as soon as the chancellor of the day mention cut think its budget be now low than it be in if prison do not have the staff to unlock the prison safely for reasonable period of time do not have the money to provide meaningful activity and do not have the resource to provide good quality education mental health decline and that can have tragic consequence for prisoner and staff will come back to the issue of education in moment but will briefly mention mental wellbeing in prison recently meet lawyer who have be represent four bereaved family of prisoner from wormwood scrubs who take their own life between april and february this year there have be seven self inflict death at the scrubs the pain for the family must be unimaginable and be sure that other prisoner and the staff who find the deceased be also struggle any self harm death in prison be potentially preventable one that deserve rapid response to work out what go wrong and to implement learning for the future but not one of those case have yet make it to an inquest an inquest for one of the family be schedule for august this year but that be over three year of wait for answer we rightly talk lot about the court backlog but maybe not enough attention be pay to the coroner court backlog accord to coroner statistic for the average time from the date of death to the conclusion of an inquest be week but it be postcode lottery think the bad case be at north lincolnshire and grimsby where the wait be week one of the important outcome of inquest be often the prevention of future death report if an institution such as wormwood scrubs be wait over three year for an inquest into the death of prisoner and there be crucial learning that coroner could uncover how can that prison be expect to make the necessary change when the coroner do provide recommendation in their prevention of future death report how do we know that public body will implement they recently speak on panel for campaign launch by the charity inquest which be ask the government to implement national oversight mechanism the mechanism would collate recommendation from inquest and prevention of future death report along with the public body response in database it would then analyse these response and produce report finally the mechanism could allow follow up procedure to check on the progress of implement change arise from the original recommendation this sound like sensible and not expensive approach and one that could help to lower the number of preventable death if recommendation become centralised and easy to follow up be grateful that the under secretary of state for justice the hon member for finchley and golders green mike freer have offer to meet and inquest to discuss this and hope to hear from he soon realise that death in custody and death in prison be only one part of the equation but they be an extremely important part want to finish by come back to education in prison in my recent meeting with the governor at wormwood scrubs she explain that individual prison have little control over their education service the moj employ education provider in the prison service but the quality of these provider can vary greatly from prison to prison the governor say that she be unable to change the provider because it have contract with the moj for number of prison that be only one example but think it be typical of the disconnect and neglect that be apparent mention local and remand prison these be often the old victorian prison and those in the bad condition the government boast be not sure why that they be on this massive prison expansion programme and put huge sum of money into new prison however that be not to renew the prison estate but because of the increase in population urge the minister to look at the way that some of our old prison be be run they do disservice not only to the people who work there and run they as well as of course to the inmate but to the wide community because people be not be rehabilitate and be come out of prison insufficiently support and go back into prison very quickly that be recipe for disaster not only for the individual but for society as whole and it be an indictment of the failure of the prison system under this government it be pleasure to follow the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter who make some really interesting point about the collection of datum both in the moj and in prison and the ability that give we as parliamentarian to hold to account scrutinise and understand well what be happen in our prison and the impact that that be have as the hon gentleman finish by say on wide society want to pick up on very specific element of that which be the impact that it be have on family be very privileged last week to host an event in this place on behalf of my constituent professor jane payler who have carry out two year research project on the impact of prison sentence on the family of offender in particular she highlight the work of families first which be worcestershire project one could reasonably question why be look at worcestershire when very clearly represent hampshire but this be in fact an open university project lead by my constituent to scrutinise the impact of prison sentence on the child and family of offender and what we know about that the answer come back sadly that we know far too little because at no point be there any coherent strategic collection of datum that give we any indication of how many child prisoner may have and therefore of how many child in wide society may need additional support because they be miss parent it be not just that the parent be absent the child be also cop with the stigma and shame of the fact that their parent usually their father although not in every case be imprison there can be reluctance on the part of the prisoner to volunteer the information that they have child because there be fear that those child will then have an involvement with social service that the mother say mother and be generalise but it be usually the mother may well not want and there be fear that that could result in even more adverse outcome for the child be prepared to concede that in comparison with my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee know little about this subject and be not an expert by long way what strike instantly however be that today be an opportunity to raise with the minister the importance of our improve our understanding and discourse around the impact of prison and understand what the moj and indeed the minister could do to improve the situation so that there be at least some collection of this datum and we know about the number estimate of the child impact vary wildly we can find one estimate back in of perhaps child impact and if we extrapolate the number for the increase in the prison population we might expect that number to be in the region of or child now some academic research rely on french datum indicate that the problem could extend to as many as child who be impact by parental imprisonment what do we know of those child first we know far too little but we do know that there be considerable problem with their emotional and mental wellbeing we know there be considerable problem with the physical impact of child potentially be move around the country because they be miss parent and the change that there may be in school we know that such child have poor educational outcome and that they and their family be largely forget unseen and impact as result of that we know there be lack of holistic and tailor support for those child we know about secondary prisonisation be not convinced that it be word but we will go with it for the time be and that there be an impact on their mental health because of the stigma and shame that they feel child lack an understanding of what have happen to their parent and many be assume care responsibility that that absent parent may have we hear from the hon member for hammersmith commentary on the impact that criminal behaviour can have on young people who have previously witness criminality and in far too many instance the young person may step into the void cause by father or parent go into prison however we can not access up to date datum and the number of child impact be simply not record freedom of information request to the moj have indicate that such datum be not in an extractable format so even if it have be collect we can not necessarily extract it within the cost parameter that be often use have one request which think be on quite short list this afternoon think at one point that could perhaps stand up and make cheeky little intervention but could see five minute in that this request clearly could not be make in an intervention without test your patience mr deputy speaker my request be to the moj please find mechanism whereby that datum can be record and share with those service that be in position to support those child whether that be local authority or the excellent charity sector just as we have with families first in worcestershire it have work incredibly hard to ensure that such support be provide to child with must say some really strike outcome the report which will send to the minister after the debate contain heart warm story of the difference that have be make to child when there have be intervention and they have be give support also crucial have be the difference that such support have make to parent come out of prison have conversation with their child who have articulate the impact on they which have convince their dad that the last place he ever wish to return be prison give that have this opportunity and few other member wish to contribute have plenty of time it would be remiss of not to raise two other issue regard the moj that be of concern to the hon member for st helens north conor mcginn be no long in his place but he raise the important point that prison should be use as mechanism to keep we wide society safe from people who be dangerous recently meet two incredible woman carole goulde and julie devey who both tragically lose their daughter in domestic homicide they have lobby long and hard for there to be review of sentencing they have welcome the fact that the eminent kc clare wade have do her review into domestic homicide sentencing but it would be remiss of not to use this opportunity to reiterate their call about the fact that horrific and graphic term for where people all too often woman be murder in frenzy by someone they may have recently be in relationship with or still be still do not carry mandatory year we need to be protect from the truly dangerous individual who abuse woman and murder their own partner would argue they be among the most dangerous people we can encounter know that the government response to the wade review be due imminently will my right hon friend the minister discuss that with the lord chancellor and the minister of state my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar to make sure that that government response be not snuck out on the last day of term it would be most helpful if member have the opportunity to have time in this house perhaps an oral statement or an urgent question the following day to discuss what we think of the government response to the wade review as say these be among the most horrific crime and it be important that this house be give the opportunity to debate that review in due course thank you mr deputy speaker for give the opportunity to speak pay tribute to my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst the chair of the select committee who have lead this debate and highlight his expertise in this area pay tribute to the chair of the select committee the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill who give comprehensive overview of what be happen on prison and probation be so pleased that the right hon member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes raise the issue of child when we have the debate on imprisonment for public protection sentence it focus on the fact that the whole family be serve the sentence and we do not give enough consideration to the implication for the family and particularly to the support need to assist the rehabilitation of prisoner as they be release will declare an interest as be an honorary life member of the prison officers association there be no financial interest and in fact be tell by the poa that it do not even gain an extra pillow in cell if ever need it it be as simple as that we have have discussion over recent month in particular presentation in the jubilee room few week ago which number of we attend where we have be meet prison officer work on the frontline want to report the conversation we have have and on their behalf set out some of the concern they have express which build much upon what my hon friend the member for hammersmith andy slaughter say about the state of prison there be three message that prison officer want to get across the first be that the austerity budgets have take so much from the prison service over the past decade that prison officer have leave the system it can only be describe as be in crisis and that be not just put prisoner and prison officer at risk but put the public at risk of dangerous reoffending the second message be that ministers need to understand that they can not run prison on the cheap it require investment particularly in staffing to ensure safe secure and purposeful regime the third message which the chair of the select committee have raise and which will come back to be that prison officer want the minister to know that they be feed up morale be at an all time low and it be develop into real anger at how they have be treat to give one quote they feel like they be disposable commodity to be work to the bone and then discard they be vote with their foot to leave the service mention have be make of the budget cut that have take place over the year and how we have arrive at this situation to give one statistic at one point at the height of austerity after the prison service see cut in overall expenditure as my hon friend the member for hammersmith have say the figure be still below what it be in alongside that we have have number of fairly disastrous privatisation experiment those have not just be in probation but in the maintenance of the prison themselves what happen in the first year of austerity be startling in the quarter of the operational workforce be lay off and crisis of violence be unleash have lay so many staff off we also get into vicious downward spiral of insufficient staff and increase violence and therefore problem with retention recruitment drive simply fail to resolve the situation on one estimate during that period we lose year of professional experience build up over decade as result of that exactly as have be say prison be fearful place with prisoner on prisoner assault and assault on staff which have soar so prison officer and support staff be leave in drove we have hear some of the statistic mark fairhurst the poa national chair present evidence to the justice committee where he explain just as my hon friend do that many leave within the first two year he say we be at the high attrition rate that the service have ever see we be currently run at for prison officer and for operational support grade some area of the country have see attrition rate of between and the chair of the select committee mention the survey of how prison officer be feel exactly as he say half of those survey do not feel safe at work and say that staff morale at their establishment be bad when we talk to officer at some establishment they tell we that it have collapse completely many have lack of confidence in the future it be also raise with we in conversation that the number of prison officer suffer from post traumatic stress disorder be rise and at critical level serve and ex prison officer receive little support for pstd and it have an overwhelming impact on their life it be unfortunately become almost accept as the norm that prison officer will have to go through that mark fairhurst tell the committee there be no support if you have mental health problem more and more of my member be get diagnose with ptsd because of the trauma that they deal with and the thing they see there be no mental health support on site for those staff they be leave the job with ill health or capability retirement so there be no support there for mental health this be one of his most startling statement we have come across scenario in some jail where the most experienced member of staff on that same wing have nine month in the job it be the blind lead the blind to try to give we an understanding of what that mean he say when you have inexperienced staff deal with experienced prisoner who have be in and out of prison all their life it have massive knock on effect on stability spend during the first five year of austerity fall by that be why as have be say with spending level cut so dramatically over period it be hard for prison officer to fully comprehend why billion be be spend on build new generation of prison to boost capacity when our exist prison have become mired in squalor that be the description use and accord to the public accounts committee only two year ago there be billion backlog of work need to be do prison be violent place we have at time reach catastrophic level of violence it need to be acknowledge not to accept that it will continue that violence be part and parcel of prison life prisoner officer can not understand that the government will not even include level of violence in their new key performance indicator for prison my hon friend the member for easington grahame morris introduce private member bill in the last session the prisons violence bill we urge parliamentarian to support it to enable that sort of monitor to be part and parcel of the performance indicator so that the government could develop full strategy the poa have join as found member the joint unions in prison alliance alongside the other union and work with the prison service it fully support the safe inside campaign to reduce violence in prison it be especially concerned about what it describe as the ultra violence in the youth custody estate it warn that an urgent review be need of the protection that prison officer need when work in that estate it come back to investment the poa also say dangerous squalid jail make rehabilitation impossible prisoner be release more criminalised more traumatised more addicted to drug than when they arrive this be madness and should be completely unacceptable in civilised society prison be often the good chance that state have to turn someone life around whether through education or treatment but we do the opposite we make they bad the poa have reach such state of frustration that it be call for royal commission believe that be one of the proposal consider by the conservative party before the last election royal commission should examine the problem in our justice system from end to end to try to tackle imprisonment incarceration and more importantly rehabilitation and as other hon member have say to look at prevent crime and prevent people reach imprisonment the poa want to raise clearly what have happen on pay and on retirement age on pay the union welcome the government increase in early starter pay but be concerned about recent statement from the government about not honour the pay review reward in future nothing will undermine morale more when there be an independent assessment of pay the poa be not allow to take industrial action like other union and therefore have to rely on the pay review body that the government say they will not honour those recommendation be utterly defeat when prison be seek to recruit and retain the poa have make it clear time and again that it believe that pension age of be unacceptable for the physical job that prisoner officer undertake it would welcome the government return to the negotiating table on retirement age which they walk away from in after the poa reject the offer to reduce retirement age those negotiation need to be reopen because be too late have try to give some understanding of what prison officer be go through at the moment they ask straightforward question what happen to the conservative party commitment and pledge of royal commission on criminal justice will the minister bring back those proposal will he commit to invest the resource especially in staffing that be need to save the system from the current crisis will he look to improve workforce morale and retention by look again at the issue of pay term and condition and the pension age which be currently threaten the final issue they want to draw attention to be the fact that there need to be clear programme to reduce prison violence ensure there be sufficient support for prison staff so that they can perform their professional job without risk to their life and limb thank the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee for speak so persuasively as always on these incredibly important issue our prison and probation service do vital work to deliver justice rehabilitate offender and protect the public but sadly after year of tory neglect they be break judge be be tell to jail few people because our prison be full no prison be rat as good for rehabilitation and release planning and one murder every week be commit by criminal out on probation it be hard to separate that decline performance from the cut face by the ministry of justice even former tory prisons minister recently declare that they go too far but with what scarce resource be leave we continue to see incompetence million spend on maintain closed prison million waste on avoidable mistake on new tagging programme and an estimate work backlog on the prison estate of billion when visit prison see at first hand overcrowded crumble estate blight by staff shortage last year visit wandsworth prison where inmate be lock in their cell for up to hour day while be there meet two prisoner who have job as prison cleaner they say that in the dilapidated and run down wing pigeon mess create most of their work they tell that they consider themselves lucky as their role as cleaner mean that both of they get to be out of their cell for around three hour day they explain that come the afternoon the smell of drug in the wing be overwhelming as prisoner use they out of boredom without fear of consequence while there see library staff by some passionate librarian but there be no prisoner there it be completely empty because there be no available staff to move the man across the prison see room set up for training include opportunity for inmate to gain qualification in skill such as dry lining again they be not be use for the same reason that be hardly surprising give that prison staff have be leave in drove since over year of cumulative prison officer experience have be lose leave wing to be manage by small less experienced team as consequence violence against staff be up by apart from the impact that staff turnover have on the running of prison it also have devastating impact on the public purse it cost to recruit and train prison officer yet one quarter of officer leave within year of take up the role why because under this government be prison officer be no long consider vocation instead it be often just stepping stone to move into less dangerous more lucrative work one thing that the government could do tomorrow to improve retention would be to give prison governor say over who they recruit currently they do not as they have no role on interview panel for new recruit that would be an important step in get good fit for their prison but it be an opportunity that be be miss the same go for procurement if governor want to buy good for prison they have to go through the approve ministry of justice supplier now there be an obvious security need here but the system would seem to be beset by delay and huge cost inefficiency at wandsworth the new governor tell she need new screen for their office to conduct zoom meeting on it take week to arrive and the exact same screen be available from argos to be deliver the next day and it be cheap when visit leeds prison staff there say that they want to procure some wood to make raise flowerbed for one of their rehabilitation project timber from the approve supplier cost three time as much as the amount quote by the local timber merchant those saving could have be make when visit hmp styal one of the house unit have just be renovate that consist of new window an alarm system and basic refurbishment use the approved supplier cost just under million which seem far out of step with the work require strongly urge the government to look into this issue as it seem that there be potential for huge saving and efficiency as well as the opportunity to build link between prison and local business which could provide path towards collaboration and post release employment in the government commit more than million to work and skill reform in prison to improve employment rate post release two year on however the probation inspectorate have find that just of those available for work go into employment upon release when classroom remain empty access to library be limited and inmate be lock in their cell for hour day how can we be surprised when prisoner who have have no intervention and no opportunity to learn anything new leave and reoffend moreover the effect of this be cost the taxpayer billion year cut reoffende have to be an absolute priority but in the current overcrowded understaffed condition prison be little more than college of crime since the government have repeatedly announce plan to build new jail and increase capacity but in the last year they have close nearly place and three new prison that be plan will not open until at the early an internal ministry of justice memo publish in june state that even if all prison building target be meet there would be shortfall of place by march overcrowding be already have detrimental effect on condition and the daily prison regime last month the chief inspector of prison inspect hmp pentonville which be originally design to hold man today it hold more than how can rehabilitation take place in these condition it be just more evidence of failure to get grip of our justice system the fact that little or no rehabilitative work be be do in prison be make it even hard for probation officer to do their job when speak to they they tell that what they long for be to be able to do their job properly but case load be simply unmanageable officer be have to prioritise paperwork and database instead of spend proper time with the people they supervise under labour probation be well regard service but this government ill conceive part privatisation wreak havoc on the service and cause mass exodus of experienced staff in total these reform cost half billion pound and they leave the public at great risk from offender because the work be often reduce to tick box exercise what be the result between and during the privatisation year the number of serious further offence conviction increase by more than third and the number of serious offender on probation find guilty of murder increase by the service have rightly reunify now but the huge organisational change the staff exodus and the vast sum waste on privatisation mean that probation be on its knee today only one local service have receive good report and in december the vacancy rate be these shortage and high case load be leave the public at risk just this morning the probation inspectorate find that only of domestic abuse offender on probation be be sufficiently assess for any risk of further domestic abuse nearly half should have have access to an intervention such as group programme or one to one meeting with probation officer to reduce the risk of further offence but that have not happen in nearly of case significant change such as move in with partner alter child protection plan or partner become pregnant be not be adequately review or reassess all the above failure in probation have cause judge to lose confidence in community sentence mean offender who should be eligible for they be be send to overcrowded prison instead last year visit community payback scheme in my constituency where those on unpaid work be help to maintain community play space which without they probably would have close they all without exception speak with pride about do work of value and have the opportunity to learn new skill it show just what can be achieve but these scheme be patchy and the use of community sentence have more than halve under the tories despite the clear benefit when they work effectively we need to look at how probation can be deliver as an effective local service labour would begin to do that by create system of community and victim payback board to strengthen community and victim involvement in sentencing under those board local people and victim of crime will have say in decide what unpaid work offender must undertake rather than get to grip with those issue the government be currently restructure probation via the one hmpps plan really hope they will take seriously the concern raise by the sector and the finding from the damn inspection report funding need to be channel to frontline officer not the bureaucratic layer of organisation above they that be the only way to reduce the burden they face and ensure they can give proper time and attention to those they supervise their inability to do this because of fail tory reform have mean that on average there have be six serious further offence conviction every week since include for murder kidnap and rape we have have justice secretaries and prisons ministers in the last year so it be no wonder that the system be in crisis they be never in post long enough to get to grip with the issue to take responsibility for their spending and be hold accountable or to set long term strategy and ensure stability no wonder the service be stick lurch from one crisis to the next when that be exactly what be happen in its political leadership if we be to fix that we need continuity at the top we need stable management that deliver proper plan for prison and probation instead of rehash announcement and gimmick and we need leadership that be laser focused on reduce waste drive efficiency and cut reoffende the tories have have year to deliver that and they have fail thank my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill the chair of the justice committee for his opening remark and more broadly for secure this important debate on this estimate day thank everybody who have contribute to the debate there can be no high purpose for government than protect the public from the devastating consequence of crime and maintain criminal justice system in which people have confidence we have honour our manifesto commitment to recruit additional police officer and through the police crime sentencing and courts act we have introduce tough penalty for the most serious crime and remove automatic halfway release of the most violent and sexual offender so that the bad criminal be lock up for long we be build new state of the art prison that will not only give effect to the order of the court to take criminal off our street but properly rehabilitate they so that they turn their back on crime for good that way we can break the destructive cycle of offend that cost the taxpayer billion year and have an incalculable personal cost to the victim and community blight by it the pcsc act also bring in well monitor and more effective community sentence which be just mention by the hon member for lewisham west and penge ellie reeves they punish offender tackle the underlie driver of offend and support people who want to turn their life around those measure include tough and more flexible electronically monitor curfew we aim to almost double the number of defendant and offender tag at any one time to reach by march we have recruit more than new health and justice co ordinator who will cover every probation region and work with health partner so that offender get the right treatment to stay on the straight and narrow that will be underpin by regular drug testing to monitor compliance we be invest up to million in community payback to drive up the hour of unpaid work do by offender so that they visibly pay their debt to society for the damage they have do we be achieve our vision to cut the youth custodial population which be mention by my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst roughly child and young people be in custody in as of april this year the number have fall to around it be also important to note that in line with our female offender strategy between and the average female prison population fall by our million security investment programme to reduce crime inside prison include stem the flow of illicit item such as drug mobile phone and weapon be complete in march enhance gate security include staff drug dog and over piece of equipment have be deploy to high risk prison site that routinely search staff and visitor we now have ray body scanner cover the entire closed male estate and they have record more than positive indication to date prison have complete their roll out of pava synthetic pepper spray to stop violent prisoner in their track and we have introduce new generation body wear video camera across the estate with networked cloud base technology these important investment rightly underpin our focus on the safety of staff and other in prison link to that we need prison to be place where offender overcome addiction which be why we be roll out abstinence focus drug recovery wing and increase the number of dedicated incentivise substance free living unit across the estate where prisoner commit to regular drug test in return for incentive such as more gym time alongside safety and security in prison we must invest in education and employment if we be to cut crime sustainably we know that if prisoner can hold down steady job it reduce their chance of reoffende by up to nine percentage point which be why we be drive forward initiative to help prisoner to secure job on release include through prison employment lead to match prisoner to job and employment advisory board to build link between prison and local industry and to ensure that the skill be teach in prison align with what be demand and require in the local labour market agree that we need to go far on education the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter speak about the shannon trust and pay tribute to its work confirm that we be extend what we do with the literacy innovation fund across prison there be also much sharp understanding of neurodiversity in our prison population and be pleased that we will have neurodiversity support manager across the estate by january be also excited about the prospect of the first secure school which we will be do in partnership with the oasis trust it be different approach from those in youth custody far elevate the role of education ensure proper support be on offer beyond the prison gate be also crucial if we be to help offender stay on the straight and narrow so we be improve pre release planning and continuity of care we want to ensure that no one supervise by probation be release from prison homeless our new transitional accommodation scheme community accommodation service tier so below the level of bail hostel help we to deliver on that commitment it be initially deliver in five probation region in but our investment be expand to operate across all of england and wales by april we be also invest in pre release team which have be embed in prison and provide an important interface for commission rehabilitative service that help ex prisoner with accommodation personal wellbeing employment training and education to improve continuity of care for prison leaver with substance misuse or wide health issue we be recruit more than health and justice co ordinator with responsibility for ensure more join up support between prison probation and healthcare treatment service where appropriate alcohol monitoring on licence be available small thing that the rest of we can take for grant can make all the difference for good or ill that be why we have introduce resettlement passport set up ahead of release to bring together the essential that offender need in one place bank account cv and the identification people need to prove the right to work and to rent flat we have also support the offenders day of release from detention act which recently receive royal assent have start out as private member bill it will enable offender at risk of reoffende to be release up to two day early to avoid what can be the hectic rush of try to get round different service on friday my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst ask specifically about magistrate sentence power give the time should not talk about that in great detail now we have have chance to talk about it in the select committee on his specific question about work with the judiciary we be work with the judicial office as part of the review we be undertake on the change and plan to engage magistrate on it we should have complete that review by the autumn my hon friend and other rightly ask about capacity the role of operation safeguard and other short term capacity measure as well as the long term capital programme since october we have see an acute and exceptional rise in the prison population operation safeguard be temporary measure to provide short term solution to that acute rise in demand he ask how much of that capacity have be use the answer be that it go up and down it be facility to be draw on as need the average over the period be really quite low but there be day when its usage be great stand it up have provide we with vital extra short term resilience as we develop far that long term capital programme as of april we have invest billion in capital towards the delivery of the additional modern prison place to which my hon friend refer by the end of june about of those place have be add to the estate that include the two new place prison hmp five wells and fosse way with the latter have accept its first prisoner at the end of may be grateful to the minister for that update those who have be to five wells and fosse way recognise what an advance they be in design and facility will he give we specific update on where we be in the stall planning process on the other three prison which be still stick in the system when be we likely to get those move forward as my hon friend well know he be previously lead light in ministerial office deal with local government we do not control the planning process be therefore not in position to give he bang up to date update except to say that those three project remain part of our plan overall this be complex capital programme and we need to deal with external factor include work through the planning process perhaps the minister could write to and the select committee to set out where we be with those project have they go to appeal yet if so have any indication be give as to when the hearing will take place of course will be delighted to correspond in that way with my hon friend we be also roll out rapid deployment cell across the estate the first three site hmp norwich wymott and hollesley bay be now accept prisoner and the majority of the additional place will be deliver this year we be undertake major refurbishment at site include hmp birmingham liverpool and norwich deliver about cell between they the wing by wing refurbishment at hmp liverpool will see every cell renovate construction have also start on new house block at hmp stocken hatfield sudbury and rye hill which will add around place between they hmp millsike the new prison of some place by hmp full sutton will open in our new prison have laser sharp focus on rehabilitation with workshop and cutting edge technology that put education training and job front and centre so every prisoner get the right opportunity to turn over new leaf like many or most workforce the prison service have experience recruitment and retention challenge at time of very low unemployment ensure our service be sufficiently resource and that we retain level of experience be fundamental for deliver quality outcome that be why we be target the driver of staff attrition and take step to improve recruitment alongside wide agenda of development in the workforce we welcome the justice committee important inquiry into the prison operational workforce and we have work closely with the committee to provide evidence we be now closely consider the survey of prison staff and reaffirm that we take the issue of the morale and safety of staff with the great gravity prison staff do incredible work and so often be the hidden hero of our justice system and society in every prison have visit their dedication and drive be clear to see we fund range of service to support staff wellbee which include care team in public sector prison that be train to provide support to any member of staff involve in an incident at work we be committed to make sure our prison staff feel safe support and value and we look forward to receive the committee full report and recommendation in due course the prison staff pay award be announce in july it represent significant investment in the workforce alongside an increase in base pay of at least for all staff between band and we target far pay rise for our low pay staff of up to the probation service be in its second year of multi year pay deal for staff salary value of all pay band will increase each year target at key operational grade to improve what have be challenging recruitment and retention position the pay increase differ for different job role but to provide an example probation officer will see their starting salary rise from around in to little over by let respond briefly to some of the individual point make by colleague during the debate the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter ask about crowd in prison the most recent statistic show crowd at in the estate by way of comparison in that figure be my near neighbour my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes raise the horrific crime of overkill have hear what she say and will pass on those point within the department commend the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell for his close association and work with the prison officers association confirm that will continue to look forward to speak with the prison officers association and other staff body throughout the prison and probation service he be right to identify the centrality of safety and security in people experience of work reassure he that we measure those thing centrally through the key performance indicator that we have in prison multiple members rightly talk about rehabilitation specifically on the question about education provider ask by the hon member for hammersmith it be true that there be four education provider contract to provide education service through the prison system however there be also flexible fund that enable individual governor to draw down fund to make supplementary provision in certain way it be important that we get blend that we be able to respond to local condition and the specific of prison population and have some commonality in the provision and in the qualification study will the minister give way on that point be sorry but think that might be start to stretch mr deputy speaker patience will be happy to follow up with the hon gentleman separately if he would like to do so as an alternative my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north talk quite rightly about the impact on family that work in both direction the effect on the child and what can be an adverse childhood experience and the effect on the prisoner then there be the importance of have family time and family support and the difference that that can make on release pay tribute to lord farmer for the work that he have do in that area we have do some work on improve the maintenance of family tie but bring here today the good news that we be work on some data link in order to understand the extent and nature of these issue more closely we know overall that the effort of our dedicated staff be work the proportion of prison leaver in employment six month after release have more than double in the two year to march from to more than since the overall reoffende rate have decrease from to as of february our transitional accommodation service have support more than prison leaver who would otherwise have be homeless across the initial five region of course there be still huge amount more to do but it be clear that we be make significant and important progress the government will always value and invest in his majesty prison and probation service our prison must be and will be safe place in which to work where staff be provide with the right support the training and the tool to empower they to do their job look forward to continued dialogue on this matter with the committee and other beyond this debate and the report in closing let repeat my gratitude to my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst for secure the debate and to all who have contribute today commend the estimate to the house the final brief word go to sir robert neill be very grateful to all who have take part in this important and valuable debate just wish more people have be here to hear it but hope that they will read at least some of what be say because the issue raise by hon member on both side of the house be important they include the condition of prison and the issue raise by the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter on the legitimate concern of the staff in our prison which should not be ignore the point make by my right hon friend the member for romsey and southampton north caroline nokes about family be also critical too look forward to the report of the wade review there be positive thing happen and there be positive suggestion from both front bench team in some way we should try to find more consensual approach to some issue of prison policy because to put it right will require an approach that will span the lifetime of more than one parliament it be an important challenge and be grateful for the time for this debate today question defer until tomorrow at seven standing order no woman and equalities committee call sir bill wiggin to move the motion on behalf of the committee of selection beg to move that dr jamie wallis be discharge from the women and equalities committee and lia nici be add believe that have until this evening so have few word

question put and agree to winnie ewing motion make and question propose that this house do now morrissey here we be just come up to pm on tuesday afternoon if reflect back on the time that our dear friend and colleague winnie ewing be in this place quite often parliament could be sit to am be or even am if she be here today can only begin to think what she would make of it be sure my much miss colleague would be say what shamble this place be that it can not conduct its business in way that allow for timely discharge of event do this show to those of we on the snp side that westminster have nothing to say to the people of scotland do it just suggest that it be about time that scotland complete its journey to independence we do the task that winnie ewing set for we our job be not to come here and to settle down but to settle up for the people of scotland be grateful for the opportunity to celebrate the remarkable achievement of winifred margaret ewing winnie be elect to this house first for the seat of hamilton in by election in then for moray in when she unseat the then tory secretary of state for scotland not only do winnie serve in this house but she be elect to the european parliament as well as to the scottish parliament the fact that she serve in three legislature make she unique as scottish politician however it be not the accomplishment of that electoral record that make winnie unique as our colleague from the intake george reid say occasionally just very occasionally person emerge from the murk of daily life with the vision and determination to change thing for good to set the country on different path that be winnie that be winnie george be absolutely right about that when the hamilton by election take place on november the voter of hamilton change the political landscape of scotland they change the history of scotland when winnie emerge from the count that night she do indeed utter the immortal word stop the world scotland want to get on winnie light spark that night and the fire from that spark have shine brightly ever since my right hon friend mention that very famous hamilton by election but there be another just before hamilton that set scotland on the path the glasgow pollok by election in which the snp candidate be the great george leslie who we also lose fairly recently it go to show do it not that we on these benches stand on the shoulder of giant be grateful to my hon friend for that intervention because he be so right with our colleague in edinburgh deliver government for the people of scotland in our parliament we have the task of complete that journey to independence but at time like this it be right that we pay tribute to those who have go before the scottish national party be form in through the merger of two political party the national party of scotland form in and the scottish self government party my goodness to think of some of the people who have the courage to give their life to shape scotland future at that point we do indeed stand on the shoulder of giant there be so many to mention we think of john maccormick two of whose son become parliamentarian neil maccormick in the european parliament and iain maccormick in this place we think of giant such as robert bontine cunninghame graham remarkable individual who be member of this house he be elect as liberal in lanarkshire in although believe he never formally take the liberal whip then stand as an independent and then become the first president of the independent labour party like so many however he be on political journey and become the first president of the scottish national party he be also very well know in argentina as rancher and an accomplished novelist tell that story because of the spark of genius in those who form the movement at that time in the like of compton mackenzie we talk about by election and will come on to the remind the very few conservative politician who be here that we have until pm so they should stick with go on smile you might learn something will the right hon gentleman give way if the hon gentleman would bear with there be plenty of time let we just settle down in think about those by election in the as well as talk about george leslie we should also think of the like of billy wolfe in west lothian in the early that journey gather sense of momentum and that momentum really spark into life with winnie success in hamilton in go back if may to the midlothian by election my own grandfather and his two brother become member of the snp in that period by election have be important for the snp in fulfil the promise that it have will the right hon gentleman give way on political journey this will be quite political journey it will be may first congratulate the right hon gentleman on secure the debate he and speak early not many people in this house will know that winnie ewing and dr paisley be good friend from the european parliament and have good relationship quite clearly one be commit to unionism and the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland while the other be commit to independence but that do not in any way inhibit their relationship although mrs ewing and have very different view on unionism much admire her courage advocacy passion and desire for her country her nickname in brussels translate to mrs legacy to be proud of her advice of stand your ground apply to many of we in politic myself include it be timeless motto not simply for generation of scot but for their very proud ulster scots cousin in northern ireland be so grateful to my hon friend if may refer to he in that way people should listen to his wise word it be worth reflect on the fact that those of we on these benches have passion and commitment we want to see scotland become an independent country but as we often say the debate about our country future ought to be one of mutual respect of course we understand that there be other tradition but we all have responsibility to extend the hand of friendship as winnie ewing do the hon member for strangford jim shannon talk about the relationship that she have with the reverend ian paisley be aware of that relationship but she also have one with john hume those in brussels at that time would often see the three of they in conversation and indeed at more social occasion as well if may refer to they in that way it be important that when we talk to people externally we give the message that we be here in this place to stand up for our constituent and in our case to stand up for our country but that we have no personal animosity towards those on the other side those who serve with winnie whether in this place in westminster or like some on the snp benches in the scottish parliament know that she always look out for new member or young member in particular in the end the way in which someone comport themselves be important in that regard winnie be shin light and an example to we all rise rise will give way first to my hon friend the member for central ayrshire dr whitford obviously we be celebrate winnie as an absolute icon of the scottish national party and of scotland but we need to remember that she be also woman and mother we send the condolence of everyone on these benches and of the whole house to fergus annabelle and terry be very grateful because that be important the sense of grief that they will all be feel from the loss of their mother will be very different from our experience we have fantastic memory of winnie as so many of we be lucky to spend time with she it be right that we reflect on all that my hon friend the member for central ayrshire talk about thinking of winnie as woman let we quickly reflect on that and think about the circumstance for woman come to this house in when it be not that common it be not just that woman come to this house in but that she come here on her own to represent her constituent as the only snp politician in this place quite frankly the experience that she have be utterly disgraceful in the main the misogyny that she face will pay credit to harold wilson who be friend of hers but the experience that she have in this place be absolutely unspeakable when we think about where we be we think about the scottish parliament be re establish in and the snp go into government and often reflect on those who have drive our movement we have speak about be on the shoulder of giant but for there be two people in particular who we owe an enormous debt of gratitude one be winnie and the other be margo macdonald who win the govan by election in as someone who be teenager in the what drive into the snp be the leadership of those two people by goodness we be so blessed by the leadership drive ambition intelligence wit sophistication and glamour that both those woman present themselves with what fantastic leader and role model they be for scotland rise speak of role model but not of glamour no certainly not my right hon friend mention the wit that we get from winnie and margo and one of the great thing about winnie be that her wicked sense of humour be as often as not turn on herself if can give one brief example when stand in the glenrothes by election winnie do lot of campaigning just by go for cup of coffee in place and talk to people she come into the campaign room double up with laughter once because woman have spot she and drag she year old daughter across the road to meet this legend of scottish politic the wee girl say that she know who winnie be because she be learn about she in school now winnie be lawyer she should have know that you do not ask question if you do not know the answer she say to the wee girl you must be do modern study then and the wee girl say no history well indeed that be typical winnie story the only thing that could reflect on beyond that be the description of anyone go for cup of coffee with winnie in all the year and decade that have know she have never know anyone go for cup of coffee with she an irish coffee perhaps since the issue of by election have be mention it be probably worth reflect that many of we be by election candidate include my hon friend and myself stand in paisley in and by election winner and winner from airdrie more recently what use to happen be that winnie ewing would turn up and assist you for the last few day of the campaign she be your minder in my case she actually replace nicola who have be my minder for most of the campaign for those who have not experience it it really be something to behold because it be not normal political campaigning certainly when it get to the evening in my case we do tour of the pub of paisley as someone who be relatively modest shy and retire it be quite remarkable to see madame écosse work the table and to be welcome by everybody and have discussion about political life since we be on the subject and we have time remember that on election day we be in particular inn in paisley member can probably think of the one mean winnie say let get dram and have to say to she winnie the candidate but relent and have one she want to buy second one and say come on not today the candidate let miss that the point of tell that story be the spirit and warmth of the individual it be an absolute pleasure to spend time in her company be glad to say that become very good friend to madame écosse to winnie ewing she would come up and spend some time with we in skye she be fantastic company will my right hon friend give way one second then will you say that minute ago well recall go to visit she when she be in the quarriers home in my hon friend constituency believe go with fellow parliamentarian colleague of our from the scottish parliament colin campbell colin have make the fateful error of phone the nursing home as we be leave his house to say that we would be there in few minute the upshot of that be that rather than our go to visit she in the nursing home there she be at the door with her coat on and her handbag as we go in the remark be right boy where be we go the expectation be that we would be take she out to place where we could have some relaxation and entertainment if can put it that way there be two link to there colin campbell be my history teacher when be at school hon member not modern study no history also have the great privilege of winnie be constituent of mine when she be in that nursing home be the candidate in and get the phone call to go and meet winnie ewing which be quite an experience for and she be incredibly generous with her time and her advice however week later winnie be not feel so good it be come up to the election and her family phone to say that winnie do not have postal vote so have enormous pleasure on election day of take winnie ewing ballot paper and voting for myself which be proud moment and something that will live with for the rest of my day that be wonderful story and know the woman as do can say to my hon friend that nothing would have give winnie more pride than know he have do that remember that election with some pride in my own interaction with winnie at that time winnie have send video address that could use in my own election campaign and it be not short it be minute long hon member the irony well do say that she be my mentor some minute of that minute address be about europe so there be serious point to this winnie study law in glasgow but she also go to study in the hague she be scottish nationalist from the age of nine but she be european and she be an internationalist she be so proud of what the european union have mean for scotland she be so proud of the role she have play as parliamentarian and of the friendship that she have develop with her friend not just from these island but right across europe there be the role winnie ewing play in the lomé convention and in bring it to inverness for goodness sake there be the work she do in establish the erasmus programme which be so inspirational in provide opportunity for our young people it be therefore not surprising that she would often talk about what the european union have mean there be number of we here from the highland and island and my goodness how we have benefit from objective status and the person responsible for that be winnie ewing think about where we be today we have to go cap in hand to westminster for levelling up money and for what be in effect scrap from the table as oppose to what be there for we as right when scotland and the european community be work together in partnership the highland and island be full of sign for project that have be finance by europe and that be the legacy of madame écosse michel barnier be recently on skye and he post picture of path that have be fund by the european union what difference between the spirit of generosity we have from the european union and what we face in this place be very grateful to the modest shy and retire gentleman my right hon friend for give way early he mention compton mackenzie and think it be worth remember that compton mackenzie who be bury in my native island he be founder of the snp in be actually an englishman which say lot about the snp despite what many would say have the great fortune during the general election of to get to know winnie very well stay with she at goodwill in miltonduff on several occasion and spend many an hour over coffee perhaps with her late husband stewart and look back fondly on that remember one time go to the black isle show the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone smile and we sit down with some farmer be the candidate and think this meeting with the farmer at the black isle show have to go well but winnie sit down and tell they well if we be independent now guy you would be suffer the problem with bse would you think that tell you so start to it would absolutely torpedo our meeting but it do not because winnie ewing have style and she have the respect of the people and it be take that way they know the truth of what she be say and do not take it badly and the meeting progress really well of course we know that winnie ewing have leave we not just the great political legacy we be stand on but her own child two tremendous scottish national party msp fergus ewing and annabelle ewing we extend our condolence to they as well as to terry and to her grandchild indeed and be grateful to my hon friend for that intervention winnie be elect to the european parliament in june remember it no you do do be eight year old well not many of we be active in scottish politic at that time be teenager let be brutal and in fact the first election vote in be that european election the general election of be not our fine hour it be if may say so temporary setback for the scottish national party we lose some ground and perhaps be not in the good of fettle in that european election remember it well there be not many expectation that the snp be go to win any seat in the european parliament indeed it be forecast that the liberal democrats be more likely to take the highlands and islands seat but what night that be when winnie ewing win the highlands and islands for the snp we hear story about winnie ewing interaction with the farmer and the same would have be true if we be talk about fishing people crofter those work in the industrial community in fort william and so on and so forth one thing about winnie be that she work for her constituent remember when the pulp mill be close in fort william the way that she pick up the phone to every newspaper proprietor up and down the land to try to get business for that pulp and paper mill the legacy of the work she do build relationship right across the highlands and islands be that she increase her majority in every election that she fight as european mp what role model she be for we as someone who believe in our political philosophy and someone who be ultimately first class parliamentarian my wife family move into the hamilton constituency while winnie be the mp there and they often talk about the success that she have get phone instal for they in the winnie do that casework and she come to visit they and make sure that she do her job as the local mp say for those on the government benches that be on page of my speech but will make some progress over the next while do worry interruption be in my introduction actually it be the précis winnie be trailblazer for those of we who sit on the snp benches but we would do well constantly to remind ourselves of her word from when in response to harold wilson ask she how she be settle in she respond not here to settle in here to settle up for scotland let we remind ourselves on these benches that that be exactly the job that we be expect to do when we talk about the memory of those who bring we here and about what winnie want with scottish independence it be not for we or for past generation that have till the soil it be for those who will follow we and for future generation so that scotland can become the country it can be prosperous greener fair country that allow our human capital to flourish that would be an appropriate legacy for winnie our dear friend and colleague who be winnie she be bear and bring up in glasgow she attend glasgow university as well as the hague academy of international law she be scottish nationalist from the young age of nine nationalist but also european and an internationalist as say early perspective that be to shape much of her political life like many who make this journey she come from labour support family her father george have be member of the independent labour party and it be only after her father death that winnie learn that he have join the snp in july month before the hamilton by election so many in the labour party would make that journey towards the snp her family make it in the it be pity that no one from the labour party be here to hear this speech and join the journey that so many in scotland have already make that phrase stop the world scotland want to get on encapsulate so much of winnie outlook that desire for scotland to achieve its potential to get on and be the good that we could be there be no well ambassador for scotland in europe than winnie she have focus determination to put scotland on the map at home and internationally although she serve with distinction leave her mark in westminster and europe that opportunity to serve in the scottish parliament bring her particular pleasure when winnie be elect to the scottish parliament in it be culmination of drive to restore nationhood to scotland that have drive she since first be elect to westminster in it be journey of year that bring the re establishment of the scottish parliament how fitting it be that winnie preside over the opening session of the scottish parliament when she proclaim that the scottish parliament which adjourn on march be hereby reconvene scottish parliament official report may there be that long journey to scotland establish parliament and it be open by the msp who be so inspirational in drive forward the process of achieve that parliament be recognition of the determination and leadership she have show since that breakthrough in hamilton in scotland have get on winnie be on her own as an mp in her first parliament although she be support by her plaid cymru friend gwynfor evans those would be challenge time for she with the open hostility often show in this place how different her experience would be when she return to this place in as the member for moray and nairn and ultimately as member of the snp first in many respect it be challenging parliament george reid sadly now the only survive member of that group remark of group meeting when winnie say look if we do hang together we hang apart as be often the case with winnie it be sage advice as apt for all of we today as it be then after westminster come europe as we have discuss and the success that winnie have there before she depart westminster she happily take up number of issue in her maiden speech in in debate on the age of majority she say there be moral and intellectual reason why it be good sense to make people responsible at the age of if not soon and mean fully responsible in every sense of the word they be become less inclined to follow their parent way of thinking and they be more able to earn they have see the world on the television screen and the visual be more compelling than read they have very good understanding of what the world be all about there be revival of interest in politic be sorry that the report do not talk about vote at because that be in the mind of everyone who consider this matter but if we go as far as the report recommend then vote at may well be the logical next step be absolutely on the side of youth would remind the house that even if we give the vote at the average age at which the first vote be cast be and if we give the vote at then the average age at which it be first cast be pitt be good prime minister so it be say and he be only so that today presumably he might not even have have vote and could not have be prime minister official report november vol be tell that story because this be woman who recognise the importance of lower the voting age at that time in the if we then think about our referendum in the scottish parliament legislate to make sure that and year old get the vote know that winnie be particularly proud of the fact that our young people those who be go to be part of scotland story be give that opportunity will close with some reflection on the referendum day in and winnie remark when she be interview at her home by hugh macdonald incidentally he be the son of one of the two man who hoist she aloft after the hamilton by election perhaps sense that our cause would not be win that day she maintain her optimism that the process of independence be go in only one direction she say have never have any doubt that scotland will be independent none this be still hopeful thursday for the yes campaign be not daft know this be on knife edge but this can not be stop it be movement it be process my dearly depart friend and colleague be exactly right want to make my closing remark to my colleague on the snp benches about the responsibility that we have if we think about what we have endure over the course of the last few year since the financial crisis of the united kingdom have be in reverse we have have decade of decline in living standard with our people be hold in poverty our responsibility be to have the vision the energy the drive and the leadership so that we can show people in scotland that it do not have to be this way will reflect for moment on book write by chap call anderson at aberdeen university in which he graphically show that scotland population in the united kingdom on relative basis have decline in every decade since the that be matter of fact it be not about blame anyone else but about what happen within the status quo people often talk about the deficit that scotland have but an important factor that have to be bear in mind be that that be the deficit within the context of the united kingdom in many respect we have miss the opportunity of north sea oil where be the legacy of the plus harvest in tax revenue from that resource it be go but friend we will not make the same mistake second time what scotland be face now be an enormous opportunity from green energy not just in provide energy for we but in provide leadership in the global economy the skilling report which we as group publish last year demonstrate that scotland have the potential to increase its green energy output fivefold let we think about the opportunity for we if we can capture that supply chain it be about create green industrial future drive that investment into the scottish economy drive up productivity drive up living standard and deliver the tax receipt that will be necessary to invest in health education transport and every other area of social policy in scotland look at our academic community look at the excellence and leadership that we have in world lead university in scotland and think about the opportunity from put that to work develop the start up and spin out of the new industry of the future and not be hold back by united kingdom that have turn its back on europe send our economy into decline lose opportunity and strike off our gdp through the foolhardiness of brexit the challenge for we be to say to people yes there be well way there be way that winnie ewing would want we to take it be about show how we would deliver that prosperity and put that in the context of the cost of living crisis where so many of our people be in fuel poverty my goodness in country rich in energy resource that be the price that we pay for be part of this union as we face that election next year and the opportunity of remove the tories from power it be not about remove the tories in one election it be about remove the tories from scotland for good because scotland become an independent country that would be legacy for winnie ewing like the hon member for strangford jim shannon who have just leave the chamber come from different political tradition but for four year between and have the privilege and pleasure of serve with winnie ewing in the scottish parliament would like to make few remark from personal angle as some member present know my parent be small farmer my father be small dairy farmer in easter ross in the late he and my mother establish small cheese business which my brother still run today enough of the family advert in the late they venture south of the border and take stand at the food fair at olympia my mum and dad write to all the scottish mps in this place and ask they to come and visit the stand and taste the cheese only one take up the invitation winnie ewing my parent never forget that it mean huge amount to they do not know winnie at that stage be still at school later my father die too young the letter that winnie write to my mother be remarkable have it yet it be treasured letter that will never part with and trust my child and grandchild never will either it mean so much to my mother this lady transcend party politic she cut right through to ordinary folk in scotland that be tremendous and rare strength to which pay tribute in appear as green as grass in holyrood there be the great lady herself from the word go she show nothing but friendship to where my party tend to drink in deacon brodie dr ewing of goodwill in miltonduff rather prefer the jolly judge far up towards the castle but many be the happy small refreshment that have with winnie ewing we enjoy each other company enormously think too of the durness highland game in north west sutherland where winnie be regular and she be very fondly receive by the local folk can tell you she be much love and they be really charm that she come to the game as often as she do again it be great pleasure to have small dram with winnie at the game one evening in fact we maybe have one too many and winnie decide that be her favourite liberal be extremely worried because think that might totally destroy my career so make sure that all copy of the northern times that refer to that be suppress and never come anywhere near here take that as great compliment it be mean very kindly indeed when the word come out that she have leave we happen to be in north west sutherland at the time people say oh dash it she away what shame when people say that kind of thing about someone who have leave we it be mean ever so genuinely if my parent be alive today they would be very sad that winnie be no long with we be very sad that she be no long with we as say she transcend party politic she be way above that it be an enormous privilege to have know she her hard work attitude and sincere approach be something to behold mourn she today we mourn she today would add two thing first the right hon member for ross skye and lochaber ian blackford refer to she as madame écosse be the member of my party who once have to go on the telly and explain why she have win such huge victory in the highland it be testing event for but come from the school of hard knock secondly imagine that great number of people in europe include present and former member of the european parliament will mourn her passing can there be any great epitaph doubt it be very grateful for this opportunity to pay tribute on behalf of plaid cymru to the late winnie ewing and to send my condolence to the family particularly annabelle who be very value member of this house when start in think she leave we in much have already be say about the inspirational contribution winnie ewing make to scottish and european politic could add to that but just want to note our appreciation in wales of her contribution in particular of course her breakthrough election in the hamilton seat be teenager at the time you would not think so be such young lad and completely obsess with politic gwynfor evans have be elect to the carmarthen seat in just before winnie ewing we have also have some near miss as we have some time and for the interest of the house will mention that in rhondda west we come within vote of beat the labour party they be much more colourful time back then our candidate vic davy would drive around the valley perch on the back of big red dragon which be load on to flatbe lorry get his message to the people it be complicated message have to concede but he know how to do it then in caerphilly the much miss phil williams who many people here will remember again come close to beat the labour candidate perhaps the most interesting one if can just go off on slight tangent and diversion which would be of interest to labour members be they here be davies who in be the hon member for merthyr tydfil he be allegedly but probably quite bit old and labour decide to deselect he so he decide to stand as an independent this be message for the labour party he stand as an independent and trounce the very lacklustre trade union official the labour party have parachute in interestingly he be then offer the freedom of merthyr tydfil but turn it down say that the support of the people of merthyr tydfil be quite enough for he thank you very much they be much more colourful time as young person in and the old world seem to be die and the new world be be bear not struggle to be bear but be bear before our eye as with davies some people from the old world show we the way bit and that be when we have the hamilton by election to spur we on at the time do not think one could overestimate the inspirational quality of winnie ewing victory join gwynfor evans it seem that the tide be with we as my right hon friend the member for ross skye and lochaber ian blackford say this place can be very dispiriting know how much gwynfor evans as the lone voice of welsh nationalism appreciate and welcome winnie ewing arrival which herald fruitful partnership between our two party that have exist ever since just for the hon gentleman knowledge in the many time spend with winnie ewing she mention gwynfor evans frequently thank my hon friend for that point some people around may be able to see this very interesting picture which be of winnie ewing and gwynfor evans together at an advanced age sit in the sunshine on bench outside gwynfor house chatting and laugh think winnie be slightly disappointed that the glass be empty laughter there have be very fruitful partnership between our two party and that be establish long time ago may that long continue true to the path that winnie ewing and gwynfor evans establish over year ago may we as my right hon friend the member for ross skye and lochaber say never forget that we be here not to settle down but to settle up that be an inspirational statement be now of an age when the old saw they do make they like that any more begin to ring true tend to think that as well so may say about winnie ewing sincerely thank you but also they do make they like that any more hear hear could not have fail to take advantage of the opportunity to speak in debate entitle winnie ewing and to add just few recollection of my time with winnie because it be very special time indeed think that what have come across in the tribute that we have hear over the past couple of week be how much people enjoy and appreciate be in her company she have that special ability to make people feel not just welcome and glad to be with she but proud to be with she spend time with she be something quite special spend lot of time with she and want to share couple of story about that there be one day that will never forget be elect in the same year as my hon friend the member for arfon hywel williams back in one of the proud moment of my life occur when be make my maiden speech from roughly where be stand now because over in that box the under gallery sit winnie ewing keep glance over to she and she keep give that encourage smile that be sure everyone remember however as you probably suspect mr deputy speaker she be not there just to hear my eloquence her daughter annabelle be to make her maiden speech the next day but winnie be determined to come along and hear all the other new member of parliament make their maiden speech that be the sort of person she be she be here to give we solid support and encouragement remember go down to the strangers bar with winnie as we would inevitably end up do on the terrace she say your speech be quite good pete the content be quite good but you be go to have to learn to speak bit more slowly and you be go to have to wear well suit leave it to you mr deputy speaker to decide whether meet the standard that be set by winnie ewing in the year be elect winnie be serve member of the scottish parliament she regularly come up to perthshire and to angus the seat be contest at that point it be always winnie people want to speak to have think myself to be reasonably exotic candidate come from rock music background but she be the real rock star it be winnie people want to speak to on the doorstep and she always have time to speak to everybody also remember the campaign because run it and winnie be there for all the new candidate recall she be particularly thrilled that my hon friend the member for na eileanan an iar angus brendan macneil be candidate and have real prospect of win the seat winnie be so proud and pleased about his victory although do not know about the rest of she think it very special for he to win back the western isles after her good friend donnie stewart have hold it for such long time know how much she appreciate my hon friend election there be one other thing about winnie ewing and be go to try to set this right over the next couple of week winnie be fantastic singer and have the pleasure of record she for cd that be commission to make as vice convener for fundraise for the party back in the rather foolishly decide that would record few of the personality in the scottish national party with mixed result it must be say but one performance stand out and that be winnie remember she wander into the recording studio like rock star straight to the mike for the first take of will ye no come back again the great poem by lady nairne and she sing it so beautifully find version of the cd which will share with my colleague and will make sure it be put online that be thing that winnie be always able to do to give song to take part and to be prepared to do everything else have not be on the snp national executive committee for some year but winnie and run the election committee that be responsible for vet candidate for the scottish parliament will spare his blush but someone we vet be in the vicinity of the chamber today and we have long conversation about his suitability think that winnie win the day and he be now our minister for independence in the scottish parliament we have such great time on that panel winnie fiona hyslop and be give responsibility for vetting candidate and think we get most of they right but we definitely get that one right there be so many great memory there be so many fantastic time with winnie she light up room she be great friend she be mentor and total and utter inspiration for all of we in the scottish national party be so proud and please that spend some of my parliamentary time as colleague of winnie albeit in different parliaments and that have that time to get to know she and to call she friend in what we be do she will always be massive figure in this party know that everybody say we will not see she like again but we will not it be hard to believe that somebody of her stature will emerge in the theatre of scottish politic for long time know how much my colleague be hurt and grieve the loss of winnie ewing and know that this parting have be hard but what life what contribution what legend winnie ewing be and we will miss she dearly welcome the opportunity to pay tribute to winnie ewing in this house today want to start by thank the right hon member for ross skye and lochaber ian blackford for secure the debate and also want to express my deep sympathy to winnie family particularly fergus ewing msp and annabelle ewing msp alongside whom work during my time as member of the scottish parliament in edinburgh although our politic could not be more different recognise the enormous contribution that winnie ewing make to public life in scotland the excellent contribution we have hear this evening from member on both side of the house be testament to her extraordinary life of public service her place in the history of scottish politic go back nearly six decade be secure and very well deserve as other have already note winnie ewing serve twice as member of parliament for hamilton after her famous by election victory in until and for moray and nairn between and she be also member of the european parliament for two decade from earn her unofficial title as madame écosse from to she serve as member of the scottish parliament as we have hear already her word at the opening of the new parliament have go down in scottish history it be truly remarkable record of service with more than year in total as an elect politician as member have highlight winnie ewing be also dedicated servant to her party as president of the snp for year from thank the minister for give way and for his very generous opening remark it be also worth put on the record that winnie late husband stewart be councillor in the summerston area of glasgow which currently represent in this place winnie her husband and her child have between they represent scotland and the people of scotland at every conceivable level which really be tremendous legacy
