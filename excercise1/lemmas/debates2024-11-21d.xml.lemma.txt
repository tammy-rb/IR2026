to further withdrawal of late and early service to market harborough the last train back from london be already far too early so we need to avoid the work have any further damaging impact we be all concerned about the impact of work on service know that the rail minister be aware of that and would welcome the opportunity to visit alongside network rail to see the work be do to mitigate the impact on the hon gentleman constituent as that work continue bus franchising whether she be take step to support the participation of small and medium sized local bus operator in bus franchising scheme this government be empower every community to take back control of their local bus service legislation on bus franchising require local authority to consider small and medium sized enterprise as part of the franchising process we be work with those interested in pursue franchising to develop different model include small scale model which require less financial commitment and provide more opportunity for small and medium sized bus operator to participate be pleased to hear that this be part of the consultation on update the bus franchising guidance we have some strong local sme in falmouth that provide knowledgeable local and flexible bus service along with community bus service too will the minister please confirm that she will be supportive of that kind of model when go through the guidance my hon friend be great champion for business in her constituency we recognise the important role that small local bus operator can provide in deliver high quality bus service they know their customer and their community in addition to the requirement to consider sme as part of the franchising process this government reform to the bus system be design to give more option to local community to deliver local bus service our transformative bus bill will seek to give local area the choice of pursue bus franchising high quality partnership with the private sector or local authority own bus company and once in law will provide more opportunity for all operator include sme thank the minister for that answer which be incredibly helpful to support the participation of small and medium sized local bus company in bus franchising scheme they also want to be energy efficient that enable they to apply for the franchise and do well how can the minister help those small and medium sized bus company to be energy efficient with hydrogen bus for example and thereby gain the franchise and contract transport matter be devolve in the hon gentleman constituency of course but put bus at the heart of our policy and want to increase ridership provide brilliant opportunity for local manufacturer of bus to take part and support local manufacturer and operator call the shadow secretary of state on behalf of the opposition front bench too offer my sincere sympathy to the family of the late lord prescott on his passing on monday in her statement on bus funding the secretary of state say that formula be be use to allocate funding she say that the formula will allocate funding base on local need population the distance that bus travel and level of deprivation this formula and the funding allocate be fair arrangement ensure that every area of the country get the service level it report november vol the formula include the weighting give to the various factor by the right hon lady have not be publish when will it be thank the shadow secretary of state for his question we be proud of the work that we have do to ensure that every part of the country benefit from additional funding for their bus and we will publish that later report november vol correction the secretary of state also say in her statement council such as leicester the isle of wight torbay and cambridgeshire will see unprecedented level of funding for service official report november vol what level of subsidy do she believe that bus service in those area will require it be incredibly important that decision about local service be take by those who be operate they that be why not only have we provide substantial level of billion announce in the budget and the allocation set out on monday but we be provide local transport authority with the power they need to provide the service that local community want and deserve local bus services travel to school if she will make an assessment of the effectiveness of local bus service in enable child travel to school the government know how important local bus service be in provide access to education we have set out an ambitious programme of reform to empower local leader to improve service for passenger include through the introduction of the bus bill to ensure that they well reflect the need of local community too associate myself with the remark about lord prescott in my constituency of tunbridge wells group of parent have tell about the difficulty that their child have in get to skinners kent academy the child can get either the no or the no the first one get they to school minute early so they have to wait by the side of busy road in the cold and the dark and the latter get they there minute late over school year that be hour of education kent be give million for bus service beyond give the money what will the department for transport be do to ensure that the money will increase the frequency of service so that child can get to school on time think an adjournment debate may be need well mr speaker do not know the particular detail of the no or the no forgive as the hon member have point out kent county council have be give million as part of our billion package for bus we be right lot of wrong over the underfunding of rural service in particular over the year and we expect to see

transport can be bring into the scope of the bus fare cap will the minister agree to look at that service from participate operator that serve school be open to member of the public and run all year round and will be eligible for inclusion in the scheme the current fare cap do not allow for the inclusion of closed school service at the moment that be for logistic reason understand in the statement on bus service on monday ask the secretary of state about extend concessionary travel to child and young people her response be to suggest that mps should talk to our individual local authority about this but that be not the approach that we take to concessionary travel for pensioner have just be contact by somebody age over who can not afford to go to college because it would cost year and her family just can not afford that be it not the case that concessionary bus travel for child and young people should be extend on national basis rather than have this postcode lottery as former schoolteacher know how important get child to education be and those bus service provide vital line that be why we have put billion into our bus service network suggest that local service such as mine in the bee network in greater manchester have use their resource to improve access to education for young people rural community in town and village such as holwell in my constituency which visit last week often depend on bus for their day to day life and for get their child to school but all too often the reliability of these service make it increasingly hard for family to depend on they what new power and funding will this government be give transport authority such as hertfordshire and central bedfordshire to ensure that they can get bus for my community back on track like our rail user bus user depend on punctuality our bus service have not be up to scratch with vast underfunding over the past few year we be hop that the million investment in our bus will give local community the power they need to hold operator to account on the punctuality of those bus so that our young people can get to their college and school on time transport infrastructure what step she be

impact on the uk will be but we do know that the prime minister rush to further cut in our emission be yet another example of politician put short term publicity above long term planning when will he publish the plan to achieve this new target where this government do the right thing we will back they but where they put politic before people and where they put press release before practicality we

reference to other issue that raise in my meeting those issue be raise consistently with the chinese by all member of this government and to be fair they be raise by member of the previous government when they be in office again there be lot of common ground on cop we use the meeting to push forward on the target it be shame that what use to be cross party issue not so many year when cop be in scotland there be real unity across the house about the importance of tackle one of the most central issue of our time the fact that the leader of the opposition be now take the position of attack the very idea of set target show just how far the conservative party have fall on this issue be proud that under some of her predecessor we have that unity it be shame that have now be lose because of the position adopt by the opposition the right hon lady reference my being at in rio when the farmer be protest be an opportunity for the lead economy of the world to get together and discuss question of common issue on the economy and security if her implication be that the uk should not be there at leader level that we should join putin in avoid that meeting and that be the position of her party

the prime minister for his statement welcome his commitment at baku to the new emission target we support those target when will he set out an action plan to meet they many family across the country will be worried not just about climate change but about an increasingly insecure world the devastating conflict in the middle east the action of china not least with the continue imprisonment of jimmy lai the war in sudan of which be alarmed to see no mention in the declaration and on our own continent where putin force continue to wage their illegal and outrageous war against the innocent people of ukraine on the middle east we welcome the reiteration of the commitment to the two state solution and the call for ceasefire in gaza and lebanon but with the united states once again veto un resolution for ceasefire in gaza do the prime minister agree that now be the moment for the uk to recognise the independent state of palestine on ukraine we welcome the new approval on long range missile we must give our ukrainian ally whatever they need to win this war the reality be that that support should have be give soon why have it take the threat of second trump presidency for there to

government five mission on sudan he rightly raise an important issue which do raise at the on gaza we support the un security council resolution as reference in my word early we have long stand policy on recognise palestine as part of the process two state solution be the only way for political solution to this awful and ongoing conflict on ukraine careful decision be make co ordinate and collaborate with our key ally on russian asset action be be take that be already be do in number of forum as think the right hon gentleman know congratulate the prime minister on the restoration of uk leadership lord prescott who do so much to lead on kyoto would be truly proud of my right hon friend work and that of his cabinet be very proud to lead the uk inter parliamentary union delegation to baku this weekend where we hear loud and clear report from finance expert who say that we need trillion year in climate finance between now and the uk have lead from the front but the reality be that we can not hit that target without build big world bank we could lead that charge by recycle some of the billion we get back from the european investment bank be that an initiative the prime minister could look into thank my right hon friend for his question on uk leadership we be back lead on the stage the sentiment among other leader be that they be glad to see the uk back lead on these issue their word to be that they feel there have be an absence under the previous government on finance this be really important there be number of way we should and can leverage private money to meet very important challenge whether the global climate challenge or other challenge we take step at cop to set out how those mechanism could be improve strongly welcome the decision to allow ukraine to strike against target in russia from which missile drone and glide bomb be launch in discuss how good to support ukraine will the prime minister say what progress be make in assist ukraine own military industrial sector to allow it to develop its own technology and to reduce its reliance on the west thank the right hon gentleman for raise that issue because think it be very important that that work go on we be make our own contribution to that will not go into the detail here as he will understand but can make sure that he have meeting should he wish one to give some of the detail of that in the prime minister statement he refer to the billion investment for wind turbine in hull how do he envision that will benefit and improve life and opportunity for my constituent in great grimsby and cleethorpes be very pleased to announce the work in hull with about well pay job there make the blade for wind turbine it be not that many year ago that go to the whitelee wind farm just outside glasgow there be or so wind turbine up there ask how many be build in britain and the answer be none not single component not only be this announcement very good for hull with well pay secure job but it be very good for the united kingdom that we be begin to make the component for wind turbine return the prime minister to his meeting with president xi he may recall that at the time president xi put four red line one of which be about democracy and human right which he say he would allow no challenge have be in contact with many hong kong refugee here who flee hong kong and they be worried about the prime minister failure to condemn the arrest of the and to call for their release and that of jimmy lai do not believe the prime minister really answer the question properly so will give he another opportunity can he now get to the dispatch box he can forget that another minister who might have say it and say right now that he as prime minister condemn the chinese government for their arrest and incarceration of the peaceful democracy campaigner and call for they to release the campaigner and jimmy lai immediately because they be in breach of the sino british agreement be happy to affirm and confirm all of that do raise those say condemn it moment ago and be happy to say so interruption just do and will say it again these be serious issue that the right hon member have consistently raise and recognise that and we have discuss the matter between ourselves on previous occasion it be important that where we have these significant difference particularly on issue of human right we have frank open discussion about they that be why these matter have be raise repeatedly and myself raise they in the meeting have early this week and will continue to do so be happy to be clear about that condemnation and to repeat that for he know the prime minister share my disappointment at the weakness of the statement on ukraine compare with the statement when he meet president xi do he raise china support of russia in the war in ukraine and ask he to step back and join we in try to end the war in ukraine on fair term for the ukrainians yes do raise the position of china stance in relation to the conflict and there be clear read out of the meeting it be not the first time that have be raise by this government or in fairness by the previous one not all member of the at the summit be as concerned about the russian invasion of ukraine as the uk be ahead of the summit it be say that the prime minister would talk about the unfathomable consequence if putin succeed do the prime minister talk to some of those sceptical leader about those consequence if so what do they say yes of course do russia be member of the putin be not there the conservative party seem to be suggest that we should not have be there either which find very odd implication but yes it be really important to take every opportunity at these sort of meeting to have the discussion that we need to have at leader level not only with our close ally but with those who do not agree with we so that we can raise those concern and try to find way forward which be what we do mr speaker may associate myself with your remark the prime minister remark and the remark of other about the late lord prescott he really be one off and will never forget his kindness and support of on the substantive issue of the statement wish to congratulate the prime minister and colleague on last night security council vote to try to get israel to provide humanitarian access to gaza but on its own the vote will not stop the israeli government destruction of palestinian life and home the inaction that we see from the previous government over the past year mean that there be an even great pressure on this government to act quickly give that israeli government ministers be knowingly ignore international law and order preparation for the annexation of illegal settlement to start in january will the prime minister impose sanction on they and the organisation that fund they be grateful to my hon friend for raise the important issue of the west bank and settlement it be major and escalating cause of concern and have be for some time certainly sanction have be impose in the past and will continue to be impose welcome the prime minister statement condemn china action but can he make commitment here now and completely clearly that before any minister meet any chinese official they will meet with the family of jimmy lai or indeed any of the other many hongkonger who be here and whose family have now be detain we know we can brief the prime minister on this that there be hongkonger who be threaten by the chinese state here in the uk today and it be his job to defend the people of this country not to bow to the people in beijing defend the people of this country be what we do every day raise these important issue be the right way to do it be very clear about what raise and that be matter of public record as the right hon member will well know in the past few day the labour government have reaffirm our commitment to ukraine in its existential war against russian aggression reaffirm our commitment to combat climate change in all our interest and reaffirm our commitment to back the un resolution for ceasefire in gaza and the release of all hostage do the prime minister agree that at time of global volatility geopolitical uncertainty and rise authoritarianism it be more important than ever that britain and britain value be back in action on the global stage do agree with that it be clear that we live in more volatile time now than think many of we can remember these be issue of global concern whether that be climate change or conflict and they have direct impact on the united kingdom so it be in our national interest to show the leadership that we have be show on these issue that leadership be sadly miss under the previous government mr speaker may associate myself and my colleague with your remark and the remark of hon member on the passing of john prescott john be deeply principled man clearly drive by desire to improve people life our thought be with his wife pauline and his family the investment that we have see in renewable particularly in scotland not only be essential in tackle the climate crisis but have the potential to enable people to live in warm home with low bill however the totally outdated set up of the uk energy market where electricity price be tie to global gas price mean that people be not feel the benefit of the roll out of cheap renewable energy source as temperature drop below freezing and million of pensioner struggle without the winter fuel payment will the prime minister now commit to domestic energy price reform this be really important point and be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise it we be power forward to clean power by which will not just achieve independence particularly to stop putin put his boot on our throat with energy bill everybody have suffer because of that but will also bring down price mean cheap bill which be really important to the hon gentleman point at the beginning of his question it will deliver the next generation of well pay secure job across the united kingdom include in scotland couple of year ago my constituent be hit hard by rocket gas price and energy bill because the last government leave the uk hook on global gas market control by dictator such as vladimir putin follow the cop summit can the prime minister reassure my constituent in north warwickshire and bedworth that he will work relentlessly to ensure that nothing like that ever happen again yes can it be an important point all country be impact by the conflict in ukraine we be impact more than other country because some of the step that could have be take in the move towards renewable be not take at speed by the previous government and people across the country pay the price give the prime minister unequivocal backing of ukraine and his admirable assertion that putin must be see to fail will he rule out replace if she have to be replace our professional diplomatic ambassador in washington with party politician who have state that ukraine must lose the occupy territory to russia give up on become member of nato and rely instead on security guarantee from european state thank the right hon gentleman for the joint position in relation to the importance of ukraine will resist the temptation that he offer for to start discuss the position that he reference echo your remark mr speaker and those of the prime minister about lord prescott he be true embodiment of working class value and aspiration as he always use to say nothing be too good for the worker this weekend will join rochdale ukrainian community to commemorate the anniversary of the holodomor stalin man make famine against the ukrainian people which result in the loss of up to million life do the prime minister agree that the russians will never crush the spirit of the ukrainian people and that we will do everything possible to aid they in their defence against russian aggression yes agree be strike during the general election campaign as think member of all party will have be wherever they campaign across the country that support for ukraine be there in every quarter of the united kingdom be very proud of the fact that that be the position across our country be strike that the prime minister statement contain not single reference in to our most important security and trading partner the united states particularly at this time of change with the good news of the election of president trump while the prime minister be at the cop summit he may have miss the fact that growth be fall in this country debt be rise and the motor industry be panic as job be be destroy just yesterday nissan announce further job cut as have ford because of electric vehicle target which be cause irreversible damage to our motor industry what be the question do not think that there be question we have stabilise the economy and we have an absolute mission on growth there be no growth for year the hon gentleman party be cheer along the mini budget not so long ago which be the major cause of many of the problem that we be face today may offer my condolence to lord prescott family he be true pioneer and an inspiring role model and he will be remember here and in every place that benefit from his leadership and support for community and neighbourhood last month meet my constituent sebastien lai we talk about my constituent jimmy lai the british citizen who have be arbitrarily detain share my heartfelt thank and the thank of my constituent family to the prime minister for raise his case at the will he share his expectation as result of the conversation raise it personally myself because it be such an important case and it be very important that we continue to do so it be raise by government ministers every time we engage with china it be such an important case this house know the detail which be why take the opportunity in the meeting have early this week to raise it directly with the president everyone in the house welcome high ambition for our country but give the complexity of deliver against the ambitious target that the prime minister set out there will be apprehensiveness about other country go down the track at different pace which will have implication for our economy may draw his attention to the excellent comment make by his chancellor about the financial service industry last

leadership he have restore our place on the world stage climate change be the big threat face we all that use to be an uncontroversial statement which be why be stunned to hear the leader of the opposition describe the action we have take to deal with that problem as be do for short term publicity that be absolutely outrageous be the prime minister as delighted as be that the climate sceptic of the conservative party be now sit on the opposition benches so that we can take the long term decision from the government benches it be great shame that the conservative party have decide to go backwards on that important challenge not so many year ago there be united position across the house because it be such an important challenge think that be simply sign of how far the conservatives have fall it be unsurprise that they be on the opposition benches may they remain there for very long time welcome the commitment that the prime minister share with prime minister modi in their discussion the prime minister set out in his statement the position on reignite the free trade talk that begin under the previous government do he set out any red line on that free trade agreement and have timetable be agree the previous prime minister promise free trade agreement by diwali will this prime minister set different timescale think the hon gentleman will find that the previous

would restart early in the next year of course there be check and balance and discussion to be have on that but be pleased that we have raise that ambition that engagement be constructive and in the good interest of our country may associate myself with the prime minister comment about the late lord john prescott he be giant of this place and of the labour movement my condolence go to his family

insecurity which be sometimes not talk about be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue raise food security at the summit early this week my hon friend also refer to flood for anybody who be sceptical about cop there be very powerful set of intervention by the spanish prime minister about the impact that climate have have recently with the terrible flooding in spain that be material reminder of why we must never let up and why we should not be divide on the important issue of climate change breakthrough moment at the previous cop be the creation of the loss and damage fund but the financial contribution from each individual country be miserable include that of the uk support community and climate vulnerable country be in all our interest because it prevent large scale migration when land become uninhabitable will the prime minister commit to an increase financial contribution to the loss and damage fund be not go to set out financial contribution here the focus that we bring to cop be on the future action and resilience planning that be need and be absolutely determined to work with partner to make the transition for example to clean energy across so many other country associate myself with the remark from mr speaker and the prime minister about john prescott although do not know he personally it be fair to say that he be clearly phenomenon the prime minister will be fully aware of the importance of the investment of jaguar land rover and tata group here in the united kingdom and to my constituency of warwick and leamington will he give his assessment of uk india relation follow his bilateral meeting with prime minister modi relation with india after the discussion early this week be in constructive and positive place which be good for my hon friend constituent and for the country as he will know and expect have separately discuss issue with the tata group in relation to its investment into this country obviously president lula global alliance against hunger and poverty be to be welcome but such initiative become mere platitude if they be not back up by action and resource in practical term what be the uk commitment to this initiative it be an important initiative we back it early this week and we will support the action that come out of it make that clear in my contribution the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that these initiative need to be back up by action to carry they forward and we will make sure that they be add my voice to the tribute pay to lord prescott thank the prime minister for his update on what be his priority for the uk international climate leadership in the run up to in brazil do he discuss that with president lula in their bilateral discussion yes do because cop next year will be very significant and important as think everybody recognise what be need more than anything be for other country to follow the lead of this country in relation to their emission target and discuss that directly with he add my condolence to john prescott family on their loss also thank john for his life and in particular for the joy of campaign with he where he be much love during the and election the prime minister be right to say that refugee flow be cause in part by climate change but they be also cause by war what do the summit say about the war in sudan and congo as well as the need for ceasefire in gaza while russia invasion of ukraine be obviously wrong what pathway do he see to bring about cessation of that conflict rather than put in long range missile which can only exacerbate the conflict with russia and lead we to very dangerous place indeed be there pathway to an end to that war that he or anyone else in the see during their meeting do raise both climate and conflict as major driver of migration across the world which be why they need to be address at the international level in relation to ukraine be very clear that russia be in breach of the un charter this be russian aggression against sovereign country in europe the sort of aggression do not think would see again in my lifetime and we must ensure that putin do not win this war that be why have be so clear in stand with ukraine for as long as it take and provide it with whatever resource it need thank the prime minister for his statement and for his display of unity with the french president emmanuel macron on armistice day we have go from tory prime ministers who question whether france be even an ally and who leave normandy early to labour prime minister who stand shoulder to shoulder with our french and european ally do the prime minister agree that strong alliance with our european neighbour be crucial to our peace and security yes do to attend the armistice day in france be special and be sorry be say that it be very special and moving occasion on which we remember all those who lose their life for our freedom be not sure why the right hon member for basildon and billericay mr holden want to chunter through that we be able to collectively reflect on all those who lose their life not only in the first world war but in every conflict since we should never lose sight of the fact that many of those whom we lose be bury in france and it be very special moment to be there john prescott be remarkable climate diplomat and funny move and strangely mesmerise speaker but he be also aware that while ambitious climate target be necessary climate action be essential on that point understand that the hydrogen allocation round agreement be ready to go can the prime minister commit to get those agreement issue to company so that we can get the hydrogen economy go before christmas together with the job that go with it want this initiative to proceed at pace it be really important initiative there be no silver bullet here we need to work across all area to reach the goal of clean power by and we will continue to do so at pace echo the remark of the prime minister and other about john prescott rarely have there be well example of the fact that work people be mean to govern and hope that john know what great example he be to so many of we on the labour benches and across this house it be clear that we must take far large role in international affair that be not optional at this time but that role must translate into great prosperity at home can the prime minister expand on how the conversation he have at the and cop will bring more job and investment to community such as mine in gateshead agree with my hon friend that international affair be probably more important now than they have be for number of year because of the volatility but they be also great opportunity because the next generation of job be there there be race on for those job particularly in renewable and want the uk to be not just in that race but win it that be why in every international engagement that have have have press the case for the uk and be very pleased with the investment that be now come into our country an example give be the investment in hull which announce at cop but at our investment summit few week ago billion of investment in this country which will be measure in good well pay job be forthcoming that be good for our country give the prime minister optimism on his return from can he tell the house how the deal that he sign there will uphold his promise to cut energy bill by for constituent such as mine and when can they expect to see that promise become reality yes the direct investment in job in hull to build turbine be obviously really important for that constituency and for the country and will continue to make the case for those deal to be do with those job to come so that we can drive forward to clean power that will have the effect of protect energy security but also of lower energy bill last week have the privilege of meet some member of the ukrainian parliament and know that they will have be hearten by the leadership that my right hon and learn friend the prime minister have show on the world stage this week do the prime minister agree that there be only one aggressor in this conflict and that the way to end the war be in his own word for putin to get out of ukraine yes do think we must never lose sight of the fact that this war could be end today if the aggressor cease be aggressive if russia back out and back down there be no equivalence here sovereign country have be invade and that be why across this house we have stand with ukraine for as long as it take and will continue to do so be proud that the liberal democrats be the first uk wide major party to call for an immediate bilateral ceasefire between israel and gaza and we continue to push the prime minister to honour that position be also proud that many eastbourne campaigner have be call for that from the get go and have come out to condemn the rise tide of islamophobia and antisemitism across the country what global effort to stem this tide of prejudice do the prime minister discuss with leader and will he congratulate muslim and jewish leader in eastbourne as well as incredible neighbourhood police officer such as fareed kamar you know he too madam deputy speaker for unite to root out hate crime locally be very happy to applaud anybody who be take on the fight against hate crime in all its form think one of the sad feature of the last few year have be the rise in hate crime in all its form think all of we have responsibility duty to do everything we can to reduce hate crime so be very happy to applaud anybody involve in that include in the hon member constituency associate myself with the tribute to lord prescott and send my condolence to his family very warmly welcome the prime minister statement particularly on cop as member across this house have acknowledge it be great to see the uk show international leadership on action to combat climate change once more give this government mission to make britain clean energy superpower can the prime minister tell we how great british energy will result in low fuel bill for my resident in dartford ebbsfleet swanscombe and greenhithe as well as for those across the country yes great british energy which will be publicly own will drive forward on renewable towards clean power in we have to make up time because of the slowness of the conservative party but we be determined to do so this will be measure in energy independence so that putin boot will not be on our throat as it be in recent year in the job of the future and in lower energy bill we know that one thing the prime minister be discuss with president xi in august be the planning application for the chinese embassy he say to the president you raise the chinese embassy building when we speak on the telephone and we have since take action by call in that application what discussion do downing street have with the department about that call in prior to the deputy prime minister formal decision to call in the chinese embassy planning application the right hon member will know very well that the application have be in for number of year it be something the previous government be look at and it be be deal with through the usual process may associate myself with the expression of condolence to lord prescott family and friend give that this be uk parliament week do the prime minister agree that his statement should reassure young people who need hope that global issue be tackle and that his and ministers effort at international forum such as and the be vital do he far agree that it be this government who be renew and strengthen our alliance and demonstrate that great international co operation can defend our value and leave well world for our child thank my hon friend for his question think we all need to remind ourselves that it be young people more than any who will live with the consequence of our action or inaction and that be why be very pleased that the uk be lead again on these important global issue among other leader of the the absence of uk leadership in recent year under the previous government be keenly feel note the prime minister comment on cop he will know of course that the agricultural industry be one of the most difficult area to decarbonise that will require substantial investment will his family farm tax help or hinder that be very pleased that at the budget we put billion over the next two year into farming and food sustainability which be hugely important to support our farmer the hon gentleman will no doubt have notice the money allocate to deal with flooding constant cause of problem for farmer and the money put into deal with the outbreak of disease which be devastating for so many farmer he will also know that in an average case of parent want to pass on farm to one of their child by the time the various assessment be make it be only those value above million that will be affect by this despite the fear monger from opposition members that mean that the vast majority of farm and farmer will be totally unaffected as know the hon gentleman appreciate may associate myself with the prime minister remark about the late lord prescott now that the prime minister have meet the chinese president do he believe that we be in well position to advance uk interest and to challenge china on important issue such as human right than we be in the last six year in which no uk prime minister could even have those conversation because they do not go to china that be an important point this be about get the balance right that be why take pragmatic approach in the interest of this country in order to further our interest and decide to have frank discussion where they be necessary believe it be well that we meet and engage than that we be absent from the international stage the prime minister focus on fight climate change on the international stage be welcome change from the conspiracy theory and equivocation we have under the last government one of the simple way to generate clean power in the uk be through solar panel so will his government take an interest in my private member bill the sunshine bill the new homes solar generation bill which would mandate solar photovoltaic generation on all new build home when it come to the commons on january have have lot of document put in my box over the last few week and will make sure that the hon gentleman sunshine bill be in there so that be able to give he well answer next time echo the very warm tribute to lord prescott from across the house one of the warm tribute to he from outside this house be by former vice president al gore who describe he as an unwavering champion of climate action the government global clean power alliance build on that legacy unite country to accelerate the transition to clean energy but will the prime minister set out how this alliance and action will deliver low bill for my constituent and deliver uk energy security in the future yes this alliance will push forward the uk drive and that of other country towards renewable that will have an impact on the constituent of everybody in this house because it will give energy independence low bill and of course the next generation of job which will go elsewhere if we do not win these contract in government my party champion north sea oil and gas secure job not just in scotland but right across this country in every constituency include mine rural dumfries and galloway the prime minister talk about we have putin boot on our throat but surely pull the plug on the north sea oil and gas industry as he be do deliver we into the hand of putin and make our energy security less viable as the hon gentleman know very well north sea oil and gas be sell on the international market and therefore be subject to constraint the proof be there over the last few year we have have terribly high energy bill it be bad in this country than in other the suggestion that somehow the last government insulate we from the impact feel by other country be ludicrous against the evidence today the united nations have say that virtually no aid have get into gaza for the past day this winter hundred of thousand of people face malnutrition or bad can the prime minister give an update on conversation he have at the that could help we end this conflict release the hostage and finally get aid back into gaza repeatedly press that matter not only at the but elsewhere that aid into gaza be desperately and urgently need and in much great volume than be currently make their way through have argue consistently for the release of the hostage that have to be the starting point for that aid to get into gaza and for all of we to work for long term solution here it have to be peaceful way to the two state solution thank the prime minister for his statement like the rest of the house agree that we must be lead voice on the global stage however would like to ask the prime minister why it be necessary to travel with official to the notwithstanding the carbon footprint there be the cost to the public purse especially as will have lot of cold pensioner this winter the contingent this year be actually few than the contingent last year it involve wide number of individual because lot of negotiation as the hon member probably well know go on at cop and it be vital that we be there do that important work what be clear throughout the prime minister statement be the need for defence collaboration across the world as we live in much more unstable global situation in his discussion with the australian leadership be he able to recommit the uk to aukus can he give we an update on the next step please be able to discuss aukus with the australian prime minister in the as have do on previous occasion when have talk with he include our full commitment and press on to the next stage on behalf of the democratic unionist party may send our sincere sympathy to the family of john prescott on his passing he be indeed mighty man he will be miss but the one thing he have leave behind be legacy and think we can all recognise that the prime minister will be aware that for these summit to be effective there must be global buy in to see world leader such as france among those determine that it be not good use of time pose question if new format be need what discussion have the prime minister have with other nation to ensure that meet environmental obligation be not something to be avoid but instead be something to get excited about be grateful for the hon gentleman comment on john prescott and his legacy be so pleased to build on that legacy both on climate which john feel passionately about and with the job we have be able to announce go to hull buy in be really important issue it be why we need to show leadership because we can not do it on our own no country can with the uk show leadership we can get the buy in of other country in whatever form and in whatever way we can that be why work so hard at cop on this issue which be raise again at the it be why be very supportive of the initiative for private finance to be leverage in to help other country meet the obligation they will have to meet be pleased to note that the prime minister have good discussion with prime minister modi and deepen our bilateral tie and unique bond can he assure that my constituent jagtar singh johal seven year arbitrary detention be raise with modi in those discussion to help bring he home to dumbarton thank my hon friend for raise that matter and let give he that reassurance that it be raise it be an extremely important case so it be raise by and it have be raise by other ministers as he would expect business of the house the business for the week commence november will include monday november second reading of the non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill tuesday november second reading of the tobacco and vapes bill wednesday november second reading of the finance bill thursday november debate on motion on the international status of taiwan follow by debate on motion on freedom of religion in pakistan the subject for these debate be determine by the backbench business committee friday november private member bills the provisional business for the week commence december include monday december general debate on the grenfell tower inquiry phase report tuesday december second reading of the national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill wednesday december opposition day allotted day debate on motion in the name of the official opposition subject to be announce thursday december business to be determine by the backbench business committee friday december private member bills associate hon member on the opposition side of the house with the comment make about lord prescott death be delighted to hear that the house administration be aim to win the national autistic society autism friendly award know that all colleague will want to join in wish the house team good luck with that in last week episode of this long run saga draw attention to the government incompetence in have budget that manage to raise the rate of national insurance low the ni threshold and increase the minimum wage all at the same time describe that as terrible blow to the retail and hospitality sector and ask if the treasury would publish an assessment of the total effect of those measure before they come to the house well need hardly have bother because barely five day later what do we find letter from tesco marks and spencer sainsbury all the major supermarket and many of the big name in the retail industry highlight the budget impact in force shop closure and job loss the sad truth be that there be nothing surprising here it be completely obvious to everyone except the government that this unplanned triple whammy be likely to have this effect ask the leader of the house again will we see an analysis of its effect when the finance bill come to the house next week or alongside the forthcoming national insurance contributions secondary class contributions bill otherwise think we should turn our attention to energy the government have proclaim their intention to make britain clean energy producer by couple of week ago the new national energy system operator publish report on how that might be do must say that be feel degree of embarrassment as have be under the impression that the secretary of state for energy security and net zero be slightly clownish figure unable to eat bacon sandwich without cause an international incident and with political style closely model on wallace and gromit but actually be quite wrong in fact like the chancellor of the exchequer the secretary of state may need to update his cv now realise that he be heroic figure the titan of transition in fact will go far the energy secretary be modern clark kent whose slightly bumbling comedic exterior be merely disguise conceal range of astonishing superpower think of what he will have to achieve if the uk be as he promise to have entirely carbon free energy in just over five year time he will have to build twice as many pylon and cable in those five year as we have build in the last he will have to get all the transmission infrastructure build on time and reshape the planning rule or the taxpayer will be force to pay for wind turbine that stand idle like the greek god aeolus this great baron of breeze will need to ensure that the wind blow and contract as much offshore wind capacity in the next two year as in the last six combine he will also need to ensure that the global price of carbon double or triple just to make the sum add up that be before one consider the effect of unexpected inflation skill shortage dependency on foreign energy technology and intermittency of supply what could possibly go wrong meanwhile the energy secretary plan for small modular reactor have be delay while he plunge ahead with his plan to cut off gas turbine and leave we dangerously reliant on expensive foreign energy import those plan be not simply heroic they be fanciful they be magical thinking what be bad they be likely to be ruinously expensive both for the taxpayer and for the electricity user it be little wonder that top business and union leader have come together to describe they as just not feasible and impossible we have be here before with the three day week of the and the result be blackout and energy rationing should we expect that again this be the rub power reveal we be see not merely lack of competence but an energy secretary who have still not make any statement on the neso report that mention he be deliberately refuse to account for his action to this house on this foundational matter and he be hold the commons in contempt when can we expect statement from the energy secretary on the neso report when will he be force to come to the dispatch box to explain and defend this folly first of all join mr speaker and other in mark the sad loss of john prescott he be true legend and one of the good campaigner of our movement he put climate change and real meaningful levelling up at the top of the political agenda long before they be fashionable he be groundbreake and huge fun and he will be greatly miss we send our condolence to pauline and the whole family as mr speaker say there will be an opportunity for tribute next week be sure the whole house will also join in mark parliament week when we open our door on how we work in this place today be ask she to stand day when we encourage more woman to seek elect office let take this opportunity to point the house to motion that have table today which make some important change to proxy vote for member one of my priority as leader of the house be to make parliament more family friendly we have more woman than ever in this place and more parent of small child those with caring responsibility and disabled member we need to change the way that we do thing to reflect the time have ask the procedure committee to continue its wide review of the proxy vote system and the modernisation committee will consider these issue in due course however have hear from member that the current system have not meet some immediate need so be extend the childbirth miscarriage or baby loss proxy provision to explicitly cover complication during pregnancy or ongoing fertility treatment under this scheme reason for proxy remain confidential and be self certify require no onerous paperwork be make the default for all proxy seven month and hope the whole house will welcome that the right hon member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman raise number of issue but must say be lose track of the opposition argument they attack our budget measure yet they support all the investment they do not like our decision yet they take many of the same one in government they duck the difficult issue yet criticise we for deal with they yes we have have to make some big choice but we stand by they because we be on the side of ordinary people the nhs and public service we be operate in the interest of economic stability unlike his party we will see the impact of the budget over time but the conservative really must decide whether they support the investment and the extra spending on our public service or whether they do not want any of it and be against that support the right hon gentleman pick on the secretary of state for energy security and net zero but there be not more accomplished member of the cabinet he be drive forward his agenda he be forthcoming to this house on many occasion and every time he appear in this house he wipe the floor with his opponent yet again the conservatives be on the wrong side of history we have very ambitious mission to become clean energy superpower by one that we be drive forward it be vital that we do that that mean take on some of the inherent issue that they duck our infrastructure the grid our planning law get the investment where it be need which we be announce that all the time unlock new power supply in nuclear solar hydrogen and elsewhere and establish great british energy which be well under way to ensure much need homegrown production take together those measure will lower bill create job and give we the energy security that the right hon gentleman government fail to give we be not the truth that opposition members be become political opportunist they spend year in government duck the difficult decision leave huge black hole and big mess for we to clean up public service be on their knee strike action be cost billion in lose productivity pay deal be on ministers desk with not penny account for and not single penny be set aside for the compensation scheme the reserve be spend three time over and on their watch inflation be at living standard fall for the first time in our history under the conservatives now they want to have their cake and eat it at the same time they want all the benefit from the budget but not the hard call need to pay for they in few short week they have go from the party of government to the party of protest my right hon friend have illustrate great many aspect of the mess that this government have inherit from the last include long waiting list our crumble school and our fail economy and nowhere be that mess more visible than on the in warwickshire between coventry and stratford which adjoin my constituency last month tonne of rubbish be collect from the roadside because no clearing up have be do for many year yet another example of the mess that be leave behind may we have debate in government time not just on pothole but on the state of our road and the mess that the last government leave they in what well symbol could there be of the mess we have inherit than all that mess leave on the in my hon friend constituency we be committed to tackle the plague of fly tipping and the vandal who be create mess in our community and that be one of the reason why we be crack down on antisocial behaviour and introduce respect order so that those responsible can clean up their own mess call the liberal democrat spokesperson too would like to pay my respect to lord prescott although we do not serve in this place at the same time it be impossible to have follow british politic over the past few decade without acknowledge his enormous influence also wish to extend my condolence to his family and friend be pleased to note the constructive approach take in the other place in relation to rail passenger service include commitment secure by liberal democrats to make the delivery of improvement and the maintaining of high standard of improvement crucial part of the government agenda early this week receive an email from essex herts air ambulance register charity that provide helicopter emergency medical service for the critically ill and injure of essex hertfordshire and surround area in the last financial year alone its member attend mission it cost more than million every month to keep the service operational and to cover all charitable cost that would not be possible without the good will of people in essex and hertfordshire but the recent change to employer national insurance contribution will cost the charity an additional year will the leader of the house grant debate in government time on how the impact of the rise in employer nic can be mitigate specifically for the charitable sector recognise the vital sometimes lifesave role that it play in all our community thank the hon lady for her kind word about john prescott also thank she and her party for support the final stage of the rail franchising bill the passenger railway services public ownership bill complete all its stage in both houses the other evening which mean that it will be one of the first bills to become an act under

severe that member of the family be slap with sanction by both the united kingdom and the united states it be clear to that the activity of the guptas be of significant national and international public interest because of their position on those sanction list lasslett also uncover document that seem to show that the proposal document for the development be substantially plagiarise raise concern about both the integrity of the project and the procurement check perform by the uzbek government in country that be widely criticise by reputable news outlet and civil society for widespread corruption this story speak directly to the challenge that the uzbek people face in hold their elect official to account importantly the company tie to the gupta family raise question about the provenance of the huge sum of money use to fund the project the finding may point to attempt by the guptas through their associate to integrate their ill get wealth into the uzbek economy the public interest merit of the investigation be in my view undeniable but the story be never publish the information that it contain link potential procurement corruption to the looting of billion of dollar from south africa state coffer be effectively block the uzbek people be deprive of information that speak directly to their government propriety in the award of enormous contract the story be silence in way that follow pattern that be sure be all too familiar to member present lasslett receive legal letter from boutique law firm on behalf of the developer the lawyer letter provide some meaningful factual information but try to obfuscate important issue and outright deny any relationship business or otherwise between the developer and the gupta family despite clear evidence to the contrary now opendemocracy routinely face legal threat but follow the correspondence decision be make that the benefit of publish the story would be outweigh by the time and financial expense of face down deep pocket litigant the medium outlet decide against run the story despite believe in its credibility and appreciate the public interest in ask question about country mire in decade of corruption allegation at the high level when even highly respected academic with extensive expertise and reputable news outlet decide to censor themselves follow legal intimidation we can only wonder what other case of egregious misconduct have be uncover only then to remain hidden but we need not wonder for too long occasionally public interest story threaten with legal action have still find their way into the public domain for instance the investigation into the tax arrangement of the former chancellor nadhim zahawi which later partly contribute to his dismissal dan neidle tax lawyer researcher and commentator have be investigate the then chancellor financial tie to the data firm yougov there be concern about whether zahawi be benefit from tax code that he have have hand in shaping in lengthy and detailed thread on twitter set out his evidence neidle allege that zahawi have avoid almost million of capital gain tax in response zahawi lawyer send neidle two letter which not only ask he to retract his accusation by the end of the day but suggest that it would be serious matter if he publish the legal letter neidle do not submit to those threat instead he set out his research finding and the conclusion that he draw in more detail moreover believe that the assertion of confidentiality be false and that the letter be rather an attempt to intimidate he neidle choose to publish the letter and draw the public attention to the use of legal threat to silence research after he go public neidle report hear from many other who have be intimidate in similar way he state silence be integral to the slapp strategy small time blogger say something you do like you get your lawyer to write they letter warn they off the blogger delete their blog and nobody have any idea what happen it be not just the odd former politician who use legal threat to avoid scrutiny sadly britain have become go to destination for lawfare tactic our court have become the playground of the super wealthy the uk be by far the most frequent country of origin for slapp accord to the uk anti slapp coalition around of lawfare case originate from here we be almost as frequent source as the european union and the united states put together london be an international hotspot with lawfare tourist travel from far and wide to get in on the action aside from the powerful individual and entity directly benefit from the protection afford by such threat send legal letter be also lucrative business for the lawyer who write they the legal professional who knowingly engage in this abuse of the legal process be the product of culture in which client choice be base on profit over professional ethic the solicitors regulation authority which be task with hold the profession to high standard be not equip with the right tool to hold lawyer to account of the slapp report to the sra over the past two year case be close with no further action and of the remain live only two be ever refer to disciplinary tribunal what be more the financial penalty at the regulator disposal fail to match the deep pocket of the individual and law firm that engage in these tactic the sra have paltry fin power of just for traditional law firm which pal in comparison with the firm resource in effect the fine be likely price in by the offend law firm at present we simply do not have proper deterrent or the ability to impose real financial penalty on the lawyer and firm that knowingly engage in legal intimidation our legal framework also fail the minority of lawfare case that eventually make it to the court mean that those legal case can not be throw out by judge at an early stage welcome the measure enact by the recent economic crime and corporate transparency act that ensure that case of legal intimidation that relate to economic crime can be tackle however as we have hear in past debate in both houses those measure do not go far enough we urgently need to update our legal framework to ensure that all slapp case that reach the court can be throw out at an early stage if judge deem it appropriate only then can we level the play field and ensure that those with deep pocket be fairly scrutinise just like everyone else pay tribute to the former hon member for caerphilly who bring forward private member bill that seek to fill this gap in our legal framework his bill be due to come back to the house when the general election be call so it sadly go no far we can re examine much of that bill as we seek to tackle the lawfare scandal engulf our country we urgently need to take seriously the risk that legal threat pose to the health of our public debate know the government will listen to the powerful story bring to light today and will seek to answer our concern about the inadequacy of our regulatory and legislative framework look forward to hear from the government exactly how we can challenge the scourge of lawfare once and for all we be surround by silent story it be high time they be hear thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton for obtain the debate which be on an important subject chair the all party parliamentary group on media freedom and be delighted to see the vice chair the hon member for kensington and bayswater joe powell attend the debate the uk have proud record of defend and promote media freedom in this country and across the world in the uk establish the global media freedom coalition which now have member during my time of involvement in the medium which go back quite long way always pay careful attention to the annual publication of the world press freedom index be pleased that the uk ranking have rise substantially in recent year we now stand at no still some way to go but nevertheless an improvement the reason we have improve be that lot of other country have get considerably bad so we have rise as result of their demotion the hon member for south dorset be right that the phenomenon of slapp have be blot on our record for considerable time chair the culture media and sport committee for year in we carry out an inquiry into press standard privacy and libel in particular we see the phenomenon of libel tourism which to some extent continue to this day we hear about for instance the case of dr rachel ehrenfeld us academic who have write the book funding evil how terrorism be finance and how to stop it the book appear in the united states it have no british edition twenty three copy be obtain in the united kingdom by order over the internet despite that saudi businessman name in the book take legal action against dr ehrenfeld in the uk court he be award considerable damage on the basis that dr ehrenfeld do not defend the action in court that she see as have no jurisdiction over the matter that lead to the introduction of the libel terrorism protection act by the new york state legislature which basically say that resident of new york do not have to abide by foreign court judgment in this particular area since that time the situation have much improve and of course the defamation act seek to address the specific issue of libel tourism and raise the bar for claimant in libel case nevertheless there have still be chilling effect we also hear from the author tom bower who be subject to legal action over very small reference to richard desmond in his book about conrad black mr desmond lose the action but be prepared to pay huge amount to bring it about certainly it be mr bower view that he do so to demonstrate that he be willing to spend large amount even on small and relatively minor accusation the result be that mr bower plan to write book about mr desmond do not proceed because the publisher be too afraid of potential legal action as the hon member for south dorset recognise further measure since the defamation act have be introduce primarily through the economic crime and corporate transparency act which focus specifically on the issue of slapp around economic crime or allegation when return to the position of minister responsible for the medium in my second incarnation we be nevertheless aware that it remain problem the department for culture media and sport have establish the national committee for the safety of journalists which hope be still in existence the committee be originally set up to look at the physical threat to journalist and attempt to intimidate they through harassment sometimes online but occasionally through physical aggression and lot of work be do on it we then agree that the issue of slapp represent an attempt to prevent media freedom and to close down legitimate public interest journalism so the committee extend its work to cover slapp remember that we hear from catherine belton the author of putin people and tom burgis who write kleptopia both of which reveal corruption in one case on the part of an ally of president putin in russia and in the other on the part of some individual in kazakhstan both be subject to legal action against they personally as well as against their publisher perhaps the most appalling example which be debate in this house at length be the discovery that yevgeny prigozhin the founder and leader of the wagner group have be allow to circumvent the sanction place on he to bring legal action against the director of bellingcat who have rightly identify he as the leader of the wagner group that be scandal and be glad to say that the decision be subsequently reverse again it be interesting that somebody as notorious as that have choose to bring an action in the uk the hon member for south dorset suggest that it be matter of shame that the uk be see as the centre for such action and share his concern to some extent it be also tribute to the strength and independence of the uk judicial system which be admire around the world the reason why so many people wish to pursue action in the uk court be normally that they have great confidence in uk court than those in many other place it be right that we should take action where the motivation behind those action be more to do with prevent legitimate inquiry as say the dcms national committee for the safety of journalists establish slapp taskforce in think that be in my third incarnation in government with responsibility for the medium the taskforce bring together departments such as dcms and the ministry of justice representative of campaign organisation such as reporter without borders and index on censorship and publisher and journalist include the news media association and the national union of journalists the taskforce be chair by janis makarewich hall the excellent dcms official its initial meeting be attend by the then secretary of state lucy frazer and attend as many meeting as could that lead to lot of work on try to understand the prevalence of slapp produce guidance for journalist examine the legal ethic and what more might be do both by the solicitors regulation authority and the bar standards board to ensure that law firm do not take on case for which there be no real justification other than an attempt to shut down journalism and raise awareness four meeting of that taskforce take place do not know whether it still exist but very much hope that it do would be interested to hear what work have continue under this government as lot be do under the last as the hon member for south dorset rightly recognise wayne david introduce bill that be prepare in government to tackle the issue of slapp and it be amend during its passage to strengthen it it reach the house of lords but it do not reach the statute book because of the general election lot of work have be do and hope that we can build on and learn from it the bureau of investigative journalism have send number of case as example of slapp the hon gentleman quote one of they do not want to use privilege to cite individual case but there be concern that it be happen in number of area and we need to address it through legislative change at the same time it be important to recognise that individual have right to defend themselves against untrue and unfounded accusation that be as much fundamental part of liberty as freedom of speech not all case claim to be slapp be slapp in my view particularly those in which the claimant have subsequently prove successful in the action that they have bring in the court that almost disprove the claim that it be slapp to begin with so we do need to be careful have also have correspondence from the society of media lawyers which suggest that there be lack of empirical evidence and that campaigner ignore exist legal and regulatory tool it also suggest that this be an area that the law commission should perhaps review but have concern that such review be way of push the matter into very long grass and would unnecessarily delay measure on which great deal of work have already be do rather than do that urge the government to consider the work do in dcms and the ministry of justice and in particular the debate that take place during the committee stage of wayne david private member bill and to introduce legislation to deal with the chilling of medium freedom in the uk which absolutely recognise be legitimate concern thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton for his passionate and eloquent speech and for secure the debate strategic lawsuit against public participation or slapp be essentially misuse of the legal system through threaten claim that be bring to stifle lawful scrutiny and publication they have be use to silence public participation by and suppress information from activist environmental campaigner non governmental organisation whistleblower victim of sexual assault and even people just post negative product review online the list of journalist who have face slapp simply for report in the public interest grow by the day of course receive slapp cause immense mental and financial concern and distress it be clear that most people target by slapp can not afford the legal cost of defend the claim against they without effective anti slapp legislation everyone in the uk remain at risk if they choose to speak out on matter of public interest that be why have an effective anti slapp regime in the uk be so important failure to have one essentially undermine democracy it be certainly welcome that the government be push for great transparency in public life through enhanced reporting update to the ministerial code and change to government contract award but focus solely on the public sector be not enough the consequence of focus only on the public sector could be chill at one end of the spectrum the public may be deny knowledge about issue of public interest and at the other end the exposure of corruption and other form of wrongdoing in many area will be limit that would continue to leave the most powerful with the ability to manipulate the legal system to conceal wrongdoing across the uk agree with what other have say about the need for anti slapp law to balance access to justice for those who have right to defend themselves but in reality slapp victim journalist campaigner and abuse survivor often lack the resource to defend themselves against aggressive legal tactic design to intimidate they and suppress the publication of their information that be why comprehensive anti slapp bill which would balance access to justice for those who have right to defend themselves against the pernicious use of slapp would help to ensure that justice be accessible to all not just the wealthy it be important to stress that the eu pass anti slapp directive early this year have few question that the minister can perhaps answer in her closing speech know that she welcome lot of what have be say today the justice minister in the lords say that the government be undertake review of slapp policy what be the parameter of that review and how can parliamentarian and civil society engage with it do the government recognise that although claimant lawyer of course have expertise that be useful to this debate we should be sceptical about let those who have direct financial interest and who deny the very existence of slapp have such substantial influence on policy making do the government agree that we will have hope of stamp out slapp only with comprehensive and robust anti slapp bill and be there realistic prospect of one appear in the next king speech or of another legislative vehicle be use in this parliament be it not the case that far from restrict access to justice anti slapp legislation will ensure that justice be accessible to all not just to privileged few who seek to manipulate the uk legal system slapp essentially undermine the very nature of the uk legal system and the freedom of speech and expression that our country be so proud of hope that the minister will address my concern and those of colleague in close the debate in an ideal world there would be limitless supply of lawyer who would provide their service to victim and defendant alike free of charge then the issue of slapp could never arise we be not talk here about try to restrict the right of individual to seek the protection of court and clear their name of defamatory claim about they if that be what we be seek would be something of hypocrite because year ago have to pursue such libel action against an impecunious magazine that think it could get away with say anything about public figure no matter how baseless because it have no asset so if someone pursue libel action against it and win they could never recover the ten of thousand of pound in cost that be when the boot be on the other foot person who have no asset therefore use the cost of lawyer against the person they wish to defame however what have happen in more recent time particularly since the demise of that magazine because there be other way of deal with it be precisely what the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton say in his excellent introduction be an abuse of the legal process and in particular of the huge cost that apply to hire lawyer to defend oneself by what believe he describe as very small number of very rich people the solution to this type of problem be therefore for the court to be able to deal with it at such an early stage that even though some cost will be unavoidable the huge threat of unbearable cost will be remove because worthless libel claim against an investigative reporter whose story be well found will be throw out beforethe vast bulk of the expense can be incur some hon member who be here in the previous parliament may remember that we have brief debate on january deal with the question of lawfare make couple of intervention on behalf of former member of the house charlotte leslie who face what be certainly slapp as result of she not even have publish anything but have privately contact number of people include give my then position as the chair of committee that she regard as relevant to her concern she write to we to try to do due diligence on an individual who propose get involve and invest money in an organisation by which she be employ fortunately in the end the case fail utterly in court but only after she have be put through nightmarish ordeal pay tribute to her resilience in come through that ordeal we be of course particularly concerned about vulnerable individual but sometimes even large organisation can be subject to the slapp technique if hon member look on the internet they will see that on january this year on the bbc website no less story head post office lie and threaten bbc over horizon whistleblow begin the bbc can reveal that in the period lead up to the broadcast of trouble at the post office the panorama programme feature the whistleblow testimony expert interview by the bbc be send intimidate letter by post office lawyer about their participation in the programme senior post office manager brief the bbc that neither their staff nor fujitsu the company which build and maintain the horizon system could remotely access sub postmaster account even though post office director have be warn four year early that such remote access be possible lawyer for the post office send letter threaten to sue panorama and the company public relation boss mark davies escalate complaint to ever more senior bbc manager the article also state the post office false claim do not stop the programme but they do cause the bbc to delay the broadcast by several week as we all know the bbc have the resource to resist major legal action have one ensue only three day early than that article on the scandal there be an article on january on the website of the press gazette which be the industry representative body it comment on the way in which the itv drama about the post office scandal have bring to wide audience the shocking story of the hundred of postmaster who be wrongly prosecute and indeed the four who commit suicide as result the article be head attention to post office horizon it scandal follow year of dogged journalism it rightly pay tribute to the freelance reporter nick wallis who write the famous book the great post office scandal and to two other reporter rebecca thomson and karl flinders who both write numerous article for much small enterprise journal call computer weekly in fact it can be say that the first investigation into horizon which be publish in be carry out by computer weekly after year long investigation by rebecca thomson the investigation editor of computer weekly bill goodwin be quote as say that the magazine persist despite bullying letter from the post office demand to know its source he say we ignore they reaction be mute when the story first appear but it initiate slow burn chain of event that lead to the uncovering of scandal of enormous proportion be very grateful to the bureau of investigative journalism which have already be mention in this debate for provide little more detail on what computer weekly face it have supply with some further embellishment as it be of what have already recount it tell that the general counsel for the post office send threaten legal letter to computer weekly and that the trade magazine brave campaign which continue regardless of the threat often leave it as lone voice with other outlet seemingly very reluctant to pick up on the important reporting with which it persist one legal letter from share with the bureau of investigative journalism threaten computer weekly over an article that say the post office close working group responsible for look into claim against the horizon software the general counsel claim that the article include significant number of inaccuracy and damaging error and argue that the reporter have act improperly state we be most concerned that computer weekly choose to publish this highly damaging article without take the proper step to verify the information the letter acknowledge that computer weekly have amend its article to include post office comment yet it persist with the threat you should not underestimate the seriousness with which the post office view the publication of such damaging and inaccurate allegation the step take by you in response to this letter may well influence post office decision as to any further step it may take to protect its reputation it have now emerge that the post office take multiple aggressive action to shut down the story about its failure over prosecution that be spark by the faulty horizon software the scandal only really spread into the mainstream press after the breakthrough moment in when alan bates and litigant take civil case against the post office to the high court which they win couple of year later even then as be say early the full story be not widely know until the itv drama be broadcast in response to what the bureau of investigative journalism state the post office now sing welcome different tune it say that the organisation be commit to support the ongoing public inquiry and that it be fair and right for the post office to be hold to account by journalist it say the approach of the post office today regard communication be base on the knowledge that we must apologise sincerely learn from the past be transparent with stakeholder and support justice and redress for those who have be impact it also say that it be actively explore additional way to strengthen transparency that be all well and good after the post office fight so hard to cover up what have happen and close down the story of the scandal but will close as begin by say that any slapp legislation be not mean to give anybody carte blanche to say anything they like on the basis of no evidence to smear belittle or denigrate people simply because they wish to target they for whatever reason the purpose of such legislation be to stop people who know perfectly well that the accusation against they be well found as the post office know but who nevertheless persist in abuse the legal system because of the horrendous threat of cost that will drive people to bankruptcy or to surrender in the face of possible bankruptcy before the issue ever get resolve in court central to any slapp legislation must be simplification process that ensure that worthless case case with no evidence case that be truly slapp be throw out at the early possible opportunity before unbearable cost be incur congratulate my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure this debate it be good to see some newly elect member take up this issue include in that my neighbour and hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell as well as some of those who have be around for while and try to champion it be sure the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale and for new forest east sir julian lewis will not mind my describe they in that way we be miss the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis and my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne today but pay tribute to all the work they have do on this issue over many year be not go to speak for very long because be not go to say anything that have not say before think reply for the opposition in the january debate that the right hon member for new forest east refer to and the justice select committee hold an evidence session in may of that year under its previous chair sir bob neill kc the transcript of that session be very interesting to read but what strike be how little have actually be achieve even though the issue have be debate many time it be not true that nothing have be achieve since then however as have already be mention the economic crime and corporate transparency act include some measure to tackle slapp but relate specifically to economic crime think there be general recognition that that do not go far we have also hear about the bill introduce by sir wayne david which sadly do not become law because of the general election even that bill take quite lot of negotiation in order to get any meaningful provision into it against some resistance from the previous government that be not terribly good record over the past few year give the importance that many member attach to this issue so will be interested to hear what the minister say about this government future legislative intent when she reply to today debate the justice committee may well want to return to this issue at some point but for today purpose be speak on my own behalf and repeat argument that have be around for some time there be many reason to be concerned about slapp one of they be highlight in the long title of today debate freedom of speech but as have already be mention slapp can also have pernicious effect on the justice system to which particularly want to speak slapp be now the accepted terminology but they be previously call lawfare that term be very appropriate because it be continuation of litigation by inappropriate mean it be clearly bad for victim but it be also bad for the justice system it allow bad actor to take action in the court and although we have very robust judiciary in this country who be quite capable of make their view feel without recognition of slapp in law under the rule of court and give the clearly state aim of all party particularly the government slapp be go to continue slapp be typically bring by people of unlimited resource to deter publication that be why as the bureau of investigative journalism and other have point out most slapp never reach the litigation stage they be intend to have chilling effect not only on the specific immediate target but on the wide press and medium particularly those who do not have deep pocket they can tie individual journalist and publication in knot for year and can subject they to huge amount of stress and risk we can think of example go back to mclibel what happen to tom burgis and to catherine belton or indeed as the right hon member for new forest east mention the appalling way that charlotte leslie be treat slapp be use to protect people such as mohammed al fayed who wilfully and knowingly use the court system to hide their misdeed it be undoubtedly true that such people introduce vexatious litigation into the court distort their function and operation and misdirect the purpose of justice if member think be exaggerate whether or not it be slapp in the classic definition the action take by enrc against the serious fraud office which effectively have turn the hunter into the hunted be an example of how even the institution of state can become the victim of slapp this be very insidious trend within litigation it may not be widespread but it have hidden hinterland and despite the good effort of the uk anti slapp coalition the bureau of investigative journalism which have mention and sir wayne david in his bill we now really need the government to take up this cause there be one other issue want to deal with one that always mention and that will not find favour with some member of this house if we be serious about deal with attempt to use financial strong arm to prevent justice take its course we also have to think about our attitude to the leveson reform the aim of leveson be to protect small publisher against litigant with deep pocket but also individual citizen who have be misrepresent by large medium organisation and be unable to take action or be discourage from do so the victim of intrusion and vilification particularly by the tabloid also deserve the protection of the law leveson provide solution through low cost arbitration that would be fair for both side that protect publisher in the same way as individual it be not form of state regulation but method of independent and fair determination of issue that restore equality of arm if it be right for we to legislate on slapp and stop the pernicious influence of the oligarch of the steppe we should also prevent the misuse of the court by the oligarch of fleet street begin by declare an interest in that be an unpaid trustee of the index on censorship and write weekly column for the daily telegraph we be all here for this debate because we share belief that free speech be the bedrock on which free society be build the right to voice one conscience criticise those in position of power share inconvenient truth and promote new knowledge allow we to protect and enjoy the other freedom that define our way of life however we find ourselves in crisis of free speech in this country and this debate be an opportune moment to consider just one part of that crisis by examine how the wealthy can use and abuse the court system through the slapp process which many hon member have already describe be no libertarian and all good conservative know that liberty can not endure without order that be why be not free speech absolutist there must always be balance in the law to ensure that free speech do not allow defamation or the incitement of violence to name two example however with slapp the law have definitely become unbalanced create chilling effect on free speech that give powerful advantage to the wealthy and create lucrative opportunity for claimant lawyer this be not just serious problem for journalist and news organisation slapp have be deploy by those with deep pocket against company employee non governmental organisation campaign activist survivor of abuse and people from many walk of life london continue to be know as global libel hotspot nearly quarter of cross border slapp case between and be in the uk and record number of slapp case be file in england and wales in the lack of comprehensive datum on slapp case many be settle out of court so this can be difficult to measure have be exploit by claimant lawyer who argue that there be no such problem however the evidence we have and we have hear such evidence from member on both side of the house be incredibly strong slapp have be use to shut down research publication and investigation before they can even see the light of day there be journalist who have be able to expose the use of slapp cover high profile case sometimes include powerful actor my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale refer to the russian businessman who attempt to sue tom burgis over the publication of his book kleptopia how dirty money be conquer the world harpercollins help to shine light on slapp but the issue have not go away since then many other in this debate have share similar story about the use of lawfare to control what can and can not be say in public my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis raise the case involve slapp against charlotte leslie the former member for bristol north west deploy by mohamed amersi after carry out due diligence on mr amersi and share her finding with senior member of the conservative middle east council charlotte be subject to allegation regard data protection in and defamation in she have serious and legitimate concern about mr amersi take over cmec and those concern be suppress by his abuse of the court system last year after great deal of time and money and no little stress for charlotte and her family the court rule that no serious harm have be do to mr amersi reputation and that both allegation be unnecessary and they be strike down however it be only the good fortune that cmec have insurance that allow charlotte to continue that fight her case against wealthy businessman intent on use his power to damage she and to take over her institution that she be able to win we should remember the consequence have mr amersi succeed in control an important institution in our politic that seek to shape the foreign policy of this country most victim of slapp be not able to resist as charlotte do because they be so often outmatch by people with superior financial and legal resource news organisation can sometimes fight their own corner but local and regional medium do not have the same option this be very worrying and concern for the health and independence of the press at all level the status quo also benefit claimant lawyer who collect enormous fee for litigate on behalf of the powerful as result journalist news organisation and other too often no long publish information that could serve the public interest and hold the powerful to account slapp turn the principle of innocent until prove guilty on its head and the exist system give add leverage to people who already enjoy the advantage of their wealth and knowledge of how good to exploit the court system this power imbalance make it very important for we to know the true cost to the taxpayer of take these case through the court system public service should not be manipulate by the powerful to serve their own interest the uk be not alone in grapple with the issue of slapp as have be note the european union have introduce its own anti slapp directive that though not perfect do show clear change in direction the council of europe of which the uk be member have also call for more comprehensive anti slapp legislation at the national level its report to which the previous government contribute explicitly state that slapp impede individual right to expression whilst undermine the free exchange of idea and information essential in pluralistic society in canada british columbia and ontario have successfully implement and test anti slapp legislation it be with good reason that the uk be know for its fair and impartial judiciary free speech protection free medium and democratic governance one of our country great contribution to civilisation but that should not cause we to be in any way complacent we must remain vigilant in the defence of our freedom the previous government make some welcome progress in this area as the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton say anti slapp measure be enshrine in law under the economic crime and corporate transparency act while that legislation be narrow in scope and could have be tough it still recognise that we have problem with slapp and we should continue this conversation and find comprehensive solution as have also be say towards the end of the last parliament sir wayne david with government support introduce private member bill which would have give the house an opportunity to discuss practical legislation the ministry of justice launch non legislative initiative on training and guidance to help people to fight slapp in the court and the department for culture media and sport establish slapps taskforce this be challenge that command the attention and support of member across the political spectrum and this debate allow we all to put our party colour to one side and to speak up for vital freedom and for the common good be pleased to she the prime minister comment in october when he recognise that this be problem he say that slapp be use to intimidate journalist away from their pursuit of the public interest he also say such behaviour be intolerable agree with those comment the prime minister promise to act and it would be welcome when the minister speak if she confirm when proposal will be put before the house note that there be no mention of press freedom in the king speech and the moj and dcms initiative have be put on hold know they be new government and be not try to make party political attack but it would be good to know the timing of such initiative because it would be shame to see the progress make during the last parliament undo join other member from different party in call for comprehensive anti slapps bill would like to see the parameter for the review of current policy and ministers start to work on primary legislation as soon as possible equal access to justice and free speech must be the key principle underpin the government approach the long we delay the more life will be ruin and we will continue to see free and open debate limit in the interest of the wealthy and at the expense of the public slapp will just feed into broad intimidatory culture that deploy hacking surveillance smear bullying and threat to silence critic during an age already grapple with problem of misinformation and disinformation say at the start of my speech that slapp be just one part of wide crisis of free speech in the uk and across the world imagine we all have story of our own experience it myself after write column in the daily telegraph follow the murder of sir david amess there be concerted attempt by some organisation which understand have islamist link to have throw off the organise committee of the commonwealth game that take place in birmingham in newspaper routinely receive aggressive letter from firm such as carter ruck when they write about some of the same organisation with islamist and extremist connection censorious culture drive by social medium and increasingly ideological dogma be start to police our language we have see public institution bent to obey the whim of online activist the late figure show that police force record as many as almost non crime hate incident in the year to june it have be shocking to hear report of police officer knock on the door of journalist to investigate the language they have use in tweet such as in the case of allison pearson essex police the force that turn up on her doorstep have fail to investigate or arrest people who be undoubtedly use language that should be investigate for incitement to violence such as shaykh shams ad duha muhammad who call for allah to destroy the zionists and to grant we victory over the disbelieve people think we know whom he mean by the zionists the metropolitan police have be unwilling to arrest protester who have chant for jihad and have intimate british jews on the street of london over the last year or so all this occur while free speech be under sustained assault by authoritarian regime in other country just two day ago hong kong court use the national security law to convict pro democracy activist for subversion the women life freedom movement in iran have be brutally suppress through threat beating imprisonment and execution russia have continue its crackdown on free speech arrest us journalist evan gershkovich on bogus espionage charge we hear many other such example at the freedom of expression award last night organise by index on censorship these authoritarian regime use propaganda and medium manipulation to hide their action but we must not turn blind eye it be critical that we do not allow free speech to be weaken in our country as say at the start of my contribution be not free speech absolutist and doubt many member here today really be either as with any freedom there must be limit to ensure that the common good and public safety be serve but we be now at risk of destroy the foundation upon which all our freedom rest from slapp to non crime hate incident bureaucratic legal quagmire threaten to consume our freedom to the detriment of our national stability and cohesion will always stand with colleague in this house to defend the right to free speech and hope the government will work constructively with member of all party in this house to resolve the broad crisis in our political culture democratic and press freedom be fundamental to our right that be why many of we have be campaign on change the law to provide meaningful protection against slapp and welcome the opportunity the debate offer in that regard as the re elect chair of the all party group on domestic violence and abuse want to particularly raise the need to tackle the ability of abuser to weaponise litigation be oblige to highlight personal interest give my own experience of lawfare be use against myself the house will be aware that be completely clear and vindicate in snaresbrook crown court after what and many in my constituency and around the uk view as vexatious litigation pursue with the purpose of shut down my public participation as democratically elect member of parliament and as survivor of domestic abuse in the end the local council where my ex husband be councillor at the time spend more money try to pursue in the court than the amount it allege it be try to recoup want to place on record that have never receive any recognition never mind an apology from the institution and people who do this to still to this day be seek answer so that something like this can not ever happen again because the use of lawfare by abuser to pursue current or ex partner be increasingly come to light the most common proceeding we see be bring by those accuse of sexual domestic violence launch vexatious case in relation to defamation libel misuse of private information harassment and press injunction however they can also include the family court the criminal justice system and other area of law the purpose of these proceeding be to silence intimidate discredit and further disempower survivor likewise there be no doubt in my mind that there be clearly bias in and pressure on medium outlet when report on issue relate to domestic abuse and violence against woman to explain what mean need to update the house on the extraordinary situation continue to face after survive full term as member of parliament face onslaught after onslaught my ex husband be finally expel from the labour party for his treatment of at the beginning of this year however that do not stop the relentless attempt to unjustly remove as an mp by clique of his associate still in the labour party have survive this then have the shock that he then stand against at the general election as an independent with the stated aim of expose who really be and get even with on election day itself my security situation be so serious that be literally bundle away from polling station due to the risk remember the car he be in drive well over the speed limit past the polling station be at and my security support take it on themselves to increase their resource all the way to the election count and even inside the building be still reel from what happen and be enormously proud of the positive and vibrant campaign run despite this situation be so moved that the people of poplar and limehouse have stand by but they be strike as be by how lawfare have be use albeit unsuccessfully against and how my ex husband right to pursue include publicly slander seem to be protect when continue to raise this with range of authority and people seek support be repeatedly give the impression that very little could be do and where have this be report in the medium it be not as though the safety of member of parliament have not be of public interest or indeed newsworthy lately what be it about that evoke this deadly silence in this regard and why be woman experience of domestic abuse treat so differently it might seem strange to some that raise this while advocate for press freedom but this be clearly not press freedom and of course it be obviously connect to the fear of litigious perpetrator and the law around defamation indeed the national union of journalists be warn of the current threat to press freedom pose by the use of litigation or indeed the threat of litigation have even have contact with journalist from mainstream outlet investigate my situation who understand in some case have even draft full article which be then block by their editor on what be refer to as legal ground yet invariably no such care be take when it come to printing smear about and what strange world we live in that accuse of lie and indeed all sort be not view as damage to my reputation far to this the grow trend of journalist be target directly when receive threat of legal action instil fear that deter any future journalistic content on an issue yet the free expression of survivor share their truth be in my view matter of public interest that outweigh the private interest and right to reputation of an abuser prevent the misuse of litigation and the use of the law to silence survivor of domestic abuse and violence be central to freedom of speech the united nations and other have warn about gendere censorship take place around the world and that there be clearly imbalance in the system between his right to reputation and usually her right to free speech as jennifer robinson and keina yoshida author of how many more woman succinctly put it legal change be possible and fight back we must because if we do how many more woman will be silence it be vital that legislator consider this so that certain type of public interest speech be not privileged over other it be also vital if we aim to have future free from perpetrator be able to abuse the court and pursue litigation in this way because support survivor in speak out be crucial in envisage world where no one be force to endure domestic abuse because at the core of the debate around slapp be question of democracy accountability and justice as have set out in term of my own situation slapp be be use to silence public participation and suppress the provision of information by activist environmental campaigner non governmental organisation whistleblower and even people post negative product review online would like to highlight another example raise with by the bureau of investigative journalism freelance journalist tom latchem be investigate foster care home run by reality show star ampika pickston the fiancée of billionaire owner of west ham united david sullivan mr latchem publish story with the outlet byline times about the home have its licence suspend by ofsted due to report serious safeguarding failing understand however that mr latchem believe he have be prevent from further reporting on the care home he want in particular to be able to investigate an incident in which ms pickston allegedly take child from the care home to her private residence but be send letter by lawyer for ms pickston warning in essence that they would review any publish material and if they consider anything to be defamatory or libellous they will advise our client to sue both the newspaper and any individual author or journalist for libel seek damage and cost be tell that ms pickston lawyer say their communication with the journalist be courteous and cordial and do not prevent he from any reporting nevertheless it will surely be understandable to the house that mr latchem feel he can not afford to face down someone with such resource it be obvious who lose out if accountability and transparency on the treatment of child in care home be thwart in conclusion it be clear that we need concrete action plan to stop abusive lawsuit silence those who speak out in the public interest we only have hope of stamp out slapp with comprehensive and robust anti slapp bill as such it would be helpful to hear from the government whether there be realistic prospect of that appear in the next king speech or any other legislative vehicle in this parliament thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton for secure this debate and thank everyone who have take part so far particularly thank the hon member for poplar and limehouse apsana begum who lay out precisely how abuser can benefit from abusive lawsuit which continue with grow impact in silence those who speak out in the public interest also thank the hon member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter for mention the mclibel case which be classic of the genre of use legal might against the small and most local publishing operation in an effort to stop grassroot public spirited campaigning as the anti slapp coalition say without dedicated anti slapp law everyone in the uk remain at risk if they choose to speak out on matter of public interest undermine the democratic health of our society the case will talk about today be that of ben jenkins citizen who make critical post and comment in various forum about greensquareaccord the housing provider with which he co own his home as shared owner in my work as an elect representative as local councillor as london assembly member and now as an mp have often meet work with and support people like ben these campaigner speak up when their housing provider fail when their complaint disappear into the system and when their attempt to work with other to show the pattern in the impact on fellow resident be delegitimise we have all see how those dynamic work around the disaster at grenfell and how the resident be treat before the fire in relation to the ongoing issue in the building such situation be all too common and it be exactly the kind of concern that local grassroot campaigner bring out that the big powerful company and organisation that operate these home most want to suppress we can see why the dynamic of slapp come into play in such case ben jenkins have face series of serious legal threat from his social housing provider he speak out about the company inadequate response to resident concern include drug taking in corridor poor quality repair and safety risk it be very much in the public interest for ben to speak out freely on such issue because safety in housing completely depend upon maintain good standard and public accountability ultimately that depend on this kind of whistleblowing resident in his block have try to raise the issue through official channel but have not be adequately listen to so take thing to high level be legitimate in this case no one be say that ben do not send lot of communication and do not publish negative information about his housing provider but people should be free to do that and ben activity have be vindicate in their substance the evidence of the issue in his block be well document image and video footage be publish by itv which report the issue base on ben public campaigning there be also many complaint by other resident post to facebook those have since be take down but there be an admission by the housing company in response to itv that resident complaint have not be adequately handle jenkin and numerous other resident have now receive payout and the housing ombudsman have find that the housing provider have fail to adequately respond to series of serious complaint include rat infestation broken boiler burst toilet cistern noise complaint and roof that need to be repair by speak out about these issue that need to be deal with ben face series of legal threat for his campaigning he be accuse by gsa lawyer of harassment of copyright infringement for use the logo on his blog and of put himself forward to complain on behalf of tenant who should have contact the company directly have hear that familiar phrase many time before gsa claim that ben jenkins criticism be excessive and targeted individual employee who he name on social medium gsa also say that the criticism be so frequent that it prevent the company from be able to respond to other resident issue which obviously gsa be clearly do it demand in its legal threat that jenkins sign undertaking to avoid legal action himself include commitment to refrain from any conduct that cause or be likely to cause nuisance or annoyance to any of the claimant employee agent or contractor that condition be so broad that ben jenkins feel he have no choice but to refuse the letter itself threaten that failure to sign these undertaking could incur legal cost which be likely to run into thousand of pound that phrase be clearly threat to someone live in affordable housing ultimately ben jenkins sign more limited series of undertaking but he refuse to take down his website criticise the housing provider the battle with gsa have have serious ongoing effect on ben mental health he hop that by shed light on these matter the wellbeing and safety of resident will be protect and the proper upkeep of home across the uk will be ensure he want to contribute to the raising of awareness about the challenge face and ensure accountability hope that the minister will look at this case these issue and abuse of legal proceeding and the use of bullying lawfare where money and resource be use to shield the powerful from proper public scrutiny when they should be hold to account will the minister look at bring in new action to put in robust broad and compressive bill to prevent it from happen thank my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton for secure this important debate declare an interest as spend more than decade work on open government transparency and accountability around the world support journalist and civil society to hold government to account often in country where people could be lock up for speak truth to power indeed work as an investigative journalist report on corruption in uganda many year ago stand up to people who want to silence our story begin by recognise and pay tribute to the brave reporter investigative journalist and victim of slapp in the uk and around the world people look to we to lead by example on democracy and free speech thank the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale for all his work on media freedom but our leadership be undermine by the use of these lawsuit to harass intimidate and silence critic of the corrupt and powerful in this country as we have already hear the uk legal system have become fertile ground for slapp particularly for those who wish to conceal money laundering and economic crime survey by the foreign policy centre to which my hon friend the member for south dorset refer find that international reporter on financial crime and corruption face as many threat of court action in england as they do from all other european country and the us combine other members have mention the case of catherine belton the investigative journalist who receive multiple legal threat follow the publication of her book putin people four oligarch include roman abramovich who own frozen asset in my constituency and russian state oil company launch lawsuit against she and her publisher harpercollins abramovich sue over number of claim include that he buy chelsea football club on putin order that libel be settle but have that trial go ahead the legal bill would likely have exceed million similarly the journalist tom burgis face legal action for his book kleptopia from the mining company the eurasian natural resources corporation enrc sue burgis personally and also target his publisher again harpercollins it even go so far as sue the financial times over an article relate to burgis book the defence for burgis and his publisher cost nearly as the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy mention many organisation without that financial firepower would never be able to fight those lawsuit as the financial times do that claim be dismiss by the judge but have the case go to trial and be lose the estimate cost include enrc legal fee and damage would have rise to million for these journalist the mere threat of lose their home or public disgrace show how slapp be not just about win case in court they be about silence dissent and chilling effect on free speech it be welcome that there be support from across the house on this topic provision introduce through the economic crime and corporate transparency act be welcome step however those measure apply only to case involve economic crime and have not yet be fully implement in the civil procedure rule we must move swiftly to enact those provision so that in case around corruption and kleptocracy people can not exploit the uk legal system to silence those who seek to expose their crime as my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter and the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis mention we must go far warmly welcome the prime minister pledge just last month in an article in the guardian that the government will tackle the use of slapps to protect investigative journalism turn to perhaps the most harrowing recent example of the danger pose by slapp that of mohammed al fayed the former owner of harrods which be in my constituency of kensington and bayswater in september the bbc air allegation that al fayed rap five woman and sexually assault over dozen other while they work for he since then over woman have come forward with allegation but for decade effort to hold al fayed accountable be thwart by legal threat and intimidation as far back as vanity fair publish an article about al fayed that detail how he have sue the observer over story about the source of his wealth other journalist be also threaten or sue at the time the journalist maureen orth write all critical reporting outside the observer virtually stop allegation in the press of sexual abuse be suppress in the mail on sunday prepare report state that al fayed be under investigation for sexually assault year old legal threat force it to remove his name and refer instead to senior harrods executive that be how slapp work they do not just protect reputation they shield individual from accountability and allow abuse to continue unchecked al fayed die before he could face justice imagine how many woman life would not have be ruin if anti slapp legislation have be in place and journalist have be able to report freely on the case my thought be with all the victim of mohammed al fayed be sure the whole house will join in that their bravery in come forward now deserve our utmost respect it be not least for they that we must ensure that man like al fayed can no long use these lawsuit to conceal their horrific crime ask the minister how can we ensure that this parliament will act decisively to finish the job follow the prime minister commitment as mention the current economic crime legislation be step forward but the exist slapp provision must be implement swiftly and the scope of provision must go far to cover other form of wrongdoing include sexual misconduct war crime and harassment as we have hear from member across the house first further legislation in this parliament will be need to ensure that for example we have filter mechanism that empower court to dispose swiftly of slapp without the need for subjective inquiry into the state of mind of the slapp filer where there may be ongoing abuse there must be very high threshold secondly there must be penalty that be sufficient to deter the use of slapp and provide full compensation to those target those penalty should take into account both the harm cause to the defendant and the conduct and resource available to the claimant the level play field argument need to be make clearly finally there must be protective measure for slapp victim include cost protection safeguard and measure to reduce the ability of slapp claimant to weaponise the litigation process include against investigative journalist slapp be not just legal tactic they be weapon against transparency accountability and justice we have the power and the responsibility to ensure that the uk legal system can not be hijack by the corrupt and powerful we must ensure that those try to uncover crime and corruption of the wealthy and powerful journalist academic and whistleblower be protect and not persecute let we send clear message today as united house that the uk will no long be safe haven for those seek to silence their critic congratulate the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure the debate have listen with interest to all hon member and it be welcome exception that we be speak in the house with unity and with one voice from share sense of the value of free speech to stop the bully who use slapp to intimidate people so horrifically too have story it be about lady call carrie jones who receive legal letter from wealth creator samuel leeds after she raise concern about leeds interaction with her brother who have die of suicide after spend thousand on mr leeds controversial course carrie lose her brother danny who be an army reservist to suicide in before his death he have attend course run by samuel leeds who still offer controversial course on achieve financial freedom through property investment danny who be vulnerable and in debt even before join mr leeds course attempt to secure refund from mr leeds before he take his life carrie attempt to contact mr leeds after her brother death to understand the effect that the course have have on he but she never receive satisfactory response so she speak to some journalist and other who have handle leeds course which sister would not she want answer for her family but she also feel that there be serious public interest concern about mr leeds business not least because his course do not appear to be regulate by any professional or governmental body trading standard authority have ignore her attempt to raise concern about wealth creator such as mr leeds shortly after carrie speak to her member of parliament about mr leeds course she receive legal letter from ellisons firm of solicitor represent leeds in numerous legal dispute with his critic that legal letter suggest that she have be participate in campaign of harassment against mr leeds it do not immediately threaten she with lawsuit but it warn that legal action could follow if she suggest that mr leeds and his course have have any influence on her brother suicide carrie respond firmly that she would not retract her criticism and would continue to raise awareness until her question be answer what very brave woman youtube channel on which she have feature ask question about mr leeds involvement with her brother be subject to legal threat and close down it will not surprise the house to hear that this be not the only instance of mr samuel leeds send threat the guardian have find some individual subject to legal threat from mr leeds while the economist have report on the despair of attendee who feel the course be scam another man who ask to remain anonymous attend course run by samuel leeds and be dissatisfied he later post on the facebook page of mr nick fletcher former member of parliament ask whether there be any safeguarding measure to protect vulnerable people from wealth creation scheme which be not an unreasonable request he write that he live with disability and have see people try to manipulate the vulnerable into pay for these course that be all he say he do not mention samual leeds despite not name mr leeds the man receive letter from ellisons solicitors on mr leeds behalf cite the facebook comment and warning any mention of our client may be perceive as harassment defamation spokesperson for mr leeds have comment danny butcher death in be tragedy your account of the relevant event be one sided and miss important context which we have no confidence you will fairly represent to fellow mp he continue our business and founder be subject to campaign of abuse and sustained attack include unwarranted defamatory and even obscene and deeply personal publication what sensitive soul along with member of all party as liberal democrat resoundingly request that the government build slapp into any legislation that be come forward because it be desperately need for this country our citizen and our legal system congratulate the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure this vital debate declare an interest which have raise with the speaker office and parliamentary authority as be currently the defendant in lawsuit will refer not to that but to general concept we pride ourselves in this country on free speech the quality of our campaigner our journalism our broadcaster and our investigator so how ironic embarrassing and frankly humiliating that we should be the global epicentre of slapp design to prevent exactly that as the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy say there be crisis in free speech now in this country and crisis of fear among journalist author writer and broadcaster about what they can and can not say how have we get to this situation surely if we be beacon of free speech around the world with the great parliament and the great legal system we should be able to preserve and protect free speech we have hear lot of shocking example and evidence but there be example elsewhere in the world state in america for example where anti slapp mechanism have be introduce as new member of this place be surprised to hear how long we have be talk about this year and year this government have be elect on mandate of change so now seem to be the moment for they to grasp that mandate in this vital issue and say yes it now time to stop talk about this and do something about it with concerted action just hope that the minister and the government will find time in this session to bring forward anti slapp mechanism in legislation to preserve what we cherish so dearly free speech congratulate the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure this debate it have be an education for want to refer to constituent of mine by name hear the cautionary remark at the start of the debate so will not name any other individual none of these matter be sub judice jan cruickshank have consent to the use of her name today in the sharing of detail of her case she be devoted mother of three and have be in committed relationship with her husband rob since meet as childhood sweetheart many of the case we have hear about today involve mega wealthy high profile individual jan be not such an individual jan face problem with her employer the construction industry training board in she be allegedly sexually assault by co worker at the construction industry training board upon report the assault to citb jan unfortunately suffer nervous breakdown and have to take sick leave the person against whom the complaint be make be put on gardening leave he return after week even though he have be tell to take at least month on return to work he begin propagate false narrative suggest that jan be falsely accuse he jan have report the assault while in vulnerable state have recently suffer significant house fire the condition of subsequent police interview which last approximately hour in damage environment compromise the integrity of the process senior whistleblower at citb have reveal that its legal team have indicate substantial potential liability should jan case come to trial the whistleblower confirm that there be targeted campaign to discredit jan over several medium citb misuse the false narrative to depict jan as home wrecker subsequently initiate predetermined human resource investigation focus on facilitate her exit from the company second whistleblower have corroborate that management plan to exit jan from the business month before her hr process be complete follow the assault jan be place in the untenable position of have to confront her alleged attacker daily on her return to work amid ongoing hr investigation let we bear in mind that this be someone have to face that situation because large employer have fail to take proper step to separate those two individual and allow they to work freely jan employment be terminate after what she describe as warped and unprofessional hr investigation citb later communicate to the police that the situation stem from consensual relationship and far lie to the police suggest that jan have be send explicit picture to the offender dismiss the severity of the allegation that submission have severely negative impact on her case and do so to this day jan pursue matter to an employment tribunal with the support of her union but she face significant challenge here be the rub which be relevant to the debate today she be pressure into accept settlement far below the realistic sum that she should have be entitle to furthermore she be ask to sign non disclosure agreement so she could not speak freely about the case this be why believe that jan case fall into the category of slapp she be determined to seek justice so that the alleged attacker be prosecute and she receive just compensation this will enable she and her family to move forward the term slapp be often employ to describe legal action aim at harass intimidate or exhausting victim resource broad understanding of slapp emphasise the need for protective measure for individual seek justice jan should not have be subject to hr investigation or an employment tribunal rather she deserve time off work for recovery and support follow the trauma that she have experience bad of all the police scotland interview officer lack the requisite training to handle such sensitive sexual assault case result in the premature conclusion of the matter it be later discover that this be the officer first interview of that type and she should have have supervision to guide she could wax on about many more aspect of this case but will bring it to close at this point because jan situation starkly illustrate the extreme harm that can be inflict by behaviour classify as strategic lawsuit against public participation these tactic not only target individual victim but create pervasive ripple effect that extend to their family community and the broad public ask citb to consider issue public apology to jan ask the police to consider re look at the whole way that the case be handle and ask the minister to meet to discuss this situation far in more detail thank all the member who have speak for set the scene so well and for give so many personal example in explain where we be at the moment it be nice to see the minister back in the house and it be also nice to see she elevate to her present position thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton in particular for present the case so well and so succinctly speak as someone who be name in civil litigation high court case involve the covid vaccine of all thing in this world my with the northern ireland minister for health and other representative from our area we be name collectively by someone who have decide to do it the case have no foundation whatever but nevertheless have to appoint barrister and prepare to defend something that need no defence along with many other member of the legislative assembly and civil servant although this be litigious and unnecessary and have no legal foundation the stress and the time that it take up be terrible those with few mean or money pursue slapp against other who be totally innocent the judge strike out the case of one defendant straight away and the domino effect be that the rest of we receive the same treatment by right be very thankful for that approach when be have to pay legal fee from my own pocket for discuss and voting for government policy which be bit hard to comprehend we live in an increasingly litigious society defence can cost everything to many people and although in many case cost will be award that can not compensate for the sleepless night and the level of stress and give back the peace that be take away and replace by dark weighty cloud of uncertainty we have see number of slapp case recently in northern ireland they seem to be happen regularly in january northern ireland high court dismiss scandalous frivolous and vexatious defamation claim bring against the belfast journalist and author malachi by the sinn féin politician gerry kelly the foundation of the slapp be that the journalist have dare to talk about the maze prison breakout that have be detail in gerry kelly own book and about the fact that he have shoot prison guard mr kelly try to silence the reporter apart from expect he to offer an apology for state what everyone in northern ireland know to be the truth indeed the magistrate highlight the content of those very book which appear to make mr kelly civilly liable on the balance of probability for the shooting of mr adams the prison guard mr kelly know what happen the prison guard know what happen his fellow escapee know what happen and most important mr adams family know what happen yet kelly attempt to silence discussion of it with lawsuit the judge be very clear in his ruling that case could be throw out state that the proceeding bear the hallmark of slapp and have be initiate not for the genuine purpose of vindicate reputation injure by defamatory statement but rather for the purpose of stifle the voice of his troublesome critic this be why we need the ability for the judiciary to step in at an early stage and prevent the stifling of freedom of speech in such civil case it seem to be an old trick on the part of many people who like to drag up the past of other while silence the voice that speak about their own past read an interesting article publish by the uk anti slapp coalition about another sinn féin case this time involve gerry adams who be attempt to use this method to silence those highlight the news that he could be civilly sue by victim of the london and manchester bombing accord to the article last year organisation write to the leader of sinn féin mary lou mcdonald to express concern about the use of slapp by party member the co chair of the coalition write it be incredibly concern that effort to call out legal intimidation be now be subject to legal intimidation themselves while solicitor do remain independent from their client they can not disassociate themselves from the legal tactic that be deploy in the course of litigation believe that to be true look forward to hear from the minister how the situation can be address hopefully through legislation in the house this tactic must be call out for what it be which be not to say that we should never be able to prevent someone from spread lie and falsehood we include every member in the house must retain the right to defend our character but that be different from use legal machine to silence the little man or the little woman support legislation throughout this united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and believe we must ensure that it be in place for the judiciary to use as and when it be need freedom of speech be worth protect in legislation we all say that and believe that this parliament must send that message today legislation be need and look forward to hear from the front benchers have to say call the liberal democrat spokesperson welcome this important debate and thank the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton for secure time for it all of we in this chamber be interested in the upkeep of our democracy as part of that we must be vigilant at all time we must always work to construct democracy that enable those in position of power to be hold to account and then we must do everything in our power here to protect that system without it we be on slippery slope to tyranny with that in mind we must all be clear about the fact that slapp have absolutely no place in our democracy and think all member be clear about that slapp be intend to censor intimidate and silence those who challenge powerful vested interest slapp burden critic of the rich and powerful with eye water legal defence cost slapp prevent the misdeed of the rich and powerful from be report publicly and in do so they limit the ability of society to scrutinise people in position of power regardless of their protestation the people who use slapp know exactly what they be do come to this place to fight for liberal value but as member on both side of the house have say today this be an issue that command consensus across the political spectrum we have hear representative from at least six party make basically the same point my liberal value mean that have healthy scepticism of concentration of power whether it be state power private power or as be so often the case with slapp the financial power of an individual or company which in some case as other have say be unlimited financial power as liberal feel strong sense of duty to stand up for the right of all of we to hold those in powerful position to account that right be at the very heart of our democracy and slapp be an affront to our democracy we must absolutely secure the right of critic journalist and commentator to hold the powerful to account failure to do so place the right of those who already have huge power and money to defend their position and their corrupt practice and any other wrongdoing above the importance of free challenge as part of the public debate member who have speak about this subject previously have already say that while slapp be not always apply with the intention to win case they be use as means of deterrence against organisation or individual who engage in public advocacy or speak out on matter of public concern dissent be silence include in so many case dissent on the part of investigative journalist and the impact on our public debate be chilling one case that demonstrate the issue raise by these legal process involve of story publish by inside housing this trade publication conduct an investigation of the condition be endure by homeless people and asylum seeker who have be place in an office to residential conversion in north london journalist witness stain on the ceiling apparently cause by leak sewage they also find break fire safety door and damp problem risk the health of the vulnerable people live in the building people place in the accommodation be fund by taxpayer money that clear case of public interest should have involve the naming of the landlord and the building which would have enable power to be hold to account however when the journalist from inside housing give those responsible the landlord the right of reply they receive letter from solicitor threaten legal action the article state while inside housing would be confident of defend its journalism the cost and time involve in the legal action would be difficult for an organisation of our size consequently landlord who be offer substandard and potentially dangerous accommodation to vulnerable people and who be take taxpayer money be not name the threat of legal action mean that even the building could not be name we do not know whether that landlord be still in receipt of public sector contract or whether they be still run building that be not fit for habitation and there be no way for we to find out as their identity be never publish because of slapp that be just one example of power not be hold to account for its misdeed other example of the impact of slapp that have be raise in the chamber today have be instructive number of publication have be mention today and want to do something unusual for politician offer thank to private eye it regularly make brave editorial decision to give this issue the oxygen of publicity that it deserve and it name without fear or favour as subscriber and former journalist value its contribution also pay tribute to other organisation include those that be part of the uk anti slapp coalition other members have mention the bureau of investigative journalism too we on the liberal democrat benches be call for comprehensive anti slapp law to be pass and we call on the government to lay schedule for when it might happen we hope that when the legislation be bring forward it will not be stymie by the inclusion of subjective test that require the court to infer the state of mind of the complainant that will merely make the situation more complex and it will further the end of those who use slapp any legislation must be effective in protect free speech whistleblower and medium scrutiny we can not allow the chilling effect to continue we must all be vigilant and in this parliament end slapp to protect our democracy call the shadow minister begin by send my condolence to the family of lord prescott who be the sort of political figure who cut across party line as teenager with just pass interest in politic fondly remember see that punch and think good for he as shadow minister should clarify that by say he be exercise his lawful right to defence may he rest in peace congratulate the hon member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure this important debate and thank the backbench business committee for grant it it be pleasure to respond on behalf of the opposition we be debate an issue that be always challenge for any democracy how do we ensure that bad actor do not exploit important protection that have be put in place for our benefit and how do we prevent measure that be mean to act as shield from be turn into weapon these tension find sharp expression in the misuse of our legal system through slapp they be not just frivolous lawsuit or the expect robust exchange between solicitor and their client they be serious deliberate tactic use to stifle voice that expose wrongdoing or hold the powerful to account they be design to intimidate drain resource and create chilling effect that suppress important public discourse it have be positive to hear contribution from member that demonstrate deep understanding of this issue and its importance my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale draw on his experience of the culture media and sport committee and of be former secretary of state in discuss all the key issue that we have consider today as do my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis and my hon friend the member for west suffolk nick timothy my right hon friend the member for new forest east remind we of the importance of ensure that the other side of the debate be remember when it come to allow people to fairly protect their reputation my hon friend the member for west suffolk talk in helpful detail about what happen to the former member charlotte leslie remind we how much politician be in the firing line know that my hon friend the member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies who have join on the opposition front bench be concerned about how slapp can be use to stifle debate both locally and nationally of course all back benchers here today want to see action from the government although the tone of the debate have be consensual it be the job of the opposition to hold this new government to account in what be become familiar pattern labour members when in opposition early this year support legislation that would have build on our work in this area now that they be in government however reason to delay have appear in the other place the government have say that they now think further review be need today alongside an explanation for this change hope that we will hear more concrete commitment and clear plan from the minister slapp extend their impact far beyond the courtroom investigative journalist whistleblower campaigner and even grieve family raise safety concern have find themselves silence slapp do not defend reputation they conceal misconduct shield wrongdoing and erode public trust in our institution in the previous parliament as member of the justice committee have the welcome opportunity to join one off session of the foreign affairs committee that do an excellent job of put slapp in the parliamentary spotlight get to hear at first hand from witness work across journalism many of whom have be mention today include catherine belton the author of putin people investigative journalist tom burgis susan coughtrie from the foreign policy centre who be co chair of the uk anti slapp coalition and arabella pike who be head of publishing at william collins distinctly remember catherine and arabella talk powerfully about their experience of the sustained legal attack that putin people come under and it be clear that it take real courage to persevere with its publication tom describe his experience across africa and the wide network of oligarchs and corrupt government work together to suppress journalism that would have hold they to account he have direct experience of successfully defeat slapp relate to his own book as other have mention susan describe how individual take advantage of good journalistic practice whereby give right to reply be use to start to overwhelm journalist and highlight that this sort of activity be undertake by not just legal professional but other unregulated individual the bureau of investigative journalism have document numerous case where slapp have smother story of profound public interest story expose safety failure corruption and malpractice such case deserve public scrutiny yet they be bury beneath mountain of legal threat of course the right to defend one reputation be important it ensure fairness prevent the spread of harmful falsehood and protect individual from malicious attack like other who have speak today have first hand experience of that journalistic blogger decide that they have proof that my time spend volunteering as policeman be make up and that have commit criminal offence in lie about it at the height of an election campaign see that story spread across social medium and reach ten of thousand of people it be only through my take the available legal step that stop it spread far shoddy journalism should not find shelter in anti slapp legislation but when slapp turn the scale of justice into tool of suppression they undermine the very principle that they claim to protect sadly the uk legal system be see by some people as favourable domain to stifle debate although it be not watertight source survey by the foreign policy centre reveal that the uk be the most frequent single international origin of legal threat against journalist account for of case by comparison of slapp threat originate in the us and the eu combine recognise the threat of slapp the previous conservative government introduce important legislation that the current government say represent significant step forward in this area the economic crime and corporate transparency act define slapp in law for the first time introduce swift dismissal mechanism and implement cost protection in claim relate to economic crime reflect the then government belief that of slapp be link to financial corruption and the scope of the original bill the last government also establish the slapps taskforce group of legal and medium professional task with improve our understanding of slapp and equip stakeholder to combat they as other have mention during the previous parliament the former member for caerphilly wayne david introduce the strategic litigation against public participation bill private member bill that present further possible step to address slapp will introduce my own bill which be base on that bill in early january will my bill have the support of the conservative party opposition that be an important point and notwithstanding my hope that the government will introduce legislation expect that we will be able to support bill that be suitably similar to the one originally present mr david bill propose robust framework to combat slapp include wide early dismissal mechanism and requirement on claimant to demonstrate great likelihood of success for trial to proceed additionally the bill call for new civil procedure rule to protect defendant from adverse cost when slapp claim go to trial crucially it would have empower the lord chancellor to extend this framework to other court or tribunal if slapp be be use to circumvent these protection the conservative government recognise the bill value support it as complement to the step we have already take and importantly so do the then labour opposition unfortunately despite its potential the bill fall away during the wash up before the general election as be sadly too often the case the proposal have cross party support there be no call from the then opposition for review or for thing to be consider far which they have now decide be necessary in recent article the co chair of the uk anti slapp coalition susan coughtrie express her disappointment that labour have not develop clear plan for similar legislation this could have be relatively easy win not only for the new government but for the protection of public interest speech and the democratic health of our society she be right of course and can not think of new government in more dire need of an easy win than this labour government with all this in mind urge the minister to address several press question give the government support in opposition for the private member bill and its measure why have they now determined that far delay review be need when will this review be complete even if the review recommend some change to the approach outline in that bill do the government commit in principle to introduce comprehensive anti slapp legislation next year if not when will they bring forward legislation will the government commit to far and ongoing work with the solicitors regulation authority to see whether its work could be reform to deter law firm from take on slapp case finally will the minister commit to support the ongoing work of the slapps taskforce ahead of legislation that have be unnecessarily delay this would send strong signal of the government commitment on this issue the balance we must strike be clear our legal framework must protect the right to defend one reputation while safeguard freedom of speech and ensure that public interest journalism can thrive urge the government to pick up where we leave off as they have detailed and comprehensive private member bill ready to go the powerful must not be allow to misuse the legal system to suppress scrutiny and silence critic in opposition labour members be clear on what they support and what need to be do somehow enter government have bring uncertainty and hesitation to their thinking at time when too much of this house legislative capacity be leave unused and when this government desperately need positive story to tell they have change course encourage they to build on our work and deliver in this area so that we can reaffirm our commitment to justice accountability and the public interest and ensure that the uk remain beacon of free speech and fairness under the law associate myself with the shadow minister lovely remark about lord prescott john be political giant and be sure speak for the whole house in send our thought and condolence to his family congratulate my hon friend the member for south dorset lloyd hatton on secure this debate also thank the backbench business committee for give we the opportunity to debate this vital subject so early in this parliament we have have good debate today and have always think that backbench business debate lend themselves well to issue where there be general cross party consensus that problem exist but where we need thoughtful forensic consideration about how to move forward with sensible workable proposal echo the comment of the chair of the justice committee my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter on how good it be to hear the wisdom of long stand members such as the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale and for new forest east sir julian lewis and the hon member for strangford jim shannon while also hear powerful contribution from newly elect member particularly the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour and for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan and my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell be happy to meet the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east although would also like to discuss with the department for business and trade whether it might be more appropriate for he to meet minister from that department give that the matter he raise relate primarily to non disclosure agreement slapp represent an abuse of our legal system they curtail free speech have chilling effect on public interest journalism and pose threat to our democracy as we have hear today they be characterise by the use of threaten tactic or action to silence those who exercise their right to free speech on issue in the public interest these case often involve an acute imbalance of power where those with deep pocket use their wealth and influence to silence journalist academic and other who be commit to raise issue that need to see the light of day these powerful actor do so by abuse the legal system to suppress information on which we collectively rely true accountability and transparency in function democracy can be achieve only through free speech and free press that uphold the high journalistic standard while challenging abuse of power without fear of financial ruin as the prime minister recently write this be government that will always champion press freedom we believe in be hold to account that must apply to everyone irrespective of wealth or position the government understand the profound financial and psychological impact of slapp such action have enormous consequence for the wellbeing and the very livelihood of those on the receive end of they because slapp conduct be not about win legal argument or remedy instead slapp seek to exhaust defendant so that they withdraw their investigation or public commentary that be very clear in the response receive to the call for evidence run by the previous government slapp also impact the standing of our legal system that system underpin by the quality of our legal service and independent judiciary be hold in the high esteem internationally the legal service sector contribute billion to our economy each year we must not allow our world renowne system to be abuse for improper purpose must emphasise that the vast majority of legal professional in this jurisdiction operate with the utmost honesty professionalism and respect for the rule of law however the small minority who abuse our system by bring slapp claim risk undermine its integrity and reputation by their very nature slapp rarely reach court claimant ensure that by rack up pre litigation cost so as to make defend the case beyond the reach of those target often journalist investigate wrongdoing in the public interest there be detailed account of how aggressive letter put pressure on target to remain silent proceeding be bring in multiple jurisdiction to ramp up risk for defendant and disproportionate cost be claim in relation to the remedy seek apart from the distress obviously cause to those exercise their right to free speech in medium case resource be divert as press outlet in house lawyer be force to spend hour pore over defence instead of publishing material of real interest in the case of freelance journalist without insurance or academic there be often no legal resource at all for they to get advice from when threat from slapp claimant come in defendant be often unable to take on the risk associate with fight the lawsuit in court usually because of the exorbitant cost they would have to pay to the claimant if they be unsuccessful in defend their case time sensitive reporting be also hinder when slapp be issue as it prevent the journalist from reveal critical information while the case be ongoing we can not accept that chilling effect on public interest journalism and the prevention of other information in the public interest see the light of day to their credit the previous government introduce legislation to tackle slapp that relate to economic crime in the economic crime and corporate transparency act which receive royal assent towards the end of last year we support the slapp provision in the act in opposition and be proud that we be the first country to legislate against slapp at national level the act introduce statutory definition of slapp and require the civil procedure rule committee to develop new early dismissal process to strike out slapp without merit and to develop rule provide cost protection for defendant who be subject to slapp thank the cprc slapps sub committee which have be work hard on develop these rule we expect its work to conclude early next year the cprc will then consider the matter and once recommendation be adopt there will be clear court procedure in place to deal with these abusive lawsuit where they relate to allegation of economic crime the measure will go some way towards tackle this abusive practice the government understand that slapp claim be use to suppress public interest information beyond just economic crime we have hear many example today that illustrate the range of subject they can cover the right balance have to be strike between access to justice and the right to free speech there will always be legitimate defamation claim and any intervention must be proportionate and target appropriately be clear that this be complex area and we should not legislate in haste only to find ourselves with unworkable legislation with unintended consequence we do not currently intend to legislate in this parliamentary session but we be continue our work to consider how good to tackle wide abuse of the system in the long term welcome that general commitment apology if the minister be go to come on to it but could she explain why when labour be content with the legislation draw up in the private member bill it now feel it be too complicated and unbalanced and can not be implement the hon gentleman pre empt the next section of my speech we see during the passage of the private member bill before it fall on prorogation that there be strong and differ view on slapp understand that there be still unresolved issue before prorogation the former member for caerphilly wayne david the promoter the bill be very good friend to when be previously in this house know there be current member who would like to just pick up where he leave off but do not think it be quite as simple as that have read hansard carefully and deliberately to ensure that be aware of view across the house on this topic will also be meet colleague from the foreign commonwealth and development office the department for culture media and sport and the home office shortly to ensure we have robust and joined up response across government this be an important and complex issue where fundamental principle of free speech and justice be at play so it be imperative that we take the time to get this right our immediate focus therefore will be on the implementation of the economic crime and corporate transparency act provision our future approach to slapp reform will be inform by monitor the operation of the new procedural rule when they come in we continue to build our evidence base take into account the view of stakeholder that be raise during debate on the private member bill also invite parliamentarian to continue engagement with we as we consider long term option to tackle slapp beyond economic crime as well as the legislative measure that be to be take forward through wayne david bill non legislative measure be be develop through the slapps taskforce could the minister say whether that be still continue the right hon gentleman also pre empt the next part of my speech be very happy to tell the house that be keen to consider range of non legislative measure procedural measure in the court while not rule out the possibility of legislation in future but want to take time to look at what option will work well as say we be also pay close attention to evolve approach to slapp in other jurisdiction notably follow the adoption of the council of europe recommendation on slapp which be conclude last year legislation be not the only weapon in our arsenal to deal with abuse of the system the solicitors regulation authority have already take action its update warning notice on slapp in may this year remind solicitor and law firm of their duty and the serious consequence of breach of those duty with new fin power of up to when regulated firm or individual do not meet its professional standard the sra also publish guidance for member of the public who may have be target by slapp include detail of how to report the activity so it can be investigate and deal with promptly up until may this year the sra have receive total of report on slapp and two case have be refer to the solicitors disciplinary tribunal we remain engaged with legal service regulator on this important subject be clear that where uk law firm or practitioner be accuse of breach their duty it be important that regulator can hold they to account and tackle poor conduct therefore welcome the work of the sra in do that the slapp taskforce refer to by the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale be as he will know launch in september last year to support journalist who be work to investigate and publish story in the public interest the taskforce sit within the framework of the national committee for the safety of journalists and have work on non legislative measure to protect public interest journalism from slapp alongside the measure in the economic crime and corporate transparency act the dcms be engage on this issue the under secretary of state for culture media and sport my hon friend the member for barnsley south stephanie peacock will be meet member of the slapps taskforce later this month to discuss progress include how datum collection and sharing have improve understanding of the prevalence of slapp experience by the medium profession be confident in the careful and consider approach that this government be take to the issue of slapp it be important that we listen closely to the differ view on this topic and that any action we take be proportionate that involve consider range of option for long term reform that account for the diversity of view express by stakeholder and those target by these abhorrent action to echo the prime minister behaviour that make use of slapp be intolerable and we will tackle it to protect investigative journalism and free speech while also ensure access to justice again thank my hon friend the member for south dorset for champion this critical issue and all those who tirelessly campaign against abuse of our legal system and for freedom of speech nothing could be more important to wind up this afternoon first debate call lloyd hatton want to wind up the debate by thank the many member on both side of the house for their thoughtful and constructive contribution thank the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy for brighton pavilion siân berry for poplar and limehouse apsana begum and for cheltenham max wilkinson my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale and the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan it be clear from all those contribution that in this house there be broad consensus about the need for an overhaul of our approach to slapp in both legislative and regulatory sense indeed for once there appear to be an outbreak of agreement in the chamber that something must be do it be useful to hear from the minister therefore that she and the prime minister understand that this be important we can not allow the scandal of slapp to go unchallenged any long sadly thing have move too slowly for too long this be an opportunity for we to work together on both side of the house to finally put the issue to bed once and for all question put and agree to resolve that this house recognise the impact of strategic lawsuits against public participation slapps on the publication of story in the public interest acknowledge that most case of slapp do not reach the court but be block or change at an early unseen stage far recognise the importance of disclose suppress story under parliamentary privilege in order to highlight the broad impact of legal threat on free speech far acknowledge effort make to tackle slapp through the economic crime and transparency act and call on the government to introduce comprehensive anti slapp legislation that provide swift dismissal of such case protect those target from prohibitive legal cost and ensure that slapp filer face significant financial deterrent international men day beg to move that this house have consider international men day issue affect boy and man health and wellbeing and gender equality thank member of the backbench business committee for grant this debate and the member across five party who support the application have confession to make be new to this place do not know when apply for the debate that the convention be that would be the first speaker however it be an honour to open this debate mark international men day which take place on tuesday of this week hope that be able to give voice to some of the man and boy in the area that represent who may feel powerless and unheard my second confession be that this be the first time have ever speak publicly about the health and wellbeing of man and boy specifically be unashamedly feminist my work before come to this place be in international development include support woman empowerment project in northern ghana and research on gender and education in rwanda on recent international women day be in the central african republic to meet and seek international support for woman leader of the interfaith platform who courageously work together to promote peace in the uk have support initiative to break down barrier to girl enter science technology engineering and math and be proud to belong to party that be work to close the gender pay gap and set national mission to halve violence against woman and girl gender inequality as we all know have long be see through the lens of woman struggle and rightly so woman have fight tirelessly for equality of opportunity and freedom from violence and discrimination but when meet and listen to my constituent there be also undeniable challenge that specifically impact the health wellbeing and life outcome of boy and man these be raise with by woman as well as man because nobody fight for their son more than mum may be clear at the outset of this debate that international men day be not call to diminish the importance of woman right nor to overshadow the progress make in gender equality for all rather it be about recognise that gender inequality harm everyone man and boy as well as woman and girl man be more likely to die prematurely more likely to develop alcohol addiction more likely to be homeless more likely to take their own life more likely to be send to prison and more likely to be victim of violent crime commend the hon member for secure this debate he be right to highlight the issue of suicide more young man under the age of commit suicide in northern ireland than anywhere else in the united kingdom over the past five year suicide of young man number almost that be worrying and very concerning have quick question for the hon member man shed across the country be great help the one at the glen community association in newtownards directly help young man and teenager order mr shannon intervention must be short than that there will be plenty of opportunity to make contribution should you so wish during the debate welcome the hon member intervention will come on to talk about man shed meet representative of the men sheds association on tuesday in speaker house man be indeed more likely to take their own life boy be more likely to be exclude from school and they be underachieving compare with girl at every level of education that be because gender inequality be not only structural by which mean an unequal division of power and resource as assign through our rule and institution but cultural it be embed in social attitude and expectation around manhood and womanhood it be here where gender inequality really harm man and boy also recognise as attempt to frame this debate that man like woman be diverse there be more than one way of be male refer here not only to sexuality but to binary idea of how man should behave if member be to visit my home on summer night they might find mrs rushworth in the garden light the barbecue and in the kitchen prepare the salad if they be to visit in the winter they might find she bleed the radiator while be sing lullaby to settle one of our child in bed international men day be an opportunity to celebrate male diversity and to promote kind more emotionally connected and liberated version of masculinity as positive male role model for boy wish to focus the rest of my remark on two concern by product of gender inequality that be prevalent in my constituency of bishop auckland man mental health and the concern rise of male suicide particularly among young man and boy underachievement at school and why we must tackle those issue head on for the benefit of both sex the crisis in man mental health be one of the most significant issue of our time it negatively impact not only on the individual concern but on their relationship with family friend and work colleague and tragically it be increasingly lead to suicide in the uk man be three time more likely to die by suicide than woman and it be now the lead cause of death of man under the contribute factor be multiple and include debt addiction family breakdown and unfair deprivation of access to child but what seem to compound all of they be loneliness and sense of be trap carry burden alone too often the societal expectation that man be stoic strong and emotionless lead to suppression of feeling from young age boy be teach to man up to hide vulnerability and to suppress their emotion that be damaging narrative that not only impede emotional wellbeing but stifle open conversation about physical and mental health pay tribute to the excellent organisation that be work to provide man and boy with the tool and space to talk openly about their feeling without fear of judgment or stigma one of they be mention moment ago this week meet rob lloyd and john latchford from men sheds which provide space for man to come together and work on craft while develop friendship and mutual support network another great example which be sure all member will be familiar with in their constituency be andy man club which have group all over the country that be help to end the stigma around man mental health through the power of conversation similar organisation in my constituency in south durham be manhealth which work to raise awareness of and improve man physical and mental health it organise man walk and peer support group which meet weekly attend one recently in my constituency and find group of man from all walk of life sit together in circle the session start with each man take it in turn to update the group on their week begin by say how they feel on scale of one to sit listen touch by the openness of those who be share and the non judgmental kindness of those listen and offer support then the group leader come to and ask well sam where be you this week freeze briefly contemplate how should respond do quickly say something positive and move on or should be honest and make myself vulnerable do tell the truth that this week be five not quite rock bottom but feel little joy in life do admit how anxious and out of place have feel in my new role how the online abuse that all mp receive secretly get to and how lie awake at night feeling overwhelmed by the scale of the challenge of meet my voter expectation five do it share and although have fear that these man might struggle to relate to as member of this place find understanding nod and expression of appreciation it also lift my spirit to be able to visit each of they one by one and listen to the particular story that they want to share with that be the thing about peer support it be in the giving as well as in the receiving that people feel empower on behalf of the whole house may say that my hon friend be do an exceptional job we should acknowledge the importance of man be positive role model for other man do he agree that some of the situation he describe leave young man vulnerable to nefarious role model online role model and so on and that all of we old man have duty to provide opportunity to talk and positive role model for young man my hon friend make an important point before come to this place use to tutor for the brilliant club in several school in the north east and would often have conversation with my student one course that teach be about the prevention of genocide and it touch on issue of identity base violence and discrimination very often the girl would enter conversation about the sort of misogynist comment that they receive and their experience of sexual assault by boy in their class who be influence by so call online influencer to name and shame one andrew tate seem to be have really pernicious influence on many boy and seem to promote version of masculinity that believe be deeply harmful both to boy and to the girl whom they then interact with that be an excellent intervention the crisis in man mental health and wellbeing have its root in the crisis in boy mental health and wellbeing in boy age to die by suicide an analysis by childline find that despite have more than double the suicide rate only one boy for every five girl talk about mental health to childline and they be even less likely to contact the service when they have suicidal thought boy as well as man appear to be suffer in silence health and wellbeing be intrinsically link to the ability to learn nationally girl be outperform boy at every level of education from primary school through to university in the north east we have the low gcse grade anywhere in the country particularly among boy of course it do not use to be this way back in the it be the other way round and there be alarm at the fact that boy be outperform girl significant study do at that time explore thing such as language and space in the classroom and the way that boy would dominate conversation when visit school today see the reverse boy who be suppress and do not feel able to speak freely there be much evidence that that be not uniform picture and there be example of school where boy be not underperform so we know it be avoidable and preventable to pick up the point we hear moment ago research show that boy need to have positive role model that do not just mean father and male teacher although that be important it could mean old boy in the school be give responsibility to act as peer mentor to young boy there be evidence of unconscious bias in teaching staff which we need to get rid of we need to raise expectation because the school that do well establish culture of high expectation among boy we need to take seriously who and what be influence boy when be grow up in the it be more or less take for grant that we be in an age of progress where our generation of young man be grow up with more respect for woman and with more progressive value again to reference the grow move to the far right and the misogynistic value be spread online that progress be now in reverse we need to guard against those behaviour by boy online another significant intervention that will promote in other part of my work in parliament be much early focus on social emotional learning in school we need child to grow up learn to recognise understand and regulate their emotion and to find well or appropriate way to express they they need to learn great self awareness social awareness and empathy for other people be not bear with these skill these be skill they develop and from an early age base on the sort of role model and interaction that child experience at home and in the classroom the welsh government and the mayor of manchester be good example of those actively roll out programme in school that focus on child social emotional learning will leave my remark there because have talk for long enough and be conscious of leave time for colleague to make their important contribution to the debate and add to the point have raise thank everyone for convene to discuss the issue hope that as house we can take these issue seriously and it will not just be debate but something that lead to meaningful change congratulate my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure the debate madam deputy speaker where be everybody nobody be on the conservative benches besides the opposition whip be surprised to see empty benches on the conservative side of the house be sure the shadow secretary of state the hon member for east grinstead and uckfield mims davies will give great speech but she should not have to hold it all down by herself international men day start in in trinidad and tobago and we start debate international men day in the house in think it be important to attend today because it be not competition always attend the international women day debate and my fighting for the right of woman do not in any way negate my fighting for the right of man it be important that we campaign so it would have be nice to see more people in the chamber get lot of misogynistic abuse online from people who say why do we have an international men day well we be have an international men day debate and the house be not full this be great time to talk about the many man charity that do amazing work in my brent east constituency we have boyztomen move on up black men of london men united make the leap and the social wellness club we also have lot of barber who do lot of great work the man and boy who go for haircut be encourage to talk and have debate they be not always great debate be not say that they always make sense but customer be encourage to talk and share there be particularly good barber shop in brent call faisal barbers it teach the young man thing such as timekeepe they have to arrive on time or they can not get their hair cut all those kind of soft skill be important in later life like to highlight that shop because even during the pandemic it have debate about covid keep safe and get the vaccination that be important as my hon friend the member for bishop auckland say there be grow range of charity include man sheds andy man club prostate cancer uk which be do lot of work harry hikes walking man and many more it be important to encourage those organisation this year there be three key theme for international men day make positive difference to wellbee and live raise awareness of and fund for charity support man and boy wellbeing and promote positive conversation about man manhood and masculinity my hon friend mention manhood and masculinity will talk more about that today we know that lot of the way in which society run be centre on man from how clothe be make for emergency service worker to language so it stand to reason that for equity purpose there have to be more of focus on woman however as say that do not come at the exclusion of man be man be not about be strong and silent that be very old thinking we need to encourage more man to speak up and speak out when it come to health man die of prostate cancer every year one every minute one in five uk man do not live to the age of and man die by suicide every day that be an alarming number there be continued crisis in male suicide which be the lead cause of death for man under believe that there be direct correlation between the increase in mental ill health among man and the growth in the number of involuntary celibate or incel that grow and worry underground movement of young man be define by misogyny that believe that man have lose the genetic lottery and be destine to fail with woman incel be often poorly educate boy and man and they justify violence against woman via their ideological stance it be important that we tackle that crisis head on and send strong message from this house that incel be not in any way good representation of good man woman be not the enemy one woman be kill every three day by man so we need man to speak up and speak out we need man to be loud than the toxic man on social medium who have huge platform we need man to speak louder than the man with power the man in power and some of the man who be soon to get power we have lot of work to do some of incel contemplate suicide every day there be well document terrorist attack and mass killing by incel international men day be important for everyone the world will be safe if we all work together to respect each other and make sure that we be all keep safe will end with quote by alex karras who say it take more courage to reveal insecurity than to hide they more strength to relate to people than to dominate they more manhood to abide by thought out principle rather than blind reflex toughness be in the soul and spirit not in muscle and an immature mind rise to balance the benches and stand up for man member on the government benches can not have it all their own way hon member may not be wholly surprised to know that do not originally intend to make speech in this debate but will add short one in support of the community shed and man shed in my constituency of broadland and fakenham most recently visit the aylsham man shed about two week ago which welcome woman as well as man have be very interested to hear some of the comment make by hon and right hon member this afternoon and have learn lot this debate have help to reflect on what it mean to be man stand before you madam deputy speaker comfortable in my cardigan that be one form of manhood but that be probably stretch it little slightly more seriously look at my relationship with my wide friendship group and compare they with those of my wife who be brilliant at communicating and at the small act of kindness and connection that go into make personal community as well as corporate community community around the village and school relationship compare with my wife and be find wholly want fit all the stereotype why use sentence when single word will do to communicate why pick up with old friend when can ignore they for few more year that be fine when thing be go well but as man we be too often find bereft of support when thing go badly heaven forbid if my wife be to fall under bus would be devastate she be the good thing that have ever happen to and the community support that take for grant because of her involvement in my life and my family would be remove all too often man be leave expose do not quite know why it be but we seem to be less good at and less prepared to focus on and invest time in the soft relationship that go into make that cobweb and network of community touchpoint that make we strong it make we be here for each other have learn lot in this debate be very grateful to the backbench business committee and to the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for organise it have already name check the aylsham community shed but will finish by name check the brundall man shed which have visit couple of time it be easy to think that these organisation tend to be use by man who be my age and above but actually they welcome young man and man of all age one of their great strength be that they not only bring man together but start challenge some of the age exclusion that we have too often in our community and bring people of whatever age into comfortable welcoming and friendly environment that be exactly what it be about whenever go to man shed or community shed feel welcome it feel like comfortable environment where we be accept for who we be and what we can bring the shed be wonderful series of organisation one of their strength be that they do not rely on the state for funding they be community organisation that have come up from below and support themselves in both their direction and funding however there be one area in which they really rely on the community which be quite difficult in some circumstance and that be in the provision of accommodation the aylsham community shed be in share space in the high school which be great but bring challenge because it have to pack everything away at pm the brundall man shed be in an extra part of boat shed which again mean that it be forever reliant on the good will of the wide community while that good will be there the organisation can flourish if have one message for the wide community it be to support man shed provide they with space and get behind they congratulate my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth on secure today debate and on the tone and sentiment of his message this be not about undermine international women day it be chance to highlight positive image of masculinity and to raise awareness of issue that affect man almost exclusively first want to talk about problem that affect many man in every part of our country the impact of prostate cancer last week be delighted to join my right hon friend the foreign secretary at an event with prostate cancer research highlight the vital importance of screen for cancer that impact one in eight man and be second only to lung cancer as cause of death in man as we know early diagnosis of prostate cancer be essential diagnosis at stage to result in five year survival rate of almost but if diagnosis do not occur until stage where the cancer have spread beyond the prostate that rate half to at barts health nhs trust of man with prostate cancer be only diagnose at stage we need to bring that proportion down both locally and across the country but sadly that figure have be go in the wrong direction not all of we face the same risk of prostate cancer geographically late diagnosis be concentrate in some area such as scotland and the north east of england area of high deprivation tend to have low access to diagnosis and despite have much high diagnosis rate black man be time more likely to die from prostate cancer than white man that show that diagnosis be not the whole story we need action to improve access to the right treatment as well so would be grateful for anything the minister can say about the government plan to improve access to screening and reduce those disproportionate impact for black man the need for fast diagnosis and more effective treatment of prostate cancer be serious problem for man and be look forward to address that in the come month through the newly form all party parliamentary group also want to talk about another problem that man do not have which be worry about equality yesterday be equal pay day the day on which the average woman stop earn compare with the average man that be something that we should all want to remedy not just because equal pay for work be basic fairness but because our economy and society work much well when all our contribution be value properly sadly however teacher in leyton and wanstead tell that male student now regularly question the basic idea of equal pay between man and woman this will be an increasingly familiar point to colleague across the house but believe that as society we be only just start to wake up to the threat create by far right online influencer who weaponise masculinity positive example of masculinity be not hard to find we have plenty of they at the prostate cancer event last week and have plenty of they in the royal air force many boy and man have no need of masculinity there be no need to hold narrow few up as paragon of decency and manliness for all to imitate those member who be not aware should know that lead the evacuation of kabul be in charge of the air force that fly people out of kabul couple of year ago in the documentary that be make and some of the television interview give afterwards one in particular may have break down in tear alongside friend of mine guy call sergeant andy livingstone he step forward to cradle young child when its exhausted mother collapse during one of the evacuation flight what horrify afterwards be that there be article and discussion not about person find upsetting event upset but simply about the fact that someone deem to be in position of power who be man have show some emotion it be clear that the challenge face by young man be expose they to radicalisation include misogyny racism and homophobia just want to pay tribute to my hon friend for raise this matter and to my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for secure this debate and to say on record that and be sure the rest of the house think they be both amazing role model for young man watch this debate that be very kind might start cry laughter we should all understand that those challenge for young man include the legacy of isolation from the pandemic fragmented and divided society understandably low trust in our medium and social institution lack of hope for the future give the dire economic growth and the housing crisis they have grow up with their whole life address these problem of restore hope and trust be core objective of our mission lead government and these challenge be face by all our young people therefore in my view the major difference in radicalisation be not great gender rift across our society it be that young man and boy be specifically be target by extremist and grifter we should be clear how pathetic these conman be they be parasite and predator who exploit and amplify anxiety that be normal for young people it be totally normal for teenager to have some concern about body image their love live and how they fit into peer group and wide society it be equally normal for young people to rebel and to want to think for themselves and to establish their own identity what be not normal be for these anxiety to be fuel exploit and channel into totally unhealthy obsession and bigotry set man and boy against woman and girl against each other and against the institution that hold our liberal democracy together be unacceptable as society we need to recognise this threat and to defend all our young people from it we know that young people but primarily boy be start out in entirely benign place such as history channel on youtube or gaming forum and be rapidly be push into space where extremist predator dominate most of all we need to get serious about the regulation of the space in which these extremist influence thrive we need to make it clear to social medium platform that if they continue use algorithm that be destructive to our social fabric fuel violence against woman and girl and be harmful to our young people they will face the consequence thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for secure this important debate as we know international men day be on tuesday my hon friend the member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey talk about his service and the horror of war and tuesday also mark day since the russian invasion of ukraine want to put on record my thank to all the man serve on the frontline in ukraine and to those who have be injure or lose their life in that awful conflict many important man issue have be raise and be in agreement with much of the sentiment of the debate particularly on the issue of health and the danger of social medium platform however this debate should be inclusive of all man and want to affirm that trans man be man would like to commemorate the transgender day of remembrance which be yesterday which be an opportunity for we to honour those murder as result of transphobia and the many more who have die by suicide this include many trans man and the issue we have hear debate today include mental health and suicide be experience by tran man do my hon friend agree that trans man be often miss out of the trans debate that they be also subject to some really cruel behaviour and often suffer violence such as rape and that that be report absolutely acknowledge that and will be come on to some of those issue in my speech man and boy face incessant pressure to live up to myth and stereotype about what masculinity be and what be man be there be fracture between the image we see in film and television of what be man look like and the quality we promote and value in our male role model as we know this gap be dangerous it have make man vulnerable to increase mental health problem and death by suicide debate such as ours today help we understand the range of experience of and difference between man across the world so thank everyone for be here and for their honesty want to use this opportunity to talk about the unique issue trans man and transmasculine people face in the uk be not an expert by any mean but do know that address the significant marginalisation of trans man and transmasculine people benefit everybody want to thank all those who have educate and continue to do so transactual for example have be do fantastic advocacy work in parliament with drop in just last week transmasculine people have historically face erasure and lack of representation in society and continue to do so they be largely invisible in the medium on tv and in film whereas we see hyper fixation on tran woman in certain part of the medium as result there be big gap in understand the material issue that transmasculine people face it mean their access to healthcare be poor and they face an increase risk of abuse include domestic violence and of course transphobia in the world of sport for example gender critical feminist be express high level of concern at the possibility of include trans woman and be fight for this same exclusion of trans woman across other sex segregate space but there be silence surround the experience of tran man in these same conversation this erasure lead to dangerous myth develop about the experience of trans man and reluctance of people to try to access support or feel part of the community transactual tell that generally tran man be less likely to respond to survey despite the most recent census reveal there be largely equal number of trans man and woman in the uk we must really listen to trans man and transmasculine people need and feeling to even begin to improve wellbee and liberation tran man and transmasculine people face number of barrier in access equal quality healthcare on the nhs waiting list to receive top surgery on the nhs be now in excess of four to five year just for consultation in england and waiting list be grow this leave situation where trans man and transmasculine individual be force to pay for private care which not everyone can do or to put up with dysphoria and the associate mental health impact for which there be sector wide lack of support and training top surgery drastically improve wellbee and save life it be not just something that be nice to have for transmasculine people across the nhs there need to be great awareness of trans man and transmasculine people who have give birth if for example trans man be not ask whether he could be pregnant before receive dose of radiation there could be serious consequence we can begin by remove gendere vocabulary from pregnancy care and parenthood in the well know situation of freddy mcconnell for example he be unable to be list as his child father the high court rule that even though he be consider man by law and have gender recognition certificate to prove it he could not appear on his child birth certificate as father or even parent the same problem occur in access to cervical cancer treatment currently any trans man or non binary person with male sex marker on their nhs record will not be include in the recall system in this area the law be all over the place and there need to be more input from trans people themselves by move to great awareness we can significantly improve health outcome for all man male privilege patriarchy be bad for man by speak out about the varied experience of man we will all become more liberated gender diversity be gift and to truly expand how society understand masculinity we must bring together everybody experience rise to speak on this issue because my view have evolve as we be all on journey it be because be woman and feminist that care so deeply about support man and boy as woman care about woman right and have raise and will continue to raise the voice of woman who be mistreat that do not exclude from care about the unique set of issue face man and boy in our society it drive to take action on they the struggle for equality be struggle for all of we to be treat fairly with equity of opportunity and access to the support we need for our unique challenge be determined to use my platform to improve the life of man and boy in my community who be frankly desperately in need of our help we have reach fork in the road and this new government can deliver for man and woman without competition it be time to change the conversation to prioritise policy and legislation base not on what those with the loud voice want but on our share vision for the society we want our child to inherit in my area that mean tackle the driver of male suicide suicide among man be tear through my community in darlington and our wide region the north east have the high rate of death by suicide in england and it have the low wage local grassroots group be do incredible work in rise to tackle that challenge in the absence of other support just last week attend fundraiser in my community it be call strictly step by step and it be run by lot of grassroot live experience charity they put forward one man from each charity to take part in strictly come dancing tribute these man be ask to leave their pride at the door and prance about in the name of progress on man mental health it be fantastic to take such difficult subject and turn it into something utterly uplifting and that be progress in and of itself however the message be clear man need to talk and when they ask for help they must be able to receive it because the lag in they seek support be so long that it mean when they do ask for it it be at crisis point want to put on record in this debate how honoured be to be able to advocate for the memory of so many have never meet and in memory of too many have know also pay tribute to those who be take their personal pain and turn it into progress for other hope that tracey and david the parent of dyllon and quinn hilary the mother of george harvey dad michael and those in manhealth engage and andy man club who be lead in our area can take small amount of comfort from know how much and our wide community value their work be determined to use my time in this place to improve and drive suicide prevention strategy employment opportunity in our area mental health support paternity right online safety and veteran support service all those issue if not tackle will continue to push man and boy into crisis finish on this point as woman know what it be like to have to struggle to get fair deal and because of that be determined that we do not allow lost generation of our man and boy international men day uk seek to promote positive conversation about man manhood and masculinity believe that we need to debate definition of masculinity because outdated social more about masculinity still all too often permeate society and influence boy and man behaviour we need to challenge stereotype be strong male should not equate to be unkind nor should it equate to eschew creativity or hide one feeling will provide couple of example one from the distant past and one from the more recent past perhaps we should remember as we hold this debate that knight prince and king of old be expect to be poet musician dancer linguist and much more as well as soldier leader and so on it be not one or the other more recently not many people know that our current special air service the good special force in the world alongside the special boat service in case any of they be watch comprise sas regiment artists regiment of the army reserve the reference to artist be because volunteer regiment be form in the century name the middlesex rifle volunteer corps artists more latterly it be the artists rifles form of painter sculptor musician architect engraver and actor it be tough and creative its enlisted man and officer fight in the second boer war and the first world war after the second world war the artists rifles be rename as sas artists volunteer it be vital that we challenge stereotype not just as some academic thought experiment but because the effect on boy and man of misplace conception about manhood can be horrific for their mental health man sadly account for three quarter of suicide in with death per which be the high level since that be horrific it be tragic for the individual and their friend and family and it be also unnecessary want to touch on an example from rugby where man be get together to do something about that terrible situation back and forth mens mental health in my constituency be found in after the suicide of friend of one of the founder member it be base on simple idea to organise regular walk for man who be struggle with all aspect of life it have grow to have follower in year and have achieve charity status encourage communication be at its core because the big challenge be to break down the stigma of talk about mental health and its associate social anxiety my constituent in rugby will benefit from its christmas breakfast event in december its social evening and of course its walk it also have podcast which be good listen one of its member have say the group have help find my purpose in life again thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for secure this important and timely debate and for his impressive speech also thank hon member across the house for their thoughtful contribution there be so much more to do within this challenge it be important to redefine masculinity it be important that we support charity that work to break the stigma around mental health and it be important that we send message to boy and man that kindness be strength admit their feeling be strength and be creative be strength finally they must always always seek help from friend or if need medical support if their mental health be ever at risk thank my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth for secure this really important debate be touch to hear his powerful speech want to touch on two point that he so eloquently make first he rightly remind we that there be many way to be man and many form of masculinity as young gay man grow up in berkshire in the struggle with that as grow up it take many year to learn and feel comfortable in my own form of masculinity thank he for reflect on that also thank he for so powerfully emphasise that gender inequality affect everyone do not think there can be any disagreement across the house on that important point international men day be an opportunity to remember the dreadful health outcome affect too many man in society particularly when it come to mental and emotional health emphasise emotional health and will come back to that other member have raise the alarming suicide statistic for man in england and wales male suicide be three time more common than among woman last year among man age to suicide be the lead cause of death and be responsible for over quarter of death of man in that age range mention those statistic for england and wales largely because could not find regional or local authority datum be grateful to the house of common library for highlight those figure but the lack of granular datum strike as something that should be address as well as international men day on monday we will recognise white ribbon day proudly wear my white ribbon today the theme for this year white ribbon day be it start with man that be poignant reminder that domestic violence and violence against woman and girl be not just woman issue it be also man issue and it be too often root in harmful masculine norm let place on record the important point which can not be emphasise enough that domestic abuse affect man as victim too it be really important that we acknowledge that bracknell forest have the high rate of domestic abuse incident in berkshire for that reason be grateful that this government have set out their mission to halve violence against woman and girl in decade what be the connection between domestic abuse and violence against woman and girl and man suicide both be proof that too often man do not get the support that they need in the most extreme case this lack of support lead to violence against themselves and against those around they the two issue be intrinsically link last week be privileged to visit fantastic local charity in my constituency youthline which do amazing work offer free counselling service for child and counselling at reduce cost for their family be fascinated to hear about the support that it offer young people deal with complex emotional difficulty be sure that everyone in this house would agree that even the most love and nourished child can face emotional difficulty grow up it be difficult time for the good of we should rephrase that for those in the good circumstance but for those face challenge it be often hopelessly difficult time of life three quarter of the user of that service be girl be tell that too often boy be refer to that fantastic service not to support their mental or emotional health but because of behaviour issue because of perception that they be misbehave when the root cause of that be failure to support they through difficult emotional and mental health be also privileged to visit fantastic youth club in my constituency the wayz the staff talk to about the work that they do to support girl and boy to engage with the difficulty of grow up they poignantly remind that sometimes boy find it hard to talk so give they the space to do so often through activity rather than direct conversation can have real positive impact on outcome for young boy prevention be always more effective than intervention that be such an important point with that in mind it be welcome to see the government work to bring more mental health service into the community and focus on prevention with an additional mental health worker promise by this government would welcome an update from the minister on the delivery of those additional mental health worker fundamentally what we must do to support boy and man with their mental and emotional health be provide the space for they to talk through their issue in way that support they other have mention the fantastic work of andy man club very early in my time as member of parliament be privileged to be invite to attend one of its meeting as be my hon friend the member for bishop auckland sam rushworth like he be deeply touch and move by the marvellous work that it do in my community to reach man who have for too long be fail by system that be not well gear to listen to they and encourage they to talk about their difficulty what find most affect be see that the service be be deliver not by train mental health professional but by other man who have experience similar difficulty in talk and share their emotional problem they be support each other through their mental health struggle it be powerful reminder of the need for we all to provide and support the space that be need to allow such important conversation to take place call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you madam deputy speaker the hon member for bishop auckland sam rushworth be extremely eloquent especially at the beginning of his speech when he describe the work that he have do in other country and in the uk to address inequality acknowledge the gender pay gap and the violence perpetrate against woman and girl by man and explain how that do not undermine the need to discuss male specific issue on international men day there be great many issue that we could touch on and number of they have be touch on by various member but as the liberal democrat mental health spokesperson will focus primarily on that subject man be three time more likely than woman to die by suicide since the suicide rate among woman have approximately halve but it have fall by only among man related fact be that at any give time of man have mental health disorder man be twice as likely to die of alcohol specific cause and about twice as likely to have substance abuse problem they be less likely to have equal access to child and of rough sleeper be man partly owe to mental as well as physical health issue want to pay tribute to some amazing charity in winchester emmaus hampshire the winchester beacon and trinity winchester be homelessness charity that work hard to ensure that homeless people have safe place and support can get back on their foot rather than be stick out on the street and can engage with social service the staff volunteer and other supporter include the council do an incredible job tomorrow will be visit trinity winchester with another charity call streetvet whose vet treat the dog belong to homeless people this be not primarily an animal welfare issue homeless people with dog be much less likely to take part in risk take behaviour much more likely to engage with social service and much more likely to get off the street more quickly these be multifactorial and complex issue which almost always include mental health factor but there be many different way in which we can come together to address they one thing that have strike be the fact that we be all much close to become homeless than we be to become millionaire regardless of our status in life another organisation that want to talk about be the farming community network grow up on small family farm in rural area and now work as vet with rural community we know that farmer have very high suicide rate although an increase number of woman be become involve in farming which be very good thing it be still very male dominate the mental health of farmer have be of specific concern for long time about five year ago go to farming community network meeting and meet farmer from australia who have have mental health breakdown he give talk about his journey his mental health breakdown how he get help and how he get through it what really surprise be that several hundred other farmer have turn up to hear the talk and they all discuss mental health afterwards huge majority of the farmer be middle aged or old and remember think that this show how much progress we have make on man discuss mental health do not think that my father who die few year ago at the age of would have ever discuss mental health he certainly would not have talk to his friend about mental health issue or any struggle that he have farming be an industry where people have to be problem solver and they work in difficult condition it shape people to be unwilling to show what they see as sign of weakness but we know that those work in isolation and in tough situation need to rely on each other for help the hon member for leyton and wanstead mr bailey speak about the man who die each year from prostate cancer we know that mental health and prostate cancer be the two big issue that get discuss when we think about man and man health there be so many other issue as well but those two be at the very top thank all the woman who support man with health issue and mental health issue because we know that woman often ask man to go and get check out when they have health issue and that woman urge their partner or son to go and get counselling we know that man include myself be really bad at proactively seek help and the nudge and support that we get from woman must save so many life we have talk lot about the fact that compare with woman man and boy currently underperform throughout their educational career we have also discuss the huge issue that we have with increase radicalisation and misogyny especially online we have touch on people such as andrew tate and the effect that they have on impressionable young man who sometimes feel that they do not have the opportunity that they think they deserve we know that throughout history man have have more power more access to finance and more influence than woman on international men day and as man who be privileged enough to be in this chamber want to take this opportunity to call for more research into endometriosis it be an underdiagnosed disease of woman and there be often delayed diagnosis there have not be huge amount of research into it and many woman struggle with endometriosis in the same way that man struggle with mental health issue as the hon member for bishop auckland point out man health issue affect woman and woman affect man we should not separate they we should work together and make sure that we support each other because that be what we have to do go forward finally wish to echo other members comment as someone who be trustee of mental health charity for seven year know that it be so important to talk to each other if we be struggle be really pleased when one of my constituent chris north come up to in the pub to say hello he be trustee of charity call looseheadz and he come to visit in parliament last week with the two founder dave and rob the charity be primarily base in rugby club and its aim be to have mental health lead in every single club little like farming rugby be traditionally fairly alpha male environment although that be change the charity be aware that if it get into community team and clubhouse place where man go anyway it can encourage they to open up and talk through peer to peer support that be where it can make huge difference last week meet sam burge farmer from winchester who be the local volunteer for the farming community network he talk about the importance of peer to peer support and breakdown of the call to the farming community network reveal variety of issue but mental health support and mental wellbeing be at the top of the list it be encouraging to see that initiative such as looseheadz and the farming community network be encourage man to reach out for help with their mental health call the shadow minister as usual thursday afternoon of backbench business debate mean that we be more collegiate than ever the debate on strategic lawsuit against public participation

important to be there to listen and to give man the opportunity to open up we encourage and implore man and woman to do that the suicide prevention strategy set out by the previous conservative government for tackle suicide be priority the then shadow minister say it would be priority for any incoming labour government and hope that can be reaffirm will she give the house an update on any

as the shadow minister mention security for man at work be so important for tackle man mental ill health thank everybody for their contribution question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider international men day issue affect boy and man health and wellbeing and gender equality cleat hill heat pump incident motion make and question propose that this house do now mather before call the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller inform member that the speaker have grant waiver to the house sub judice resolution in respect of the coroner inquest into the two death connect to the cleat hill gas explosion member may therefore refer to the inquest in this debate be very grateful to have secure this debate on the impact of the cleat hill pump incident on resident and welcome the minister to her place as she know have number of question some of which she will be able to answer and number of which will be for other departments although be sure that she will be able to pass those on to the relevant minister on tuesday july during drill for the installation of ground source heat pump in residential neighbourhood back garden on cleat hill in my constituency reservoir of gas be encounter at shallow depth of approximately metre subsequently certain discussion recommendation and action be make by various party in response on saturday october an explosion at the property result in the death of two people paul swales and julia harris the blast happen close to where gas from the underground reservoir have be vent by the time of the explosion gas have be vent from the shallow reservoir for day approximately household be evacuate from their home on saturday october and for nearly five week now my constituent have be live with relative friend or in the majority of case in temporary accommodation provide by bedford borough council take this opportunity to commend my constituent for their resilience to the disruption cause to their daily life and to the anxiety that have be cause and which continue to be feel by many also commend the community and spiritual support offer by st mark church in brickhill which have provide facility fellowship food and focus for resident over these five week pass my condolence to the family of paul swales and julia harris there be currently series of investigation include by the police and the crown prosecution service regard the period between the encountering of gas on tuesday july and the gas explosion on saturday october hence the focus of this debate be on the circumstance and regulation precede the early date and subsequent to the latter date however there be some open question on the mind of my resident regard the period under investigation and believe that they be worth put on the record in this debate although appreciate the minister will not wish to comment at this stage which agency be in charge of make my resident safe after the discovery of gas on july which agency be responsible for sign off the mitigation of vent gas who if anyone be responsible for the venting of gas for the period between july and october do the responsible entity have the requisite expertise to take on those responsibility what procedure be put in place to ensure that the venting of gas in residential neighbourhood remain safe be the correct response make when resident provide concern about the venting of gas which regulation guide the response by agency from july and be they sufficient my resident hope that the various investigation will be able to provide answer to those question and the many other that they have raise turn to the current situation the british geological survey continue to monitor for gas in both the air and soil in and around the metre cordone off area recent measurement have be consistently at negligible level but monitoring continue to take account of various climatic feature motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now mather that may strike some people as odd but it be the normal commons procedure there will be further meeting tonight host by bedford borough council record my thank for the leadership show by laura church the chief executive of the council and my thank to craig austin and the other staff of the council for their considerable effort on behalf of resident the meeting be helpful in address immediate concern but will raise some other issue first there be the return of resident to their home as might be anticipate there be difference between resident regard their confidence in return to their home many be eager to do so but many resident have considerable anxiety about return with concern for their safety and that of their child or love one have speak to resident and major assistance in build that confidence would be an accountable authoritative voice to underwrite the assertion that it be safe to return however it seem that none of the agency have the combination of expertise and authority to make such call in the absence of that the default may be that the risk of return will be transfer from responsible body to each resident with potential implication for future insurance and other liability which clearly should not happen what step can the minister take to end this mexican stand off regard advice on safe return for resident to their property will she urgently investigate in what form responsible agency or authority could provide the underwritten reassurance that it be safe for resident to return over this period bedford borough council have incur considerable additional cost and divert many officer and staff to manage the need of resident the exceptional demand for expenditure and human resource come shortly after one of the most significant incidence of flooding in the area in fact the met office report that bedfordshire have its wet september since record begin in much of that rain come in the very last part of the month and cause significant flooding as the minister be well aware there be scheme the bellwin scheme that can be use to support local authority with cover those exceptional cost know that the department have be in discussion with bedford borough council and be wait to hear whether formal application will be make also understand that minister be empower by section of the local government and housing act to decide whether to activate scheme after consider the circumstance of each individual case there be discretion here should the council make formal application will the minister ask the secretary of state to use the power grant to she under section to approve the application by bedford borough council the incident at cleat hill should also stimulate review of regulation to see whether they be sufficient or should be update it may surprise hon member as it do my constituent that it be permissible to drill hole metre deep in back garden without any permit or notification require such borehole be consider permit development will the minister review whether the drilling of metre hole in residential area should continue to be classify as permit development or whether there should be permitting or notification requirement the cleat hill incident also raise some question about the regulation of the installation of heat pump more generally more than ground source heat pump have be instal in the united kingdom and this be the first know incident in which gas reservoir have be tap during the drilling for ground source heat pump however the uk currently plan to roll out many more heat pump large proportion of which will be grind source heat pump in its effort to achieve net zero we must remember that borehole be drill for variety of reason not just for heat pump and that the incident at cleat hill be about the drilling of borehole not the heat pump specifically however the ground source heat pump association which be not party to the investigation write to to say while this be the first incident of its kind in the uk and be extremely unlikely to be repeat we do not feel it would be appropriate to simply wait until the formal investigation have conclude it go on to say on that basis the gshpa have communicate with all its member advise they to procure gas monitoring equipment if they do not already possess it as precautionary measure we have instruct member to go above and beyond present regulation and guidance and to follow the procedure give in the borehole sites and operations regulations which apply to coal authority areas when drill borehole for ground source heat pump ground loop at all site in light of this will the minister ask the relevant department to review the geographic scope of the borehole sites and operations regulations and decide whether they should be extend to cover broad part of the united kingdom more generally will she ask the relevant minister to engage with the ground source heat pump association to review and where necessary update the regulation and official guidance on the installation of ground source heat pump as you might imagine madam deputy speaker my resident who have be out of their home for five week have some practical question about insurance and the impact on house value would like to put those on the record although appreciate that there be limited scope for consideration of official support by the minister the first question be about the variation between insurer regard the number of day that policy holder can be absent from their home for some insurer that number be day for other it be day write to the association of british insurers which advise that although those provision remain in place insurer will take case by case approach and look to respond sympathetically where customer be likely to remain out of their home beyond the limit provide for in the policy due to the evacuation the second question be about the impact that the discovery of this shallow gas reservoir and the explosion may have on my resident future ability to obtain home insurance and on the premium attach to such policy again put those question to the association of british insurers and be grateful for its response the abi can not comment on individual pricing or commercial decision by its member but add that say we have raise the concern with our member and we be not currently aware of any general issue relate to cleat hill that would change the general underwriting approach apply to the area it will be commercial decision for individual insurer and range of criterion unrelated to the incident may impact on an individual household future risk these will continue to be assess by insurer on commercial and competitive basis on house value be grateful for the response to my question from the minister colleague which state on your question about the effect on property value it be possible that there could be some diminution of property value however our expectation be that property value will return relatively quickly to comparable local level be grateful to be able to put those point from the abi and the minister colleague on the record will close by comment on the importance of gain comprehensive understanding in july my resident be alert to the release of gas but be content to return to their home because they believe the situation be under control now they face return to their home in very different circumstance with many more question much great anxiety and much less trust in take people at their word currently the size and scope of the gas reservoir at cleat hill be not know an assessment be be make of the cost of project to provide this information but it be likely to be beyond the budget of the local authority the central issue remain the lack of comprehensive understanding of the status of the gas reservoir how significant be it what be its geographical scope do the period of venting create fissure in the layer of rock that have keep the gas from seep into the soil do the day period of venting release such proportion of gas as to make the rock layer susceptible to collapse from the downward pressure of the metre of soil above these be all very important question to be answer there be an emerge plan for the gas monitor and alarm to be available to local resident and connect to response centre this long term monitoring plan be design to provide an early alert to resident should there be any future change in detect methane level however can the minister advise we of which agency would be responsible for the ongoing monitoring if such long term plan be put in place can she assure that the department will be able to seek expert advice so that the correct plan be put in place for both the regularity and duration of testing include of the stability of the close borehole and of the rock layer contain the gas reservoir to remind the minister the incidence of break seal on shallow gas reservoir be historically extremely rare it be not exactly comparable but the drilling in of borehole for geothermal energy in staufen in germany create significant problem decade later in that case water be release not gas but believe the incident reinforce the need to gather comprehensive understanding of the situation at cleat hill so will the minister instruct official in her department to liaise with bedford borough council to assess the proposal to conduct full survey of the scale and scope of the gas reservoir at cleat hill and see whether the cost of that survey can be bear centrally may begin by pay my tribute to lord prescott and send my deep condolence to his family lord prescott be great friend of the east end where be member of parliament and we remember the contribution he make to so many life in our country turn to this very important issue commend the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller for secure this debate on the impact of the cleat hill heat pump incident on resident want to extend my deep sympathy

week later in hospital as result of the fatal injury she sustain in such incident the most important consideration for local partner be of course the protection of life this mean the evacuation of household comprise some individual as result household remain in temporary accommodation with household have make their own arrangement such as stay with friend and family as the hon gentleman point out that be hugely disruptive to the life of the resident alongside the add uncertainty and the ongoing issue with not be able to return home the initial investigation by the gas distributor cadent find that gas be detect at the scene however it be not the odourised supply that flow through its network and into people home but rather odour free natural gas from pocket underground the source of the gas be metre deep borehole drill in july in the garden of the property as part of work to install ground source heat pump as have be point out this encounter pocket of natural gas follow that an attempt be make in july to plug the borehole to stop gas flow to the surface but this work be evidently unsuccessful as subsequently gas continue to leak after the explosion in october gas testing of the soil in the area conduct by the british geological survey find gas leak to the surface over wide area require metre safety cordon and the evacuation of the home inside the cordon follow the explosion partner have come together to respond to the immediate aftermath ensure the safety of neighbouring resident investigate the circumstance of the incident and put in place plan to secure the borehole and stop further gas escaping the site have be the focus of investigation by the health and safety executive to help determine the cause as well as by bedfordshire police in support of the coroner office additionally as part of the government wide response to the tragic event number of other specialist agency such as the british geological survey and the coal authority have be essential in support local partner there have be several public meeting attend by agency to ensure that resident be inform about ongoing work and the step be take to make the area safe to far reassure resident

in the future local partner be draw on group such as the coal authority which have expertise in work with resident to help develop information that can be provide to insurer mortgage lender and new purchaser our expectation be that property value will return relatively quickly to comparable local level be aware that such response mean that local partner incur unexpected cost create additional burden for organisation such as the council as have be point out the government principal mechanism for support cost arise from emergency incident be the bellwin scheme which be administer by my department bedford borough council have register an interest in make claim under the scheme for the combined impact of the gas explosion and early flooding in september which we will consider as soon
