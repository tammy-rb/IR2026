wait on clarity for when the government will come forward with concrete step to extend this scheme what will happen after march would be grateful if the minister could give we that clarity now this be an incredibly serious issue but the conservatives do not allocate any funding for it at all when they be in government and therefore we be leave with the current situation reiterate to those who may wish to use the list place of worship grant scheme that million be leave in that scheme grant be cap at but the analysis from the department be that of all application be unaffected by this change

the question and for the opportunity to respond to it today appreciate how serious and personal this be for the hon member who like other member of this house be sanction by china name in the witness statement follow the security minister statement to the house on monday the prime minister update parliament yesterday follow the crown prosecution service clarification that the government be able to publish the witness statement of the deputy national security adviser as the prime minister say in the house he carefully consider this matter and follow legal advice decide to disclose the witness statement unredacted and in full reiterate that as the prime minister say yesterday under this government no minister or special adviser play any role in the provision of evidence the prime minister can not say whether that be the case under the previous government but once again invite the conservative party to clarify that stop play politic this be about national security you petty little man have now have the opportunity to read these statement member will have be able to confirm for themselves what the prime minister and other member of the government order may just no you be go to hear it whether you like it or not mr tugendhat expect well from you you will be want to catch my eye and this be not the good way to do it can we please show little bit more respect which normally get from you thank you mr speaker have now have the opportunity to read the statement member will be able to confirm for themselves what the prime minister and other member of the government have state repeatedly the dnsa faithfully and with full integrity set out the position of the previous uk government and the various threat pose by the chinese state to the uk and do so in order to try to support successful prosecution the first and most substantive witness statement be from december under the last government the second and third which be both much short be from february and august respectively it be clear from these statement that the substantive case and evidence submit by the dnsa do not change materially throughout and that all three document clearly articulate the very serious threat pose by china the second witness statement in particular highlight the specific detail of some of the cyber threat that we face and emphasise that china be the big state base threat to the uk national security the third statement go on to state that the chinese intelligence service be highly capable and conduct large scale espionage operation against the uk to advance the chinese state interest and harm the security of the uk it be clear from this evidence which all can now see that the dnsa take significant stride to articulate the threat from china in support of the prosecution the decision on whether to proceed as the prime minister make clear yesterday be take purely by the cps it be also clear that the three statement be constrain by the position of the conservative government on china at the time of the allege offence as the prime minister say yesterday and the security minister say on monday this government first priority will always be national security and keep this country safe we want this case to proceed be sure all member of the house do and know you do too mr speaker we be all profoundly disappointed that it do not should declare an interest as be name in the witness statement as someone sanction by china be shocked to learn that the prime minister know that this case be about to collapse several day beforehand but choose to do nothing we now know that the cps be not far short of what it need the director of public prosecutions tell mps yesterday that it be something like short however we do not know exactly what the cps be ask for what that be we do not know why the government would not go that bit far when they be ask to that be what we need hear from the minister today why do the government not give the cps what it be ask for nobody be dispute that there be plenty of evidence the witness statement be shocking they tell we that china be conduct large scale espionage operation cash be say to have tell berry in message you in spy territory now yesterday government source brief the guardian that the civil service decide that decision should be do independently of minister no no no mr speaker the civil service do not get to decide anything minister decide the prime minister be not some helpless captive unable to make sure that the cps have what it need he know and he decide not to help why let we come back to the evidence that be provide the prime minister say yesterday that he be utterly constrain by the position of the previous government and every expert have already contradict the pm on this however we can now see that the two witness statement from this year do state the position of the current labour government direct contradiction of what the prime minister say yesterday the evidence include line from labour manifesto and they weaken the case they make it less clear that china be threat to our national security that be one of the thing that change the sunday times report on meeting convene by jonathan powell with the permanent secretary of the foreign office to discuss this case until yesterday the government say that that be just make up now they admit that it happen but they still will not come clean about what happen in that meeting or any other meeting in conclusion this house need to know what be ask for by the cps and why it be refuse and we must see all the correspondence and the minute if the government will not publish the china file people will ask what have this government get to hide thank the shadow minister for that and as say do recognise how personally important this matter be to he and to many member of the house on transparency the security minister have give two statement to this house the prime minister give what think we can all agree be rather lengthy statement yesterday and he use the pretty unusual process of publish the evidence in full yesterday so transparency be something the government be try to provide the key point the shadow minister make be about why the prime minister or ministers do not interfere or try to do so as the prime minister make clear yesterday this be matter for the cps independently and an important principle of this evidence be provide independently by the deputy national security adviser the prime minister make it clear and this be the bit find order mr cartlidge you be very energetic there and even can hear you from here so please can we have little bit less this be the bit that find slightly confusing about the opposition approach on monday and today as well they have accuse this government of political interference include by the national security adviser the prime minister have make it absolutely clear that that be completely untrue on the other hand they be say there should have be political interference and that the prime minister should have direct or try to help the cps the prime minister have make it very clear that that be not the case and that no prime minister and no government would interfere with the cps on decision to charge which be entirely for it to make in term of the evidence in the three statement put forward yesterday there be clear consistency across they they all set out the very very serious threat that china pose do not think anyone can think that that be not the case interruption it be provide independently by the deputy national security adviser without interference from anyone else they be his word it be his choice what happen and that be what happen we have be through this several time on monday yesterday and today the prime minister have provide the evidence it be there for ministers and members to see ultimately the decision be take by the cps not to proceed and we be all disappointed in that call the chair of the foreign affairs committee it seem to that the issue be this give that all the deputy nsa witness statement refer to china as threat can not understand why the cps take the nuclear option of collapse the case rather than leave it to jury twenty year as criminal barrister have give absolute faith that the jury would have spend no time on how many angel can dance on the top of pin but would simply have look at whether or not china be an enemy they would have find it very easy to decide that that be exactly what it be and then move on to whether or not these man have be spy on behalf of china it do seem to that the decision should have be leave to jury do my hon friend have any idea why on earth the cps drop the case as say this be decision take by the cps independently with no interference or involvement from the government member may or may not sympathise with that decision it be cps decision that be why it be important that the evidence be in the public domain now and that everyone can judge from that how thing proceed will just make one final point obviously the cps decision be not base purely on the evidence put forward by the dnsa it be base on much wide evidence collect over much long period so the decision on whether to proceed be take by the cps on much broad evidential basis call the liberal democrat spokesperson yesterday we see finger pointing and gotcha moment from both the government and the opposition benches during prime minister question but the release of the witness statement last night provide further question for both side include what pressure be be apply to the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat and the hon member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns from within their own party to dampen down their criticism of china this whole thing make an absolutely mockery of what be serious collapse of case and threat to our national security threat that be not go away but will only increase do the cps tell the government in advance that the case be at risk of collapse do it ask the government to be more explicit in their wording and if so why be the government not more explicit will the minister commit today to statutory independent inquiry which would provide radical transparency and ensure that the right lesson be learn so that this do not happen again can promise that will try to avoid all gotcha moment and finger pointing on the question of when the cps inform the government my understanding and the prime minister make this clear yesterday be that the prime minister be inform very shortly before the case collapse matter of day before that be on the record it be in the house if you need to refer to that from the prime minister in term of future inquiry should have say to my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry that this be an issue select committees will want to look at as well there be normal process for that but be unable to go beyond that today call the chair of the joint committee on the national security strategy be pleased that the government publish the witness statement last night but clearly there be lot of question yet to be ask in term of how this come about and what evidence there be that may not have be share or perhaps be not ask for the joint committee meet this morning to discuss the situation we will hold formal inquiry into the issue just to remind members the committee comprise the chair of the foreign affairs committee the home affairs committee and the justice committee so we be well covered we will be hold the inquiry as soon as we possibly can will the minister give his commitment that we will have access to ministers civil servant and whoever we wish to come before we as say parliamentary scrutiny and transparency be something that despite the allegation we be try to provide with statement and by publish evidence be sure go forward that that be something that will carry on will come back to my hon friend on the precise mechanism for how we will do that but be sure people will be make available to his committee call the father of the house obviously this be too important for party politic it be matter of national security against an existential threat from china the prime minister be clear yesterday when he say that no minister would ever apply pressure to the cps and completely believe he but we would like to have clarity that ministers have no discussion with civil servant and then subsequently civil servant with the cps we want to be absolutely clear that there be no ministerial involvement at all that be absolutely my understanding paragraph of the august statement say it be important for to emphasise that the uk government be commit to pursue positive relationship with china to strengthen understanding cooperation and stability why do the deputy national security adviser think it be good idea to include that in the statement the deputy national security adviser be reflect government policy at the time that be his choice of word and it be his decision to include that but if we look across the statement we see there be broad consistency and no material difference on the policy relate to china which have be pretty much share across the house it be now clear that the crown prosecution service ask the government more than once over more than year for some additional evidence on what the cps consider to be the crucial question of whether china constitute national security threat during the relevant period it seem to have read those statement that at least two important question arise the first be the one just ask by the hon member for widnes and halewood derek twigg give that it be clear at the point when the deputy national security adviser make his second and third statement that the question he be be ask to comment on be whether that bar of be national security threat be meet or not what be the possible relevance of the inclusion of information about china as an economic opportunity surely the minister and the government can see that that only weaken the substance of the question that that witness be be ask to answer it would be useful to understand whether the dnsa come to that view on his own or have it suggest to he that that would be useful thing to include the second question be this the government have be clear the minister have be today and the prime minister be yesterday about how disappointed they be at the outcome of the trial and how much they want the prosecution to proceed give the length of time and the number of request receive by the cps surely it would be logical to assume that the government would be strain every sinew to find extra evidence to meet the cps requirement whether they think the cps be right to ask for it or not it be clear that with that extra evidence the cps would have proceed with the case as the government say they want what evidence can the government provide to we that every sinew be strained and that they do everything they could to find that evidence if that evidence be in fact available and other could find it will the government not have some explain to do thank the right hon and learn gentleman for the tone of his question on the first be so sorry will he remind what that be the first question be about why the deputy national security adviser include reference to economic opportunity in his statement when he know that that be not the question he be be ask nor the relevant question be so sorry thank the right hon and learn gentleman that be do to provide broad context of the government position on china at the time but it be an independent decision take freely without interference from ministers or adviser of the dsna to do so interruption it be not my position to account for that that be his decision and that be the evidence submit under consecutive government be afraid that be all can add on that point may take the minister back to the wording of the act it say that it be an offence to pass information that would be directly or indirectly useful to an enemy it do not say that it be an offence to directly or indirectly pass to an enemy information that would be useful the difference be that in the first it be the usefulness of the information that constitute the offence it might be pass to any unauthorised person in the second it be the passing of it to an enemy that constitute the offence by use the second interpretation it be therefore possible to argue that unless the person the information be pass to be an enemy no offence be commit that it would seem to be how the two man have the case drop in fact by pass it to person not authorise to receive it friend or foe they have allow it to circulate outside of the uk government control where it could then be obtain and use by an enemy surely that be what the act seek to criminalise if the minister agree be he satisfied that the wording of the act be as it should be or do he think that the prosecution be drop erroneously comment on whether or not it be drop erroneously be not something that any minister would do from this dispatch box would like to make broad point about china activity in the united kingdom relate to this the application for the super embassy be currently on the government desk as the minister say and have be acknowledge china be threat and be actively work to undermine our national security the secretary of state for housing communities and local government say that the government would never compromise national security how can the government give any consideration to approve the chinese super embassy which would give extraordinary capability to china to continue to expand its espionage activity and to target hongkonger on british soil with its transnational repression as the hon gentleman say the decision on the chinese embassy will be take by the secretary of state for housing communities and local government in due course it be completely unrelated to this case and anything in it that be an important point to reiterate thank the minister for his response so far on this important matter want to draw his attention to sub paragraph of paragraph of the deputy national security adviser initial witness statement in which he reference newport wafer fab as it be call in do the minister share my concern that the wafer fab sale could have be adversely affect by this leak of private information thus jeopardise the livelihood of good people in my constituency and what can he say to reassure and other that this can not happen again can understand how seriously my hon friend and her constituent will take this if she will permit will get back to she with substantive answer on that from the team as soon as can may apologise for early outburst mr speaker interruption order be not in the position of need any advice or help have have enough from the opposition benches do not want it start on the government benches too think we will take it that there be in fairness an apology to those on the front bench may start by say briefly quite how this feel mr speaker my home have be break into my file have be ransack somebody be put into my office by hostile state and the two party be play politic with it this be the national security of the united kingdom the people of tonbridge elect they may have choose wrong but they do the people of other part of the united kingdom choose everybody else in this house it be up to they to choose who represent they yet here we have two individual seek to extract information from we and the government response be not as mine be do everything you can to make sure the prosecution work no no it be process process well who the hell side be you on this be not about bureaucracy this be about leadership we be not send here to be civil servant we be send here to lead the country and to make decision feel nothing but fondness for the minister in his place and be very sorry that he have be send out on what be not quite his first outing but pretty oh it be his first outing he have be send out on his first outing to defend the indefensible he now have the position in which he effectively have to say that he be not politician but bureaucrat that there be nothing he can do and that frankly he should not even be here in the first place because that seem to be the prime minister line former attorneys general have get up and prosecute on the state behalf this attorney general and this prime minister have say not on my watch not worth the effort just to say have huge respect for the right hon member even if that evidently be not mutual at the moment let we see if we can get to that place the prime minister answer this question yesterday fully appreciate how personally this affect the right hon member his constituency and his office do understand that and be genuinely not try to play politic see his eyebrow raise at that but be genuinely not be try to tell the story of how this situation have progress and to reiterate from the dispatch box the point that the prime minister make yesterday and the security minister make on monday which be that the government position as it have be under successive government but particularly under this prime minister be that there will be no interference with the cps in the process of this and that every effort be make to try to deliver evidence to support its case when it be ask for as the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat emphasise so emphatically across the whole house we be appal by the action of the chinese state want to go back to the precise law under which the charge be bring the act be first introduce in and the conservatives set out to review it when they be in government in but they do not successfully replace with law that be fit for purpose until eight year later have the conservatives get on with the job and replace the law more quickly would we be in different position now my hon friend invite to play party politic and have promise several time that be not go to do that factually it be true that if the espionage act have be update more quickly and the current act have be in place at the time the case would have be able to proceed that be the case decision be take not to do that and think that be greatly regrettable welcome the minister to his place on his first outing have to say think the prime minister owe he favour the minister will understand the need for absolutely clarity and know he say that but give the serious threat that he have say china pose to we can he be absolutely clear on two issue first that there be no ministerial involvement whatsoever in pull this case and secondly that the government provide all evidence that they be ask for be afraid that just say it be my understanding be not good enough we need some assurance the answer be yes to both give that the deputy national security adviser be civil servant and therefore accountable who be hold he to account for the job that he be do may just emphasise that be sure he be do his level and honourable well in the circumstance in which he find himself but it be really beyond belief that as become apparent from the third inquiry where the director of public prosecutions be ask for clear statement that china be national security threat nobody be capable of tell he well actually you well say that the idea that he be somehow beyond any influence from anybody be laughable one can only conclude that this conspiracy of omission be something that the government want because they do not want this trial to go ahead no that be really not the case first people who have work with the dnsa will know that he be of the high calibre and integrity on this matter he present evidence under successive government on this devoid of any influence from adviser or government on this side can not say if that be the case under the previous government but be sure it be he present that evidence freely and to the good of his ability under successive government leader should delegate responsibility but not accountability the argument at prime minister question yesterday revolve around whether minister or special adviser have influence the collapse of the case and it be establish that neither ministers nor special adviser have involvement in the provision of evidence but do the minister think it would have be worth ministers reflect on the intelligence and security committee china report and request sight of the witness statement provide by the senior civil servant before they be submit in essence have the government seek to delegate to civil servant responsibility and accountability no it be not the position of the government or of successive government to vet witness statement make in such case the hon gentleman will correct if be wrong but think that be what he be ask across the three witness statement the deputy national security adviser set or time can not remember the exact number clearly and consistently the very serious threat that china pose on the basis of that the decision not to prosecute be take by the cps be slightly baffle by the answer that it be not the job of ministers to vet witness statement when they be make on behalf of the government that be exactly the point they be accountable the prime minister say that the evidence that be relevant to the case be the previous government china policy but the statement publish last night show that they be change to reflect this government china policy that be not the only way in which the prime minister story have fall apart but on that specific point what he tell the house be not correct be it it be there be no political interference from the government in any of the statement make interruption it do not matter how many time hon member allege it it be not the case among all the noise of this china spy scandal my constituent in boston and skegness and the whole british people want some clarity from the government do they view china as national security threat yes or no throughout the evidence the threat that china pose be set out multiple time there be complete consistency between the two obviously there be very serious threat have read they out in my statement the deputy national security adviser be clear in his evidence that china be the great state economic threat to the uk do the minister agree with that be he seriously try to suggest that the deputy national security adviser give what he have say in his evidence do not clear what he be do with the cps with his superior jonathan powell or ministers yes that be exactly what be say the prime minister say yesterday and the security minister say on monday notwithstanding the decision to drop this case it be clear that china be try to undermine our democracy will the government include all chinese official hong kong special administrative region official and chinese communist party link organisation on the enhance tier of the foreign influence registration scheme be afraid that be not across the specific of that in my brief so will get back to the hon lady the minister know the prime minister well have be one of his close adviser as well as his parliamentary private secretary why when he learn that major trial concern spy on members be go to collapse do the prime minister do nothing why do he not ask if anything could be do to stop the trial collapse be that what he want to happen and if not why do he not act as have say many time the government want the prosecution to proceed and allow every opportunity for evidence to be provide for it and for the cps to gather that the prime minister have already state when he be inform that the trial be in that process he also make it clear yesterday in response to the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat that it be not his position to interfere the case be then drop by the cps independently the cps have independence from ministers civil servant do not the whole point of our constitution be that civil servant can never be throw under the bus because minister be responsible they own everything the civil servant do there be no carve out because someone have this high title of be national security adviser they be civil servant it be not once it happen repeatedly in an iterative process by which the cps ask for and say there be gap what be it will the minister please stop try to make out that we have different constitution from the one we have in which he suggest that somehow minister be not responsible for the behaviour of their civil servant when that be the foundation of accountability within our parliamentary system will refer back to what have say already it be not the place of ministers under this or previous government to be vet or interfere in evidence on that matter the battle with china be not just an economic one it be also battle of idea about how the state should operate and the fact that this case have collapse be make complete mockery of our argument about how the state should operate compare with how china do thing suggest to the minister that along with the prime minister he be in danger of inadvertently mislead the house he have be ask number of time about the content of the statement in relation to the conservative party position at the time and he have insist that the statement make only reflect the position of the conservative government at the time will the minister explain then why the exact wording in the labour party manifesto in relation to china and its role end up in that statement the wording in that statement be put in there to provide wide context of the situation but as have say many time and will keep say it that wording be provide independently by the dnsa without any involvement from ministers or political adviser rise be you in at the beginning no do bother waste my time then can the minister tell we whether the attorney general share the concern of the cps that there be not enough evidence to prosecute think every member of the house share the concern that the case do not proceed and that there be not enough evidence but that decision be take by the cps early this week the security minister the hon member for barnsley north dan jarvis come to this house and say that the national security adviser do not have any link to the group group that promote economic link between the uk and china why do the minister say that when the national security adviser be list as fellow of the group on its website until very recently can not reply on specific of the group do not know that but the national security adviser be not involve in any part of this as the prime minister make clear yesterday the cps decision not to prosecute leaf our nation less secure what assurance can the minister give the house that the government do everything in their power to ensure that the cps have the necessary evidence to prosecute as have say several time this government do everything they could to support the cps in that process and to allow evidence to be submit but gently point out again that one of the reason that this do not proceed be conservative policy at the time not materially different from this policy and the reliance on the act minister what baptism of fire as an mp understand the beautiful picture that word can paint but also understand the damage of ugly word and unfortunately see here the problem that play with word be lead to with great respect to the minister do he acknowledge that the play on word by the government and the cps further erode trust in government and that the witness statement may be construe to underline the view of my constituent in strangford and elsewhere that china be threat to those in this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland will the minister meet his cabinet colleague to find an open and transparent path to justice not simply for this but to send message to the chinese government to ensure they accept the sovereignty of this country and this nation and the protection that should and do exist for all those who live here my constituent and everybody constituent the hon gentleman raise good point and thank he for his kind word in welcome if can speak as many time in this place as he do will be very be not sure anyone really want that he make very serious point about the threat pose by china and the threat pose to his constituent and all our constituent by that that be the central message we should be try to get back to how the government can work across the party and how with the cps and other we can all work to ensure that this kind of thing can never happen again on point of order mr speaker until the statement be publish last night some of we have no idea about the detail of this case but the government appear to be unwilling to answer three question that have be ask repeatedly in this chamber so can you mr speaker kindly help to ascertain how we get answer to they the first concern proof that for the month the cps ask about the dnsa at no point speak to any ministers or the national security adviser why when the prime minister be inform that the case would collapse do he not do everything in his power and be there any evidence that he take any action at all and why if the government be so disappointed that the case collapse have there be to this day no repercussion for the chinese communist party despite the government in power have every tool in the box to make it clear that we will protect this house this democracy and this country can not prolong the uq know the hon lady well and know she will not leave it at that point of order she will go and use all the option that be open to she and be sure that she will be come back in not too distant time rise call tom tugendhat who will not keep this debate go on point of order mr speaker will not be go to raise different argument if may give that the government position be that the bureaucrat run the government and be in charge of everything may we dissolve this house and save the taxpayer the money because clearly this be not democracy any more be sure the right hon member would not want to give up his seat quite so quickly on point of order mr speaker you have take close interest in this issue mr speaker the fact that it go to the heart of this parliament on the protection of members of parliament and the secret that we sometimes hold be sure that you will share my concern that someone on their very first outing have be send out on this issue and that the prime minister use yesterday prime minister question and have not face proper scrutiny in this house in statement may gently ask whether you would seek to have he make statement to the house it be not even point of order and you know that we be keep the debate go do congratulate the minister and feel sorry that this be his first outing but have to say if you take the pay check you also take the pain that go with it speaker statement before we move to business question would like to pay tribute to bbc radio today in parliament programme which last week

hon friend the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman who be in poland with the defence committee what an interesting conference recess it have be be in manchester for fantastic conservative party conference but also out and about at home in my beautiful constituency in the scottish borders from spend time with the scouts in hawick to fight lner plan to cut the number of train service in the borders it have be busy few week we have see six party conference during recess the snp maintain its age old obsession with independence rather than sort out scotland struggle nhs school and transport system the right hon member for kingston and surbiton ed davey continue audition to become circus act and the labour party continue its own internal chaos drama and division we have direct challenge to the leadership of the prime minister with the mayor of greater manchester no less andy burnham parade himself around as the next leader an act he manage to keep up for just few day before he scuttle out the back door of the conference centre how embarrassing for order mr snell think you be the man who have send letter about go on the chairmen panel this be not the way to get good interview how embarrassing for the labour party be sure the leader of the house be relieve to no long be the government chief whip although perhaps he think he could have do well job than his successor at attempt to manage the increasingly rowdy mob lurk behind he the labour party conference be also deeply disrespectful to this house with government policy announcement galore it be like king speech scatter over four day with major policy announcement all make to the party member and trade union baron in liverpool not to this house where member have have to wait for over two week to hold ministers to account that be simply not acceptable what will the leader of the house do to ensure that this government show mp and this parliament the respect we deserve the most controversial announcement be the plan to introduce digital id can the leader of the house confirm when that legislation will come before parliament so that mps can finally scrutinise what be be plan visit many local business in the scottish borders during recess and they be quite frankly terrified of what the chancellor plan to do to they in her budget and yesterday the chancellor admit what we all know she be go to raise taxis in the budget once again because this labour government have destroy our economy unemployment be up by over since labour come to power with another rise this week fuel so sadly by rise joblessness among young people the international monetary fund say we will have the high rate of inflation of any country in the that be the reality more people job and livelihood on the line people household bill get big and big and cost of living crisis the chancellor should listen to the challenge face household and business across the nation will the leader of the house say whether the government will set out plan for how they will help household across the uk with the increase cost of living in contrast the conservative party conference in manchester could not have be more different from labour cost bold plan for strong economy and strong border reduce the cost of buy home cut the cost of people energy bill reduce the size of the welfare state leave the european convention on human right to take back control of our border crack down on crime and much much more while we have be do the hard detailed work to decide which taxis we will cut the chancellor be decide which one she want to put up finally know that member be deeply concerned at the collapse of the china spy trial early this week the government claim they could not publish the evidence relate to the collapse of the trial because the crown prosecution service would not allow it claim that the cps say be completely incorrect there be key question for the government what additional evidence do the cps request from the government do the prime minister authorise the withholding of that information be evidence withhold by the government to win favour with the chinese government this house deserve to know the truth we need to see the china file yesterday number of chairs of house of commons committees meet the director of public prosecutions and there will now be formal inquiry will the leader of the house ensure that all part of the government fully co operate with that inquiry china remain real and present threat unless the government act all of our security be at risk first welcome the shadow deputy leader of the house to his place for his inaugural address the hon member for carshalton and wallington bobby dean also make his debut today so find myself in the unusual position of be somewhat of veteran of business question on only my second outing as ever due diligence lead to wikipedia to find out bit more about the shadow deputy leader of the house discover that he be the fast mp to take part in the london marathon with what be tell be commendable time of three hour minute and three second genuinely that be not only an impressive achievement but the fact that then and since then he have raise great deal of money for charity be to his credit also note that in he become the first uk politician to complete an ironman triathlon it seem fitting that in margaret thatcher centenary year find myself up against the conservative party new iron gentleman want to associate myself completely with the hon gentleman word about the terrible manchester attack which have rightly be condemn on both side of the house and with his word of tribute to the late ming campbell who be as he say hugely respect as dedicated public servant and tireless champion for his

id legislation in due course but we do bring it to the floor of the house in statement at the early opportunity on monday this week as for the hon gentleman comment on the economy genuinely believe that anyone on the conservative benches who stand up and say anything about the economy should begin with an apology because theirs be the only government in recent time where living standard be low at the end of the parliament than they be at the beginning as for the detail of the budget and whether there be plan of course there be plan for growth he know that he will have to wait until november for any detail of that in term of the evolve situation regard the matter of china be the fourth minister this week to stand at the dispatch box to potentially face question about that the hon gentleman rightly point to key meeting that take place yesterday between the dpp and committee chairs be firm believer in strong independent select committees and be quite sure they will do fantastic

executive of the royal college of midwives announce that it have decide not to contribute to nhs england professional strategy for nursing and midwifery because it have become clear that midwifery be

week ago there be un report that genocide have take place in gaza and it be the international community obligation to establish the truth and hold those responsible to account will the government at

not only painful for community but ultimately it be also painful for some of those company remind my hon friend that the renters rights bill be proceed through the house and he may wish to raise some of those point in that debate he may also wish to ask for debate and again because of their experience have no doubt that many other member will wish to join in call the chair of the backbench

that the debate do not start until pm and as result do not finish until midnight it be true that the protect time mean that the debate go ahead and people be able to have their say but know from past experience how difficult it be for colleague to stand up and tell their personal story do not think it be the place of this house if we can manage it to get to situation where those story be not tell

this issue in the house for we need to shine light on that malevolence there can be only one law in this country the law that apply to each of we and all of we the government and agree absolutely with the point on which the right hon gentleman finish his question because the rule of law be sovereign in this country no other law take precedence over that and he be absolutely right in say what should

component of the year health plan and allow time in parliament to debate the challenge face by young carer take this opportunity to pay tribute to young carer who do fantastic and at time very difficult job some of we wonder how we would cope in those circumstance also pay tribute to my hon friend who have work tirelessly on not just this issue but other issue for her constituent can

week ago today meet the governor of the bank of england to discuss the important decision around quantitative easing and quantitative tightening and the governor agree with that this be actually fiscal matter it be trigger loss of ten of billion of pound for the taxpayer every year and therefore the governor would welcome more input from the houses of parliament on this important matter write to the chancellor copying in the leader of the house to request debate before the budget because if this house have debate and vote on different decision to guide the governor and the monetary policy committee it would actually help the chancellor in her difficult decision around the budget be sure that the hon gentleman be try to be helpful so will take he at his word on have debate on these matter he raise important point suggest that he should be the one call for debate if there be to be discussion about economic policy in the run up to the budget there be various avenue by which he can call for that and make his point it be not unusual in this situation we be number of week away from the budget but the chancellor be work extraordinarily hard to come up with budget that not only

the closure of care home can be extremely distressing for resident and family who need as much notice as possible should such situation become possibility unfortunately be afraid the circumstance that she describe be not untypical when it come to reform in government the party have over offer and be generally underachieving this be matter for local authority but she may wish to raise it at health and social care question next tuesday on march my constituent sue and dave evans lose their year old son who be the passenger in car be drive by newly qualified driver yesterday sue and dave be in

to send my congratulation to all those graduate from forth valley college and thank my hon friend for raise this matter he be great advocate for his constituency this government have deliver the big budget settlement for the scottish government in the history of devolution and he will know that education and skill policy be devolve however hope that ministers in the scottish government have hear

the great school lunch which raise awareness of the benefit of healthy and nutritious school meal there be real concern that the funding for both school lunch and breakfast club be not enough to cover the cost of provide they put pressure on school budget particularly in constituency such as mine where school be among the low fund in the country will the leader of the house agree to raise this issue with the chancellor ahead of the autumn budget to ensure that underfunded school be not leave behind order before the leader of the house respond let say that many member wish to contribute so can ask that question be short and that the leader of the house be on point as well so far school be offer free breakfast club which put on average year back into parent pocket and we intend to extend

constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for berwickshire roxburgh and selkirk john lamont to his today at pm there will be protest in moffat by campaigner who be make last ditch attempt to save the local bank of scotland branch and commend they for their effort it be one of five branch to be close in my constituency this year do the leader of the house agree with that if bank can not be persuade not to abandon the high street they should at the very least ensure that their premise be provide for community use therefore in the case of the peebles branch do he also agree that the bank should look favourably on the offer from the peebles community trust for that branch do agree with the right hon member because in person banking be important to our local community in fact have hub opening in whitley bay in my constituency in about day time understand that be cold comfort for the people of moffat but we be see banking hub roll out across the country think bank have such responsibility and the good bank actually look at their responsibility to continue to have branch presence should they not think they have an obligation to work with other to ensure that there be access to banking would also say that the scottish government have their own community right to buy policy which he may wish to look at as part of any campaign for the purchase of community hub next week in westminster hall there be debate on financial inclusion in which he may wish to amplify his point after two year of bombardment and siege gaza healthcare system have be decimate be sure the whole house welcome the ceasefire fragile as it be the release of hostage and that aid be begin to increase somewhat will my right hon friend consider the case for debate on the step that britain could take to support the rebuilding of gaza hospital so that the most innocent in this awful conflict child can at least begin to get the healthcare support they so desperately need my hon friend raise an important question and make really important point as the foreign secretary say the ceasefire do give an opportunity not just to scale up aid but to look at the future of gaza recovery an important part of that be healthcare for child because they deserve well future than what they currently have we be actively support the rebuilding of gaza healthcare system and we will update the house on the measure we be take we have bring forward debate and statement on these matter and we will continue to do so couple of week ago spend fabulous day at the race at bath racecourse for century horserace have be part of our national sporting history and it be part of our dna yet across the industry people be deeply concerned about the threat that harmonise tax rate will have on the sustainability of the sport may we have debate before the budget on the impact the propose measure would have on british horseracing read story as the hon lady do about what might or might not happen as she would expect to say she will have to wait until the budget to see whether those story be accurate she could secure debate before the budget because know this be concern for number of member across the house york be kind and welcome city follow the recent wave of intimidation racism and violence perpetrate by few which have rock our city have launch the york unity campaign with the hashtag ourthreeword to ask people across york to provide three value that define our city mine be inclusion community and caring what support can the leader of the house bring to our campaign and may we have debate on inclusion in our city and community my hon friend be great advocate for that fine historic city but also for the cause she speak of today she be often voice of calm in these matter and thank she for that and for raise the matter today know that there be concern across the house so perhaps she could look to secure an adjournment debate or backbench business debate to see if there be share view and experience across the house in woolavington village in my constituency three separate planning application total over home have be submit with the prospect of fourth even large proposal to follow the cumulative impact of those development on local service will not be fully assess because each application be treat separately to make matter bad somerset council temporary emergency planning measure have lead to the cancellation of many plan committee leave local councillor cut out of decision make process may therefore ask the leader of the house for debate on how cumulative housing impact be assess and how we ensure that local democratic oversight be not undermine notwithstanding the comment make to the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton about the importance of housing understand from constituency perspective but also from the experience of colleague across the house that there be concern particularly in rural area that be see their community transform albeit in necessary way in many case think the hon gentleman would be able to make an excellent case for backbench business debate so that he can expand on the view he have express today as have say before the fact that the railway station at burntisland cowdenbeath and kinghorn be not fully accessible cause many of my constituent great deal of trouble in june network rail tell that it would have the first stage of feasibility study into how to make burntisland station accessible complete by the end of the summer despite repeat request it still have not give date by which that will happen do the leader of the house agree that network rail need to make this priority and will he make time for debate on accessible transport we be committed to improve the accessibility of britain railway and know that my hon friend have raise this issue with the transport secretary we will make announcement in due course but agree with she that network rail have responsibility as well as government it be matter that need to be address and we be go to get on with it in my constituency there be fantastic organisation call the filo project community interest company that provide innovative and award win dementia care when people come to the filo project however their care be subject to vat of simply because it be not commission by local authority which can claim back vat will the leader of the house find time in government business for debate on the vat status of community interest company that be provide this level of dementia or other disability relate daycare so we do not stay with system where there be vat on life alter social care community group be the golden thread that run through our community and hold they together so the hon member should be credit with raise these matter which be important because community group often struggle she should perhaps might not be forgive for say this draw this issue to the attention of the chancellor as we approach the budget she also have an opportunity to raise it as matter for debate because other may share her concern at my whitchurch meet and greet resident raise serious concern about dangerous and disruptive heavy good vehicle traffic on oving road one warn that soon there will be nasty accident yet the route remain unrestricted for hgvs will the leader of the house allow time for debate on the impact of hgv traffic on our village do he agree that local authority such as buckinghamshire council should make full use of their power to restrict or prohibit hgv where that be possible hgv can have negative effect on community both on safety and through their environmental impact particularly in village where road and pavement be often narrow as my hon friend say local traffic authority have power to restrict or prohibit the use of hgv on any road if they have the power and there be demand for it in local area they should use that power think that be good topic for westminster hall debate we know that at time it be hard to see gp and the teenage cancer trust have highlight that to year old have to see gp more often than any other age group often three time before get referral for cancer diagnosis will the leader of the house allow debate in government time on increase access to gps as part of the wide national cancer plan particularly for young people we be acutely aware of the state of access to gps when we come into government and we be do something about it we have deliver over million more nhs appointment since july and we be continue to push on that in fact we have deliver on our manifesto pledge seven month early we have set out our year plan back by extra investment it be important not just to ensure that there be extra slot for people to be see but to think about where they be and where people can get access to information know from talk to the secretary of state for health and social care that he be acutely aware of that if he have not hear what the hon member say will draw it to his attention last saturday attend the anniversary celebration of the dowlais male voice choir which be one of at least six choir in my constituency they do great job of represent the town locally nationally and internationally take particular pleasure in congratulate meurig price the only original member of the choir leave from the early day from will the leader of the house join in congratulate the choir on this milestone anniversary may we have debate in government time on the benefit of choir and choral society to community life and to individual health and wellbee congratulate the choir when we think about the welsh valley we associate they with male voice choir which be an important part of the fabric of those community the government be acutely aware of that so would welcome the opportunity to raise these issue through debate where the government be able to support music and other community activity they be keen to do so to ensure that support do not go just to certain area and to certain type of music but that everyone and every area particularly community thing like male voice choir get its share rural family across north yorkshire include those in village such as killinghall and hampsthwaite in my constituency have be leave strand by change to home to school transport rule with child live in the same village now set to go to different school and parent face have to give up work to get they there will the leader of the house make time for debate on reform school transport law so that school transport properly serve area like north yorkshire will he perhaps pass that on to colleague in the department for education think it be important that the hon gentleman seek debate on that matter so that he can put together the evidence and bring it to the attention of ministers who be acutely aware of the cost of public and school transport think that an opportunity to share experience of that across the house would inform debate when landfill operator fail to follow the rule that have be lay down to protect the environment and the community it take far too long for the environment agency to take enforcement action in one case in my constituency the company then declare liquidation in order presumably to avoid the cost of clean up that be not acceptable it happen elsewhere in the country so could we have debate on this matter in government time my hon friend could seek debate to raise this matter but will take his concern to the relevant department and perhaps he could seek meeting with ministers to explain what the problem be my constituent mark houghton mbe serve his country in the british army for more than year in february while work abroad he be seriously injure in an accident that have leave he unable to walk mark be now back in the uk and receive treatment but he be not currently entitle to any further support because he have be work abroad for two out of the last three year do the leader of the house agree that our veteran deserve to be treat with dignity and respect and will he allow for debate in government time on support for disabled veteran yes it be important to recognise the contribution that veteran make these be somewhat unusual circumstance but they be harrowing and concern should the hon lady seek an adjournment debate she may be able to draw her concern to the attention of the relevant minister because we be look at the whole question of how we can treat our veteran well with the dignity and respect that they deserve and she may get the answer she seek the street around birches head and sneyd green have become an impenetrable labyrinth of road closure diversion and blockade while severn trent water dig up the road to replace important infrastructure cause great disruption to local people the new roads and street works act and the traffic management act should give local authority the ability to co ordinate some of those work but in this case it simply be not happen and those act now seem deficient in do what they be mean to do could the leader of the house arrange for either statement or debate in government time on how we can ensure the co ordination of those work to reduce the impact on local people again this issue be not unique to my hon friend constituency and though he be great advocate for his constituency be sure other have similar story he may seek backbench business debate to raise these matter because as far as can remember we have be discuss these thing for quite long time and we therefore do need to work out what further thing can be do apparently we have short question from jim shannon once again welcome the leader of the house to his new role which he be clearly enjoy very much wish he well on wednesday past

ensure the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity in area beyond national jurisdiction the agreement deliver on four critical front first it establish new obligation to share the benefit arise from research into and the use of marine genetic resource from these ocean area secondly it create mechanism to establish area base management tool include marine protect area which be an essential step to safeguard fragile ecosystem it be great that the uk be finally ratify the treaty and it be also great to hear the minister talk about the benefit of marine protect area but if the bill be to signify new and invigorated government focus on protect our precious marine environment do she not agree that the terrible destructive fishing practice of bottom trawl obliterate vital habitat on our seabed it make mockery of the entire term marine protect area that the uk government have ignore the environmental audit committee advice to ban bottom trawl from our own marine protect area of course domestic marine protect area be not within the remit of the bill because we be talk about area beyond national jurisdiction what can say be that the uk government have introduce consultation look at ban bottom trawling in of our marine protect area that consultation be out now we be show our commitment to ocean on not only an international scale but national scale thirdly the agreement strengthen the framework for environmental impact assessment by build on the provision of the un convention on the law of the sea to ensure that new activity in these area be sustainable and responsible fourthly it reinforce capacity build for develop state and promote broad technological transfer the journey to the agreement start with an ad hoc informal working group in before it progress to preparatory commission that work through and and culminate in formal inter government conference that negotiate the text between and the uk have already play lead role in shape the agreement over the course of more than decade of negotiation in september we be one of the first country to sign the agreement when it open for signature at the un and today through the bill the uk take major step towards ratification will now outline the structure of the bill which be divide into five part part and be design to correspond and give effect to the three core section of the bbnj agreement relate to marine genetic resource area base management tool and environmental impact assessment thank the minister for introduce the bill and for her deep interest in this subject we be all very impressed by what the minister do and we thank she for it far to intervention of the hon member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins he and both represent coastal community would like to say that marine biodiversity be the lifeblood of the fishing industry and that as we have often say fisherman be the great natural caretaker of the sea do the minister agree that the input and the generational knowledge of the fishing sector be essential as we move forward pay tribute to all the fisherman throughout the united kingdom who play such vital role in help to feed our nation the bill also ensure that the uk have the necessary power to implement decision adopt at future meeting of the bbnj conference of the party begin with the marine genetic resource provision part of the bill set out the requirement relate to the collection and use of marine genetic resource from area beyond national jurisdiction and digital sequence information generate on those marine genetic resource these measure mean that uk researcher conduct collection activity from uk craft or equipment such as royal research ship or autonomous system will need to notify national focal point within the foreign commonwealth and development office before and after the collection of these resource additionally any user of marine genetic resource or digital sequence information will need to notify the national focal point once result of utilisation be available and make those result available in publicly accessible repository or database the result of utilisation include publication such as journal article and patent grant should detail the outcome of research and development on these resource these notification will provide valuable datum on material collect and on the result of research in area beyond national jurisdiction these notification will be pass on to clearing house mechanism core part of the future architecture of the bbnj agreement the clearing house mechanism will act as global online notification hub where party to the agreement will submit their notification allow researcher from the uk and elsewhere to see what be be collect from where and how it be be use that function be key to the benefit share mechanism under the agreement enable researcher from develop country to work from the same scientific datum as researcher in the uk that will also facilitate the development of cross national research group crucial to support breakthrough scientific discovery the measure in the bill also require repository and institution hold marine genetic resource to provide access to sample under reasonable condition that will apply to body like the natural history museum the national oceanography centre and uk university similarly uk database contain digital sequence information from marine genetic resource will need to ensure public access marine genetic resource may hold the key to future medicine enzyme and sustainable technology this be fast grow global sector and our university and biotech firm be world leader take together the measure will allow our researcher and company to remain at the cutting edge of marine genetic discovery benefit from and contribute to global research in this space part of the bill provide power to allow the uk to implement internationally agree measure in relation to marine protect area and other area base management tool establish in area beyond national jurisdiction any such measure will be agree in meeting of the conference of the party and will aim to manage activity in geographically define area of the ocean to achieve conservation and sustainable use objective part also ensure that the uk can implement any emergency measure adopt by the conference of the party to respond to any natural or man make disaster in area beyond national jurisdiction that may require for example restriction on navigation of uk ship or discharge from uk craft part update domestic marine licensing legislation to meet the environmental impact assessment requirement set out in the agreement these change apply to licensable marine activity that take place in area beyond national jurisdiction it provide the power need to adapt the uk domestic marine licensing and relate environmental assessment system as new international standard and guideline be agree by the bbnj conference of the party for example that may include apply the late standard for environmental assessment or for the ongoing monitoring of impact in short it will future proof the uk marine licensing legislation ensure that we can keep pace with emerge technology and activity in area beyond national jurisdiction in addition to the bill secondary legislation be require before the uk can formally ratify the bbnj agreement we will need to make change to domestic legislation to implement the bbnj agreement provision relate to environmental impact assessment and to define digital sequence information those issue require engagement with stakeholder and statutory instrument will be lay before parliament after the bill receive royal assent once the secondary legislation be in force standard six week process will allow we to finalise the instrument of ratification which include signature and formal submission to the united nations the provision in the bill may appear to be narrow and technical but once implement they will enable the uk to participate fully in global effort to conserve and sustainably use the ocean beyond national jurisdiction work with our international partner the bbnj agreement will allow we to safeguard fragile ecosystem protect endanger specie and ensure that scientific benefit be share fairly and responsibly the bill be root in this government broad environmental and international goal we be protect and improve the marine environment at home and internationally to meet the global commitment to protect of the world ocean by and this bill be key instrument in deliver that goal the bill support our effort to maintain multilateral agreement and international governance as the bedrock of our global community and to address collectively the big issue of our generation climate change food insecurity and harm to marine environment issue that affect not just the uk but every nation on earth hope that member will recognise the urgency and importance of this moment the ocean can not wait and the consequence of inaction be profound this bill be an opportunity to act to protect marine life to support sustainable development and to ensure that the benefit of the ocean be share fairly and responsibly commend this bill to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for her explanation of the bill it be an important piece of legislation and thank she for acknowledge that it start under the previous government hope there will be consensus but there be many question to be answer and we need to go into this legislation in lot of detail to ensure that there be not unintended consequence nobody in this house doubt the importance of protect our ocean the high sea belong to we all to every nation on this planet and the united kingdom as proud seafaring nation and world leader in natural science with no less than overseas territory span for now at least all five of the world major ocean have always lead the world in safeguard they the protection of our ocean be one of the define challenge of our age two third of the world ocean lie beyond the jurisdiction of any single nation and those water be home to vast array of life that sustain the planet ecosystem britain depend on the sea for our trade they have be moat for our national security and be our bridge to the wide world we therefore have not only moral duty to protect they but strategic one one of the core value of the small conservatism that believe in as the name suggest be to conserve thing that truly matter that apply not only to our institution and our way of life here in these island but to the preservation of our green and pleasant land and in this case that of the marine biodiversity so that we can hand on to our descendant the natural beauty that know we all cherish that principle be certainly not in question today by anyone in this house of any party nowhere be our record clear than in the crown jewel of our leadership on the environment that be the blue belt programme through it the united kingdom and our overseas territory have create over million sq km of marine protect area from the south atlantic and the pacific to the indian ocean these water safeguard king penguin on the falkland islands green turtle on ascension island grey reef shark on the pitcairn islands and countless other specie across the globe have have the privilege to visit the falkland islands and ascension island and see the amazing biodiversity that we be responsible for and the ocean around those territory be vital to protect the blue belt be one of the large network of protect ocean on earth and it exist because of british leadership alongside the government of the british overseas territory we grant those creature and their habitat protection from exploitation by other from industrial fishing fleet and from country that would plunder our resource without second thought that be something this nation should be immensely proud of be listen carefully to what the hon member be say and he be absolutely right on the blue belt do he therefore regret that in all the debate we have have about the chagos islands the conservatives have not raise the importance of the conservation of the fish stock and the biodiversity around those island the chairman of the foreign affairs committee be be afraid incorrect we have raise those issue on many occasion and have personally raise they on countless occasion over the year before too long the right hon member will hear bit more about the chagos islands and the importance of protect marine stock and biodiversity in that part of the world despite what have be say today fear that at this stage the government be rid roughshod over that record and undermine those very principle through their abject surrender of marine protect area the british indian ocean territory might look like scattering of remote atoll in far flung region of the planet but they be home to sq km of ocean one of the most pristine marine ecosystem on the earth an area of ocean the size of france within it live more than specie of fish and over specie of coral have the opportunity to see it for myself in when visit the chagos island in particular the atoll of peros banhos where be greet by the wonderful chagossian coconut crab as jump out of the dinghy and walk on to the beach and into the uninhabited island where we shamefully force the people to leave their home all those year ago and refuse to allow they to return its water shelter seabird turtle and dolphin it be an environmental treasure that the world envy and that britain have rightly protect over so many year be the hon gentleman aware that mauritius be one of the early signatory to the un global ocean treaty if so be not sure what his point be the hon member should examine how mauritius behave in reality which will come to later if we want nation that will actually take these issue seriously it be the united kingdom it be easy to sign treaty it be not so easy to follow it through in practice in what believe to be an act of historic folly this government be to hand that amazing territory over to mauritius that nation do not have the record the capability or the will to protect such fragile environment its own water have suffer from overfishe and poor enforcement its close alignment with china and indeed india should concern anyone who care about the indian ocean future indeed the evidence speak for itself in the environmental performance index mauritius rank for marine key biodiversity area protection with score of just out of for marine habitat protection and for marine protection stringency down nearly be these the credential of nation ready to steward one of the world most delicate ecosystem the government appear to think so disagree be just wonder whether the hon member find himself in the wrong debate order be oversee the debate if the hon member have be in the wrong debate would have point it out thank you madam deputy speaker some of we do care about our british overseas territory and the marine environment some of we have make these argument for many many year as have many on the government benches if we be to take this issue seriously we need to take our responsibility seriously otherwise future generation not just in this country but across the world will look back at this debate and what we be do today and think what on earth be they do give away such vital part of the planet that we be responsible for either the government truly believe that mauritius will reverse course and persuade china to respect this marine protect area or as be afraid the chagos surrender treaty imply we shall end up do the heavy lifting while pay for the privilege forgive for not be entirely convince but do not believe that the statistic have cite be those of nation ready to take on responsibility for one of the world most delicate marine ecosystem scientific assessment show that live coral cover in mauritian water fall by up to in the late while coastal erosion and reef degradation continue unchecked united nations review in find that while on paper mauritius have environmental law enforcement be inconsistent community involvement be limited and response to emerge threat such as ocean acidification remain inadequate unbelievably seagrass bed which be vital for carbon storage and marine biodiversity be still clear to make way for tourism development be this really the environmental guardian that minister be entrust with sq km of some of the most pristine ocean on earth it beggar belief we need to look around the world to see what happen when chinese fishing interest move in in ecuador thousand of octopus and shark have be leave dead on the shore because of illegal fishing by chinese vessel we need to guard against that in future off the coast of ghana fisherman catch have fall by due to chinese bottom trawler decimate local fish stock around the korean peninsula squid population have collapse by hope that this legislation and this agreement will help to protect the ocean around the world and country where there be no protection at the moment if the chagos island be hand over the same fleet will soon appear in some of those water and chagos will be at the mercy of exploitation that be the context in which the house be consider the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction bill it run to clause as the minister have say it be impossible to run through they all today but no doubt we will look at they in great detail in committee there be however several point that must be address in today debate when will ratification happen clause provide for the commencement of regulation but without any statutory deadline or parliamentary trigger leave ratification entirely at the discretion of the secretary of state to add to that clause and grant far reach power to the secretary of state to make regulation to amend exist act of parliament by secondary legislation where be parliament role in that how will the house scrutinise decision take by the conference of the party under the agreement will we be consult before international rule be impose on british institution and industry will british water or those of our overseas territory ever fall under the jurisdiction of foreign or supranational regulator we surely can not allow global bureaucracy to override british parliamentary sovereignty beyond the question of control lie the spectre of bureaucracy clause and impose heavy reporting duty on marine research and genetic sampling clause allow still more procedure by regulation have the department assess what that will cost in time and money for our scientist and shipping operator and for legitimate researcher how will small british enterprise compete if they face mountain of paperwork while less scrupulous nation exploit the same water freely we all support high standard but in the world we currently live in we can not afford to lose innovation or competitiveness then there be the matter of expense the impact assessment admit that compliance licensing and enforcement will not be cheap yet provide little detail on who pay at time of fiscal restraint when every department must justify every pound spend can the minister explain whether this legislation will truly be the good use of taxpayer money how much will it cost to implement the bbnj regime in full will the task of monitor fall to the royal navy or the marine management organisation and what extra resource will they receive to do the job what be the cost benefit ratio and have the government assess whether there could be indirect impact on the taxpayer what of the impact on british industry fisherman offshore energy and biotechnology can the minister assure we that british fisherman will not face restriction that our energy sector will not be burden by impractical licensing demand and that our biotech pioneer will not find their discovery trap in international bureaucracy wonder if could offer some helpful clarity this debate be on bbnj biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction with the word beyond give clue to the fact that it do not relate to british water the point the hon gentleman be raise about what impact the high sea will have on offshore wind development here might therefore not be entirely valid and his point about the impact on british fisherman fish in uk water might not be cover by the global ocean treaty wonder if it might be helpful for he to read the explanatory note alongside the bill the minister will have plenty of time to explain all these matter in detail in committee this be second reading when we raise issue of concern look forward to committee and to all my question be answer at that stage if not today thank she for her intervention what safeguard will protect british intellectual property in marine genetic research will the benefit share provision prevent our scientist from develop the fruit of their own work will other nation shoulder equal obligation or will britain be leave carry the cost because we be do the right thing and other be not our research institution be some of the most prestigious global leader in the marine sector whether it be the natural history museum the national oceanography centre or our magnificent university first and foremost there must be guarantee from the government that this bill will not drown they in red tape clause rightly extend the bill provision to the british overseas territory which be central to our environmental success story from the pitcairn island with their resident to tristan da cunha home to barely resident these far fling britons have show what small community can achieve for global conservation when they have british support but how can they have confidence in the government assurance when they witness what be happen in chagos if minister be willing to trade away one british territory without consultation or consent what message do that send to the rest remind the house that conservation with the loss of sovereignty and without credible mean of enforcement be hollow virtue the united kingdom have record to be proud of from captain cook to david attenborough we must build on that record and not undermine it with rush ratification if ministers will answer the question that have lay out and if they will commit in statute to parliamentary oversight fully cost implementation plan explicit safeguard for british science and intellectual property and legally enforceable protection for the overseas territory many on the conservative benches will consider how to support measure that genuinely conserve our sea if they will not and other order mr rosindell can check that you be near your conclusion be marvellous be literally about to get there madam deputy speaker if ministers will not do so and other will oppose any step that weaken britain hand end where begin as conservative our principle be that we want to conserve to keep safe to steward and to defend what we be responsible for we must be true to that principle we must continue to act as custodian of the sea in way that respect our sovereignty honour our obligation to our descendant and protect the livelihood and ecosystem that depend on the united kingdom be really proud to be stand here today because it be an historic day for ocean conservation let we make no mistake the world ocean be under significant threat the intergovernmental panel on climate change estimate that if global warming reach of coral reef will die if temperature rise by as now sadly look likely of the earth coral reef will die coral reef be not just pretty thing that we go diving on they be incredibly complex and important ecosystem they be fish nursery but they also provide significant protection for islander from both adverse weather and sea level rise other threat include illegal unreported and unregulated fishing which be decimate fish population across the globe and deep sea mining which threaten to cause damage from which ecosystem will take decade to recover currently two third of the ocean lie outside the jurisdiction of national state and that be what the bill focus on for the health of ocean and the planet as whole it be crucial that the international community develop way of ensure that these area be not subject to lawless exploitation as be currently happen in january this year as chair of the international development committee my hon friend write to the government to push they to ratify the global oceans treaty as member of her committee thank she for her effort on this front if recall correctly our committee work highlight that the uk have to work globally because there be billion people who depend on the ocean for work especially in poor small develop nation do she agree that this be vital step forward for the future especially of small island develop state and that the government must push other who have sign up to this treaty to ratify it thank my hon friend and colleague he be absolutely right and that be why today be so historic this be the uk take that leadership role and hopefully corral some of the other country that be more reticent to do the right thing the international development committee and the all party parliamentary group for the ocean both of which chair have long be call on both the previous government and this government to put in place the necessary legislation to ratify this agreement to have finally reach this point be credit to the ministers particularly the minister for water and flooding my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy but also the minister responsible for the indo pacific my hon friend the member for feltham and heston seema malhotra and the minister of state for international development and africa my noble friend baroness chapman in an era of international fragmentation be relieved that state have come together to forge this agreement and safeguard global public good as my hon friend the member for rushcliffe james naish allude to country have already take the next step of ratification be very proud that the minister for water and flooding be champion this in opposition and have deliver on her word lead this ratification in government thank she for that as seafaring nation and centre of expertise in maritime law the uk be perfectly place to lead the charge to protect the world ocean sadly we be lag behind many country include the seychelles st lucia and barbados which ratify the agreement last year it be not surprising that the small island develop state or sid or large ocean state as they prefer to be call be quick to ratify because they recognise the existential threat that ocean ecosystem degradation pose to human society and their economy as the international development committee argue in our report last year sid need reliable partner the uk talk good game when it come to responsible global leadership but activist and policymaker from sid tell the committee they be concern about the consistency of britain commitment hope we will see that change at this moment under this government and that we will stand up for small island develop state particularly our overseas territory which the hon member for romford andrew rosindell mention the health of the world ocean be not an issue confine to low income country it be an existential issue for all of we as the government impact assessment acknowledge the impact of reduce fish stock and decrease capacity will be bear by all of we include future generation the uk must seize this moment to match its international conservation ambition with tangible action to protect our domestic water bottom trawl fishing highly destructive practice be still permit across almost all of the uk sea include in more than of our marine protect area welcome the government consultation on that and hope that they will take the necessary step to ban that practice wherever they can the government must consider introduce additional legislation to ensure that the uk marine protect area be actually protect because sadly even though they have the title many of they be not the bill also offer plentiful opportunity for the uk blue economy as world leader in marine science and technology to support quick progress the uk need definition of the use of marine genetic resource and digital sequence information by the time the agreement be ratify that be to support all those who will implement it the uk next step be vital to ensure that we fulfil our leadership role in ocean protection the day countdown have start the first conference of the party ocean will be hold within just month with the clock ticking will the minister set out timetable for the passage of the bill through both houses we need it to pass quickly to allow the uk to play its full part in the first conference will the minister also confirm whether the bill legally extend the uk exist domestic duty to have regard to the precautionary and polluter pay principle to the high sea if not will she say whether something to that effect should or could be insert into the bill will the minister consider produce an ocean strategy ocean issue currently fall between number of different departments which unfortunately mean they be under the ownership of none the bill be to be commend and must attain royal assent without delay strongly urge all member to support it call the liberal democrat spokesperson it be privilege to speak in support of this bill this be hugely important step that as the minister lay out will finally allow the united kingdom to ratify the high seas treaty and play its full part in protect our share global ocean that be something that hope members across the chamber will support share in congratulation to the minister on keep her word that she give as shadow minister that be really good to see the bill come at crucial time after more than decade of negotiation this treaty be one of the great biodiversity conservation victory in history it be landmark moment for global ocean governance set out for the first time clear legal framework for establish ocean sanctuary and area base management tool on the high sea two third of which lie beyond national border and be therefore currently lawless we refer to our rainforest as our planet lung but our ocean be just as important for biodiversity regulate our climate absorb almost third of human make carbon dioxide and sustain billion of people around the world as we have hear they be also under extraordinary pressure from overfishe plastic pollution and the grow threat of deep sea mining the treaty be currently the only viable pathway to meet the global by biodiversity goal of protect at least of the world ocean before currently less than of the high sea be fully protect so time be run out to meet that goal by the end of the decade welcome the bill which provide the legal framework for the uk to deliver on the high seas treaty three central pillar first the fair sharing of benefit from marine genetic resource the dna and datum of ocean life secondly the creation of marine protect area and area base management tool on the high sea and thirdly strong environmental impact assessment to prevent harmful activity before they happen this have to be fair for develop nation and capacity building and technology transfer be central to that this be personal to before enter parliament spend over decade work professionally on the creation of marine protect area in east africa and south america help to create the first ever multiple use marine reserve together with fisherman and government in zanzibar on misali island then spend several year mediate conflict and reach consensus between fisherman tour operator the galapagos national park and the government to help create the galapagos marine reserve which at that time be one of the large mpa create since then have be involve in work towards international marine governance beyond national jurisdiction the high seas treaty as well as the uk blue belt programme and work with community and official on all those overseas territory have see at first hand what be at stake from work with fisherman to prevent the destruction of coral reef by dynamite fishing to the terrifying news that we have reach the first climate tipping point with our precious and beautiful warm water coral reef now in irreversible decline put at threat the livelihood of hundred of million of people have also mediate negotiation with the fishing sector on deep water fishing to find sustainable fishing quota and standard for tuna fishing while protect vital marine corridor for our endanger marine mammal and bird have dive along those tag whale shark to understand the route that they take across the high sea beyond national jurisdiction that be often the wild west where we be face the tragedy of the common and there be no agree rule or governance to stop everyone in the race from take as much as possible before someone else do that be why it be so important to highlight that the global ocean treaty could provide legal mechanism to address the blue hole in the south atlantic region require agreement about what be sustainable fishing practice and way effectively to deter terribly unsustainable activity that be why the liberal democrats be call for coherent ocean policy and an ocean strategy that link the global commitment we make through the bill to strong domestic action on marine protection sustainable fishing and pollution at home the uk be instrumental in secure an ambitious treaty text at the un and we should take pride in that however as other member have say we must be honest the uk be not among the first nation to ratify that treaty and that matter because where britain lead other follow the commitment be make today must be match with commitment to sustainable fishery management and marine conservation back in our own water our credibility and moral authority on the world stage be under threat when ministers seem to say that we might not implement an outright ban on bottom trawling despite pledge early this year to extend the ban on bottom tow fishing gear to offshore protect area be member of the environmental audit committee inquiry into marine governance which recommend the ban on bottom trawl ahead of the un ocean conference and we commend the government on their announcement at that time fully support the committee chair response which repeat the committee call to completely ban bottom trawling within offshore mpa and plead with the minister and the government to take the right decision on the back of the consultation that be happen now and not to undermine the integrity of our protect water in conclusion the liberal democrats be clear we support the bill and we urge the government to bring forward ratification swiftly hope members across the chamber will support that so that the uk have seat at the table when ocean take place and go forward like other very much welcome the bill and hope it swiftly pass into law so that we can play full role at ocean next year if we look back beyond recent year we have people such as john kerry and david miliband as co chair of the global ocean commission spearhead effort on this front but it then feel as if the issue drop off the agenda next year will be important for ensure that it become priority again will start by say why the ocean matter why they be under threat and why protect they be so important as we have hear ocean be massive carbon sink they absorb over of excess heat trap by greenhouse gas as well as around to of global carbon dioxide emission they host around of all life form many of which be still wait to be discover they be under threat from plastic pollution ocean acidification and the bleaching of coral reef and from overfishe on an unsustainable industrial scale the large factory trawler have net mouth of up to metre wide and to metre deep that sweep up hundred of tonne of fish and seafood in one trip much of which be bycatch not for human consumption that be then discard oceana have call this marine deforestation akin to clear fell an entire rainforest when you only look to harvest one type of tree the environmental justice foundation have do some brilliant report in the past into slavery and labour exploitation as part of this industrial scale fishing particularly in the thai seafood sector the fish stock in territorial water be deplete but the far afield those ship go the high the risk to the worker that be keep at sea for year at time accord to the united nations food and agriculture organisation between and of assess fish stock be be fish beyond biologically sustainable level that figure be much high in the high sea and in straddle fish stock with two third classify as over exploit or deplete that include iconic specie such as shark that be crucial part of the ocean ecosystem it be estimate that there have be decline in the ocean population of shark and ray since some of oceanic shark and ray specie be threaten with extinction roughly million shark year be kill by human through target fishing shark finning and bycatch many of we will have see the blue planet series that do such brilliant job at highlight among other thing the threat of plastic pollution and at spur call to action want to give shout out to bbc bristol natural history unit which have be hugely influential as well as give great enjoyment to all the people who have see its programme it be great shame that agreement still have not be reach on global plastic treaty and we must keep up the effort on that front hope that sir david attenborough late production ocean will have similar impact when it come to bottom trawling as sir david say what we have do to the deep ocean floor be just unspeakably awful he say that the trawler tear the seabed with such force that the trail of destruction can be see from space it be report that some of the material film for the programme be deem too shocking to be show due to climate change more than half the world straddle fish stock will shift across maritime border between economic exclusion zone and the high sea by in the high sea fishery management be much more challenging and stock be much more likely to be over exploit as say early that make the need for marine protect area in the high sea even more important as we have hear as well as be an island nation ourselves because of our overseas territory the uk be the custodian of fifth of the world territorial water that mean that we be the neighbour which be the next good thing as custodian of much of the high sea include the sargasso sea greenpeace be call on the uk to take lead in work with our overseas territory bermuda on develop an ocean sanctuary proposal for the sargasso sea ready to present it at the first ocean cop next year the sargasso sea be uniquely biodiverse and important ecosystem the float sargassum mat be know as the golden float rainforest and they be haven for juvenile fish and turtle spawn ground for rich range of specie and an important migratory pathway for humpback whale as generator of massive carbon sequestration and oxygen production the sargasso sea be vital in tackle climate change and planetary health but it be at risk of overfishe pollution and shipping traffic there be much support in bermuda for the proposal and hope that we will be able to take that forward next year give our strength as global financial centre the uk be uniquely well place to play role in develop innovative financial instrument that will help finance marine protection build on what country like seychelles and belize have do with their blue bond and their debt restructuring at last year we launch our six principle for high integrity carbon and nature market and they have be out for consultation this year in world where public sector resource and donation be dwindle the world be look to make progress on leverage private sector finance in meaningful and sustainable way that could be of huge benefit to climate vulnerable coastal country and small island state but could also be applicable to fund marine protect area in the high sea make it economically viable to protect our sea rather than to plunder they have hear that the treasury may be less enthused about the nature side of these voluntary market than the carbon side but hope that be not the case will certainly keep up the pressure on the treasury to take this forward want to speak briefly about deep sea mining to which be totally opposed deep sea mining could cause irreversible damage to deep ecosystem and loss of undiscovered biodiversity understand that the current uk position as confirm by an fcdo ministerial answer last month be that we back the suspension of deep sea mining and support moratorium on the granting of deep sea mining contract by the international seabed authority the minister say that we will not grant licence for exploitation unless there be sufficient scientific evidence about the potential impact on deep sea ecosystem and strong enforceable environmental regulations standards and guidelines however it be not clear what power we will have through this international collaboration to stop other country issue such licence so hope that the minister will clarify that in she sum up be little concerned that the measure in the bill about marine genetic resource will open the door to deep sea mining accept that there be case for explore the potential of such resource if carry out under strong safeguard but would resist any attempt to allow deep sea mining to occur finally while welcome international initiative and as have be make clear the bill address area beyond national jurisdiction we need to lead by example with strong protection for our own territorial water as have be say there have be some progress notably around our overseas territory but perhaps it be easy to act when those area be thousand of mile away and do not have the same economic interest there have be great work around ascension pitcairn and south georgia but there be more of mixed picture around the uk coast dogger bank in the north sea be one of the large marine protect area since it be establish in it have benefit from reduction in bottom trawling support the recovery of marine specie like halibut cod angel shark and eel as it say in the uk national biodiversity strategy and action plan all marine protect area must be well manage enforce and effective not paper park we could start by move fast to end all bottom trawl in our marine protect area the recent excellent report blue carbon publish by the world wide fund for nature the wildlife trusts and the royal society for the protection of birds set out blue carbon mapping project carry out with the help of the scottish association for marine science we be the first country to undertake such mapping we know about the importance of kelp forest seagrass meadow and mangrove but it be the less glamorous sediment on our seabed that be the true hero in carbon sequestration the report find that million tonne of organic carbon be store in just the top cm of seabed sediment and vegetate habitat and of that be in the sediment such as the mud in my role as minister for climate it frustrate that we talk so much about the role of tree and forest in carbon sequestration but we do not talk about the ocean at all be tell that that be because it be difficult to quantify so this project be great example if this be the amount of carbon work that be be do by the seabed around the uk coast just think about the amount that the seabed of our high sea be do we must have action on that at ocean cop hope that the bill will be enact very soon and look forward to next year discussion less than of the high sea be fully protect there could not be more important time for this treaty it be the world only viable pathway to meet the global biodiversity goal of protect at least of the world ocean before along with my liberal democrat colleague welcome the fact that the government be finally bring forward this legislation it be disappointing that the uk be not among the first country to reach the threshold to get the treaty ratify especially give the long cross party support for the subject in this house but hope ratification will be swift to allow the uk seat at the table at ocean cop we liberal democrats have long be push for the strong possible marine environmental target both internationally and domestically include through the ratification of the global oceans treaty the bill be welcome but we must not be complacent global plastic production and waste have double in the last year and more than million tonne of plastic be dump into the ocean every single year put countless specie at risk of extinction in the bbc report that there be more than trillion piece of plastic float in the world ocean that be simply shocking and totally unacceptable biodiversity rely on healthy ocean but plastic pollution climate change and unsustainable fishing practice be destroy our marine biodiversity with of marine specie at risk we must act now community across the world rely on the ocean for their livelihood job and food security indeed we all rely on the ocean for our livelihood but we be take more from the ocean than can be replenish with of big fish population deplete and of coral reef already destroy the first ocean cop be on the horizon for next year which will give the uk an important seat at the table if we ratify the treaty in time while there the uk should champion further measure to protect our ocean include ban on bottom trawling in marine protect area bottom trawling be most terrifying practice that damage the seabed kill animal and plant indiscriminately and release carbon from the sea floor in very large proportion which drive climate change if member have not watch the documentary ocean with david attenborough please do it be terrify once watch it make pledge that would not eat fish until we have at least sign the ocean treaty so there be personal reason why push the government for early ratification love fish and this should not be call not to eat fish this be about protect the ocean if member watch the david attenborough film they will see that good and positive thing be that the ocean can recover very quickly if we give they the option to recover that be why today be such an important day the british public be with we some of british adult say that they would like to see bottom trawling ban in mpas accord to polling from oceana the environmental audit committee back the call to ban bottom trawling in september the department for environment food and rural affairs tell the environmental audit committee that it would not roll out an outright ban implore the government to reconsider we must manage our territorial water effectively and we could start by implement the fisheries act in full through that we could reform the fishing quota distribution to phase out the fix quota allocation system which largely reward those with the deep pocket it could be replace with system that reward and incentivise low impact from fish that deliver environmental social and economic benefit to community around our coast we must also look more closely at illegal and unregulated fishing hide overfishing when illegal discard be unaccounted for in fishing quota be drive stock into severe decline marine group be urge the government to introduce strategy to tackle overfishe by the end of include catch limit and fair deal for fisher adjust to low catch limit the transparency around enforcement and monitoring of fishing activity in uk sea be not adequate the marine management organisation be not even require to publish datum on the enforcement of fishing regulation we be tell that post brexit the uk would establish good in class fishery management as an independent coastal state but we have not take advantage of that freedom to strengthen our regulation welcome the bill as an important starting point but if we be serious about protect the blue heart of our planet this must be just the beginning of real action to restore the health of ocean across the world and here at home repeat the liberal democrats call for coherent ocean policy be delighted to rise to support the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction bill the introduction of this legislation mark the beginning of process for the uk to ratify and implement the global ocean treaty this vital agreement enable the protection of international marine life no protection currently exist for wildlife such as fish turtle and dolphin that inhabit the high sea over which no one country have jurisdiction the ocean which cover more than of the surface of our planet be vital share resource it provide we with sustenance oxygen and genetic resource for food medicine and research it be also our great ally in the fight against climate change as the large carbon sink on the planet however it be an ecosystem under perilous threat increase ocean temperature be symptomatic of the warming climate and endanger we on land through decrease capacity to absorb carbon dioxide in the atmosphere rise sea level and the loss of vital marine life and resource the introduction of this legislation reaffirm this government dedication to protect global marine life as well as mitigate climate change and improve our natural environment in the current moment when the environmental consensus be at risk and there be those who would retreat from the world pretend that we can draw up metaphorical drawbridge and keep safe behind the safety of political castle wall this bill be significant marker of this government commitment to multilateral process which be in fact the only way to address some of the great challenge of our time this debate be one of many on the environment and nature that have attend in recent week and month to which not single conservative backbench mp have bother to turn up do not say that to thumb my nose at they say it because it be profoundly depressing oppose the tory party with every fibre of my being but it be one of the great political party of western europe over the last and more year and it have just give up his majesty official opposition be just not interested that be not just today it be in debate after debate that attend some hard work opposition front bencher turn up but not single person sit behind they say to they in the most earnest sincerity that election defeat be disappointing but the tory party have to man up it must turn up and start take this seriously because these be matter of the most supreme importance and we can not have the official opposition just refuse to engage have to say that the comment from the hon member for romford andrew rosindell be pretty lukewarm understand that the previous government look at this issue for quite some time but they never get as far as legislate in listen to what he say be leave uncertain of how supportive the opposition actually be of the propose measure we will find out more in committee hope that have commit to this issue in government but never actually legislate on it they will get behind this important legislation as we have hear this bill fulfil the commitment make by the labour government at the un ocean conference and in opposition the ocean need uk leadership and action the evidence that the eac receive during our recent inquiry govern the marine environment paint worrying picture of the state of the marine environment it be under threat globally from global warming pollution and overexploitation lead to decline in population of marine mammal bird reptile and fish specie accord to the living planet index uk sea be also in poor condition fail on most of the indicator of good environmental status in the most recent assessment by the government however there be some good news marine conservation effort be effective when we do they they work while only of the ocean be currently protect in marine protect area remarkably half of all catalogue marine specie have be report in those area some of specie face extinction have find refuge in marine protect area the government be take important action to well protect the of uk sea already designate as marine protect area repeat what have be say by other colleague we want to see the government go far damaging activity can still take place in those area but the consultation refer to by my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy be vital nearly two third of the ocean be consider high sea or international water which pose governance and logistical challenge how be it possible to protect area that be beyond the jurisdiction of any one nation that be why the global oceans treaty of be so significant landmark moment in provide the legal foundation for establish mpa in area beyond national jurisdiction the creation of protect area in the high sea be essential to make by reality this bill which establish the legal framework necessary for the uk to meet its obligation be vital its royal assent will lay the groundwork for the uk to ratify that agreement as we have hear country have already ratify the treaty so it will come into force next january and the first un ocean conference will be hold within the year as such it be vital that the uk get on with ratify that treaty so that it can be party to discussion and can shape agreement set out timeline for the uk ratification of the global oceans treaty be one of the key recommendation of the environmental audit committee so we welcome the prime minister and my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice have keep their word on that this be narrow bill that allow the uk to fulfil our global commitment caution well mean ally against extend the process or undermine the commitment that the government have make by attempt to attach to the bill other commitment that be not relevant to it and create division in this incredibly important area what we need be unity however the ratification of this treaty be just the start we have much more to do to protect of the ocean by and establish marine sanctuary where marine life can thrive to conclude strongly support the bill look forward to its passage through parliament and thank the government for prioritise this issue despite heavy legislative workload it be welcome development that provide the power and regulation need for the uk to ratify the treaty work with other nation the ocean have long struggle to get the attention they deserve there be no voter out there on the ocean thank be owe to sir david attenborough and the many filmmaker and photographer who over the year have bring the ocean into our live room and help we to get to know they and care about they most of we only get to experience ocean from beach or from foot look down from an aeroplane window at vast endless blue expanse but have spend month and month alone on the ocean long way beyond national jurisdiction row across ocean to raise awareness of the environmental crisis face our world particularly the part of it that be blue be try to bring human face to the plight of our ocean out there in the middle of an ocean when you have not see dry land for several month thousand of mile separate you from the close land mass and the near human being be on the international space station it feel like you be well beyond jurisdiction and often beyond justice it be out there in that lawless place that come to understand both the power and the fragility of the ocean you see its beauty and its bounty but also its vulnerability to what we human choose to do the ocean have no voice in this place so today we be be its voice the ocean may seem boundless but it be not indestructible we have pollute it overfishe it and warm it the deep sea be home to some of the most extraordinary form of life on earth be particularly pleased to hear the minister refer to sunfish which be surely the weird creature have ever see but it be increasingly target for exploitation we know the surface of the moon well than we know the bottom of the ocean there be real danger that we could destroy specie before we even know they exist more than of the world surface and nearly three quarter of its ocean volume lie out there in the place beyond any country control for century the high sea have be treat as no one responsibility beyond the environment lawless expanse and still today only be properly protect meanwhile overfishing pollution and deep sea mining be degrade ecosystem that we barely understand the ocean be become more acidic threaten the existence of plankton the base of the entire marine food chain and weaken its capacity to absorb carbon and regulate our climate that be what be at stake the health of the ocean be the health of our planet that be why the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty matter so profoundly it be the first global treaty to bring order fairness and protection to the high sea it offer framework for manage those share water responsibly and ensure that the benefit of ocean science be share globally not hoard by the few early this year when bring the climate and nature bill before this house far press the government to commit to ratify the bbnj and be pleased and thankful that they be now deliver on that promise particularly thank the minister the hon member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy for her long term persistence and commitment to this cause it show that when we work together across the house we can turn ambition into action however ratification be only the beginning turn this treaty into practical reality will demand co ordination funding and focus as such would like to ask the minister few practical question about implementation from the fcdo perspective question that have send to her office first on institutional co ordination how will departments such as the fcdo defra and the department for transport work together to manage marine genetic resource environmental assessment and new conservation tool under single coherent system secondly on enforcement what mechanism will ensure compliance by uk vessel and research institution operate beyond national jurisdiction give the real challenge of which be keenly aware of surveillance and jurisdiction at sea thirdly turn to resource and capacity have the government assess the staffing budget and technical resource need to set up the new repository database and administrative system require by the bbnj fourthly on transparency and fairness what plan be in place to ensure that the datum hold by repository such as the natural history museum and the national oceanography centre be accessible and interoperable especially for develop country include small island state in line with the bbnj principle of equitable benefit sharing finally on international engagement with the first ocean cop expect in how will the uk prepare to shape the operational detail of the agreement at the international level and who will represent we at that table these question matter because they will determine whether the bill deliver real protection rather than just good intention our scientist be ready to lead the national oceanography centre with its cutting edge research and fleet of autonomous submersible vessel include one know as boaty mcboatface be already map deep sea current and gather the knowledge we need to understand and protect the ocean under the bbnj that vital work will become part of global effort to heal the sea the ocean be the blue heart of our planet it give we half the oxygen we breathe shape our weather and sustain life on scale that defy our humble human imagination if that heart falter everything we depend on will be at risk we often think of ocean as divide nation but actually they connect and unite we we be so to speak all in the same boat as the great american oceanographer dr sylvia earle say we need to respect the ocean and take care of they as if our life depend on it because they do by ratify and implement the bbnj we can help turn the tide sorry just can not help it let this be the parliament that give the ocean voice and future it have be almost year since first meet professor alex rogers at two day conference at somerville college oxford convene by the global legislators organisation for balanced environment the subject be international law on the high sea the young postdoctoral fellow inspire we about the amazing biodiversity of our global ocean use the singular deliberately but he also frustrate we by explain that the international community lack any legal framework to protect it the ocean account for of our planet by volume and nearly two third by surface area every second breath we take be supply to we by the ocean some of the excess heat in the climate system have be absorb by the ocean the ocean be our great nature base solution to climate change and it be only by restore the health of our marine ecosystem that we can deliver on our promise to meet the by target in the kunming montreal global biodiversity framework the bbnj treaty be the missing part of the jigsaw that be why today debate be so important and why the bill be so important the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction bill be welcome and necessary but we must recognise what the treaty be and what it be not we must do so not in order to understate what the bill do but to understand clearly what action we must take follow its passage we will need secondary legislation to implement the treaty and dare say this before the budget will require adequate funding the treaty create framework for the establishment of protect area on the high sea but it do not in and of itself create those protect area it be therefore important that the government start to develop proposal for high sea mpas especially in region of the world where the uk be party to the relevant regional fishery management organisation commend defra for the work that it have already do in its stocktake of area base management tool in area beyond national jurisdiction this be really important baseline ask the minister to set out in her response to the debate what further work be plan to identify support and deliver specific mpa be particularly keen to hear how she might develop the supplementary report that have already be prepare on the sargasso sea will she confirm that this internationally significant ecosystem be priority for the development of an mpa it have now be year since the sargasso sea be recognise as an ecologically or biologically significant area have meet all seven ebsa criterion our country history have leave legacy that legacy be our exclusive economic zone which be the fifth large in the world largely due to our remain overseas territory but that legacy bring responsibility with it pay tribute to the work of the previous conservative administration who expand the blue belt programme to nominally protect more than million sq km of ocean from anguilla in the caribbean to pitcairn in the pacific ocean in the last year the programme take satellite imagery of more than million sq km of uk overseas territory water provide crucial monitoring and surveillance to crack down on illegal unreported and unregulated fishing activity it be this very tangible knowledge and expertise that the uk should be at the forefront of deliver through the first bbnj cop which will take place within year of the treaty take force from january welcome the announcement follow the spending review that the blue belt programme will receive increase funding for however give that million of this million come from official development assistance which itself be be cut hope it will not seem churlish if ask that the programme be ringfence for the future for much of human history we do not need the bbnj treaty the high sea be protect from the bad impact of human activity by the simple reality that they be so far from land and too difficult to access the dawn of the industrial age and motorise ocean go vessel change all that even specie that live their whole life hundred or thousand of mile from land be no long safe from human exploitation nothing epitomise that sad reality more than the slaughter of the great whale industrialised whaling cause the death of nearly million whale even the blue whale the large animal that have ever live have its number reduce by more than whale size and the fact of spend most of their life in inhospitable and hard to reach part of the open ocean have keep they safe for millennia but the introduction of new and more powerful technology mean that even they become the victim of massive over exploitation today there be few than north atlantic right whale leave in our ocean and why be it call the right whale ironically it acquire its name because it be rich in blubber and baleen it move slowly and it float after be kill so it be easily tow in to be butcher so it be deem the right whale to hunt the history of these great mammal show just why we now need the bbnj biodiversity be no long protect by its remoteness from land human greed will destroy it wherever it be find on our planet unless we act decisively to regulate our most destructive activity today although the international whaling ban be still ignore by few country whale be no long threaten by hunter on the whole but they be kill by ship strike and they be entangle in fishing gear emphasise the importance of the international ban not just because believe that it be one of the most important conservation achievement of the century but because it be great achievement of multilateralism something that be not much in vogue at the moment it show how by act in concert with other nation we can mobilise popular support around environmental objective with both clear ecological and clear moral purpose and we can achieve result regard it as an inspiration and template for what we be now do in the bbnj the huge factory ship that once slaughter whale have largely go but in their place equally large factory ship now plunder the ocean as if it be bottomless pit of profit there be longliner set fishing line ten of kilometre long each with up to hook and huge purse seiner use net that be km long and metre deep imagine net that be twice as deep as big ben the elizabeth tower be tall and which stretch out so far from this house of commons that it take in the whole of buckingham palace and most of its garden these fishing enterprise devastate the very population that they be target that be why we need this bill early this year the centre for environment fisheries and aquaculture science the government own marine expert find that more than half of the uk key fishing quota be set above the level recommend by scientist overfishing have lead to collapse in celtic sea cod population since with an collapse in haddock an collapse in whiting and an collapse in herring just two week ago the scientific assessment of mackerel show that the specie have decline by in the past year despite continue advice from scientist to reduce catch quota that reduction have not happen while the uk have be world leader with the blue belt programme at home we continue to practise the opposite of what we preach most notably through disastrous sustainable catch limit and quota worse we have drive out small fishing fleet leave our sea vulnerable to the monstrous mega ship whose bottom trawl scrape away the existence of all life in their path the inequitable quota allocation that be formalise in have result in more than of the quota for mackerel herring and blue whiting be hold by just company most of they not even british half of the english quota be hold by dutch icelandic and spanish interest more than half of northern ireland quota be hold by just one trawl company and of wales quota be hold by spanish company the system have be rig against the uk inshore fleet and its independent fisher all of this be do by uk company sell their quota abroad but it be the awful consequence of the privatisation of public good our fishery and the uk taxpayer have receive not penny in benefit as result if the uk be truly to be leader in the implementation of the bbnj and to demand of other nation that they curb their rapacious plundering of the high sea we must at the very least begin to stop the over exploitation of our stock at home our ability to make our voice hear internationally will sound hollow if we continue to ignore the science and set politically lead quota allocation at home high sea fishery often have unimaginably high level of bycatch this be particularly true of tuna fishery because tuna often school with other pelagic specie such as dolphin manta ray and billfish indeed many tuna specie inhabit the same surface mixed layer of the ocean that be inhabit by vulnerable specie such as silky shark or turtle it be estimate that million shark be catch every year most as bycatch in high sea fishery so it be no wonder that the number of large open ocean shark have decline by at least in the past year almost entirely due to high sea fish where they be either target or catch as bycatch beyond the reach of national jurisdiction the leatherback turtle the large turtle in the world be threaten with extinction because it be so often catch as bycatch by purse seine fleet of fishing vessel on the high sea in the international union for conservation of nature red list of endanger specie publish just last week only one of the specie of albatross be not threaten with extinction through be catch as bycatch on hook on longline fishing fleet in the open ocean distance from land once provide protection for many specie in the pre industrial era and the same can be say of the deep sea until recently the deep ocean be out of reach for human activity unfortunately this be no long the case industrialised fishing fleet be now able to fish deeply and deep but many deep sea specie be slow grow an orange roughy reach sexual maturity only between the age of and much old than shallow water fish these factor make deep sea specie uniquely vulnerable to overfishing and as many of the deep water be on the high sea we need to ensure that the bbnj agreement protect they and their habitat well deep sea fishing especially on seamount pose an existential risk to many deep sea ecosystem and bottom trawling which be devastating in coastal and shallow sea be arguably even more so on the high sea bottom trawler tend to focus on seamount as these underwater mountain act as biodiversity hotspot in the open ocean seek the minister assurance that in consider the next step after ratification establish protection around seamount on the high sea will be one of the government priority ask for the same assurance in relation to the issue of deep seabed mining trust that the government will continue to oppose any development of this on the high sea the bill before we be excellent it will delight the now professor alex rogers who suspect be not at his desk either in oxford or at the national oceanography centre where he be now the science director most probably he be out somewhere in the antarctic ocean in submersible explore the deep ocean as he have be do for more than year if he be to take break from his mission to discover new marine specie in the deep ocean in this decade and send we message suspect that it would emphasise the importance of get this bill enact quickly if we do not ratify the treaty at least day before the first cop the uk will not have seat at the table we will merely be spectator as other set the ambition or the lack of it as they roll out the implementation of the treaty congratulate the minister on bring the bill to the house for its second reading and trust that we be able to see the whole ratification process complete in time for the uk to make strong proposal at next year the venerable bede first write of the isle of eels back in the century he explain that the isle of ely be know as such because it be surround by water with an abundance of eel but these eel do not spend their whole life in ely or indeed in the uk the biological story behind eel be quite remarkable one they breed in the sargasso sea which as we have hear be so important to many other specie as well and they drift across the ocean for two or three year as tiny and fragile eel they adapt to freshwater and mature in river sometimes grow up to metre in length before swim all the way back to the sargasso sea to reproduce once more before die these eel face many danger in their life cycle include the impact of climate change on ocean current pollution and poaching european eel be consider critically endanger specie so it be imperative that we take action to protect they now at local level the creation of eel pass not as it might sound passport but ladder or passage have be welcome action to allow they to get from the sea into freshwater habitat and back again however much more need to be do to protect they and other endanger specie on global scale so it be really good that the government have propose this bill ely hold an annual eel festival which not only recognise our history but celebrate biodiversity and nature the festival celebrate our heritage and be always ting with concern about the decline in the eel population but also with determination to see eel return to our river in abundance they be not anywhere near as common in the river great ouse as they once be owe to all the factor mention but the good news be that in over eel be record as make the mile journey from the sargasso sea to cambridgeshire measure like ban bottom trawling in marine protect area would be good way to protect endangered specie like eel and other as would the provision of great resource for international environmental co operation hope the government will take on board call for ban on bottom trawling in marine protect area we can not possibly have the moral authority to call for such ban on the global stage when we have not do it in our own water like our eel all wildlife depend on our ocean as indeed do we as the human race the speech from the shadow minister the hon member for romford andrew rosindell be shocking and depressing for party that once hug husky to now be question its support for our ocean be shameful twenty five century ago aristotle question where eel come from but if we do not take urgent action to protect they and other marine wildlife we will not be ask where they come from we will be ask where they have all go therefore welcome this bill and the international co operation of which it be part let we get it through the house as quickly as possible so that we can sign the treaty and make sure that it deliver what we all hope it will deliver be grateful to my hon friend the minister for her remark and for the attention that the fcdo have pay to the importance of marine conservation the biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction treaty represent transformation in the way that we protect nature in the high sea commend the government for be an early proponent of the agreement and be so pleased in fact be thrilled to see that we be finally go to ratify it feel that have be witness the chamber at its good this afternoon to hear such passion and such well inform expertise on both side have be real honour it remind one what an honour we all have in be member of this place and sit in room to listen to such speech which have be wonderful let confess that be one of those people remember that when come back from see sperm whale be still weep and apologise to the organiser of the trip that seem to just not be able to stop weep but she say do worry dear we see lot of people like you on these trip feel as though have find my people give the passion that have be express today for the high sea and for biodiversity today want my speech to have particular focus please forgive for this because believe that our commitment to this treaty can be test by how we treat our current responsibility join the opposition spokesperson the hon member for romford andrew rosindell in use the chagos island as test apologise for not recognise that the opposition have be talk about the biodiversity of the chagos island perhaps be only focus on the considerable amount of time they have spend on the sovereignty of the chagos island have since spend the time available look up their reference to biodiversity and there have be three of they so apologise for say that there have not be any have have number of exchange in this house with the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty who have responsibility for europe north america and the overseas territory about the vital importance of safeguard marine protect area around the chagos island be grateful for the assurance he have give that the government be commit to the continue protection of the unique and unparalleled environment of the chagos archipelago however the fcdo assurance although welcome really do not go far enough but before say why want to explain why these water matter so much not least because of their role in replenish the high sea and the extraordinary obligation that the uk owe the world to ensure that they remain protect as have be say these sq km of near pristine ocean be among the most pristine in the world they be home to the large live coral atoll and to island they be the breeding site for more than quarter of million pair of seabird as well as the vital and unexplored deep sea ecosystem that my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner talk about with such passion the vast no take zone that the uk establish in provide vital sanctuary for numerous endanger specie if this marine environment be damage it would do huge damage to the sea generally and to specie already on the brink of extinction such as the endangered hawksbill turtle which forage in the water of the chagos island and nest on their beach or the unique population of reef manta ray which use the protect water as refuge and which would soon disappear if those water become unprotected this be exactly the kind of marine life that the bbnj agreement seek to protect through the establishment among other measure of marine protect area in the high sea the vast marine protect area around the chagos island provide safe corridor and forage ground for vital migratory specie and apex predator such as tuna shark and whale and without it we would see their number crash much more widely across the world in warm world in which coral be die at terrifying rate the coral in the chagos archipelago be relatively healthy and act as reseeding bank for other reef in the indian ocean through larval dispersal the reef and marine life of the chagos archipelago help to replenish degraded reef and deplete fish stock from east africa to indonesia the coral in the chagos archipelago have show an extraordinary degree of resilience and an ability to recover even from bleach event and it be not know why this resilience and the undisturbed nature of the chagos ocean make it really important site for scientific study it could give we an important insight into what we can do next to save our coral reef and proper insight into how healthy marine ecosystem function and the impact of climate change for the last year the uk have protect those water and take seriously its duty as the steward of those ecosystem just as the bbnj agreement invite the entire international community to do as steward of the high sea as the uk now hand they over to mauritius we have an equally serious duty to ensure that they remain protect that bring to the term of the chagos deal and the minister of state evidence to my foreign affairs committee for which be grateful to he the minister note that the uk and mauritian government be commit to promote the conservation of the environment of the archipelago obviously welcome that and pay tribute to the government of mauritius for their clear determination to protect nature nothing be about to say be intend to cast any doubt on that commitment the problem however be that mauritius be democracy vibrant democracy in which government have historically have different attitude to protect the ocean it be therefore not good enough for the minister just to point to the commitment of the current mauritian government to marine protection we need basis for last confidence and mechanism to ensure that these ecosystem remain protect for future generation my principal concern be that there be no funding mechanism in place to ensure that mauritius will properly resource marine protection in the chagos archipelago and to incentivise it to do so that stand in contrast to the treaty we be discuss thank the right hon member for give an opportunity to say sorry to the shadow minister for misunderstanding when intervene early why he think it be so important to mention the chagos island hope he will accept my apology must say that we be all behave so well this afternoon be say that there be no incentive or funding mechanism in the chagos archipelago deal yet the treaty we be talk about the subject of the bill we be give second reading today do have that very funding mechanism why do it because we know that that be need for it to work without dedicated funding mechanism for chagos marine protection in which transfer of fund be contingent on the continue protection of the marine environment there be nothing to ensure that this protection will continue the mauritian government want to allocate resource for do so but they operate in resource constrain environment it be therefore deeply regrettable that both party do not reach an agreement on future arrangement for environmental protection across the chagos archipelago before sign the treaty they should have allocate dedicated fund to it or agree funding mechanism that would have be proper basis for confidence in short the chagos agreement should have follow the lead of the bbnj agreement remain concerned that there be lack of concrete action on the future conservation of the chagos archipelago unique marine environment and biodiversity appreciate the commitment that the minister have give to the house and my committee but now action need to be take draw on the example present by the bbnj agreement the ratification of the high seas treaty be testament to britain renew global leadership on climate and nature that reputation risk be undermine by failure to invest in the protection of the unique and extraordinary marine environment that be the chagos island welcome the government and the minister leadership on this issue in bring the bill to the house to enact the un high seas treaty too be member of the appg for the ocean know that people in exeter care very deeply about our natural environment particularly the sea and ocean and rightly so the world ocean be vital to the health of our planet and to our people they produce over half of the world oxygen and absorb quarter of all carbon dioxide emission help to regulate our climate they support an immense diversity of life provide food for billion of people and support enormous ecosystem which contain knowledge that we have only just begin to tap after decade of industrial damage this landmark legislation and the treaty will go some way to protect two third of the world ocean and it represent massive step forward by nation across the world to protect marine life and ecosystem beyond our national border by provide the legal framework necessary to implement the bbnj agreement domestically the bill include provision for marine protect area environmental impact assessment and the sharing of benefit from the collection and use of marine genetic resource and will help we to meet the target to effectively conserve and manage at least of the ocean by also welcome the bill as core part of re establish the uk role in provide global leadership on climate and nature both at home and around the world just as the uk be leader in marine and climate science so be exeter be delighted this week to host in parliament the met office which be base in exeter to showcase the range and depth of its expertise the met office be not just specialist in our weather it be also specialist in space weather our ocean and the connection between climate change and forecasting its work on ocean biogeochemistry study how carbon and other gas be absorb transport and exchange by the ocean the mechanism involve and the impact change have be pioneer it research the risk of rapid loss of sea ice and be study the rise of sea level and the impact on community the environment and the economy the met office also provide vital service in generate risk assessment of rapid change to the meridional overturning circulation which be tell be literature graduate madam deputy speaker not science graduate play an important role in regional climate it be also part of the national partnership for ocean prediction bring together world class expertise and research as well as develop beneficial marine product and service in addition the university of exeter have wide range research community work on project relate to our ocean these come together under the exeter marine research network and their ocean research run from pollution and conservation to governance and human health in june this year exeter university professor callum roberts be the lead author of report in nature support the un high seas treaty his paper highlight that the high sea be the earth large and most secure carbon sink protect they be critical to preserve the biological and nutrient cycle that draw down and keep atmospheric in check they welcome the un high seas treaty say it offer pathway to great protection but they be concerned about the length of time for implementation the report author also argue that full and permanent ban on extractive use of the ocean be both feasible and necessary model on the successful precedent set for antarctica in the will the minister comment on what more can be do beyond the treaty as we bring it in to protect our ocean above and beyond this legislation finally want to pay tribute to my constituent mary attewell debbie thomas sue down and lizzie waler of exeter greenpeace group who have be doggedly campaign for the uk ratification of the treaty thank they for all their work and for keep this issue at the top of the political agenda hope they will be celebrate this evening if the bill pass its second reading they have ask to question how the treaty will be enforce would welcome comment from the minister on that too agree with my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins that we want there to be cross party and cross house agreement on this issue while it be disappointing that the conservatives be not here it be also disappoint that green party mp other than one small intervention at the beginning be not here to participate substantially in the debate commend the bill be extraordinarily thrilled and pleased to support it know that the ratification of the agreement as soon as possible support the uk broad climate and nature agenda and will mean that we can take our seat at the top table at the first cop that will ensure we remain at the forefront of global effort to tackle biodiversity loss and climate change through multilateral co operation this will strengthen the role of international law so important in these time and multilateral institution as the foundation for ocean governance welcome the bill for what it seek to put into law but also for what it signal about the approach of the government and hopefully this house to national and international obligation and interest it be testament to the continued survival and delivery of multilateralism in global affair in an age of continued and heighten global strife conflict and antagonism the bill be proof that there still remain hope for global co operation and that joint endeavour with share purpose can deliver common good institution such as the united nations can still be practical and effective forum to facilitate state come together to work out collective solution to collective problem there be those who seek to withdraw from international agreement see multilateral institution and process as threat we must eschew such an approach because it ultimately do not serve our national or global interest such an approach of withdrawal and isolation will not further our interest effectively in this case the united nations biodiversity beyond national jurisdiction agreement which the bill will bring into the framework of uk law will be one of the most important stride forward for biodiversity and the marine environment for the first time the united kingdom will have legal framework to help we to protect large expanse of the sea that be beyond our national water the establishment of such protection will help to ensure that region of the high sea be safeguard from harmful extractive and destructive practice the protection will help to restore biodiversity to these region and help maintain the ocean capacity to absorb produce by human activity thus help to mitigate the impact of global warming as have be mention the ocean absorb about of man make and this treaty will help to ensure that they be fit to continue do so the ratification of the treaty must not be the be all and end all for protect the biodiversity of the world ocean it must be means through which the uk and ally globally can continue to advocate for great protection of our share marine environment one mean of do that through the treaty will be the first conference of the party or ocean this will be the first forum for the treaty signatory to discuss and action its implementation such as agree proposal for the first generation of high sea sanctuary the treaty be welcome and the bill be welcome but implementation be necessary to deliver what we need as the minister say in her opening comment the cop will take place within year of january which be when the treaty come into force as have be say if the uk have fail to ratify at least day before that date we will not have seat at the first cop that be why urge the house to pass this legislation at pace already there be report that the first ocean cop could be as soon as august next year the government have rightly speak at length about the importance of the uk bring its soft power to bear with this be the first cop of its kind it be essential that we bring uk expertise and influence to the event while the treaty be in its infancy we have see the importance of conference of the party as means of promote collective action on climate change and nature we can not miss this chance to be part of the first ocean cop to do the same for our world ocean multilateral agreement implement by collective action be the way forward on this issue be therefore more than content to support the bill enthusiastically today two third of our planet be ocean our ocean which sustain life on earth can not be leave unguarde any long after year of international negotiation the world finally agree to the high seas treaty with the bill we will turn that treaty into action and show that britain be serious about deliver on its promise there be no response to the climate crisis that do not also respond to the nature crisis that be why it be important to protect biodiversity in this country beyond our border and beyond the sea two third of the world ocean lie beyond national border and until now they have have almost no real protection the bill give we the power to protect international water by establish marine protect area by demand proper environmental assessment before deep sea mining or destructive fishing can go ahead and by make sure that the benefit of marine science be share fairly the bill underpin the global goal of protect of the ocean by goal that labour put in its manifesto and one that we should be proud to be deliver on the high sea absorb carbon regulate weather and produce half the oxygen that we breathe if we do not get biodiversity right we will not get climate change right either we have all hear the tedious line often repeat by member on the conservative benches where no one be currently sit that we can not act because other country be not act but to lead in address climate change we have to do precisely that take action do something meaningful and lead other country in make difference hon member may wonder why from the most landlocked constituency of calder valley be speak on the bill but in calder valley we know the cost of climate change as flood devastate our town we also know that protect nature be our first line of defence and whether that be restore our moorland at home insist on biodiversity net gain in development or safeguard ocean abroad the principle be the same commend the government for introduce the bill which be vital step in turn the international commitment into real action the next challenge be to ensure that the bill not only pass but be properly enforce and resource as many colleague have say look forward to hear more detail on that from the minister let we see this as the first day of britain leadership on our sea on land and at sea our natural environment have suffer soul crush collapse over many decade put the future of iconic specie and entire ecosystem at risk as be so eloquently describe by my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner in tour de force of speech the government be elect on clear promise to end that catastrophic decline the long term consequence of which if we do not reverse that trend will be profound our food security depend on healthy ecosystem the bedrock of our economy be our natural capital and the public our voter cherish our sea river coastline ancient woodland and national park they will not be forgiving of political system that fail to protect and restore our share natural inheritance the bill be particularly vital step towards the renew protection of our natural environment it recognise that biodiversity do not obey national border or jurisdiction so neither can our duty to safeguard it as obvious as that truth may seem to the public let alone conservationist successive government have fail to give the high sea the attention they need the bill begin to put that right by at last create legal framework for the uk to ratify the un bbnj agreement and meet our international obligation in full as have be note just of the high sea have full protection and there be still much research to be do on deep sea ecosystem but they be increasingly recognise as key global reservoir of biodiversity so the crucial task be to move the legislation forward quickly and end the crisis engulf our ocean industrial fishing practice such as bottom trawling the underseas equivalent of plough bulldozer through wild flower meadow be tear apart fragile seabed habitat while trawl net indiscriminately catch and discard countless non target endanger specie once those specie be go they will be go forever and their entire intricate web of connection will go with they unravel irreplaceable ecosystem with profound knock on effect that we can neither predict nor prevent as have be mention if we fail to pass the bill urgently the uk will not have seat at the table for the treaty first cop that would not only represent dereliction of our international obligation we have as great responsibility as any nation to protect global biodiversity but silence our voice in safeguard our own national interest such as the protection of the uk million seabird over half of which be already in decline specie such as the albatross and the petrel spend more than of their life forage on the high sea we can not protect they with action on our own coastline alone yet britain strip of her seabird would hardly be britain at all other country will have their own priority and national interest to pursue so our government must be at the table play its part in secure the long term future of the many specie that play such an important part in our culture and identity welcome the bill and the opportunity it create to discuss nature and biodiversity in this place topic of serious debate right now for the public and for the government close by say again that decision drive by an ideology that prioritise profit over people and the environment do not just undermine our economy they wreck our natural world and our social cohesion national renewal must mean economic revival but also once more cherish those thing that make life beautiful and that mean protect nature thank ministers today for do just that cannock chase may be one of the most landlocked constituency in the country but that have not stop my constituent from write to in support of the bill and rightly so if anyone do come across marine genetic resource in staffordshire would be impressed and also slightly concerned but the point be this what happen in the world ocean matter just as much to the people of my constituency as it do to those live on the coast as the wise franklin roosevelt once say the nation that destroy its soil destroy itself would like to extend that to say that the world that destroy its ocean destroy itself the uk have long position itself as global leader on marine protection and with the bbnj agreement about to enter force on january we must not give up our status on marine conservation that be why speak in support of the bill legislation that give the government the ability to ratify that vital united nations agreement and take part in the world first ocean cop next year as the new chair of the all party parliamentary group on uk food security want to emphasise how vital the bill be in protect the long term health of our global food system the high sea those vast area of ocean beyond any single country jurisdiction be essential to our food security they be home to rich marine ecosystem and globally over billion people rely on fish for at least of their animal protein intake for many coastal and island nation that figure be much high yet the vast majority of these water have long be unregulate and be vulnerable to multitude of threat include overfishe unrestricted oil drilling pollution and deep sea mining which directly threaten not just ocean health but global food security echo the comment make by my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner that to ensure the agreement have real impact the government must rapidly push for new marine protect area in international water the bill will enable the uk to play an active role in address all those threat it will extend marine licensing requirement to british activity beyond our water and mandate environmental outcome report for potentially harmful activity it will also ensure great transparency in the collection and use of marine genetic resource the biological material from marine organism that hold immense promise for medicine biotechnology and food innovation it be often say that the world rainforest hold countless discovery to come that could cure many illness and enable advancement that will enrich our human existence as well as certainly hope our stewardship of the natural world however although they be often overlook the same be very much true of our ocean these scientific and ecological discovery must benefit all nation and not simply be the preserve of the already wealthy therefore very much welcome the emphasis on open access repository and database that be so prominent in the bbnj agreement the agreement also embed vital safeguard like the polluter pay principle and the precautionary principle hope it will pave the way for international action that will finally turn the tide pun absolutely intend on the reckless destructive practice that nation across the world have perpetrate could not let the opportunity to speak on the high sea go by without mention the global plastic treaty on which hope we can find international agreement soon pay strong tribute to the minister and the british delegation to the geneva talk we know from her recent appearance at the environment food and rural affairs committee that she deeply regret the collapse of those talk without an agreement and know that she be already redouble effort to find way forward so that we can start to halt and reverse environmental catastrophe such as the great pacific garbage patch urge the government to do whatever they can alongside fellow member of the high ambition coalition to end plastic pollution and advance international action on this urgent issue as we have hear the government have commit to protect of the ocean by the bill make good on that commitment on an international level not just as an environmental ambition but as foundation for international co operation sustainable development and global food resilience commend the government for their leadership in bring this legislation forward particularly as my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins say in pack legislative programme as we seek to get our country back on its foot it demonstrate this government commitment to and prioritise of the health and sustainability of our ocean beyond national jurisdiction and urge colleague across the house to support it whether we live by the sea or in cannock chase in the heart of england healthy ocean be essential to secure and sustainable future for we all the ocean can not wait and nor should the united kingdom our ocean be teem with complex life but today they be also in state of crisis climate change pollution overfishing habitat destruction and plastic be all place our ocean under strain like never before our ocean be pay the price with more than third of uk fish stock currently overfishe and more than third of marine mammal at risk of extinction the high seas treaty which the bill will ratify into uk law represent significant and much need step forward for the first time the treaty create legal mechanism to establish marine protect area in international water crucial tool to ensure that by and in accordance with the global biodiversity framework of the world land and sea will be protect however the success of the treaty will depend on whether it be enforce so urge the government to ensure that adequate funding be provide to help to protect these newly create marine protect area we must also do our bit at home to protect marine life here in the uk some of uk water be now designate as marine protect area however during our inquiry into the marine environment the environmental audit committee hear that these site lack sufficient protection to contribute towards our target of protect of land and sea while government proposal to nearly triple the amount of seabed protection from bottom trawling be welcome therefore urge the government to enact the recommendation from the environmental audit committee and ban bottom trawling in all marine protect area without ban it be hard to see how we can claim that these area be protect at all bottom trawling be highly destructive practice that tear up the seabed destroy habitat and release carbon store in the ocean floor as david attenborough say in his film ocean the idea of bulldoze rainforest cause outrage but we do the same underwater every day we also can not protect our ocean without address the climate crisis the ocean have absorb of all excess heat cause by climate change and this excess heat be result in widespread marine heatwave that be kill marine ecosystem and cause our ocean to acidify the intergovernmental panel on climate change have be clear that if we allow warming to reach the vast majority of coral reef will be lose forever the willingness of some of our opponent to abandon climate commitment mean that it be on we to go far and fast and to do all that we can to protect nature and stop the climate crisis this bill represent welcome move in that direction it seem to that the natural world be the great source of excitement the great source of visual beauty the great source of intellectual interest it be the great source of so much in life that make life worth word by david attenborough they be word that everyone can relate to whether that be university professor in oxford year old watching blue planet on the bbc or indeed the specialist in ocean conservation meet yesterday as part of my role as vice chair of the all party parliamentary group for the ocean everyone in this room in this country and on this planet have an interest in ensure that our ocean be protect when we stare down from space at our blue jewel of world it be simply unfathomable that million square kilometre of it be at present effectively unmanaged it be free for all it have be allow to become so because of history but we now have the obligation to create system of management both in this room and across multilateral agreement with other country it be the wonder of our democracy in this country and other country around the world that we can finally introduce piece of legislation where we can manage many of these location stand as proud mp for medway in particular chatham which have an historic dockyard that serve much of our maritime trade and provide support to the royal navy many in my community have proud history and legacy of serve on the ocean from work on fleet supply freight to participate in our royal naval tradition our country have proud history of conservation through the national trust and other terrestrial organisation we also have number of third party sector organisation that be commit to deliver on ocean conservation not just through this treaty but through the many there have be in the past such organisation include oceana and the marine conservation society there be also excellent work be do by plymouth university and southampton national oceanography centre which my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner and have the pleasure of visit early this year our natural history museum with its work in london and across the country the world wildlife fund and greenpeace have all advocate for this in many way and continue to do so in many case their work be not high profile they do their work quietly and behind the scene such as by engage with defra be sure the civil servant can attest to this and ensure that they be safeguard our fishery and world this bill be extremely welcome and timely the high seas treaty reach its require ratification on september and the ratification trigger day countdown after which the treaty come into force if we want to be at that multilateral table to deliver for our resident in our community and our country we need to deliver this legislation welcome the bill be place before the house and welcome the debate with member across this chamber from those who be fascinate by the sperm whale or the right whale to those who have row across ocean and sea the content of the bill be critical genetic heritage have not be mention much today but it be critical element as it can lead to cure for cancer and heart disease genetic heritage be marker for our future on this planet if there be cure that come as result of this legislation it be today that we give security and licence to it the designation of marine protection area have be much debate across this chamber with regard to uk control and agree with many of my colleague that we need to do more domestically to protect our mpa make they fit for purpose and allow they live up to their designation this legislation create the licence for marine protection area in international water which will support our heritage and legacy for future generation it be pathway to the goal of protect of the world ocean by the bill also give scientific protection around licensing we know that there be significant challenge for both our biotic and abiotic resource much time have be spend this afternoon discuss the damage cause by international industrial fishery with new technology and industrial sized trawler come from many nation of the world the damage cause by these monster as refer to they be decimate not only our biological resource directly in that location but sea bird specie and any food chain associate with it there be also debate about mining and drilling to be have in the next to year as we begin to get access to our deep sea resource whether it be hydrate or base metal that we need we need to have that conversation so implore the government to look very closely at any moratorium then there be climate change which be not to be deny by many across the world it be happen specie be under threat and the destruction of habitat as result of the warming and acidification of the ocean be impact both coral reef and seaweed bed to conclude still have number of question around the use of the marine management organisation in this country and regional fishery management organisation how much extra resource will they need because certainly have question at present around the mmo and its oversight how do we know that this be go to be enforce the un have calculate that to make this effective we might need to look at figure of around billion annually where be that money go to come from there be serious question about who will enforce overfishe protection and marine protection area when we have fishing piracy go on around the world what be the measure for dispute resolution we know that there be united nations convention on the law of the sea dispute around the south china sea with china and dispute be also ongoing over the arctic so what measure and mediation will this treaty introduce this treaty tell everyone watch about our value whether they be year old blue planet watcher or professor in submersible in the arctic it set the tone for the next hundred year it be necessary that we do this and implore colleague to support it that bring we to the front bench contribution call the liberal democrat spokesperson with the leave of the house it only remain to say that we have hear across the chamber impassioned and professional expertise we have also hear about the importance of work together not only in term of hope that member on the conservative front bench be listen we have also hear about the importance of work across the chamber on something that be so vital to all our constituent our ally across the world and those in our overseas territory to finally fill the gap of the lawless part of the ocean through global ocean governance that we can all agree on collectively that will be hard as hon member have hear have work with artisanal and industrial fisherman and with researcher scientist and conservationist it be not and it will not be easy to come to an agreement about area base management plan and the ocean sanctuary and mpa that we be look to create but we can do it if we all work together implore hon member across all party and benches that we get to ratification in timely fashion so that we can be part of the new global ocean movement sit at the table at the first global ocean cop and take lead position go forward we owe it to ourselves to the child of everyone we know and to the future of the planet this have be wide range and important debate on vital bill there have be many valuable and informed contribution not least from the hon member for glasgow north martin rhodes for calder valley josh fenton glynn for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff for cannock chase josh newbury for derbyshire dales john whitby and for chatham and aylesford tristan osborne the hon member for exeter steve race be rightly proud of the great academic institution in his constituency highlight the important role that uk research play in the world it be pleasure to see the hon member for rotherham sarah champion make one of the first back bench contribution she reinforce the point that my hon friend the member for romford andrew rosindell make about the destruction of the marine environment know that she speak from position not just of expertise but of passion and she have show that over so many year with commitment to our ocean and with the work that she have lead on may say to the liberal democrat spokesman the hon member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings that she show why it be so important that we have people in this house with such wide range experience who have have life outside this place she have bring expertise to the debate and be sure that many of we envy she in what she have be able to do the intellect that she have apply to the argument and the fact that we can all listen carefully to what she have say the hon member for bristol east kerry mccarthy say something important when she talk about marine deforestation and some of the mainstream medium show that have footage that she have hear have be too shocking to show that represent real problem in this debate be we wrap this up in cotton wool for some people to not show exactly what we be try to deal with she make the important point that we should not hide from what be go on in the world agree with the right hon gentleman to an extent it be report in the guardian that some of the footage be deem too shocking to be show do not know whether he have see it but what remain in the film be incredibly powerful have read about bottom trawling in the newspaper for long time so know about it from factual perspective but it be only when see those image that it be bring home to how terrible it be be grateful to the hon lady for that important intervention the hon member for bath wera hobhouse raise the importance of mainstream medium we be grateful for her apology to my hon friend the member for romford for misinterpret his drive about the importance of the chagos island it be disappointing that the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins who be no long in his place feel that not enough of my colleague be in attendance but those of we who be here have stay here mr speaker have comment on many an occasion that can often be more than enough the hon member for south cotswolds dr savage point out how little we know about the ocean that be an important point it have often be say that space exploration get lot of coverage and we talk about it very much indeed we be talk about man the moon again and maybe use it as launch pad to go to mars yet so much of our own planet be completely unknown and unexplored that bring to the hon member for brent west barry gardiner who have genuine interest and expertise he give wide ranging and important speech and make an important point about the ocean be one of the big solution to climate change he be indeed right that the european economic zone be legacy from the day when we own half the world one of the great achievement of the last conservative government be the work we do on the blue belt and on ensure that we protect important marine environment do not know whether he will expand on this in later debate but notice that he do not appear to be fully supportive of give up on the fishery from the eu with the eu reset wonder whether he may have thing to add to that debate at another time but perhaps now be not the time and place however he do make an important point that we can only do what we have to do as country if we have the ability to do it in those water the way that the hon member for ely and east cambridgeshire charlotte cane approach the subject of the conservative party record in this area be real pity be proud of some of the work we do on the blue belt include work on this bill and as we have see during the debate there be wide support for it across the house the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry point out her genuine delight in the fact that this house have so many expert to speak on such an important issue she echo the concern of my hon friend the member for romford on what will happen with the chagos bill do not want to go into great detail on that because we be go to be here long time on monday evening debating that bill but think she be drive at the fact that the assurance in the chagos bill do not go far enough in protect the blue belt welcome her clarification that my party have raise the issue of the blue belt she come with expertise and deserve to be listen to when she be raise these important point the minister open the debate by talk about the urgency and importance of this moment that be true when my hon friend the member for romford speak he make some very serious point not least about how we can ensure that the responsibility that the united kingdom have always take towards marine fishery do not get overridden if we can not control our work entirely he make the point that in the scheme of thing we must ensure that we do not hand over the ability to other country to stop we do that work the reality be that again will touch briefly on this because it be not part of the debate the un security council set up for reason find it hard to react to what be happen in ukraine because russia can override anything with its veto we must ensure that we have the ability as government and country to employ the law and protection that we need to put in place we will raise these area in committee even if that be through probe amendment because we want to ensure that the bill can do exactly what it intend to do the reality of the bill also come into some of these situation that we see on the horizon we know about the opening up of the arctic the melting of the sea ice and the opening of the north east passage which for many month certainly week of the year be fully navigable the ice have go away by that much at the same time we know that president putin and the russians have say that there be hydrocarbon resource in that ocean that they want to mine that would be devastating for the fragile ecosystem that exist in that unique area of the world which be almost completely untouched have the pleasure back in may of be part of the nato parliamentary assembly visit to svalbard the university centre in svalbard have dozen of country university academic institution and hundred of nationality study that region climate change and the effect it have on the arctic and the effect on ecosystem it be absolutely vital as we see the geopolitical tension form in area where they have not be before that we have those strong protection in place will the right hon member give way be about to finish but will give way to the hon gentleman the right hon member be absolutely right to talk about the opening up of the arctic and the geo strategic threat that we face there in that respect would he support my early call that the government should release the joint intelligence committee report on the link between biodiversity sustainability and national security will not be draw quite into that trap about release joint intelligence report however the hon gentleman make an important point because there be no doubt that we be talk about sovereign security if we do not get this right and that apply to all country around the world if we allow climate change and not the protection of valuable ecosystem as have be describe by many hon and right hon member across the house it be all of we who will suffer we have our concern about some area of the bill we will be table some amendment in committee and probe those area but on the whole we hope that we can support the bill and it be important to carry on the work that our government start thank the shadow ministers and hon and right hon member across the house for their thoughtful and constructive contribution to the debate it have be encouraging to hear the broad support for this important piece of legislation and to hear the expertise both from member life experience prior to come to this house and from the extensive work of our committees over long period of time want to recognise the work of number of the key stakeholder involve in inform the debate some of whom be able to speak to in the course of prepare for today include the marine conservation society greenpeace oceana the pew charitable trusts and the blue marine foundation want to make cheeky remark towards the right hon member for wetherby and easingwold sir alec shelbrooke for whom have lot of respect in that he suggest he could make up for the fact that there be no conservative back benchers here during the debate but indeed he make useful contribution that be important because this should be whole of house debate it be important to recognise that we be continue work that be start under the previous government and that we support all the way through it be important that member from all party be present as the bill start its passage through the house because as will set out it be important to inform the implementation and the ongoing debate will draw on and respond to the contribution that have be make during my remark in particular know that the hon member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings whose comment base on her extensive experience be very much respect by the house will make great contribution during the passage of the legislation she also talk about the importance of multilateralism and how we play our part with other around the world my hon friend the member for rotherham sarah champion have experience of chair number of appg and have make long stand contribution will come back to some of the point she raise but it be helpful to hear from she early in the debate we also hear from my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry will come back to some of the point she raise my hon friend the members for bristol east kerry mccarthy for chesterfield mr perkins who chair the environmental audit committee for brent west barry gardiner for exeter steve race for glasgow north martin rhodes for calder valley josh fenton glynn for cannock chase josh newbury for derbyshire dales john whitby and for chatham and aylesford tristan osborne and the hon member for bath wera hobhouse for south cotswolds dr savage for ely and east cambridgeshire charlotte cane and for north east hertfordshire chris hinchliff that go to show that we have have whole of nation debate before turn to my more detailed remark want to make point about young people and the next generation the important point be make that the ocean do not have voter but when think about the issue that be most important to young people include in primary school in my constituency the health of our ocean and how we protect our environment be very high on the agenda the ocean have their supporter across all generation and that be important let start by remind the house why this bill and the bbnj agreement matter the bbnj agreement be huge step towards protect our share ocean it will enable great conservation of the two third of the ocean that lie beyond national jurisdiction and will support the delivery of the kunming montreal global biodiversity framework which include the target to effectively conserve and manage at least of the ocean by environmental degradation could lead to huge economic cost globally make ocean conservation long term economic imperative too the agreement support the uk wide climate and nature agenda ensure that we remain at the forefront of global effort to tackle biodiversity loss and climate change through multilateral co operation it also strengthen the role of international law and multilateral institution and reinforce the un convention on the law of the sea as the foundation for global governance there be also clear opportunity for the uk which have one of the world lead marine scientific research community world renowne institution in the uk such as the national oceanography centre the marine biological association and our lead university marine science department be at the forefront of ocean research and will greatly benefit from provision in the agreement that promote transparency and datum share around marine genetic resource the bill along with the secondary legislation that will follow will deliver on our commitment to ratify this historic agreement let turn to some of the point raise in the debate and will aim to answer as many question as possible in relation to the chagos island this deal will help to protect the unique environment of the chagos archipelago both the uk and mauritius have commit to protect what be one of the world most important marine environment and that commitment will be support by an enhance partnership between both country under which the uk will support mauritius ambition to establish marine protect area that protect the globally significant ecosystem in the chagos archipelago the uk support for this will be agree in separate write instrument as part of the implementation of the agreement and government official have already begin discuss with their mauritian counterpart what it will involve this have be welcome by lead conservation ngos include the zoological society of london and both the uk and mauritius attach great importance to the need to protect marine biodiversity include the fight against illegal fishing it be worth mention that under the treaty the uk will continue to manage environmental protection on diego garcia and the surround nautical mile that shall be undertake in accordance with applicable international law and with due regard to applicable mauritian environmental law the minister for europe north america and the overseas territory my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty be at the heart of these discussion and have be lead on maritime protection in the overseas territory through expansion and confirmation of funding for the blue belt programme and our work in the polar region he have meet scientist in the cayman islands and bermuda last month and on board the royal research ship sir david attenborough to discuss their crucial work in the antarctic and arctic we be do crucial work on the convention for the conservation of antarctic marine living resource which be sure will be the subject of further debate in the house thank the minister for speak about the point make about the british indian ocean territory by myself and other include the chair of the foreign affairs committee the right hon member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry the marine protect area be establish by the government of gordon brown at the tail end of the last labour government it be vital area that we need to protect what guarantee can she honestly say we be get that if we be to hand over the sovereignty of the chagos archipelago to mauritius mauritius will protect it in the same way we have do under both labour and conservative government reiterate what say both the uk and mauritius attach great importance to the need to protect marine biodiversity indeed the uk will still have responsibility for manage environmental protection on diego garcia and the surround nautical mile and discussion be ongoing in relation to the establishment of the marine protect area which will be the subject of separate write agreement can not speak far on that because want to go through other point but be sure the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth will be happy to discuss this matter far in the house the hon member for romford andrew rosindell raise the issue of protect intellectual property right the secretary of state will not transmit information to the clearing house mechanism that would be protect under intellectual property or trade secret law be sure the hon member will be aware of that from his reading

in anticipation of this afternoon debate of million of support for child hospice over three year thank the minister for listen to the call of the child hospice sector and the liberal democrats the three year settlement will enable hospice to plan and deliver service over long period above all it will ensure that seriously ill child and their family can continue to access hospice care however provider tell that this level of funding do not solve the child hospice funding crisis nor do it put child hospice on genuinely long term sustainable financial footing bluntly this funding will only slow the rate at which child hospice service be be cut across the south east indeed across the whole of england child hospice support thousand of seriously ill baby child and young people and the family who love and care for they one such organisation be shooting star children hospices parent recent say without the support of the team at shooting star believe our family would be under enormous strain and feel unable to know where to turn they be place of compassion expert medical care and human dignity they provide everything from end of life care to vital symptom management and psychological support but our child hospice be in crisis unless urgent action be take many may disappear since the number of child and young people need end of life care have double the demand for symptom management have surge by hospice be have to provide more care and support than ever before yet they be struggle to keep their door open at the same time inflation and rise cost particularly in recruit and retain highly skilled staff have drive hospice expenditure up by an average of in the past year alone the government disastrous national insurance hike have only exacerbate the exist pressure for example southern hospice group be local charity make up of three sussex hospice chestnut tree house child hospice near arundel martlets in hove and st barnabas house in worthing the national insurance rise have collectively cost they yes the government have increase funding in cash term but it be simply not enough local nhs funding from integrated care board remain low than it be three year ago even as hospice stretch to meet rise demand child hospice be now dip into their reserve to stay open in of they end the year in deficit in that figure be expect to rise to staggering this be clearly not sustainable meanwhile postcode lottery in funding continue recent freedom of information request conduct by the charity together for short life show that some integrate care board in london spend over per child need palliative care while other spend less than we see that too in the south east one icb spend over per child while another spend just over only of icb could even say how many child access hospice care in their region this gap in datum must be fill the announcement this morning suggest that funding be distribute via icb would tackle the postcode lottery issue but the result of these foi request suggest that there be an awfully long way to go how will the minister ensure that icbs commission child hospice service equitably what guidance will they be give to ensure that these vast variation in support be eliminate if can emphasise one thing it be that people be the beat heart of the hospice movement highly qualified specialist passionate volunteer and generous donor all make the seemingly impossible happen but the force be in crisis incredibly there be only full time equivalent paediatric palliative medicine specialist serve the entire uk when we know the need be for at least to if we follow the guideline of the royal college of nursing we would have nearly community child nurse right now we have under the professional who care for our sick child be be stretch to breaking point urge the minister and the government to build on today announcement by first fix the broken commission system we must instruct nhs england and the department to model what each local nhs body should be spend on palliative care and to hold they accountable we must commission service at regional and national level where appropriate to create economy of scale and we must use the new pan icb commission office to ensure consistent and equitable access to care across england secondly we must tackle workforce shortage and invest an additional million per year in grid and spin training for paediatric palliative medicine we must fund and implement safe staffing ratio for nurse and aim to employ the community nurse that england truly need congratulate my hon friend on secure this debate an amazing child hospice that serve constituent in my patch be demelza which have an amazing array of staff volunteer and the rest include queen nurse such as donna mole will my hon friend congratulate donna on be recipient of that award will she also congratulate the fabulous fia one of the child serve by the hospice on book that she have write and will she encourage the minister to order copy thank my hon friend for celebrate the work of queen nurse and fabulous fia for what she have do in write book be not sure that could do that it be truly impressive and be happy to encourage the minister to buy the book it sound like have well buy it too this be about real child like fabulous fia it be about real family and real suffering that could be ease child hospice provide of care for every invest by the state which be extraordinary value so they deserve more support these child deserve dignity comfort and skilled care and their family deserve the support that only child hospice can offer my hon friend have bring forward critical debate on child hospice while we be look at child hospice let say that this issue be also critical for adult hospice in south cambridgeshire we have the fabulous arthur rank hospice which at the moment be look toward the cutting of its adult hospice bed the outcry from constituent and member be huge do my hon friend agree that the icb could look at strategic commissioning of that care across both adult and child hospice bed thank my hon friend for the campaigning she be do with her colleague on arthur rank hospice in cambridgeshire and she be right when go to visit chestnut tree house in sussex last week see that it be talk to adult hospice in the area about where that more strategic view can happen these child deserve dignity comfort and skilled care and their family deserve the support that only child hospice can offer will this government truly support the vision lay out in the nhs year plan in which neighbourhood health centre hospital and hospice work together to deliver high quality end of life care in the community or will we continue to let these vital service be ignore underfunded and unconnected there be an opportunity for more action than that in this morning announcement and for long term commitment urge the minister to do what be necessary and right and ensure that no child be leave without the care and dignity that they deserve thank the hon member for mid sussex alison bennett for secure this vital debate also thank all those who work or volunteer in the palliative care and end of life care sector for their care and support the compassion that they provide to patient family and love one when they need it most this government want society in which every child receive high quality compassionate care from diagnosis through to the end of life irrespective of condition or geographical location in england integrate care board be responsible for the commissioning of palliative care and end of life care service to meet the need of their local population to support icb in that duty nhs england have publish statutory guidance and service specification it have also develop palliative care and end of life care dashboard which bring together all relevant local datum in one place that dashboard help commissioner to understand the palliative care and end of life care need of their local population while the majority of palliative care and end of life care be provide by nhs staff and service we recognise the vital part that voluntary sector organisation include hospice also play in provide support to people at the end of life and their loved one in recognition of this we be support the hospice sector with million capital funding boost for eligible adult and child and young people hospice in england to ensure they have the good physical environment for care be pleased that the first million tranche of that funding which hospice uk kindly allocate and distribute to hospice throughout england be fully spend by hospice on capital project an additional million have be transfer to hospice uk for onward allocation to individual hospice for use in the financial year and know that many hospice be already spend that funding this year hospice in london and the south east be receive over million of that million capital funding that include over million for child and young people hospice in london and the south east we be also provide million in revenue funding to support child and young people hospice for this be continuation of the funding that until recently be know as the child and young people hospice grant child and young people hospice in london and the south east be receive almost million of that million of revenue funding as confirm in my write ministerial statement lay early today be delighted and proud to be in position to announce that we will continue that centrally administer funding for the next three year of this spending review period that include the to financial year as well as each year child and young people hospice in england will receive at least million adjust for inflation from nhs england via their local icb this amount to at least million over the next three year to support hospice care for child and young people mirror current and previous year transaction arrangement by do this we be promote more consistent national approach and support commissioner to prioritise the palliative care and end of life care need of their local population further detail on the delivery of this funding will follow in due course this government commitment to provide that much need funding until the end of the spending review period recognise that the ability to plan for the long term be vital to our child and young people hospice be proud that this government have remove the cliff edge of annual funding cycle so that our child and young people hospice will now be able to operate on the basis of far great certainty and stability agree that increase the time period cover by this grant to child hospice to three year will really help can the minister comment on whether there be plan to do the same for the adult hospice sector the hon lady will know that child hospice be in different situation from adult hospice there have always be centralised grant for child hospice whereas the funding for adult hospice go through icb and be part of the broad budgeting and commission process clearly we will need to set an overall financial framework for adult hospice we be currently go through the final stage of negotiation both with the treasury and within the department of health and social care to finalise the financial envelope and allocation for each part of my portfolio and the portfolio of my ministerial colleague although the investment be important there be big opportunity around reform lot more need to be do around the early identification of people in need of palliative care and people reach the end of life the interface between hospital hospice and primary care be nowhere near where it need to be big part of our neighbourhood health strategy will therefore be about how we ensure that hospice have strong voice at the table in the holistic integrated planning that be such an important part of the journey the hon lady make some powerful point about that in her speech and we be look at the issue as we speak be meet official to determine how to reform the system it be not just about the money but about how the system work we think that there be huge room for improvement be truly inspire to visit noah ark child hospice in barnet yesterday to understand the key issue that it be face and see how our three year funding

age palliative care and end of life care in line with our year health plan the government and the nhs will closely monitor the shift towards strategic commissioning of palliative care and end of life care service to ensure that service reduce variation in access and quality although some variation may be appropriate to reflect both innovation and the need of local population official will present further proposal to over the come month outline the driver and incentive that be require in palliative care and end of life care to enable the shift from hospital to community include as part of neighbourhood health team furthermore through the national institute for health and care research the department be invest million in policy research unit in palliative and end of life care the unit launch in january and be build the evidence base on palliative care and end of life care with specific focus on inequality and on iron out the regional variation to which the hon lady rightly point
