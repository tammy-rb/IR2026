have member of the senior leadership team responsible for attendance evidence suggest that the strategy be work there be few persistently absent pupil in the past academic year and in the last academic term overall absence be down to from in the autumn term the year before that be all back by national communication campaign to remind parent that moment matter attendance count the campaign aim to encourage parent to realise that their child should attend school if they have mild cough or cold and no fever or vomit and that mild anxiety can be make bad by prolong period of absence the campaign have be run across social medium and the radio we be grateful to sir chris whitty the chief medical officer for his letter reassure school leader that child should generally attend school if

guidance be clear that there should be support first approach but penalty be there to prevent court action from take place should say that of the fixed penalty notice issue be for unauthorised term time holiday but be happy to pick up that discussion with he my final point be this have watch the labour party try to reinvent itself as the champion of child be in school and many labour members have raise issue about the pandemic which be where many of the problem stem from however remember their action during that pandemic remember how long it take they to say that school be safe remember the then prime minister stand here every week ask the leader of the opposition to say that school be safe and he not do so remember that when one of labour union ally produce statement say that teacher should not be teach full timetable nor routinely mark work during that period labour say nothing to challenge it when that same union team up with other union to produce point list of thing they want to see before school return the labour party say nothing to challenge they what be labour big idea during the pandemic to go against the vaccination advice of the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation which be that we should vaccinate by age and instead vaccinate teacher no other profession just teacher whatever their age why because the union want that to happen in addition to the motion conflate two separate thing and in addition to this problem be bad in labour run wales like all problem be we will not allow the labour party to reinvent the history of their behaviour under this leader of the opposition they can not blame the last leader of the opposition for that it be under this leader of the opposition the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer it be this government who do all they could to get child back to school during the pandemic and it be this government who be do all they can to get child back to school now question put
