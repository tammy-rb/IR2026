mauritius by the uk chief negotiator harriet mathews and other official for the talk those talk be productive and it be completely understandable that the new mauritian government will want time to

however that we have agree good and fair deal that be in both side interest it protect the base at proportionate cost it have be support across the national security architecture in the united states

enable implementation of that treaty both houses of parliament will have the opportunity to scrutinise that treaty before ratification thank you for grant this urgent question mr speaker once again minister have be reluctantly drag to the house in fact have just see the foreign secretary leg it in world of increase danger change and uncertainty why be they so keen to surrender this strategic asset we have be repeatedly tell by ministers that this be good deal and that it have the support of the national security apparatus we keep hear that but where be the evidence to justify those hollow claim if the deal be so good why have the government be so secretive about the detail can the minister explain be sorry that the foreign secretary have abandon the house and not even come to this statement because yet again we be respond to medium report can the minister confirm that we will be able to extend the lease on the military base after year as report will we and the us still have full autonomy of operation what safeguard will be in place to stop other country include china try to establish themselves on the base or near the military base on diego garcia how much be the british taxpayer go to be liable for each year and in total over year now that we know we will be pay for the privilege of give away these island what exactly be our money go to be pay for the government claim that they can not disclose information about the lease but surely the minister can at least say explain and be honest where on earth the budget be come from if it be account for in the budget forecast present in the autumn we all hear about those budget forecast recently will the minister tell we what the funding will be for the economic partnership and the trust fund for chagossian people can the minister also tell we what aspect of the deal the new mauritian government want reconsider in the response what consideration be be give to provide more funding or to weaken any protection that may be in this lease importantly can he explain why the view of the chagossian community have be so ignore when the whole world can see that this propose deal be fall apart the foreign secretary and this government have try to flog it constantly not only be this monumental failure of statecraft from this labour government but it be also significant humiliation for the foreign secretary and his credibility and for the prime minister why be labour put our security at risk ignore chagossians and let our standing go into freefall in this world remind member that these contribution should take no long than two minute we be absolutely not damage our security we be protect it through this deal and that be why this deal have be agree to protect the operation of that base to protect it against the legal uncertainty and to ensure it be on safe footing well into the next century the right hon lady constantly refer to our somehow give up the base on diego garcia but the deal do exactly the it protect the base on diego garcia interruption it protect the base to continue order mr gemmell we have enough all the way through prime minister question if hear any more you be out seriously mean that be not put up with it the right hon lady constantly talk as if somehow we be give up the base on diego garcia that be the exact opposite of what this deal do unlike the failure to secure the deal under the last administration which might remind the house go through round of negotiation yet fail to secure deal to protect our base this deal protect the base the right hon lady ask series of other question she ask whether we would be able to extend the lease and the answer be yes would we continue to have autonomy for our operation and those of our ally absolutely yes be there safeguard in place to prevent foreign force or other on the outer island absolutely yes have answer the question on cost number of time in the house we be very clear that it be not normal practice for the united kingdom to confirm the value of its payment for military basis anywhere across the globe we have not do that in the case of any other base such as the one in oman and the united states itself have not confirm the value of its direct payment for basis include in djibouti and the marshall islands the right hon lady speak about the chagossians and have engage with chagossian community over many year be confident that this deal have clear benefit for chagossian community and will allow the resettlement of the outer island and the restarting of visit she also mention the trust fund the right hon lady refer to medium report and there be huge amount of speculation let we get back to the actual fact the mauritian prime minister himself have confirm to his assembly that he be willing to conclude this deal with the united kingdom those be the fact and we will protect our national security and our interest under the mauritian criminal code anyone who question the integrity of mauritian territory include the chagos archipelago be potentially subject to year imprisonment most british chagossians have at one time or another effectively give that level of disconsideration to the mauritian government what conversation have the minister have with the mauritian government to ensure that this part of the code be remove so that it be possible for british chagossians to visit chagos in the event that the deal go through as say we take the interest of chagossian community incredibly seriously the deal provide for chagossian to return to the outer island and to resettle they if mauritius decide to pursue programme of resettlement most importantly we will get on with get those visit go so that they can go back and visit the island include diego garcia with the appropriate protection in place call the liberal democrat spokesperson the foreign secretary tell this house on october that his deal be in the uk security interest the chaos we have see since then do nothing to assure our ally or to repel our enemy in retrospect do the minister think it be wise to announce an agreement just week before election in mauritius and the us do he agree it would be wise for any future agreement to come before this house for scrutiny and vote before signature it be important that any agreement comply with the opinion of the international court of justice but self determination remain an important principle too now that negotiation have reopen can the minister say how the chagossian people will be represent in those talk court rule this week that tamil asylum seeker be illegally detain in terrible condition on diego garcia will the minister apologise for their treatment and assure the house that the camp in which they be hold be now close for good as have repeatedly say in this house the interest of the chagossians have be absolutely at the heart of this deal and be sure they will be confident that there be number of provision that will satisfy the concern that member be raise in good faith and that chagossians have raise with directly this be treaty negotiation between the united kingdom and mauritius the hon gentleman be aware of the icj judgment and will let he read that in his own time the hon gentleman specifically ask about the situation of the migrant and we recognise and be carefully consider this week judgment but make it clear that this government inherit deeply troubling situation that remain unresolved under the last administration four year after the migrant arrival on diego garcia believe that the shadow foreign secretary be home secretary when the migrant first arrive and the situation go unresolved we be absolutely clear that the situation be unsustainable and we work at pace to resolve it we will carefully consider the judgment of that court those of we who have speak to the american military know the importance of this base will the minister confirm that he say that since the agreement be announce the american military and security service have raise no concern with this government yes indeed as far as be aware that be the case in fact the opposite be true there have be warm welcome for this agreement from across the united states security apparatus because it put this base and our share operation on secure footing into the future remind the house again that that be the very reason why this government act and indeed why the previous foreign secretary start the process in the first place so we be tell let go over to james cleverly then will the minister answer this with simple yes or no do the prime minister the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer have any conversation with philippe sands kc about diego garcia without the presence of foreign office or other government civil servant yes or no do not have detail of all the prime minister meeting be sure the right hon gentleman can ask the prime minister that question himself for those of we who have serve for the us military who retain genuine and close link with the us military and who know that this issue do not bring about the concern that other be try to conflate with it will the minister say what his view be on how it be see by our us military friend praise my hon friend for his service and work be very clear our ally in the united states and indeed our other ally who rely on the important guarantee that the base provide be supportive of the deal it have be support across the security apparatus at every level and that be absolutely crucial we would not have sign up to deal if it do not protect our interest and those of our close ally call the father of the house can the minister enlighten we as to the attitude on the deal of the incoming trump administration do he know or shall ask the hon member for clacton nigel farage we very much welcome as have say before the election of president elect trump and vice president elect vance during the transition period there be restriction on what conversation can go on as have say repeatedly in the house we be confident that when the full detail of the deal be provide by the us national security apparatus any concern will be allay know that the minister be strong supporter of the overseas territory as be the foreign secretary and the prime minister despite this be document already in the house and in gibraltar to avoid any doubt or further scaremongering and for member on the opposition benches will the minister once again confirm that this government be completely committed to support the right of self determination for the people of gibraltar and the falklands thank my hon friend for her important work on gibraltar as thank you for yours mr speaker have say this before and will confirm again that we be absolutely and resolutely commit to the sovereignty and self determination of gibraltar and the falkland islands indeed enjoy meet our overseas territory family at the joint ministerial council just few week ago it be truly baffle that such decent ministers have allow themselves to be bamboozle by the blob will the minister confirm that this be not be rush through in advance of the takeover of the white house by an incoming president in one month time if in one month time that new president say that this be terrible deal will it be too late to change it the right hon gentleman know that have immense respect for he and his work in this house take issue with his choice of word we have incredible official in this government who have loyally serve government from party on both side of this house they work incredibly hard to defend the national security and interest of this country if anything this be not rush at all there be round of negotiation under the government of the right hon gentleman party we get in and we get deal do that protect our national security and our interest what assurance can the minister provide parliament about the scrutiny that the agreement which will be strike in due course will receive as have say number of time in the house the treaty once sign will go through the normal procedure in the house confirm that in my answer to the right hon member for witham priti patel there will be the opportunity for ample scrutiny by both houses and legislation will be lay in due course the minister get ahead of himself he say the government have move at pace to resolve the situation the situation be not resolve he criticise the last government for not secure deal his deal be not secure either the last time we talk about this we talk about the president elect not be keen on the deal and the chagossians not be properly consult on it when will he come back to the house on this situation and tell we something positive about this cack handed deal have repeatedly state number of positive thing include the support for chagossians that will be inherent in the deal the positive fact be that after round of fail negotiation under the previous government we achieve and have do deal we be confident that that deal will be support by our partner and we will continue to present detail of it in due course do the minister agree that confirm the legal status of the base which be leave outstanding by the previous government will cement our role in the indo pacific and provide an important pillar in our strategy to counter chinese influence in the area my hon friend be absolutely right despite the attempt to constantly whip up the idea about chinese influence the deal contain specific precaution to prevent foreign force remind the house again that mauritius be one of the only country that do not join the belt and road initiative its ally be india not china the government clearly want to dismantle legacy of empire why then do we think it be so important to attach the chagos island to mauritius when in fact that link be only establish when both territory be acquire by the french empire and later by the british empire why do we not listen to the chagossians instead of impose the legacy of empire on they have engage with many chagossian group the hon member will know as have say multiple time that there be range of view across the chagossian community he be perfectly able to look at the legal judgment himself the fact be that the government want to secure the long term operation of the base our national security and our interest we have engage with our partner and secure deal which his government fail to do the current situation be clearly unsustainable most of the negotiation take place under the previous administration it be now become political football have the minister hear any other serious recommendation for the future of the island no have not and certainly have not hear they from the opposition benches will repeat the question ask by my hon friend the member for bicester and woodstock calum miller which the minister studiously avoid clearly the deal be not ready to be sign so why be it announce two week before the election when we be look to protect the national security of this country we will operate at the fast and most appropriate pace that we can this matter have be leave languish under the previous administration with the future of the base unsecure we have secure it may wish you merry christmas mr speaker do the minister recognise that the issue be be raise by the opposition again and again despite the cognitive dissonance that it be they who open the negotiation in the first place have to endorse the comment of my hon friend the member for portsmouth north amanda martin about the scaremongering and the irresponsible way in which the opposition have conduct the debate with regard to other overseas territory and self determination order be little bit concerned as grant the urgent question have take judgment call hope we be not question that it be absolutely right that the house scrutinise these matter and it will continue to have the opportunity to do so in range of forum indeed will meet parliamentarian later today to discuss they there appear to be collective amnesia among conservative members have raise this number of time many of they serve as ministers in the previous government and they know exactly what the risk be to our national security have just return hotfoot from very full mar lago speak to several member senior administrator especially of the incoming administration which will be in the white house in day time let assure you that there be very deep disquiet among they all as to what this deal may mean for the long term future of diego garcia and whether such deal will hold give the precedent of the deal break over hong kong they also can not understand why we would surrender the sovereignty of the island on an advisory judgment from pretty obscure court this be about sovereignty and you keep say yourself that the sovereignty order we can not both stand when you say you you mean have no ownership of this decision that be fair enough mr speaker if we respect the sovereignty of gibraltar and the falkland islands on the basis that it be what the people want can we have referendum of all the eligible chagossian and let they decide the future sovereignty of the chagos island that surely be the only fair solution we have be very clear that these negotiation be between the united kingdom and mauritius and have set out in the past the reason for that the interest of the chagossians be absolutely at the heart of this agreement and as have say have repeatedly engage with they the hon gentleman continue to speculate but with the great of respect he do not know the detail of what have be agree he do not know the detail of what have be share and he do not know the detail that the national security apparatus of the united states have consider be confident that his concern will be allay once he see the detail of this deal merry christmas mr speaker the minister say that view across the chagossian community be mixed in my experience mr speaker when politician say that they be simply choose the view that they want to hear will the minister take the opportunity that have be give by the incoming mauritian government to take breathing space in which he can consult formally and in structured way with the chagossians to find out what they want have engage with the chagossian community twice in recent month as have make clear in answer to number of parliamentary question table by the right hon gentleman colleague the interest of the chagossians will continue to be at the heart of this agreement and take their concern very seriously be be quite honest mr speaker that there be range of view some oppose the deal and some be in favour of it that be completely natural in democratic process let we go to long term campaigner jeremy corbyn thank you mr speaker have be member of the chagos islands british indian ocean territory all party parliamentary group ever since it be found and have lot of interaction with chagossians over the past year can assure the minister that have meet many chagossian in this country and in mauritius they be abominably treat and short change by the deal of and then later remove from the island their one unifying cause be the right of return and settlement and hope the minister will confirm that that right will be uphold understand all the negotiation surround the base but there be no reason why they should not include the right of at least visit if not reside on diego garcia itself the international court of justice be very clear that the decolonisation process be not properly carry out by britain in the when mauritius achieve its independence and that have to be make right that have be vote on by the icj vote on by the un general assembly and endorse by the security council be any more evidence necessary to indicate that it be clearly part of mauritius and that chagossians have right within mauritius as well as on the chagos islands where hopefully they will be able to return agree with the right hon member characterisation of what happen to the chagossians in the past it be matter of deep regret for this government and indeed think that regret be share across the house as have say we will have the interest of the chagossians at the heart of this agreement he be right to characterise the range of view across the chagossian community in response to the question that have just be put to can confirm that the programme of visit will include the ability to visit all the island include diego garcia with the appropriate safeguard in place hope too for resettlement of the outer island provision certainly exist for that to happen and think that that be one of the most likely scenario in which chagossians can finally return to those outer island the minister be try to say that nothing have change on this deal yet medium report suggest that the new prime minister of mauritius believe that the deal be not good enough and the minister be now say that it be the same deal clearly there be something that we be not be tell in this house either the amount of money that we be pay for the rental of the space will have to increase or some term and condition have change thank you mr speaker for ensure that this house can scrutinise the position the minister should have give statement to that effect rather than have to have an urgent question can we therefore pause this process to allow the chagossians to have their say and to look at what the incoming american government have to say and then before we proceed with this giveaway make sure that everyone be in agreement the prime minister of mauritius have make it very clear in his exchange of letter with the prime minister of this country and also in his statement yesterday that they be willing to conclude an agreement with we that be very clear therefore on the fundamental nothing have change we be engage in conversation it be only natural that after an election they would want to do that and to be able to scrutinise the agreement that be entirely proper that be why official have be have these conversation but will not give running commentary on private discussion know the minister will want to give the house the great possible clarity on what have bring we to this point the foreign secretary have be clear that one of the central consideration for the government be the likelihood if not the inevitability of bind legal judgment against the uk in this matter the minister will know that the judgment of the international court of justice be not bind on the united kingdom when dispute be between the uk and another state which be or be member of the commonwealth that would include mauritius do not expect the minister to disclose the legal advice that the government have receive but will he please give the house some more clarity about the nature of the legal jeopardy that the government perceive here will not for that very reason go into that type of advice the right hon and learn member know that from his extensive and distinguished experience on these matter have to ask this fundamental question if there be not problem why do his government start negotiation on this think we can forgive our overseas territory for be little concerned about this government commitment to their right to self determination those of we who like be bit old and have long memory will remember when the previous labour government open negotiation with the spanish government over the future of gibraltar but what be more interested in today be have reassurance from the minister that any decision will be well inform so can he say which of his ministers have visit the british indian ocean territory like the right hon lady but have to say that find it extremely unhelpful the way that the falklands gibraltar and other overseas territory which be not comparable with this situation be constantly bring up have just be with the leader at the joint ministerial council mr speaker you graciously host reception as well and we be absolutely resolute in our commitment to the falklands and gibraltar have be there and say it myself directly on the rock the minister of state for the armed forces have just be in the falklands say exactly the same thing to the falkland islanders can tell you mr speaker they be get feed up with the nonsense that we be hear about this it be hugely problematic for their interest go forward refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests surely the minister must accept though that the timing of this announcement be one of the big diplomatic gaffe of modern time it come literally hour before general election be call there be widespread perception in mauritius that this government be try to give leg up to very unpopular sit government who subsequently score zero out of directly elect seat in the mauritian parliament do he not agree that it be wholly appropriate that the new labour mauritian government would be wary of the intention of his government simply do not recognise the right hon member characterisation can the minister update the house on the measure be take to safeguard against the emergence of chinese military and surveillance capability in the british indian ocean territory have be very clear that within the agreement there be provision to ensure the security of the outer island this deal would not have be agree by the united states security apparatus or indeed by we be it to give that kind of benefit to another country have be very clear about the position of mauritius in relation to china and there be provision and safeguard in place that should allay any fear on that matter the minister do not seem to answer the question raise by the shadow foreign secretary so may ask this just one more time from which budget do the government plan to make the annual payment that he be propose to the mauritian government have be very very conservative members can guffaw all they like but will give the answer that relate to the fact here and that relate to the national security interest of this country the previous government be involve in round of negotiation and they fail to achieve deal we achieve that deal we will provide further detail in due course yet again this new labour government rush into an ill judge and regrettable policy decision to cede the british indian ocean territory to mauritius against expert advice and with no regard to the wish of chagossians in this country and elsewhere it be like the government awful policy on scrap the winter fuel payment for pensioner the heartless family farm tax and their job tax will the government show some leadership admit that they have get this wrong scrap the deal and keep this vital territory under british control to protect uk interest the marine environment and ultimately global security in an increasingly unstable and dangerous world gently suggest that the hon gentleman spend bit more time reflect on the failure of his administration on this and series of other issue from the public finance to our national security this government be clear up the mess that his party leave behind on not only this issue but so many other thank the minister for his answer however be sponsor of the british indian ocean territory citizenship bill which call for descendant bear to individual within the british indian ocean territory to be able to register as biot there be now an even great imperative because of the chagos decision which be make with no input from local people what discussion will take place with those who consider themselves british the chagossians seem not to be assure so what will be do to ensure that they receive all the necessary information in timely manner and will not get answer to their question through news medium outlet have deep respect for the hon gentleman as have say number of time the government deeply regret the way that chagossians be remove from the island and treat thereafter we have always be clear on respect the interest of chagossian community have engage and will continue to engage with chagossian community their interest be at the heart of the deal from the trust fund to the ability to resettle on and visit the island and series of other measure that we have take here in the united kingdom be confident that their interest be be respect provisional local government finance settlement the government be elect on mandate of change to deliver new era of economic growth and national renewal and reverse the year of failure and decline that we inherit through the tough decision that we take in the budget we prevent return to austerity while protect work people payslip the plan for change that the prime minister unveil early this month be the next stage on the journey of reform plan to kick start growth and get britain build again put more money in

change so that the benefit be feel in every community we can not do this alone we need strong empower local government to work with we as equal partner in new relationship public service be our collective duty but after decade of cut fiscal mismanagement and the failure of the previous government to fix the foundation it be fact that council of all political stripe be in crisis the broken local audit system in england and the scandal of the unacceptable backlog that lead to the recent whole of government account disclaimer far illustrate the dire strait of the system and the legacy that we must reconcile the prime minister get this as former director of critical public service he know that reform be vital and so do the deputy prime minister have work on the frontline as home care worker see the human impact every single day be proud to have public service and local government in my blood too that be why take the responsibility to lead the government work to rebuild the sector with the seriousness that be due and the urgency that be require the work have already begin and today mark major milestone in our mission to rebuild local government and put council on firm financial footing as we publish the provisional local government finance settlement for and launch our consultation on these proposal alongside our consultation on wide funding reform in the autumn budget the government announce billion of additional funding for local government service of which billion would come in the settlement present today but we know that we need to rally that be why be announce over million of additional grant that include over million of extra funding for social care since the policy statement also confirm that the new funding include million that will be make available in the final settlement to support council with the increase in employer national insurance contribution the package in the provisional settlement will enable local government to invest in the vital service that people rely on make billion available equivalent to real term increase in council core spending power when compare with confirm that this will increase even far in the final settlement today be the start not the end take together the additional funding make available in this settlement and the budget will deliver over billion of new funding for local service over and above local council tax alongside that every authority in england will receive one off share of million currently hold in the business rate levy account together we must ensure that public investment be use for long term prevention and reform of local public service rather than expensive short term crisis response which often have much bad outcome we be determined to end the cycle of failure that we have see for too long and we will provide certainty by ensure that no authority will see reduction in its core spending power after account for council tax flexibility next year we be also ensure that taxpayer money go to where it be need the most that include an immediate down payment highly target million recovery grant fund through repurpose the rural service delivery grant and the service grant ahead of broad reform to fairer funding system later today we be launch consultation on local authority funding reform start in there will always be tough decision to make but we be determined to ensure that we fairly reflect the real driver of cost include demand the need for public service and importantly the ability of council to raise revenue locally that be why we be make up to billion of extra funding available through this settlement to help local authority to meet the spiral cost of social care that include an additional million uplift to the social care grant which confirm today take the total increase to the grant for to million that include the new child social care prevention grant first announce in the policy statement which today confirm will be uplifted in further final settlement by million take the total to million that be the first step in our national roll out of transform family health service as we double settlement investment in preventive child social care service to over million next year place on record my appreciation and that of the deputy prime minister for the partnership and determination show by the treasury the education and health secretaries and their ministers and official we will not do as the previous government do and impoverish council and those who need support the most then parade they around for public shaming that help no one we must work together to get council back on their foot financially the principle stand that it be for local authority to decide at what level they set their council tax and they be accountable to local taxpayer however we be commit to keep taxis on work people as low as possible and we have to strike balance so we will maintain the previous government policy as set out in the office for budget responsibility forecast of set council tax referendum principle make up of core principle and principle for the adult social care precept that mean that resident will have the final say over increase that go beyond that we have put in place framework for to support those council in the most financial difficulty similar to the approach take by the previous government we will consider request for bespoke referendum principle on case by case basis we expect the change outline today will give the respite need and clarity on the direction of travel but we also know that year have hit hard and for some the recovery grant and the other measure will still mean that additional support be require we will put taxpayer and the impact on work people at the forefront of our decision and we will look carefully at council individual circumstance for instance how much they charge in council tax and the strength of their plan to protect vulnerable people on low income to recognise the impact of council tax on household across all council we be consult with the sector on change to payment instalment which will allow annual council tax bill that be spread over month to move to month schedule by right help household budgeting spread the cost for work people and mirror how most household bill be pay ensure local government can deliver for work people in the long term require root and branch reform of the way that council be fund that be why through the settlement the first multiyear settlement in year we will introduce an up to date assessment of council need and resource today we be launch consultation on the objective and principle of those change we will consider representation from all corner of the sector to develop our understanding of the driver of need include deprivation and of the impact in rural area on service delivery fairness for all deliver once and for all we will redouble our work to shift power away from westminster into the hand of those community who know their area well we will reduce the myriad of fund pot that council have to contend with give they the flexibility they need to deliver local and national priority that effort be underpin by our strategy to streamline and simplify the local audit system in england local community deserve transparency accountability and the effective early warning system that local audits provide we be take immediate action by replace the broken and dispersed system with focused proportionate and value for money local audit office ensure that the system be fit for purpose this be long term challenge and it will take hard work and dedication to achieve which be why we be waste no time in fix the foundation get the audit backlog under control overhaul the system for the long term return to secure multiyear settlement and bring forward ambitious plan for devolution growth and reform of public service while improve standard accountability and efficiency we be build for the long term to get local government fighting fit legal and decent and as equal partner to rebuild our country from the ground up and ready to play its part in deliver the government mission through our plan for change commend the statement to the house call the shadow minister it be christmas the two wise man and the wise woman on the government front bench have arrive bear their gift for local council but on close inspection while the goal be beautifully package the box be somewhat empty than people have be expect it have be challenging few week for local government we have hear the government plan to take as much of the local as they can out of local government and it be clear that this statement will leave our local authority face further challenge in do their day job and significant uncertainty as we go into the new year all that come from government who promise just short time ago that they would end the bidding war as they call it among council they then promptly start new bidding war for homelessness funding rather than address it through the settlement give that it be core statutory duty of local authority the consequence of the government approach be that localism on central government term only represent just in london million net cut in the funding that council will have available to deal with homelessness at time when rough sleeping be at council face uncertainty about the cost of funding election the minister tell we just few day ago that he would be consider whether to cancel local election in place face local government reorganisation up and down the country in all those local authority our return officer be book and pay for the polling station hire the staff and carry out the canvassing they need certainty as we go into the new year of course our council face additional and uncertain challenge that be announce in the children wellbeing and schools bill as well as from various statement make by other ministers that clearly imply significant increase in the cost of new statutory duty come the way of our local authority with no clarity about how those may be fund all of that be on top of bring forward local government reorganisation proposal to deadline early in the new year it be not clear whose interest that serve but for all those local authority that may be consider that it represent significant additional cost pressure as many of our councillor go away for their christmas break and try to digest the detail of the settlement over their christmas lunch they will face rumble indigestion as they realise that their budget pressure will grow significantly especially in rural local authority which face huge loss from the cancellation of funding that support the additional and quantified cost of local government service in rural environment will be fair to the minister the billion black hole that we spot at the time of the budget announcement have shrink by around million but when it come to council tax increase that will be announce by our local authority in february how much will they have to put up council tax to meet the shortfall how much will they have to put up council tax to cover the government new approach to asylum which be drive up the cost of temporary accommodation when will the government provide clarity on the dedicated school grant override give the impact it have on our local authority budget when will they provide clarity on the election preparation cost give that the local government association have identify billion shortfall just from the government national insurance contribution measure when will they announce further funding to cover those cost let we consider this the cancellation of the new home bonus mean million lose by birmingham million lose by buckinghamshire million from central bedfordshire million each from ealing and milton keynes million from north yorkshire alone million from lincolnshire million from the rural service grant and an million cut for rural local authority in this budget it be clear there be tough time ahead for local authority as they begin to look at the detail the new home bonus in particular mean the place that have build the most home be the one that lose the benefit if this be fix the foundation would not want to stay in the tent which be the only thing they would hold up in our local authority here we go again would think that after year of council be on year to year watch to find out what position they would be in the conservatives would at least welcome the preparation now for multiyear settlement they have year to get their house in order and they could not even line up to give council more than month certainty about what be come the one thing council be absolutely certain about be that it be only go to be bad news after bad news when there be crisis in adult social care and child service and when homelessness be rise at rate of knot the last government be completely miss in action that be what council be face how many council go bust on their watch council be line up say to the government that they could not afford birmingham let we talk about birmingham because the opposition reference the million new home bonus the new recovery million of brand new money target at those council with high deprivation and low tax basis just for birmingham be million that will start the repair work of rebuild the foundation when we talk about fair funding and why it be need we will not do what the previous government do where they put party politic ahead of the national interest let remind the conservatives of what the previous prime minister the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak say in tunbridge wells in we inherit bunch of formula from labour that shove all the funding into deprived urban area and that need to be undo start the work of undo that that be record of shame it be nothing to preach about to right the wrong of the past year and finally get money where it be need this government will work for public service not party interest call the chair of the housing communities and local government committee thank the minister for outline this much need funding uplift agree with he that council up and down the country regardless of their political persuasion need the government to support they not to criticise and denigrate they which be sadly what we have have in some case over the past year he mention some of the authority that still face those pressure include birmingham nottingham and woking which have already effectively face bankruptcy the local government association have outline that up to one in four council be likely to require additional emergency support sky report have today outline that family be stick in temporary accommodation for an average of five and half year we should not be call that temporary accommodation imagine spend the entirety of your school life in temporary accommodation because you do not have your own home the funding that the minister have announce for tackle homelessness be welcome but it be stick plaster if we be honest because it do not give council the tool to build social housing homelessness will end only if we build new home so what step be the minister take to ensure that council have those power in the short term the billion boost to the homelessness prevention grant be step in the right direction but the government must consider the unintended consequence local authority be already reliant on that funding to plug gap in temporary accommodation many use up to of it for that purpose but the new rule mean that only of the grant may be use in that way how will that change not lead to further reduction in funding for temporary accommodation at time when as we all know the system be break thank the chair of the select committee for her question we be all get ready for christmas and look forward to time with our family and our own respite but in the end it be hard to enjoy that moment give the prospect of just how many child in this country be in temporary accommodation some child do not have secure affordable place to live and so be in temporary accommodation in my own town there be such child we do our good we martial for the christmas party that charity put on but it be no replacement for secure family home there will be lot of difference in the exchange that take place here but we need to focus on why we be do what we be do the reason we be build million new home be of course economic and about decent well pay working class job we talk lot about that but in the end it be about sort out the housing crisis if we sort out that crisis we sort out the temporary accommodation crisis and the financial crisis in local government if we sort out the crisis in adult social care of course we sort out the financial crisis but we will finally deliver on the promise of the state look after the generation who give so much if we sort out the crisis in child social care we finally deliver on the state promise to invest in the next generation repair the foundation be of course about financial foundation that be important but it be also about people and community and in the end that be what we be all here for call the liberal democrat spokesperson refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be member of bournemouth christchurch and poole council local government be bring to its knee under the last conservative government with fund slash and responsibility pile on its deplete and exhausted workforce thank the local government workforce and wish they happy christmas and my local liberal democrat colleague welcome the move to multi year settlement something we have long call for and the funding announce today for homelessness prevention agree with the deputy prime minister and the minister that we must eliminate the use of especially for family at christmas also welcome the announce consultation on change the funding formula as listen to our local leader be absolutely crucial however we remain really concerned about the removal of the rural service grant which suggest that the government do not understand the nature of rural community include the difficulty of provide service over sometimes vast area subsidise public transport and identify hidden poverty often among old population that cost an awful lot on special educational need it be deeply worry that council particularly those that may literally run out of money such as bournemouth christchurch and poole council still have no idea about what will happen to the statutory override how be they suppose to set their budget in february without that certainty can the minister confirm that no council will be force to join the safety valve scheme for example which would put at risk the support provide to some of the most vulnerable child as we go into winter the impact on social care be of the great concern dorset council share with letter send to the dorset care association in which the director of adult social care state we simply will not have the resource to meet the national insurance contribution for provider indeed the minister tell in response to write question that only direct national insurance cost would be cover what do he say to provider and to staff in charity such as diversability who fear for their job this christmas it be important that we have debate on local government finance base on the number have say already that when take into account council tax no council will see reduction in its core spending power that mean that before the final settlement and not include extended producer responsibility and live part of the grant the hon lady own council will see an increase of at least we be cover the national insurance contribution make there and in addition we be fund an extra million through the social care grant we have hear representation through the sector we be not say that all this will fix everything today it can not we be less than six month into the new government and we have year to reconcile hope the hon lady do not mind but remind she that number of those year be under the coalition government what we miss then and be try to make up for now be that if we take away community and preventative service which we all know make big difference not just in cost but in outcome we end up pay more and more at the back end but for bad outcome the cruelty be that the liberal democrats moment in government which accept be short be the time to invest in reform and prevention that time be not take and that opportunity be miss and year later we be reconcile that and fix the system from the ground up we will do that welcome this commitment to local government and recognise that the minister have big job to do in address the challenge that have arise because of the last year not least in local government audit welcome what seem to be commitment to embrace the redmond review will he give more detail about what will replace the office for local government most in the sector would agree that oflog the office for local government have vague remit that be an expensive way of gather datum in the end if it be to be develop we could risk mission creep whereby its remit would verge into the area that local authority so dislike about the former audit commission we be try to get the right balance between the early warning system that enable we to see which individual council be under stress and importantly note any develop systemic threat or theme for which central government might have to take much early action we want to rebuild that early warning system however we be absolutely clear that we be not replace the audit commission for one it be hugely expensive and we need to ensure that any money go to the frontline of local public service honestly council do not need inspector go in to mark their homework when they should be trust to get on and do the job well people understand what the national audit office be so we hope that they will understand and see the benefit of local audit office and that it will be embrace by the sector will the minister set out how he expect local authority such as mine in buckinghamshire to absorb with such little notice multi million pound impact from significant change to the social care funding formula and the effect of the nics rise on commission service and supplier particularly charity such as mind which will be greatly affect by the change again the hon lady council will see core spending power increase of and that be only this part of the settlement it do not include extend producer responsibility or billion of pound in other grant that will come this be genuine attempt to make sure we give council the funding that be need and think we have succeed in very difficult context but it be matter of fact that some council local tax basis be strong for reason that go back many year and in some case many century that be not because of the effort of the local council it be what it be and for too long council in deprive community with low tax basis have do everything that have be ask of they they have raise council tax to the maximum so local community be pay more and more but increasingly they be get less and less they be see their neighbourhood service diminish there be tough choice and we do not shy away from that we have be very honest in the oral statement about the trade off that have have to be make but the increase of in the core spending power of the hon lady council will help deal with the issue she have raise would prefer to see the wise man and woman on labour front bench than ebenezer scrooge and jacob marley on the conservative front bench do the minister agree that the statement he have make today be in stark contrast to the legacy leave by the conservative party which leave local government in dire strait that be the point the previous government know just how bad the situation be but they put off the tough decision for example how many time in year do the previous government promise that they would go back to multi year settlement so that council know where they be but fail to do so how many time do the previous government say that they would bring in fair funding review but fail to do so how many time do the previous government say that they would deal with the audit backlog they do not just fail to do that the backlog get bad if we have not take action it would have be set of audit account and that be not due to covid because those account go back to that failure be systemic and it be all on the watch on the previous government what that mean in practice be billion of public money that they could not account for so they do not really know the state of the sector because they completely give up on monitor it follow on from the question ask by my hon friend the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey and the minister answer can assure he that there be area of deprivation in rural community such as buckinghamshire far to the point make by the shadow minister my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds while the devil be in the detail it already look from the figure like buckinghamshire will take multimillion pound hit from the loss of various grant can the minister give an assurance that rural community will be treat equally to urban one and will not be leave behind either the hon gentleman do not know the status of the rural service delivery grant or he be try to mislead the house large share of large rural authority should have get the rural service delivery grant but do not because that grant be not about rural service when the previous prime minister stand up in tunbridge wells and say that the government have take money from deprive community and move it across he do not mean that it be for all community it be for party politic so where be conservative members then when it come to those rural community that do not get the grant do not hear anybody stand up and ask for their rural community to get the money for those service that conservative members be now try to champion we will absolutely make sure that deprivation and need be part of the funding reform that be come but we will also make sure that we genuinely take into account the cost of deliver service in rural area the sector need fair funding review and we be determined to deliver one welcome the minister statement particularly the additional funding to tackle homelessness and provide early help and support for family also welcome the principle that resource should be direct accord to need however as the minister know the elephant in the room of local government finance be that the statutory override for deficit relate to special educational need and disability be due to come to an end in march council will be set their budget in the new year through to the end of march and if there be no plan to address the send deficit many council will be issue section notice council urgently need certainty at this point so what discussion be take place with local authority about the statutory override and when will they have the certainty they need agree about the importance and significance of the statutory override that be feel very acutely in the department and in the sector we be consult now on number of matter include the statutory override and we be in constant dialogue with the treasury about how we deal with that in the long term in the end this be another example of the legacy we have inherit we be take very difficult decision to reconcile reform and repair the system decision that should have be take early but be not that issue be very much on our agenda call lee dillon member of the select committee refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests be member of west berkshire council last christmas be the leader of that council and can honestly say to the minister that would much rather receive in my inbox the settlement propose by the government than what receive from the conservative government in his statement the minister talk about fix the foundation welcome the billion for social care but do he agree that with council spend up to two third on their budget on adult and child social care social care need full scale reform if we be to fix the foundation will he support the liberal democrats call for commission to undertake that piece of work to be honest although absolutely agree that we need reform believe the urgency be today think about the number of old people who would have be entitle to adult social care in who now do not even get support from the local authority because eligibility have change in so many area there be crisis and that crisis be not just be feel in the home of all the people who have give to this country and deserve well it be be feel in the acute sector and in the health service where we be pay far more at the back end because community preventative service be not in place we be work with the cabinet office and the treasury to say let learn as we go on some of this in term of innovation and pilot where we can invest to save invest in those community preventative service up front to try to well reduce demand of course it be about money but in the end it be about the service we provide appreciate the hon gentleman comment about the settlement in the round refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests as councillor in telford and wrekin as well as an honorary vice president of the local government association the government first step to restore funding for local government after very difficult year be welcome but council area such as mine have fast grow population provide outstanding service and provide leadership to the sector on all three of those count until this point that have not be reflect in the settlement that telford and wrekin council have receive will this government change that also gently remind the house that when be chair of the local government association over the past couple of year there be not single conservative councillor who think the settlement or the last government approach to it be fair or proportionate be pleased to say that this year core spending power in my hon friend area will increase by and again that do not take into account the billion of pound that will follow that reflect the service demand pressure but also the reality of the local tax basis in that area telford like many area do very good job of provide local public service but the council itself recognise that the neighbourhood service that most people see and feel those that make difference to quality of life have be retreat on because of the need to fund targeted service and social care in particular we be absolutely determined to rebuild adult and child social care and sort out the housing crisis but we also want people to live in good place that people be proud of which require those neighbourhood service to be rebuild it will take time to do that but our commitment to telford and the rest of the country be that we be absolutely determined to do so the core spending power table that the government have publish today show that total government funding for south staffordshire be down by just what do the government have against council tax payer in south staffordshire give the hon gentleman background be surprised that he be display such ignorance of council finance the government role in local government finance be to be an equaliser as he know everywhere have the ability to raise tax locally through council tax and business rate but he also know that some area have the ability to raise far more than other because of their tax base it be the job of the government to equalise to make sure that when it come to demand for service everywhere get the service provision it need that require the government to provide more funding in some place to reconcile that low tax base so that everyone get the service they be entitle to the presentation that the hon gentleman have offer show either ignorance or politic but think the country deserve well very much welcome today statement and the extra funding that have be announce commend the minister for repeatedly remind the conservative party of year of austerity during which local government see big cut to its budget than any other part of the public sector of course the lib dems be party to the coalition government when the bad of those cut be make may ask my hon friend two question first when he come to consider more fundamental reform which we accept will not be in place for another year will he look at the council tax system as whole it be an unfair and regressive system that take disproportionate amount of money from the poor people in the poor house secondly can he confirm that the local audit office will be stand alone body that look at public sector audit not an add on to the audit reporting and governance authority previous proposal which be basically to be private sector body that look at local government as an afterthought thank the former chair of the housing communities and local government committee for that question can confirm that the core spending power of that element in this settlement for sheffield will be which be before the additional fund that will follow sheffield get good settlement from this but we recognise that it be in context of grow demand so we hope council see that we be meet they on the challenge they face on whether we will review council tax think every government recognise that there be huge limitation with council tax and also huge geographical variation it be regressive which be the nature of tax base on property value rather than the income of the people in they however council tax be understand its collection rate be high and it be really the foundation although not the total as my hon friend know of the funding of council service the urgent issue we need to face be that previous government move away from their role as the equaliser in the system whereas the revenue support grant use to be in place to support council by reconcile low tax basis recent government have be miss in action we be say to council of all political stripe across every type of authority and every part of the country that we will reconcile that and work with they to equalise the situation on the local audit office we be absolutely determined that this will not be return to the audit commission we be try to do number of thing first we want to rebuild the early warning system to make sure that we see any systemic problem develop in the system however we also recognise that the cost of audit have increase by which be direct cost to taxpayer and that there be fragmentation in the market and we need to look at the fall back position as oppose to auditor supply there be quite lot that we need to deal with but this be very much about the provision of audit and make sure the early warning system be rebuild it be certainly not blow to the inspection regime know the minister want to give thorough response but have absolute confidence that he can do that with few word welcome the government statement and their attention to local government finance deliver service in large dispersed rural area such as mine in south devon be challenging and costly what plan do the minister have to ensure that rural local authority will be allocate additional funding to manage the extra cost of deliver service across area such as mine that be exactly the point of move to fair funding formula and we will of course consult on the component part make that up we have to take this in the round genuinely want any part of the country and any type of local authority to be able to interrogate the system and even if they disagree with the quantum there will always be argument that to be able to say that the rationale and the evidence base hold it be matter of accept fact that there be premium on the cost of rural service delivery just because of the travelling involve for example for home care worker there be the travel time between appointment and all the rest of it however it be probably also accept that the evidence base be not as robust and strong as it need to be so we want to make sure through this process that we take into account the need for that strong and robust evidence base fourteen year of tory austerity and fiscal mismanagement have halve the central government funding for newcastle city council suck the blood vampire like from our local economy and leave local business and family drown in uncertainty so welcome this increase funding and the specific commitment on housing and social care however can the minister reassure that there be further light at the end of the tunnel because this government work on reform public service local funding business rate and innovation investment will mean that the people of newcastle and the north east will have the power and the resource to build the public service and the economy that we choose that be completely right by the way give credit to council official frontline worker and councillor because it be local government that have lead on innovation and reform and that have bind together local community in very difficult time and would say with other part of the system too often work against the local interest not with it we need to find way of send that message not to local government because think it be understand there but to the wide system we need to say that when we make such public sector investment in newcastle and other place we expect the whole system to rally around single plan for the place and its people we expect local government to be respect as the local leader the convenor of place that can hold the ring to make sure there be not duplication or contradiction and that the money deliver the right outcome for local people we be absolutely committed to that large rural county such as norfolk face high cost in deliver their service and the government job tax add million to the pressure that norfolk county council be face can the minister clarify whether the nics funding he refer to in his statement which will go to norfolk county council and other council will cover the cost of social care commission service first pay tribute to the leader in both norfolk and suffolk for the conversation we be have particularly on devolution we look forward to hope make progress on that in the near future because that be where the real prize be we can sort out the foundation of council funding and reorganise public service to get efficiency but in the end we need to see devolution we need to see power come out of this place and be give to local community the good way to achieve that be through mayoral strategic authority work hand in glove with local authority on the question about nic we have provide over million for the cost of employer national insurance contribution and we be provide additional money through the social care grant and it be for council to decide how good to spend that money welcome the minister statement and the fact that this government be start to fix the damage do by more than decade of disastrous settlement for local government in my constituency that mean increase of more than for each local authority in core spending power but do the minister agree that as important if not more important be the consultation on long term proposal to fundamentally improve the way that local government be fund through fair system that be exactly right we have approach this year as very much recovery operation we could see that council be in the ditch and need to be pull out and take home and that be exactly what this one year settlement will do however what they need and deserve be multi year settlement that give long term security and stability and for that long term settlement not to be the continuation of broken system but system that have be rewire and put right with the fair funding review the multi year settlement and the reform agenda put prevention at the heart of public service we will begin to achieve the end to which my hon friend rightly point we have hear lot from colleague about the delivery of rural service harrogate and knaresborough be one of the area that see local government reorganisation and we be now geographically the large council in england so what reassurance will there be on make sure that rural service can be provide one of the big barrier the council face be be able to deliver home to school transport the cost of which have go from million just few year ago to what be expect to be over million this year have cover the rural service element before so will home in on the home to school transport issue which know be huge issue in many county council area where child be carry far away to get to school will be honest and say that some of that be absolutely require and have always be require but quite lot of it be the result of broken system in which education be not be provide in local community and parent have be force to move far out the plan we have to rebuild education and to invest in school some of it fund through imposition on private school to get that money into the state sector be about rebuild local education provision so that parent have the choice and the confidence to go to the state school near to their home that will have an impact on council budget for home to school transport after eight year of conservative rule in stoke on trent the council be take to the brink of bankruptcy and the minister will be well aware of the extraordinary financial support that we have receive and about which we be have additional conversation how will the recovery fund interact with authority in receipt of extraordinary financial support may also put on record the thank of the city to councillor alastair watson and jon rouse the chief executive for the work they have do to stabilise council finance in difficult time thank my hon friend for that question and join he in pay tribute to the council officer and council leadership in stoke on trent as direct cash payment the down payment mention early stoke on trent council will get million and its core spending power will increase by just in this round but that may well over by the time the full allocation come through that be part of the rebuilding process and as have say it reflect the fact that we can not punish council because of their inherit historical tax base we must make sure that the government step up to their role to equalise the system so that everyone have fair access to public service thank the minister for his statement recognise and accept the importance of proper funding for area of high deprivation but it be important to acknowledge that council with low deprivation face rise demand for their service in my constituency of wokingham child with special educational need and disability be suffer from this lack of investment they be deprive too but in way that be not be measure so their council be not get the crucial funding to look after send service properly we want wokingham borough council to get on with the job of deliver more for local resident so how will the minister ensure that wokingham receive what it need thank the hon member for come to one of our surgery to make representation on behalf of his council know that he care about these issue we need to be careful not to think that those who have receive the recovery grant be the only place that have deprivation because that be not the case the recovery grant be very targeted and have two component one be whether the area have weak tax base the other be whether the area have significantly high deprivation than other comparable area we be clear that we need to root out deprivation and need wherever they exist the fair funding review be intend to take into account many different component part include the cost of rural service delivery general overhead premise cost deprivation and the rest so that whatever the issue and whatever the context council have confidence that the funding be correct thank the minister and his team for listen to the voice of portsmouth north and for the additional funding allocate to homelessness and rough sleeping so that portsmouth city council project deficit can be address it would be remiss of not to thank the council worker alongside bev and all the volunteer at helping hands and other charity in the city they have support the grow number of people on our street under the shameful tory coalition reign of recklessness can the minister confirm that after five month in government this be just the start of additional support for our council can he also clarify that should the lib dem run portsmouth city council need further advice his door be always open congratulate my hon friend on her question to the prime minister early the council overall core spending power will increase by put portsmouth to one side whatever measure we take in general term we can never cast the net so wide and so thinly that we catch every council at the extreme end if we do the net would never get to the depth need the door be open to any council that need conversation about their particular circumstance regardless of party politic council can have absolute confidence that we will deal with they professionally appropriately and with the respect they need rise member will know that if they be not here for the opening statement they will not be call later in the statement draw the house attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests as county councillor in oxfordshire in my constituency and in my surgery and correspondence the frustration desperation and anger of parent and child with special educational need be constant and shocking their need be not be meet and as the minister have acknowledge the funding shortfall for the high need block be significant and have lead to deficit which the local government association estimate will be billion at the end of this financial year very much welcome the minister focus on this issue as well as that of his colleague in the department for education can he assure parent and child in my constituency that under the multi year settlement to which he have refer the future need of these child will be adequately meet and the need of the council address as we face those huge deficit yes can confirm that we be provide with the support of the department for education new funding of billion to support the high need block in send for the reason that the hon member say we also know that money today be not the answer in the long term we have to reform send provision in the mainstream so that parent and pupil get the support that they need welcome the money for homelessness in today statement evidence increasingly suggest that prevention work in homelessness calderdale be one of three local authority work with crisis to pilot system of early prevention in six month that have already lead to reduction in people use temporary accommodation will the minister look at that work and commit to championing what work my hon friend make good point where council such as calderdale be do well and excelling they be work hand in glove with the local community and voluntary organisation to ensure they get the coverage to reach into community applaud that work and hope that the uplift in core spending power in this part of the settlement go some way to support it thank the minister for positive statement on the funding that be available government policy state that local government be the foundation of good state from bin collection to drive economic growth it be paramount that that be do across the whole of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland what discussion have the minister have or will he have with the secretary of state for northern ireland regard the possibility of secure great funding through the barnett consequential so that northern ireland can have the funding it need to stimulate local community and economic growth probably have to be bit careful not to stray into that give that this be statement about council in england but the premise of the hon member question about adequate funding for local public service be correct let we remember that council deliver more than different service to local community in england they employ more than million people many of whom will be local people of the community council be huge power and force for good and will certainly ensure that the representation he have make be pass on to the secretary of state for northern ireland massive cut to local government service by the previous conservative government have see rough sleeping more than double and family in temporary accommodation regularly force to move from hotel to hotel with their belonging in black sack welcome the record million in homelessness funding that the minister department have award to ealing council that be an increase of almost million can the minister outline how that will help those people sleep out in west ealing and in southall town centre tonight how will it end the use of hotel and bed and breakfast for family in ealing southall that be precisely why we have provide an extra million to meet the demand we do not take any pleasure or pride in that actually it be sign of system that be not work that we must keep on provide more and more money for temporary accommodation to the benefit of hotel owner and not to the benefit of the people who need safe secure and affordable home this funding have to be part of wide plan that be why the million new home be so important if we do not provide those safe affordable home for people we will always be in this cycle of try to play catch up and that be not sustainable may too welcome the multi year certainty give by the statement today as former deputy leader of milton keynes council can say that it be the kind of certainty we ask for rather than get letter on christmas eve usually set out what the funding might be already halfway through our budget set process also welcome the fact that milton keynes be get more than million to prevent homelessness welcome the fact that there will be transparency but can the minister give reassurance to milton keynes that with the loss of the new home bonus additional funding will be give to milton keynes to make up for that difference thank my hon friend for the advocacy that she show for milton keynes and for the local authority overall core spending power in milton keynes will increase by and that be only part of the settlement the council can easily expect that to increase in its final settlement it show that the government be work in partnership with the council to deal with the issue that she raise welcome the extra funding go in to tackle homelessness especially the million allocate to croydon council after year of tory members turn their back on local council local councillor and the community they serve do the minister agree that there be cost to do nothing when it come to reform local government funding can he outline what kind of support might be available to council still carry large amount of debt there be legitimate question to ask the previous government about why on earth some council be allow to borrow disproportionately to their revenue in the end some council have find themselves on the wrong side of that when we be design the recovery grant that be about deprivation and low tax basis and deal with the quantum be about direct money to particular service but will be honest there will always be council croydon will be one of they which because of their unique situation be just outside that general allocation we be ready to have one to one support conversation where need madam deputy speaker let wish you lovely christmas break hon member ah do put off welcome the minister statement as someone who work for homeless charity in harlow welcome the additional at least million of funding to support homelessness and rough sleeping in harlow as well as the additional million of funding to neighbouring district which partly overlap between and the hon member for epping forest dr hudson that be couple with multi year funding for council for which achieve cross party support in the harlow district council chamber do the minister agree that that show clear desire by the government to support the most vulnerable people in my constituency but that that must come with join up thinking on the plan million new home and investment in our nhs that be cute way to get long question in merry christmas madam deputy speaker my hon friend be absolutely right pay tribute to the work that he do to represent the people of harlow as well as the local authority we stand ready to work on those long term funding settlement issue to ensure that we genuinely rebuild the foundation commend the minister for his work in bring forward the settlement to secure fair deal for the sector but as many hon member have allude to the elephant in the room be temporary housing that be in large part due to decision take by the last conservative government to freeze the housing benefit subsidy at level and cap the local housing allowance at far low level than local housing tend to cost with the end result be that local government be subsidise central government welfare bill to an astounding extent with two third of the council tax in my local area go towards pay that bill as an advocate for the sector will the minister meet with counterpart in the relevant departments to try to lift that cap so that people be house at rate that be cheap both financially and socially we come back again to the broken housing market the need to build million new home be there but let we be clear they have to be the right home in the right place for the need in the local area that mean not only more social home but council provision we continue to see cycle we have all see today inflation figure which be drive by private rent in which the taxpayer pay more and more for accommodation that be often substandard and do not even meet the decent home standard with no benefit to the taxpayer we have get to rebuild council housing and social housing and make it fit for purpose and affordable thank you madam deputy speaker and merry christmas will get any long for say that thank the minister for his statement and welcome the announcement make today in the last year of the previous labour government st helens borough council receive million in central government funding under the conservatives that be cut to just million year service can not be run on thin air and despite the good effort of council staff and labour councillor cut have have consequence will the minister assure and my constituent that under this government we will get the funding for the essential service that we need that be exactly the reason core spending power in st helens will increase by just through these measure give the type of council we could easily expect that to top that be our down payment to say we need time to prepare the multi year settlement and we need to do the fair funding review but we know that council can not wait for that give the last decade as my hon friend describe the last question go to the ever patient mark ferguson thank you for squeeze in madam deputy speaker refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be glad to hear my hon friend refer to the unfair funding formula champion by the previous prime minister laser target as it be at reduce support to community like mine there be part of gateshead where the average life expectancy for man be year yet the last government focus wholeheartedly on reduce support to area of deprivation like that welcome the almost million that gateshead council be receive to tackle homelessness this year on top of its previous allocation but give that one of the shameful legacy of the last government be crumble infrastructure in community like mine what effort will be make to support council like mine with the infrastructure they need in the end some of it be about the quantum of funding and some of it be about freedom of funding take away the ringfencing and reporting be absolutely critical to that gateshead and every other council have our absolute commitment finally madam deputy speaker may say thank you to the million of public sector worker council official and importantly councillor for the work that they do in provide good public service every year day in day out may wish everyone merry christmas and happy settlement day winter preparedness with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on winter preparedness before begin want to say very special thank you to all the staff who will be keep our nhs go over the christmas holiday and into the new year when be manager in the nhs work on winter planning so if may will say an additional thank you to all the people who be often unseen the manager and admin staff who also keep the system go know how hard it be for people to work in the system with the challenge that winter can bring through increase demand and high rate of infection there be thing that we can not predict storms bert and darragh have add pressure and we might have cold snap know that many people like winter cold snap of snow and ice but it be not something that the nhs ever want to see the nhs have excellent people who have do this before and unlike last year thank to the new government many of they will not be on strike while we can not control the weather we can plan prepare and pull together so today want to update colleague with the current picture before move on to the thing that we be do nhs england and the uk health security agency will publish the late statistic tomorrow morning as usual but we do know that level of seasonal illness be high the most recent figure show that last week there be increase in flu case compare with the same week last year but that be comparable to level we see two year ago norovirus case be high but covid rate be low and although rate of rsv respiratory syncytial virus have be high we expect they to start come down over the next few week want to make it clear that the current rate for both bed occupancy and ambulance delay be unacceptably high will shortly come to measure about how we be deal with that capacity will not rehearse the darzi investigation and his finding except on one thing remind the house that he find perpetual bed crisis particularly during peak period like winter cold snap that mean that every winter our staff have be waste precious time solve process problem ring round ward to find bed and desperately try to hold the system together we can see that in the figure on an average evening in patient would have be in the queue when they arrive at typical accident and emergency department in they be the four hour standard have not be meet for nearly decade and ambulance response time have not be consistently achieve since their introduction in in november the average ambulance response time stand at minute which be more than double the nhs constitutional standard third of the million people who attend last month wait more than four hour and one in of those people more than wait for more than hour those life and death delay be the result of deep structural issue in the nhs that can not be fix overnight but this winter nhs staff will be on the frontline not the picket line because we take different approach on how to work with staff and the union to resolve the resident doctor dispute we speak to they on day one we meet they in week one and by week four we have negotiate deal to end their strike that be why for the first time in three year the government be fully focus on winter and not on plan for strike this be what we be do first the nhs be manage extra demand by strengthen same day emergency care and offer more fall service for old people with upgrade hour live datum centre secondly we be continue to support system that be struggle with direct intervention through the nhs urgent and emergency care tiering programme thirdly the secretary of state be chair weekly meeting with and senior leader to ensure that we be manage pressure across the entire system last week he specially convene with trust and tell they to prioritise patient safety by focus on key metric include improve emergency ambulance response time address handover delay and tackle the long wait in we have make it crystal clear that we do not want trust to prioritise patient who can be see and discharge more quickly over those with the great clinical need because this government will always prioritise people not performance this morning the nhs publish letter outline how it be prioritise patient safety fourthly be take step to ensure that we get clear picture of what be happen on the ground recently visit newham hospital bristol southmead hospital and the head office of nhs england to see the aforementioned operational control centre where it receive datum in real time and respond to problem as they emerge fifthly we launch national communication campaign in the autumn to encourage people across the country to take their winter vaccine with particular focus on people who be less likely to come forward that last point be essential because the good and easy way to keep people out of hospital this christmas be to encourage they to come forward and get vaccinate last year people who receive covid vaccine be half as likely to be admit to hospital than those who do not so far we have deliver over million flu jab and million covid jab and we have introduce the first ever public vaccination campaign for rsv with over million and count vaccination deliver to protect young baby and the elderly in total we have deliver nearly million vaccination for this winter and thank every person who have come forward to protect themselves and the vulnerable now would like to speak directly to anyone who have not yet be vaccinate no one want to be separate from their family and stick in hospital this christmas and there be real risk that people may inadvertently take flu home to love one this year please protect yourself your family and the nhs and book that appointment today because tomorrow be the last day you can book vaccine through the nhs app or website although after tomorrow there will be local solution while we tackle winter pressure in the short term we be fix the foundation of our nhs with long term reform two week ago the prime minister speak to the nation about our plan for change and set out our ambition for the health service over this parliament we will get grip on waiting list and return to of patient wait no long than week from referral to treatment by the end of this parliament we be also take action on social care introduce the large increase in the carer allowance weekly earning limit since we will ensure that carer allowance meet its objective while review unpaid carer leave and look at the benefit of introduce pay carer leave we will publish an improved well care fund framework use billion of funding to provide well more integrated health and social care for patient and people who draw on care we be help disabled people on low income adapt their home through the disabled facility grant the employment rights bill be already in committee lay the foundation for the first ever pay agreement for care worker as first step towards build consensus on the long term reform need to create national care service by the end of our first year in government we will deliver an extra million operation scan and appointment through innovation investment in additional capacity and productivity gain we be share the good of the nhs with the rest of the nhs with our further faster team these be team of expert that be support trust with long wait to tackle waiting list and increase productivity they have be deploy to five trust so far and we be already see improvement for example in theatre for this financial year the government have commit billion more in everyday spending on health and social care than be plan by the last government in the spring budget we be give our capital starve nhs the funding it so badly lack over the past decade set aside at least billion next year which will create additional capacity include new surgical hub and diagnostic scanner and new bed across the estate that will enable additional procedure and over million diagnostic test as they come online that be the difference that government of service make we have also be clear that investment must come with reform lord darzi have give we the diagnosis and the cure can be find in shift the nhs from treatment to prevention hospital to home and analogue to digital harold wilson once call himself an optimist who carry raincoat as someone who have work in our nhs at this critical time be fully aware of the challenge we face and the effort require be make sure that we have firm hold on problem in the short term while we do the work of fix the foundation of our nhs with long term reform over the past year we have limp from one crisis to the next improvise and make do with stick plaster it can not go on it be bad for patient care and it be totally demoralise for staff we be build health service that be fit for the future ready to face every winter with confidence and we will publish our year plan for health in the spring anyone who think that we can not do it should remember we have fix the nhs before and we will fix it again the public rightly expect we to put an end to the annual winter crisis and that be what we will deliver commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state be grateful to the minister for early sight of her statement as have say before it be typically courteous of she echo the gratitude that she express to those in our nhs and also those in the social care workforce who will be work hard throughout the festive period as she allude to the nhs be already feel the pressure this winter we know that winter be always tough for the nhs irrespective of who be in government but service be feel the strain even early than in previous year tidal wave of flu infection have lead to increase in hospital case in just seven day and the national medical director of the nhs have warn of quad demic of health emergency as case of covid noroviru rsv and winter flu be all on the rise meanwhile in october the long wait of over hour increase by over quarter in just one month reach the third high monthly figure since comparable record begin in of course all that have come before the cold weather really hit and before more vulnerable pensioner be leave in freeze home unable to put the heating on after the winter fuel payment be scrap for large number what assessment have the minister and the department make of the potential impact of that on hospital admission this winter in government we recognise that the nhs face unique challenge in winter we also recognise as know the minister do from our previous discussion the importance of flow in the nhs with all part of the system work together that be why last year we provide million to boost nhs resilience specifically during the peak winter month which be accompany by million to bolster social care capacity and improve discharge from hospital that follow the billion announce early that year to boost capacity by deliver additional bed new ambulance and virtual ward place the secretary of state himself have admit that there will almost certainly be winter crisis there have be warning from the royal college of emergency medicine the royal college of nursing and director at nhs england yet in today statement in contrast to the step we take we hear lot about datum meeting and co ordination but very little in concrete term to increase capacity specifically over the winter period that will give scant reassurance to those work in the system or patient need the system in fact early this year the secretary of state suggest that there would not be any specific new funding for the nhs to cope with winter pressure the minister will know that have table number of write question in recent day meet in many case by what seem to be the standard dhsc response for name day question of hold answer as the pressure continue to grow have number of specific question for the minister while she be at the dispatch box will the nhs receive more resource specifically to increase bed and capacity this winter be there enough hospital bed and ambulance for this winter or be she take step to increase they as of the of the month how many people who be medically fit to be discharge have not be for variety of other reason be grateful for the update that the minister provide on winter vaccination what assessment have she make of the supply of the flu vaccine there be some suggestion that pharmacy and other have run out and be wait for more delivery how many additional and call handler have be recruit specifically for this winter we talk briefly about the need for the system to work as whole in that context what be the impact of national insurance contribution on hospice social care and gps the secretary of state tell the health and social care committee this morning that hospice would get an update from he before christmas but at prime minister question in response to the leader of the opposition the prime minister appear to say that it will be after christmas can the minister clarify that for the house because it be an important point finally what meeting have the secretary of state personally have with julian redhead and sarah jane marsh the nhs winter lead and when be the first of those meeting specifically on this subject be very happy for he to write to if that be easy give the complexity as seasonal flu pile yet more pressure on nhs system it be more important than ever that it get the resource and support that it need there be many promise of reform but the nhs need an immediate capacity boost in bed over winter so far the government have kick reform into the long grass in favour of yet more consultation and their preparation for winter have lack the urgency and focus that patient and nhs staff demand in government the conservative always put extra support in place to keep the nhs go through the tough winter period boost capacity and increase support this government need to get grip and do the same will do my good to address that range of question first as even stop clock be right yes twice on that basis agree with the right hon gentleman on correspondence and answer to parliamentary question again the situation we inherit be not satisfactory apologise to all member who be wait for correspondence it be something we be take grip of we want to respond positively to question the conservatives do not we will make sure that start to happen on capacity in the system again remind member that we come into office in july which be one quarter of the way through the planning and financial year we very rapidly look at the plan that be bake in by the previous government appreciate that the right hon gentleman be in the ministry of justice at the time not the health and social care department to see whether they be fit for purpose we want to make sure we bring stability to the system there be in fact more bed currently available in the system than last year if there be need to increase capacity due to likely cold snap the system be absolutely ready to respond in its usual way that be why we be meet weekly on meeting with clinical and managerial colleague at nhs england who frankly see more often than many member of my own family can tell the right hon gentleman that we start those meeting immediately would have to check the exact date but it be certainly in the summer have have fortnightly meeting since september which as say we can move to monthly meeting chair by the secretary of state we begin get grip from day one know that winter be come which be why be monitor the situation weekly it be also why we visit the operational centre to understand in real time what be happen across every single system and every single trust be that ambulance issue or problem at the front end and in the one question do not directly have the answer to be what the daily figure be will try to get those figure to the right hon gentleman later we all know that wait for discharge to assess be massive problem that be why as say in my statement we want to take grip of the well care fund to ensure it work well and to stabilise the social care system be not particularly verse in issue on supply so apologise if that be wrong we will certainly get back to the right hon gentleman on that matter because we want people to be take the vaccination where necessary can confirm that we want an announcement on hospice before christmas on winter fuel and its impact as opposition members know we will continue to monitor the impact of all situation on individual to ensure they be support in the community we urge people to make sure they access pension credit interruption have just address that but if have miss anything will come back to it despite york new emergency department consultant have describe to the situation in emergency medicine where patient be wait for day to be discharge and patient be wait to be place on ward we know we have inherit broken nhs will the minister say what she be do first to enable primary care to pull more patient out of emergency medicine in order to see people in the community and secondly to invest in social care which will clearly address some of the backlog and the logjam in patient flow my hon friend comment reinforce how much pressure we understand be front face be demonstrative of the overall pressure in the system not just at discharge but as she rightly say in primary care we take action in the summer to improve primary care increase the number of gps available in the system it be absolutely critical that primary care community service be integral to winter planning at local level that be what we expect from every single system we will continue to monitor that over the winter period and into the spring if those service be not involve in plan for any particular system enable they to monitor the surge and flow of people we very much want to understand how that be work call the liberal democrat spokesperson express my thank and those of my lib dem colleague to everyone work over the christmas period to keep people healthy and safe preparedness for winter be absolutely critical for our health and care system and quick look at what happen last year show we why ambulance across england collectively spend total of year wait outside hospital to hand patient over and quarter of million people wait more than hour to be see every winter we be warn of winter crisis under the conservatives crisis become the norm not just in winter but all year round this year be very concern so far have overflow through spring summer and autumn at my local hospital trust shrewsbury and telford one in three ambulance have have to wait more than an hour to hand over patient while patient with devastating cancer diagnosis have have to wait month for crucial scan result across england more than million people be on wait report january vol correction meanwhile be afraid we have not hear enough from the government on fix one of the root cause of this crisis which be our broken social care system the scale of the crisis be demonstrate by the challenge face ambulance service across the country at the moment october before the winter be the third bad month ever for handover delay at west midlands ambulance service which cover my constituency the equivalent of ambulance crew be out of action wait every single day now these overstretch ambulance service be formally change their advice to reflect the pressure they be under at time of peak demand even category patient those suffer heart attack or stroke will be ask to make their own way to hospital people in north shropshire have long have to put up with some of the bad ambulance wait in the country and they have come to harm as result it may no long be the case that they can rely on an ambulance arrive action be urgently need to prevent more preventable death this winter be sure the minister share my alarm that ambulance may not be reach people face life threaten situation if she do will she commit today to the government tackle the handover delay paralyse the ambulance service by accept liberal democrat proposal to make billion fund to provide more staffed bed and by agree to urgent cross party talk to fix the crisis in social care think have address the government plan on social care the hon lady make an excellent point on ambulance delay which we know to be problem and particularly so in the west midland that be one of the thing have ask the system to look at particularly so that the government and hon member can well understand the particular problem in their particular system we know that ambulance and handover delay be particular problem in some system we be make sure that clinical and managerial lead from nhs england be visit those system and that they be understand in depth the process issue in some place where they may not be adopt the good practice that can be learn from other we need to roll out good practice across the country when the secretary of state and visit the operational centre of the london ambulance service we sit in on some hear and treat call in deal with people in mental health crisis in particular some place be do that well than other those be the sort of example we want to learn from absolutely hear what the hon lady say about the unacceptable delay in particular part of the country that be very much on our priority list call member of the health and social care committee last week visit basildon hospital which be rely on by my constituent and people across essex staff in the emergency department tell that they be operate under intense pressure all year round and that it be indeed winter all year for they that be due to lack of bed the terrible condition of part of the estate and inadequate primary care service mean that people turn up at the ed when they should be somewhere more appropriate what step be the minister take to turn the page on year of decline and to ensure that basildon and hospital across the country have the resource and structure they need to well manage seasonal and year round pressure my hon friend have already be fantastic advocate for her local nhs service like the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight the acute pressure all year round we do not always have winter crisis under the last labour government it be tough work during some of that time and it do happen but get use to such level of bed occupancy and pressure in the system all year round be direct legacy of the conservatives and what they do to the nhs particularly with the lansley reform and their refusal to take grip of it this matter of summer crisis go into winter crisis be real problem that be why we be committed to these short term measure to stabilise and support the system over the winter however as say in my statement we will also look at medium and long term reform so that we do not have to revisit this scenario year on year call the chair of the health committee last friday visit sherwood pharmacy in abingdon ben who own it tell that local pharmacy stand ready to help in fact they be more than keen to help but there be two thing that he need from the government first there need to be real push for gps to refer people to pharmacy in particular for vaccination so that we be not collect patient in one already overstretch part of the system and they can do what they do well secondly there need to be general plea to the public that they can go to their pharmacy for those thing note that in her statement the minister do not mention pharmacy once let we be honest this question be not go to do it either how do we ensure that the to your pharmacy and get vaccinate you can do it fast out there this winter thank the chair of the select committee for her point she be right that do not mention pharmacy which be an omission on my part we be run an advertising campaign think pharmacy first to ensure people use pharmacy she be absolutely right that they stand ready will visit mine over the next few day to make sure be vaccinate their support work with primary care be critical again in some place relationship be work well and pharmacy support people in the community that be apparent in the statistic we be absolutely committed to ensure that that work well as part of our long term reform call member of the select committee last week calderdale and huddersfield nhs foundation trust bed occupancy be at some of those bed because of the failure of social healthcare and community care be take up by people who could be treat elsewhere all want for christmas be reassurance that next christmas and next winter social care will be on more secure footing my hon friend be absolutely right to highlight those shocking level of bed occupancy as say early run consistently at that high level of occupancy be something we should never have get use to that discharge rate be demoralise for staff very bad for patient and sign of the pressure in the system we absolutely must ensure the system be incentivise and work properly to make our hospital to community commitment one of our three shift operate in practice people do not want to be in hospital when they do not need to be and it be not the good place for they to be we will be say more about that in the new year we hear today about massive backlog at the department for work and pensions in process pension credit and winter fuel payment claim bear in mind that cold home increase winter death and hospital admission and that we be debate winter preparedness today what discussion have the minister have with the dwp to ensure that those in my constituency who be wait for their winter fuel payment will receive they before the christmas break will she commit to publish full impact assessment of that decision on the nhs thank the right hon lady for her question we have discuss this issue number of time in this place we absolutely understand the impact of cold and heat on the system and on people it be something we need to address more generally she will be aware that discussion on this issue be continue with the dwp if there be specific example she want to raise with or the department be very happy to look at they welcome today statement and take moment to thank emergency service in harlow and across the country who be give up spending time with their family at christmas to keep we all safe east of england ambulance service have set up new process to support paramedic and princess alexandra hospital which will give they direct line to gp who can triage patient and send they to the right department straight away what be the department of health and social care do to work with ambulance service across the country to learn from that and share good practice again my hon friend be already represent the people of his constituency so well by get to the heart of what be happen on the ground learn it for himself and bring such example to the house he be absolutely right that there be such example across the country work differently in different system which be challenge other system to look at that practice that be why we say we want to bring the good of the nhs to the rest of the nhs that be exactly what we mean be confident in the work happen centrally at nhs england it be learn from such example and want to go around the country to ensure that we spread those sort of idea to other place we be look at they all very closely call andrew george member of the select committee in the far west of cornwall in medical emergency we can not look for additional support from the north west or south because it be sea the urgent treatment centre at penzance hospital be close two and half year ago under the conservatives add pressure to the only emergency department for the next mile which be in truro and the out of hour doctor service have no doctor the minister mention in her statement that the nhs urgent and emergency care tiering programme be able to help will she use her influence to reopen the urgent treatment centre so that we can have emergency service in the far west of cornwall the hon gentleman tempt to make commitment from the dispatch box which be not go to do he make very serious point the sea be an issue for many hon member beautiful though it be it have an impact on the ability of the system to manage different area look at different solution for population such as those he represent be that hear and treat system more use of technology and pharmacy and community out of hospital care be exactly what we think be the right way to go in the next few year as part of the long term plan that may or may not be building with service we need to look at that in the round and learn from what work well in different sort of system rise order the question seem to be get long and long as do the response let we try to keep the question on point and no doubt the answer will be the same when start work in public health winter pressure be just that seasonal flu and extra hip fracture under the conservatives winter start get long and long how will our year plan ensure that seasonal pressure actually become seasonal and manageable again my hon friend make an excellent point we need to get back to normal and we need to recognise that there be different thing happen to the system at different time of the year much of which be predictable we need to ensure that the system be strong enough to be able to cope with those difference as we come into the height of winter will the minister join in thank all the amazing people on the frontline who be diagnose treat and care for people right across the country with multiple infectious disease challenge the impact of cold and extreme weather and the risk of fall and accident will the government please now rethink their policy on winter fuel cut and national insurance rise which will exacerbate the situation and compromise the delivery of primary healthcare social care and hospice care join the hon gentleman in thank everyone who work in the system as say the nhs be get billion more this year from this government than it have from the previous government in the spring budget we be now focused on ensure that money be use properly let take this opportunity to thank healthcare worker in bracknell forest who will be work so hard across the christmas period to keep patient safe this winter do the minister agree that we must ensure that we have not only the right investment in our health service but the right reform so that we can fix the broken nhs and get it back on its foot my hon friend be absolutely right we want to make sure that taxpayer money be use efficiently and effectively in the right place for the right treatment at the right time that be why we be look at our long term plan that be why we want to stabilise the system so we do not have to keep come back here year after year with so call winter crisis note that the minister think that the absence of the word pharmacy from her statement be an omission wonder whether she also think that the absence of the word general practice be an omission have be visit some of my local gp surgery and one tell that as result of the nic rise it be face charge of that equate to staff member so it will have to consider lay off member of staff will the minister please explain how gps lay off staff will help they to cope with the winter crisis as think the hon gentleman know can not talk about individual case from the dispatch box but we will be make announcement on that subject very shortly thank the minister for her statement and also thank my recent former nhs colleague especially those in sunderland for what they will be do over the winter the minister have rightly highlight unacceptable level of bed occupancy as we go into winter we know that as bed occupancy increase to unacceptable level there be rise in patient safety risk what assessment have she make of the patient safety monitoring regime over the winter link to those risk we have make it absolutely clear as do the nhs in its letter today that patient safety be the watchword this winter we have target in relation to monitor the performance of the system but we absolutely want to ensure that patient be keep safe as we go through the next few month yesterday speak to an elderly gentleman who be take himself off to his local pharmacy to receive the rsv jab but because he be over he be go to pay more than for it will the minister please tell we how much the rsv jab cost the department when it be free for to year old and how much guidance or limitation it place on the profit that can be take by chemist who give it to people who be over think the hon gentleman know that can not do that from the dispatch box but my official will have hear his request and what he have say about that specific case and will ensure that he receive an answer pay tribute to the hard work nhs staff in norwich and in norfolk as whole norfolk county council have use artificial intelligence to identify more than people who be risk of be admit to hospital because of fall this christmas do the minister welcome that use of ai and will she expand on how we be use technology now and in the future to help alleviate winter pressure do not wish to test your patience madam deputy speaker but good fall practice have not be prioritise over the past decade and the failure to prioritise it and continue the work that know be be do many year ago be yet another testament to the failure of the conservative party my hon friend be right to refer to the way we can use ai to help the system to improve so that this hugely preventable problem which be so damaging to the elderly in particular no long occur winter pressure come around every year for all sort of reason the difference this year be the political choice to take the winter fuel payment away from million of pensioner worse still the pensioner live with terminal illness will lose that payment can not believe that minister as diligent as the hon lady have not carry out an impact assessment of the cost to the nhs of people be leave in cold home my right hon friend the member for melton and syston edward argar the shadow secretary of state and my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton ask for such an assessment may give the minister another chance to commit to publish it the hon gentleman be wholly wrong to say that winter crisis happen under every government in every year they happen and become fact of the nhs under his party government the key difference this year which the conservatives will still not address be the fact that doctor be not on strike doctor be work in the system care for patient and do their job because this government on day one and week one and week four deliver the negotiate settlement with the doctor we can not run the nhs and we can not manage winter crisis without doctor in the frontline and that be where they be that be what the difference be it be great to be go into the winter for the first time in four year without doctor be on strike last week visit the new emergency medical receiving unit at stoke mandeville hospital bed facility to provide quick care for patient who come in from ambulance and as result of gp referral but require only short admission the early result look very promising do the minister agree that we must take these pocket of good practice from across the nhs and ensure that other part of the nhs learn from and adopt they to help we get through this winter and future winter commend my hon friend for as new mp get to grip in detail with what be happen in her local system and challenge that system while also give we those example of good practice so that we can all learn from they as she say many part of the nhs across the country want to learn from they and we want to ensure that they be mainstreame where possible there be different solution for different system but she be absolutely right to highlight that one refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as member of the university college london hospitals nhs foundation trust the upcoming rise in national insurance contribution could cost our gp surgery the equivalent of more than million appointment year general practice be the cornerstone of the nhs it be our front door many gps in my constituency have write to to express their serious concern do the minister recognise that hike cost for family doctor will only worsen pressure on our hospital push more people towards and prevent many from receive the care they need we recognise all the cost to gps as contractor and to many other part of the system as we have say many time in the house we also recognise the improvement that we have make to the system by improve the number of gps and fund the nhs by more than the last government do we will continue to look at that in the round to ensure that we have sustainable system one of the main reason become politician be the fact that my wife be midwife she would come home night after night complain bitterly about staff shortage on the ward can the minister reassure that maternity service will receive all the fund they need over the winter and will she join in thank all those maternity staff who work so hard over christmas over the new year and all year round my hon friend be absolutely right many tragedy happen over the christmas period my own father die on december those staff member go above and beyond to help people at difficult time but also at time of great joy baby do not wait for father christmas do my hon friend be right to commend midwife and everyone else who be work at this time we know that maternity service be particularly stretch across most of the country those midwife be do tremendous job in keep the system work and do the critically important job of support woman at mostly joyous but sometimes very difficult time at the start of this week patient be ready to go home from my local nhs hospital trust in sussex that bear out the statistic in lord darzi report that of patient be medically fit for discharge be really concerned that we have now reach point with winter pressure where corridor wait be normalise not only in department but in the case of initiative such as continuous flow model with corridor trolley wait be push into regular ward it be unacceptable that this have become normalise will the minister expand on her comment about the national care service when will the plan be publish will the government work with we on cross party basis and why do this work not begin soon as say in my statement we have begin plan to stabilise the workforce and the employment bill be go through the house so do not agree with the hon lady on that point we know that it will take long time and we will of course be work with colleague to ensure that we do develop that national care service let begin by echo the minister word and thank the fantastic nhs worker and those in the wraparound service who provide vital service in portsmouth all year round but particularly in winter let also thank all the member who turn up for the joint nhs consultation with and with the under secretary of state for education my hon friend the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan unfortunately owe to the scale of the damage do to the nhs by the last government our nhs provider have to make very difficult decision at this time can the minister reassure and my constituent that patient safety and emergency service in particular will be this government first priority during the winter be very pleased to reiterate that safety be the watchword for winter as it be all year round and to stress that that be why nhs england write about it today commend my hon friend for meet her constituent locally and urge all member to do the same we be get some fantastic idea from staff and from patient about how to reform and change the system for the long term one in four people try to contact their gps last month be unable to get same day appointment and one in could not get through to their gps at all we know that these people end up in up and down the country and that hospital be already buckle under the strain what be the minister do to improve support for gps and frontline service during this winter crisis especially while they navigate the challenge of the employer nics rise refer back to what say in my statement about how we be support the system we absolutely understand the importance of primary care and of use to make sure that people be direct towards get the right care in the right place we know that the system be under pressure and we will continue to do all we can to support it in the long term as well as in the short term recently visit northumbria specialist emergency care hospital in cramlington in my constituency meet the staff there who share their concern about winter pressure every year they closely track the flu season in australia give that the pattern that emerge there be often what follow here they be extremely concerned about what we be go into this winter what step have the department take to ensure that as many people as possible be vaccinate this winter be work very closely with the uk health security agency to make sure that week on week we be aware of the movement of different disease and virus through the system and we will continue to publicise the campaign to get people vaccinate anything that hon member can do to support that campaign and to make sure that people support themselves and their loved one will be gratefully receive by the entire system the campaign be something that everyone can get behind while we all pay tribute to the nhs staff who work over christmas we should remember that they be not only miss christmas with their family but put their own health at risk in care for we on monday winchester hospital declare critical incident say that it could admit no more patient and ask people to seek treatment elsewhere for year the chief executive officer of the hospital have be request extra social care package because the lack of social care be stop the flow of patient through the hospital she say that provide such package be the single big thing that would help deal with the winter crisis in september winchester hospital apply for winter crisis funding to put an urgent treatment centre on the front of its department to help deal with the anticipated extra caseload it be now december and the hospital have still not hear whether it will get the funding give the number of critical incident be declare will the minister meet and the ceo to discuss how we can support the hospital through this situation and how we can avoid have plan crisis next winter as say early different system have different issue funding have be allocate in advance to the nhs so that it understand which system require funding and that have now be bake in for this year can not address the hon gentleman point directly from the dispatch box but be very happy for official to take note of they and to check with the system on what be happen in his particular community obviously it be important that winchester hospital work closely with its local authority with regard to discharge we want to improve the well care fund and be sure that he will work with the local authority and his hospital to make sure that it work well declare an interest be governor of the royal berkshire hospital and have family member who have share in medical company the royal berkshire hospital have experience its high increase in emergency department attendance as we head into the winter period yet the estate of the royal berks be crumble out of date and not fit for purpose people with infectious disease such as flu covid and noroviru can not easily be isolate due to poor air circulation which only make the situation bad when will the royal berkshire hospital be rebuild and will the minister visit it to see the full extent of our challenge finally may wish the secretary of state and the minister merry christmas they should take short break but come back quickly to continue to clear up the conservatives massive failure on the nhs hopefully we will make announcement on the royal berkshire hospital and other as soon as possible in the new year as know that this issue be of great concern to all hon member we know that the system will be under pressure and we thank everyone work in it we want to make sure that everyone keep well and will take this opportunity to thank the hon gentleman for his comment be look forward to return here in january hopefully to answer more question thank hon member for their question this afternoon copyright and artificial intelligence and now for something completely different with permission madam deputy speaker will make statement regard our launch of public consultation on copyright and artificial intelligence the united kingdom have proud tradition of creativity and technical innovation from our film and television sector to video game publishing music design and fashion our creative industry be cornerstone of our economy and our creative identity they bring billion to the economy and employ over million people james bond the beatles vivienne westwood adele vera bridget riley tomb raider the sugababes football manager paddington and paul smith be all part of an immensely valuable british industry the creative industry be central to our economic future and we be determined to help they flourish the same be true of artificial intelligence both as an enabler of other industry include the creative industry and as sector in its own right the government be determined to capitalise on the uk position of strength in the global ai sector and will soon publish the ai opportunitie action plan which will set out an ambitious road map to unlock ai transformative potential across our economy and public service both the creative industry and ai sector be at the heart of our industrial strategy and they be also increasingly interlink ai be already be use across the creative industry from music and film production to publishing architecture and design it have transform post production for instance as of september more than of creative industry business say that they have use ai technology with nearly use ai to improve their business operation strong copyright law have be the bedrock of the creative industry but as thing stand the application of uk copyright law to the training of ai model be fiercely dispute right holder include musician record label artist and news publisher be find it difficult to control the use of their work to train ai model and they want and need great ability to manage such activity and to be pay for it likewise ai developer include uk base start up be find it difficult to navigate copyright law and complain that the legal uncertainty mean that they be unable to train lead model in the uk the status quo can not continue it risk limit investment innovation and growth in the creative industry the ai sector and the wide economy neither side can afford to wait for expensive litigation either here or in the us to clarify the law not least because court in different jurisdiction may come to different conclusion and individual case may not provide clarity across the sector nor can we simply rely on voluntary co operation that be why we think the government must take proactive and thoughtful action that work for all party the consultation publish yesterday set out clearly that the government objective on this issue be threefold to enhance right holder control of their material and their ability to be pay for its use to support wide access to high quality material to drive the development of lead ai model in the uk and to secure great transparency from ai developer in order to build trust with creator creative industry and consumer in short we want to provide legal certainty for all and to secure enhanced licensing of content there be three key aspect to our consultation the first be increase transparency from ai developer that include the content that they have use in train their large language model how they acquire it and any content generate by their model in other word consumer should know whether book or song have be generate by person or by artificial intelligence and whose content help generate it in the first place the second aspect be new system of right reservation whereby right holder can withhold their content from be use unless and until it have be license the third be an exception to copyright law for text and datum mining where right holder have license their content or otherwise choose not to reserve their right that would improve access to content by ai developer while allow right holder to control how their content be use for ai training those measure be contingent upon each other progress together we believe this package of measure could enhance the ability of right holder to protect their material and seek payment for its use through increase licensing while also enable ai developer to train lead model in the uk in full compliance with uk law it will however only work if there be proper system of right reservation in place urge everyone to read and respond to the consultation document and to examine the safeguard we be propose for right holder would especially urge both ai developer and right holder to work with we to identify simple practical proportionate and effective technical system of right reservation without which the whole package will not work we be conscious that the uk do not operate in hermetically seal bubble and this provide its own challenge if we be to adopt too tight regime base on proactive explicit permission the danger be that international developer would continue to train their model use uk content access overseas but may not be able to deploy they in the uk as ai become increasingly powerful and widely adopt globally this could significantly disadvantage sector across our economy include the creative industry and sweep the rug from underneath british ai developer that be why as well take this approach in the uk we be commit to international engagement and recognise the importance of international alignment this consultation be joint effort between the department for science innovation and technology the department for culture media and sport and the intellectual property office and between the under secretary of state for science innovation and technology my wonderful hon friend the member for enfield north feryal clark who have responsibility for ai and with responsibility for the creative industry this be not an academic exercise the consultation be absolutely clear that we will not implement these change unless and until we be confident that we have practical practicable and effective plan that meet our objective of enhance right holder control provide legal certainty around ai firm access to content and provide transparency for right holder and ai developer of all size my fellow minister and will be engage directly with wide range of people in an attempt to find practical and technical solution to this question many people have call this an existential question for our creative industry they be right we therefore see this consultation as pivotal opportunity to ensure that sustained growth and innovation for the uk ai sector continue to benefit creator business and consumer alike while preserve the value and principle that make our creative industry so unique we believe that there be potential win win solution and that the uk with its strong tradition of copyright and technological innovation be in unique place to deliver it commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister dr ben spencer thank the minister for advance sight of the statement britain be world leader in the creative industry from music to art to literature to our free and independent medium say as shadow science innovation and technology minister that while we need science to live the art make life worth live the uk also have world lead tech sector the invention of generative artificial intelligence provide many opportunity but particularly for the creative industry the data mining behind ai model can breach copyright that present challenge around authenticity when they be use to mimic artist and creative work and there be lack of legal clarity around the status of computer generate work we must tackle and respond to those issue britain creative industry employ nearly million people and contribute billion to our economy but we must also recognise that we be part of global technological ecosystem and if we fall behind in support our artificial intelligence industry it will move elsewhere let we be clear the genie be out of the bottle and the world be scrabble to respond to it as always there be balance to be strike to ensure we take the opportunity on offer to revolutionise working practice and to deliver productivity through technological innovation so we welcome work and investigation in this area on both the role of regulation and the option available give the delay in the minister bring this work forward he must recognise that this be complex area to regulate especially give the international and domestic interconnectivitie sadly rather than take an open position as an honest broker it be clear today that the government have already pick one side in this debate the minister preference for data mining opt out for the creative industry will place extra burden on creator to protect their intellectual property give the magnitude of the impact of his proposal why have he release this consultation now just before the christmas break and why be it limit to only week so when be benefit from uk creative talent over the christmas period whether listen to the sugababes or watch daniel craig as james bond bond be blond the creative sector will be respond to consultation that the livelihood of those who work in the sector depend on will the minister extend the consultation can the minister explain how the opt out will ensure protection to creator and in form this position how many time have he already meet representative from the technology and creative sector both domestically and internationally the minister should be well aware follow five month of fall business confidence that one thing that business dislike be uncertainty but this announcement of an opt out represent nothing but uncertainty for the creative industry rather than prioritise their need to be see to be do something the government need to start learn to do thing right call our very own james bond minister chris bryant thank you very much madam deputy speaker fortunately ask chatgpt what the shadow minister would ask and it be pretty much right although some of the question from chatgpt be rather more to the point will deal with the serious point he make first the shadow minister raise the point about mimic artist that be one of the thing we be consult on there be legitimate question about whether we should take further action in this country tennessee have act it have get its elvis act the ensuring likeness voice and image security act california and couple of other state in the united states of america have act on this already and whether we should move in that direction be perfectly legitimate question likewise the shadow minister refer to computer generate work he will probably know that under section of the copyright designs and patents act there be provision that seem to guarantee the right for computer generate art to be copyright protect that be not the case in most other country and it could be argue that development in recent copyright law on the nature of originality would suggest that unless human being be directly involve in the creation of the work there should not be copyright protection we have suggest direction of travel to get rid of section of the act the shadow minister say that we have delay bring this forward but merely point out that for quite long time the previous government say that they would bring forward voluntary system bring the two side together nothing whatsoever come from that so be afraid that feel bit of cheat what want to contest be the idea that we have side with one or the other there be legitimate problem which be that ai company and the creative industry be at loggerhead in the court in several different jurisdiction on several different point which be moot at the moment we do not think that simply stand by the present situation will suffice because the danger be that in two or three year time all uk content will have be scrap by one or other ai develop company somewhere else in the world if there be no legal clarity in the uk would like to be able to bring all that home so that ai operator can work in this country with security under the law use uk copyright that have be license and pay for because that be another potential revenue stream for creator in this country the shadow minister ask about extend the consultation be not go to extend the consultation we want to crack on with this piece of work only two minute early in his speech he say that we be delay bring it forward and then he say we should delay far it be time that we seize hold of this certainly will meet with large number of people my fellow minister my hon friend the member for enfield north and have meet many different organisation and we will be provide list because it will be in our transparency return publish soon and the number must run to dozen if not hundred of course there be differ view but make it absolutely clear that the three measure we be talk about the transparency on input and output that ai developer will have to provide the provision for creator to reserve their right and the exemption for datum mining for commercial purpose be contingent upon each other we will not move forward with such package unless there be technical solution to the question of how people can reserve their right at the weekend look online to see what it would be like to try to reserve right by pretend to be various musician and artist at present it be phenomenally difficult and complicated other member may have question about this and that must change there must be proper right reservation system that be easy to use practicable and enable creator either individually or collectively to assert and maintain control of their right call the chair of the science innovation and technology committee the uk be in unique position second in the world in the creative industry and in the top three for ai innovation so get the right solution to protect and support our intellectual property while support and incentivise ai innovation be uniquely important to our cultural and economic life be former regulator and charter engineer so welcome the minister decision to go with regulatory technology as the solution and to challenge the tech sector to come up with technology to ensure we can have both the reservation of right and the transparency of input to large language model both of which be critical the tech sector too often spend less time protect people and property than maximise profit but the language of the consultation be bit vague the minister talk about arrive at plan rather than solution so will he make it absolutely clear that any text and datum mining exemption be contingent on the technology be deliverable implementable and workable and that if the technology fail the exemption fail welcome the chair of the select committee to her place she be right that we can not have the text and datum mining exemption for commercial purpose unless there be proper right reservation system in place do not know whether she have look at right reservation but it be terribly complicated people can use the robot exclusion protocol but it be rather out of date and be avoid by many player in the market it be very complicated and apply only to person own website whereas their creative input might not be on their personal website it might be on somebody else try to create bridget riley use an ai bot over the weekend the bot have obviously train itself on some bridget riley work but it be shockingly bad bridget riley it be nowhere near want to ask whether it have use bridget riley work to learn how to make bridget riley like picture and if so whether bridget riley receive any compensation bridget riley could use another website if she want but it be phenomenally complicated that be precisely what must change the ai company must come up with technical solution whether they produce music text or whatever without that we will not be able to progress it be always easy if the minister look at the chair so we can ensure that we be stick to time limit call the liberal democrat spokesperson the uk can and should be global leader in ai innovation and welcome this consultation investment and support for technological innovation will be crucial pillar of grow our economy and solve the problem of today and tomorrow likewise our world lead creative industry must remain growth priority in my constituency see the invaluable contribution that the film industry make to the local and national economy drive growth while produce top quality content we might not have james bond but we have have robin hood and deadpool and wicked be recently film just over the border the creative industry have be clear that failure to apply exist copyright law to ai model training present an existential threat they be be ask to allow their output to be use to train model that could be in direct competition with they we must get this balance right there be no uncertainty in exist law uk law be totally clear that commercial organisation must license the datum they use to train their large language model the announcement that the government favour text and datum mining exemption will be deeply concern to the creative industry the issue be think to be settle under the previous government so what assessment have the government make of the likely impact of their favour option on the creative industry the expectation seem to be that small business in the creative industry should welcome an opt out system in exchange for vague commitment to transparency so will the minister lie out what successful workable example of an opt out system he have look at can he give we example of where this approach have successfully protect creative why have the option of an opt in not be include in the consultation as have be say previously the creative industry add billion year in gross value to the economy and go hand in hand with our digital economy it be essential that the government support ai innovation but that can not come at the cost of our world lead creative industry madam deputy speaker will look at you to make sure that do not go over time but would point out that wicked be far too long movie make it clear that do not think there be complete separation between ai and the creative industry ai be creative industry in many regard there be an important collaboration between the two and even sir paul mccartney have say that he have use ai to help he write some of his most recent work the hon lady say this be all settle under the previous government but nothing in this territory be settle under the previous government it be simply leave hang in the air which be why we be try to take action she ask whether there be any successful example of opt out no there be not precisely the point be try to make be that at the moment it be remarkably difficult for individual and organisation whether record label an individual artist or photographer or whoever to protect their right that be what need to change there have be some licensing some newspaper have license content with openai sony music have write to all the different ai operator to say that all the work that it protect be copyright and not to be use but be not sure that such piecemeal process be enough to build the control we want for right holder while enable ai to develop fruitfully in the uk welcome this consultation and my hon friend recognition that neither we nor this stuff exist in bubble what do he make of the no fakes nurture original foster art and keep entertainment safe bill currently in the us house of representatives which protect personality and likeness of human writer and artist against misappropriation the minister say he be in meeting mode do he know what be happen with the consultation on live event ticket it would be great to meet he to discuss my private member bill the anti oasis style scam rip off ticket bill which be be squash by friday filibustering think my hon friend who be on the culture media and sport committee take advantage of the change in the chair to get away with ask question that have absolutely nothing to do with this consultation on live ticketing be absolutely certain that the government will have something to say soon the word soon mean precisely what choose it to mean on publicity right my hon friend be quite right that that be significant question that we will ask during the consultation there be an argument for bring in legislation in the uk california as say have digital replicas law and tennessee have the elvis act which stand for eliminate limit on the voice intrinsic sovereignty think that be an attempt to cram that into the word elvis she be right that the us copyright office be argue for federal digital replica law and we might want to go down that route as well urge my hon friend and perhaps the select committee to consider that matter they might like to provide some advice in response to the consultation as well be tempt to invite the minister to consult the magnificent taylor swift who apart from all her many other talent have show herself pretty shrewd when it come to preserve the copyright of her material he put his finger on the key weakness in all this no matter what sort of regime we set up and no matter how many country we try to get involve in this surely it will only take one rogue jurisdiction to allow machine to scrape from everybody else material then the internet ability for everyone to access it will undermine the regime and in that way we face the danger that shake it off become rip it off disagree see the right hon gentleman nod early when be talk about not want to pull the rug from under the foot of uk ai adopter the uk be in very specific position we have probably the good copyright law of any country because of the specific way in which they develop it be partly thank to hogarth dickens and many other over the year that we have end up with strong copyright legislation we also have strong body of intellectual property in this country which be enormously valuable potentially to ai operator we stand in very specific position there be an argument that ai can be train elsewhere in another jurisdiction but the moment it be bring into the uk it still fall under uk legislation the right hon gentleman be also right about this do not consult taylor swift but do ask an ai company to come up with song in the manner of adele oh still feel you deep in my soul even though you leave out here on my own the love we have it slip through my hand but can forget still do understand you go but your memory all see and in the silence it you haunt madam deputy speaker laughter it be sort of adele but it be not adele do adele know that her material have be use do her record label know that her lyric have be use to create that it be sort of in the territory but it be not right think we can get this right in the uk and provide leadership to the world that be what we should strive for will just make the point that can see that this be very technical and complicated it might require long answer but be not sure it require that level of input from not adele can the minister clarify the difference between his term right reservation and previous report of the government preference for an opt out system those system have already be call out and consider unjust by our creator there be ai leader who recognise the need for fair licensing what assurance can the government provide to support both human and ai innovation do the minister with his creative industry hat on agree that respect copyright would see the introduction of an opt in system as essential again this be another false dichotomy be present to we between opt in and opt out that be why we have land on the term right reservation lot of the material out there be not copyright that be either because it be long out of copyright the law for most work last for year after the death of the author or the first publication of the work or because some artist have categorically decide not to retain their copyright tom lehrer the author of many satirical song from the and such as the vatican rag and the masochism tango have deliberately surrender his copyright this be world where we want to make sure that the vast majority of right holder whether they be the record label the individual photographer the artist or whatever have the right of control over their copyright over whether it be use and how it be use and if it be go to be use they should be remunerate urge my hon friend who know have great interest in this subject in his role on the select committee to make sure that that false dichotomy between opt in and opt out be abandon we talk about right reservation because then opt out might look remarkably like opt in in july of this year it be reveal that youtube video include material create by globally recognise british musician news channel and artist have be scrap into dataset use to train ai model content from over creative have be find in this dataset yet do not believe that consent be seek from single impact creator to use their copyright work it be clear that ai offer fantastic opportunity for our economy but it must supplement and grow industry rather than replace they wholesale creative deserve to be compensate for their work ai company will happily pay the electricity bill for their data centre and wage for their staff so why should they not also pay to access the creative content on which their model depend completely agree with the hon lady of course those company should pay for the content that they be use think she be refer to which be the dataset that be produce in germany interestingly court in hamburg have decide that this be already cover by the exemption for datum and text mining for non commercial purpose for research subsequently though this have be use not just for research but for other purpose which be precisely the kind of area where there be legal dispute that be why we be try to provide legal certainty in the uk as to what can and can not be use when it can be use and how we can make sure that people creative right be protect this be an important issue everywhere in the world but it be particularly important here in the uk because our economy have as the minister have say incredible strength both in the creative industry and more recently in ai development it be important to note that lot of the technology that power these model be pioneer by deepmind here in london do the minister agree that get the balance right on this be critical to the government mission of deliver economic growth both sector be part of our industrial strategy and we must make sure that both be able to flourish fully understand that there will be people in the creative industry who will be worried about what we be say but want they to understand that this package come as whole ed newton rex who be formerly of stability ai write in his substack today that he be concerned that this government would proceed without actually check whether system of right reservation work we will not we will proceed only if there be proper system of right reservation but there be an awful lot of very clever people who work in ai in this country would like somebody to set bunch of they on work out simple practicable technical solution to the question of right reservation then think everybody have chance of prosper in the uk as former journalist be intimately familiar with the gold standard copyright law that we have in this country do the minister agree with the news media association which be very concerned about the current situation face by its member where thing be already be scrap and take into these ai machine to quote the fabulous sugababes those member would like the minister to push the button on the exist law and protect their copyright now can we have action now rather than this rather vague and woolly consultation well no this be genuinely thorny question that need technical solution the government be not go to write the technical solution that have to come from the two side work out together how we can get to situation that benefit everybody the hon gentleman be absolutely right about the newspaper some newspaper have already license material include associated newspapers the washington post and several other it would be interesting to see whether the income that those company be receive be flow through to the journalist who produce the copyright material in the first place but perhaps that be part of the right reservation system that we need to look at as well the commitment of the secretaries of state for culture media and sport and for science innovation and technology to ensure that creator can control how their content be use and be pay for it be very welcome but some creator be concerned that the right reservation framework propose by the government will not allow they to assert control what step be the minister take to ensure that new framework take account of those concern have be try perhaps have not yet succeed to make it absolutely clear that the secretaries of state for culture media and sport and for science innovation and technology and the under secretary of state for science innovation and technology my hon friend the member for enfield north feryal clark who be sit next to would not bring forward for legislation something that undermine the copyright right of right holder in the creative industry we simply would not do so what we be try to do be push both side to place where we can create new system it will probably be new to the united kingdom and might be one of our gift to the world of right reservation that be simple practical and practicable this be not second reading debate it be simply statement on consultation urge all who have concern to voice they in that consultation this be timely statement because have be converse with anne one of my constituent anne be visual artist and dress designer and she have exactly the concern that you set out order it be the minister who be set out concern not beg your pardon madam deputy speaker will recommend to anne that she contribute to the consultation however the minister hit on the nub of the problem which be the international element for the key example be china country that have history of steal ip and be key player in the international ai competition wish the minister well in this work but how can we thread the needle so that if the consultation lead to bill that get implement we avoid not only the copyright of our creative be steal by chinese ai firm but hand the ai advantage to china think that china be the problem in lot of different case be not sure that it be in this case it be more difficult for camel to pass through the eye of needle than for to get practicable solution but that be what we be determined to achieve when the hon gentleman refer to anne think for one moment that she be his ai assistant the truth be that we will all have ai assistant very soon most of the time when we google anything these day the first result come up because of ai it be part of our life and we can not pretend that away what would like be for uk company and start up to develop ai in way that accept that the content that many of they be desperate to use need to be pay for may convey to the minister my disappointment that his chatgpt prompt yield the sugababes and football manager but not the endure institution of gavin and stacey from the vale of glamorgan know that that be an omission that chatgpt will correct this be critical debate because the path to prosperity for nation have to be path through technology in that context the primary question on my mind be whether the minister can set out plan for how datum accuracy and completeness in the creative sector can underpin the government wide ai action plan and ultimately drive national growth my hon friend make very good point about gavin and stacey and look forward to the christmas special would merely point out that since from steps be from the rhondda steps have lot more to offer he live in the vale of glamorgan well some people have greatness thrust upon they my hon friend make an important point about datum which will become an increase part of our economic resilience and strength in this country that be another part of my responsibility if have my dsit hat on very much look forward to the data use and access bill come to the commons in the new year once it have finish in the other place because it be an opportunity for we to create smart datum which will release great deal more economic potential and productivity in the uk uk music describe copyright as the foundation of the music industry provide means for creator to monetise their work an incentive for investment in talent and an opportunity for we the public to enjoy the fruit of creativity it be important that we get this right so will the minister set out how the government will work with both developer and right holder to make the most of this groundbreaking technology while still protect artist work no will have endless meeting with an awful lot of people from the creative industry to ensure that all their concern be recognise pay tribute to uk music which have already be in touch several time in the past hour to express its view on the subject quite interestingly copyright work differently in different medium in music publishing newspaper and so on and that be one of the thing we need to take clear hold of when we take anything far forward also have successful meeting this afternoon with people talk about introduce voluntary levy on ticket and arena gig to ensure that we have money to support grassroots music in this country and very much hope that we will be able to make significant announcement on that in the new year welcome the statement the minister refer to ed newton rex who recently give evidence to our select committee on this very subject it be clear that creative be deeply worried about any suggestion of an opt out when it come to the solution that be why welcome my hon friend commitment at the dispatch box to make any progress contingent on technological solution on right reservation because ultimately be that not the way to square the circle that this government be always try to square which be of economic growth and innovation while protect worker right my hon friend be right square the circle be what we be in the business of do and sometimes that be not an easy thing for government because not all the lever lie with government and with legislation to be absolutely clear though we know we need to provide legal certainty in this space that almost certainly mean that we will want to introduce legislation we will not introduce legislation until such time as all the different aspect that have already refer to namely transparency on input and output control of right reservation for right holder and the text and datum mining exemption for commercial work in that sphere hang together as all of they be contingent on one another think that be the last question madam deputy speaker so have yourself very merry christmas you be suppose to sing it do think be allow to sing at the dispatch box the minister would be well advise not to sing at the dispatch box but thank he for his comprehensive response this afternoon post office redress and funding with your permission madam deputy speaker wish to provide an update to the house about the government post office redress scheme and funding no one in this house no one in this country will have fail to be move by the plight of postmaster catch up in the horizon scandal the fact that they suffer so much over so many year be both unconscionable and inexcusable the government be determined to do right by they and to learn from the mistake of the past that be why before the election in july we promise to ensure swift and fair redress for postmaster affect by the horizon scandal and in the past five month we have make significant progress to date compensation have more than double since the government take office with million pay to victim of that amount million have be pay to people from the horizon conviction redress scheme which we set up in july as of november the ministry of justice have notify more than people in england and wales that their conviction have be quash by the post office horizon system offences act the relevant justice authority in scotland and northern ireland be also continue to notify individual within their jurisdiction while the progress we have make be positive we know there be still complex case to resolve and we need to speed up other part of the redress process many postmaster be still yet to be compensate or have their case reconsider be conscious that for the victim of the horizon scandal justice delay be justice deny and that our responsibility in government be to work to make the compensation process as effective as possible that be why we have ask the post office to write to over former postmaster encourage they to come forward if they believe they have genuine claim can confirm those letter have be send we want to ensure that every postmaster who be eligible for redress under the horizon shortfall scheme have the opportunity to apply for it on more complex case notably in the group litigation order and the horizon conviction redress scheme for which my department be and should be see to be directly responsible we have agree new target for of challenge case in the glo and hcrs to receive substantive response within day we have move in additional staff and sir gary hickinbottom who be already assist we with the overturn conviction case have be appoint chair of the independent panel for the hcrs we be look again at the argument for provide additional redress to postmaster family member who be affect by the scandal and to the employee of postmaster will report back to the house on that in due course the horizon compensation advisory board recommend the establishment of an appeal process for the horizon shortfall scheme that be independent of the post office and government and we accept that recommendation in september we be in the process of assemble team of independent external lawyer to help deliver the appeal process we expect that contract to be award in january will be able to provide further update on the appeal process early in the new year there be still concern about the responsibility of the post office to deliver the horizon shortfall scheme and the overturn conviction scheme the government be consider the merit of my department take over that responsibility but the benefit of such move must clearly outweigh the potential disruption we be carefully consider what intervention we may take thank to small group of postmaster and their family come forward this year as well as to parliamentarian include lord beamish we now know that issue at the post office go beyond horizon and that some postmaster may have be affect by early system such as capture the government have respond with swift significant action the kroll investigation publish its report into capture on september with further addendum make on october from that report we have conclude that there be postmaster who may have fall victim to flaw in capture software most of we will not be able to comprehend fully what it be like to be accuse of mistake never make ill intent never harbour and crime never commit some postmaster have tell we that like victim of the horizon scandal they be shun by their local community by their customer friend and neighbour speak on behalf of the whole government in express how sorry be for what those postmaster and their family have go through for that and all they be force to endure they deserve not just redress but the restoration of their good name uncover exactly what happen in each case will be challenging exercise give the passage of time and the lack of record and evidence however we be keen to apply the lesson that we have learn from previous redress scheme and to take account of the need of this group of victim the government will develop our proposal through engagement with postmaster and other key stakeholder such as the horizon compensation advisory board and legal expert over the come month we want to determine the scope of the financial redress and the eligibility criterion so that we can bring both redress and closure to the impact postmaster and their family expect to provide further update to the house on that matter in the spring next year we also expect to receive sir wyn williams report the post office horizon it inquiry have review the oral evidence that be submit to it over the course of the last two year be thankful to sir wyn williams for his excellent chairing of the inquiry which close yesterday be also thankful to the horizon compensation advisory board for the report that it publish early this year in case member be not aware the board be recommend that new independent body be set up to deliver any future redress scheme on behalf of the government as well as to act in role similar to that of an ombudsman the goal be of course to reduce the chance of future scandal or at least to expose they more quickly the government welcome those recommendation any recommendation that might prevent harm or at least help the government be more responsive to it be worthy of serious consideration the potential impact of such body would be wide range with potential implication for exist redress scheme in the nhs which need to be consider alongside other issue we will therefore take time to consult and consider in particular the view of the williams inquiry before reach conclusion we intend to give full response within six month of the publication of the williams inquiry report for too long decision about the future of the post office have be put off that neglect have allow significant issue at the heart of the company to grow and take root as previously set out we will publish green paper in the first half of next year to seek the public view insight and experience to help shape the future of the post office in the meantime we be take step to continue to support the post office network and the important service it provide can announce that we be provide furth million to subsidise the post office network this year the interim chair of the post office nigel railton be rightly shift the focus of the business from headquarters to postmaster the post office be also review its cost as its financial position continue to be challenge he have announce ambition for new deal for postmaster and be pleased that the post office be go to make an immediate one off payment to postmaster to increase their remuneration in recognition of the pressure that postmaster face that payment be expect to be deliver this month we be work with the senior leadership of the post office on future opportunity begin with banking so that the company can increase its product offer and commercial revenue and reduce its cost in community across the uk together we hope these step will enable the post office to move forward work well with its postmaster and well serve the need of its customer this government be attempt to fix the foundation deal with the injustice of the past and invest in different future for the post office so that it can sit at the heart of our community as trust institution once more commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the minister for advance sight of his statement as shadow secretary of state can say on behalf of every conservative member that we be commit to work collaboratively with the government to deliver the appropriate redress to all those affect by the horizon scandal and any issue relate to the capture software many of the action on which the minister have update the house be initiate by my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake as my hon friend have say ministers will have our full support in the swift delivery of redress and the overturning of the conviction of those affect by this wide range scandal the conservative party welcome the redress scheme that have be implement to remedy the gross miscarriage of justice that have affect hundred of family across the country our only focus now must be on process claim to get those scheme complete as quickly as possible there remain number of question follow the minister statement that would be grateful if he would clarify understand that the kroll report do not publish any conclusion about the safety of criminal conviction the horizon advisory group have already recommend that the government introduce legislation to overturn the conviction of postmaster who fall victim to the capture scheme read that the government have defer to the criminal cases review commission on that matter could the minister update we on what conversation he have have with the ccrc in relation to the process of overturn conviction the redress that the minister have announce be welcome news but there remain lack of specific detail on how the affected party can expect progress will he set out timeline for the redress of postmaster affect by capture he say that he have instruct the post office to write to potentially affect former postmaster urge they to come forward if they believe they have claim to make and that those letter have be send can he confirm when they be send be the minister able to provide an update on his conversation with fujitsu how much have fujitsu contribute to date what meeting have he have and where be we on that important aspect of this process it be concern to learn back in september that only small handful of claim have be offer redress through the horizon conviction redress scheme and at that point no full and final settlement have be make through that scheme could the minister reassure the house that the government be not just open the door to those claim but manage the process of get they hear resolve and ultimately redress be pleased to hear that additional staff have be second to facilitate the compensation scheme welcome that and thank the minister but can he confirm how many have be second and from where and can he give the house an assurance that they will remain seconded for as long as be necessary finally we welcome the government announcement of million of network subsidy it be announce in yesterday write ministerial statement and it be indeed welcome news the minister say that it be for this year so would he clarify whether that relate to the period up until the end of march what certainty be there of funding beyond that period so that we can all proceed on sustainable footing be it only for this year or do it also cover the fiscal year be grateful to the shadow secretary of state for his willingness to work with we collaboratively on provide redress not only to the victim of the horizon scandal but to the victim of the capture software issue the shadow secretary of state reference the kroll report as he and suspect other member of the house who have follow this issue closely will be aware kroll do not take specific view on conviction we be aware that small number of sub postmaster those who believe they be victim of use the capture software give the shortfall it generate and the way they be treat by the post office as result have refer their claim to the criminal cases review commission we have instruct the post office to work at speed to review what evidence it can provide to the ccrc to help it make decision on the safety of those conviction similarly the scottish criminal cases review commission be look at number of case and we have similarly instruct the post office to co operate with it as quickly as it can on capture redress yesterday we meet sub postmaster who have campaign on capture and indeed lord beamish to update they on the step we will take we will work at pace as say in my statement we face significant challenge with the amount of evidence available for example no central record have as yet be find of the number of capture user or of who they be we be nevertheless go to be work to design redress scheme we will consult sub postmaster and the horizon compensation advisory board as have say will bring forward an update on where we have get to by next spring on the letter that the post office have send out can confirm that they have go out very recently the shadow secretary of state will forgive if do not have the exact date he rightly air again the concern about the responsibility of fujitsu which be feel across the house be sure that he will recognise that we need to wait for sir wyn williams inquiry to report to give we well understanding of the scale of fujitsu responsibility and therefore its potential liability we have say that we will respond to the inquiry recommendation at pace and certainly within six month be sure that he will opine on fujitsu and we will respond accordingly on the horizon conviction redress scheme the then minister of state at the ministry of justice my right hon friend the member for swindon south heidi alexander and have the pleasure of appear before the business and trade committee chair by my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill and solihull north liam byrne to update it on progress in overturn the conviction follow the legislation last summer she commit the ministry to complete its work of assess the case by the end of january and understand that it still intend to do so we have already pay out some million as part of our responsibility to provide redress to those whose conviction be overturn lastly on the network subsidy uplift the shadow secretary of state will understand that the money be just for this year spend review discussion be take place across government and the post office be an active part of those discussion call the chair of the business and trade committee welcome much of the minister statement today redress be be pay out fast but the truth be that of the budget for redress have still not be pay the select committee will be supply its advice on how we make that fast in report that we will release on new year day the minister have set out detail for the house about the capture victim who have be identify do he believe that many of those victim be convict if they be would it not be right to have those conviction automatically overturn in the way that we have do for other victim of this appalling scandal be grateful to my right hon friend that the first report of his committee have look at the post office redress scheme he will know that progress have be make but as allude to in my opening statement we recognise that there be still significantly more to do particularly with the complex case specifically on conviction and capture have to tell the house that at this stage we do not know how many people be convict as result of the capture software we be aware of small number of case as have say number of case be with the criminal cases review commission and the scottish criminal cases review commission we have instruct the post office to review all its record we know it have some record available for the to period and to get what information it do have to those two body so that they can opine as quickly as be feasible on the safety of those conviction it be right that that be the first step we take we will wait to see the judgment in the meantime we will get on with design redress scheme for all those who be not convict but who suffer as result of the capture software call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for share his statement in advance honest hard work people have their life totally wreck by this scandal and it be great shame that it happen over number of year and that there be dither and delay over it for far too many year welcome the step that he have outline this afternoon welcome the suggestion make to he about an independent body for compensation however this scandal must never happen again one way this chamber could ensure that be the case be by have duty of candour on official as the liberal democrats have call for hope he will give that serious consideration to stop such scandal ever happen again finally there be real opportunity should the government choose to take it to set up an office for whistleblower through the employment rights bill which be currently make its way through the house be grateful to the hon gentleman for his opening remark in particular share his anger and that of the whole house at how sub postmaster be treat whether as victim of the horizon scandal or of the capture software issue which be clearly appalling we must do everything we can to ensure that can never be repeat he will understand that yesterday be the last day of hearing in sir wyn williams inquiry sir wyn williams have say that he will publish his conclusion and recommendation within month the government will then work at pace to consider his recommendation and to publish our response within six month of that date the specific idea that the hon gentleman have reference in that context will be sure be part of the government deliberation he will forgive if wait at this stage for sir wyn williams recommendation we will then look at those recommendation and come to the house with the future step we intend to take welcome the minister announcement on the green paper on the future of the post office it be also welcome that the government be take additional step towards financial redress for the postmaster who suffer such horrendous treatment in that scandal be concerned that this new deal for postmaster come at the expense of post office branch across the country include at kennington park in my constituency do he agree that there should not be choice between give postmaster fair deal and lose essential high street service will he please meet to discuss that far would be happy to meet my hon friend recognise that post office be fundamental part of every one of our community in the uk that be one of the reason why the government have be clear that we adhere to and support the commitment on various access requirement to ensure that every community have good access to post office facility on directly manage branch she will know that no decision on the future of all those branch or indeed any individual branch have be take recognise that she have particular concern about the branch in kennington and be happy to meet she to discuss that be glad that the minister choose to reference the excellent work do on behalf of the postmaster by lord beamish who be well know to many of we as our former colleague kevan jones hope that the whole house will join in congratulate he on his appointment today as the new chairman of the intelligence and security committee an appointment by the way by his fellow committee member which be exactly as it should be do may gently ask the minister this may go slightly outwith his department responsibility whether there be any news or progress about the question of prosecution for criminal conspiracy that be something have raise before that be one thing that might act as deterrent to this sort of terrible behaviour by gild self select class of people who think that their institutional importance be great than truth or justice be certainly happy to echo the right hon member congratulation to the noble lord beamish and to emphasise again my appreciation for his work on champion the concern of those who be victim of the capture software he be one of those whom we will continue to work with go forward as we put together redress and think about these issue more generally specifically on prosecution the right hon member may be aware that the metropolitan police have confirm that it have establish unit and be look at number of issue to do with how the post office operate he will understand that quite rightly ministers be not involve in those decision but the information that have set out be publicly available we will obviously all have to wait to see what happen in that regard my hon friend rightly say that there be an urgent need to speed up the redress process what we know be that while million have be pay out in claim million have be spend on lawyer nigel railton tell we that between and of all claim be simple case so do my hon friend agree that there be real opportunity to automate the process so that we handle claim far more quickly thank my hon friend for his question specifically on what further action we can take to speed up the process one of the reason why we introduce fix sum payment of for those whose claim have be accept as part of the horizon shortfall scheme be deliberately to offer an option of fast redress for victim on the question of automation we encourage nigel railton and the senior leadership at the post office to look at what further step they can take to speed up the consideration of claim under the horizon shortfall scheme where there be particular pressure give the number that be still come forward welcome the fact that they be come forward but we need fast action to get through they and to support all those whose claim be be accept to get redress under the horizon shortfall scheme recently meet couple of constituent tony hibberd former sub postmaster and colin chesterton solicitor who be represent he pro bono during our meeting they raise concern about the delay and inadequacy of the horizon shortfall scheme my constituent have wait in excess of four year since his claim application and year since he be force to lose his livelihood what percentage of the claimant to the horizon shortfall scheme have receive an interim payment and what percentage have have their request settle in full if the hon gentleman write to with the detail of that case will happily look at where it be at the horizon shortfall scheme have be run by the post office for some time initially it be close and then it be reopen under pressure all those who come forward in the initial tranche of claim have have they assess and offer have be make the majority of the compensation that be offer have be pay out when the scheme be reopen there be substantial increase in the number of people apply for redress indeed we be still see people come forward now and we would expect as result of all the letter that we have ask the post office to send out to sub postmaster who might have claim that there will be far substantial claim under the horizon shortfall scheme with the post office we be look at what more we can do to speed up the assessment of those claim the fix sum payment that we announce in september of some which sub postmaster can choose to accept in full and final settlement of their claim have be welcome and accept by significant number of sub postmaster that be help to speed up redress under the horizon shortfall scheme accept that there be more to do and we be look at what else we can do in that regard welcome my hon friend statement and the fact that he be put more resource and manpower into process people claim but wonder where the complexity of these claim be come from be we ask for too much information from people in the first place watch the evidence of sir alan bates at the business and trade committee and have read some of the case in the news in one case person with breast cancer have their compensation reduce and think hang on minute this may be go too far and be bit churlish just how much information be be go through in order to process these case wonder if we may want to go back and look at that have speak to the minister about this and know that he want to speed the process up as much as possible be it possible that we could streamline the process have look at this issue which come up at the select committee we write out to ask for further information in order to be able to justify the payment of more compensation not to query the information that have be provide by sub postmaster to date to try to provide reassurance on that point we be make that explicit in the letter that we send out to sub postmaster we be anxious to reduce the stress and concern and essentially the trauma that people have go through already we do not want that process to be repeat if at all possible during the compensation process ask for more information be design to enable we to offer more and fair compensation to the individual concern be listen in detail about the process you be go through look for more information on horizon you have mention capture which go back to year ago you have mention lack of information and that you be look for more detail order three time need to be he or the minister please bad habit must get rid of they my apology madam deputy speaker be concerned about the capture system which be more than year old and have different version we do not know who use it and we do not know who have be convict for it the people who have be convict be probably die every other week just now the minister talk about work at pace but can he make fly sprint to get to those people urgently to ensure that investigation be carry out and that compensation deserve be duly receive the hon gentleman make perfectly reasonable point it be something feel acutely have meet number of the sub postmaster who use the capture software and be treat very badly as result by the post office so be acutely conscious of our collective responsibility to those individual and their family some of the sub postmaster who use capture software have already pass away which only underline the point he and have make can assure the house that we will work at pace we be work with the post office and have ask the organisation to go through its record so that we can identify inasmuch as we can how many people be potentially victim of capture we be also support the work of the criminal cases review commission in look at whether conviction be safe the devastating case of susan cain the mother of my constituent zoe stokes highlight the profound human cost of this scandal susan who run the post office in hampton in arden be falsely accuse of theft and force to sell her business and home in order to repay to avoid prison tragically she later die from emphysema which medical evidence link to the immense stress that be cause by these false allegation despite her exoneration her family have be offer just of their claim with the post office refuse to accept responsibility for her illness what step be the minister take to ensure that the compensation programme for family like zoe be fair and transparent and fully account for the harm cause by this scandal commend my hon friend for champion the cause of the family of sub postmaster in his constituency he will forgive if do not know the exact compensation scheme that his constituent apply to however in general independent element be build into each of the compensation scheme to try to ensure that as fair sum of redress as possible be offer on the horizon shortfall scheme in particular in september we commit to set up an independent appeal process and hope to have more information for the house early next year we be determined to establish that process to provide far independent element for that particular scheme my constituent donna be one of the she be audit through horizon which find loss of an employee admit fraud and be later imprison but donna be make bankrupt for the loss for not just but which of course she could not pay it be never challenge we do not know whether the real amount be or she be award an interim payment most of which be take by the receiver now the amount the receiver take have be take from the final fix amount and she have only be offer despite lose everything will the minister personally look at donna case and ensure she get proper redress for this obvious miscarriage of justice would be very happy to receive further information from the hon lady and will endeavour to reply to she as quickly as can recognise that there be concern about the fairness of the compensation process there be complex case that be still to be settle we be work at pace to ensure where we can that those case be settle particularly with regard to the glo scheme we have make it clear that for all the remain case that be with we by christmas we will be able to get substantial redress pay out to those individual by the end of march as say if she write to will happily look at her letter it be know as the horizon scandal but the real scandal be not the failing of software but the action and deed of individual and institution as sir alan bates say in that light would include the misuse and potential abuse of private prosecution will the government commit to act on that yes my hon friend raise very good point the ministry of justice have make clear its concern about this issue and be set to bring forward consultation document early in the new year believe to address exactly that concern welcome the minister statement but do he recognise the frustration that many many sub postmaster still experience we put legislation through this place month ago on the quashing of conviction the compensation scheme have be in place for many year now yet well over half of the individual still have not have their case deal with meet some of they when they come over for the inquiry few week ago and there be real fear among they that the post office be still in denial and be therefore still reluctant to proceed with these claim two people give example one have be ask for information that he do not have because the post office seize all the information for the other the delay be cause because she meticulously keep record and now the post office say it have so many record to go through that it will take some time do the minister understand why many people feel that despite the decision of this house and the commitment of ministers there be still reluctance on the part of the post office to deal fairly with these people understand completely the frustration of sub postmaster who have wait so long to get redress and have their case hear the right hon gentleman will understand that there be four horizon scandal compensation scheme in the case of the conviction that be overturn by this house this year the fourth compensation scheme the horizon conviction redress scheme be set up on july and have begin pay out significant sum of money to sub postmaster who have have their conviction overturn some million as of the end of november as say early the moj have seek to contact all individual who have their conviction overturn as result of that legislation it have say that it will complete its work by the end of january and understand that it be on course to do so but be acutely aware of the right hon gentleman point it be why we continue to look as much as we can at what further effort we can take to speed the delivery of compensation last but by no mean least call emma foody welcome the minister statement and his commitment to provide redress as soon as possible one of my constituent former sub postmaster who wish to remain anonymous attend surgery recently to share their experience accuse of steal over due to the horizon system they lose their home their job and their business and be force to pay thousand from their and their family saving compound the financial loss be the reputational loss ostracise by the community experience racial abuse and force to move away appal in its own right but as we have hear today just one of many many example do the minister agree that any redress must address not just the financial loss but the further damage do to people life as result of the action of the post office be sure speak for the whole house when say that wish the experience that my hon friend have describe be just an isolated example but sadly there have be far too many similar example of what sub postmaster have be through we absolutely must get more speed into the compensation process and we be very much work on that but we will also look carefully at the recommendation of the sir wyn williams inquiry when they be publish

listen to they carefully if he and his right hon and hon friend have not do so already recommend that they make contact with the private office of the ministers concerned if that do not lead to prompt reply number of option be open to they include table question both write and oral and seek an adjournment debate suggest that the table office could be very helpful in give they further idea as to how they can well hold ministers to account office of the whistleblower motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to establish an independent office of the whistleblower to protect whistleblower and whistleblowing to make provision for the office of the whistleblower to set monitor and enforce standard for the management of whistleblowe case to provide disclosure and advice service to direct whistleblowing investigation and to order redress of detriment suffer by whistleblower and for connected purpose so it be quite small bill if may shall start with couple of thank yous all too often be whistleblower be thankless task whistleblower risk so much their personal standing their reputation and their home think that this ten minute rule motion come so soon after the statement that we hear from my hon friend the under secretary of state for business and trade highlight the importance of those who be willing to speak up and draw attention to wrongdoing when they see it should like on behalf of the house if it will indulge to thank those people who have the bravery to stand up say that there be wrongdoing and put themselves at risk also want to pay short tribute to my immediate predecessor in this place jo gideon who now serve as the chairperson of whistleblowersuk she do lot in this house to progress the issue and it be testament to she that progress be make in the last parliament hope that we can continue it in this place be grateful to the government for the work that they have be do on improve current arrangement for whistleblowing the duty of candour bill which will place on our public servant the requirement to speak out and tell the truth when an investigation be happen be an important part of shin light on some of the dark recess of our public sector when thing go wrong be also grateful to the government for recognise that whistleblowing can be important for tackle sexual harassment and for the work that they be do on the employment rights bill the whole purpose of whistleblowing be to try to prevent thing from happen in the first place all too often we end up in circumstance and situation in which something terrible happen and somebody stand up and give evidence about what have happen as we have hear over many hour of debate in this place it then cost an awful lot of money to redress the wrongdoing that have happen in such circumstance not have in place an effective and efficient whistleblowing system that be available to anybody who see wrongdoing cost taxpayer huge amount of money the current framework for whistleblowe in this country be very much look at through the lens of employment law technically someone be consider whistleblower only if they be employ by and have contractual relationship with the organisation about which they be make disclosure that mean that the remedy and redress that be available to the whistleblower normally end up in an employment tribunal which look at the occupational and work relate loss that the individual have suffer and not necessarily at some of the social and reputational damage that they suffer as result of be the person who stand up and speak out we all know that stand up and speak out be so important because it be instill in new members of parliament when we arrive here we be tell that if we see wrongdoing we have duty to say something anyone who travel on train will hear the slogan see it say it sort if people see wrongdoing in life however say something about it be often risk too far they might make disclosure about their workplace and suddenly they will be put on gardening leave they find themselves in situation in which they be label as the troublemaker in the organisation then they end up down the employment tribunal route and the issue do not necessarily get deal with one aspect of my bill that hope the government will consider take forward if not through this bill then perhaps by bring forward other bills be the propose office of the whistleblower which be support by my party in opposition and in amendment table to the economic crime and corporate transparency act such an office have be talk about in this house the hon member for torbay steve darling who be no long in his place say in previous debate that it would have help we to prevent some of the scandal that we have see in this country the propose office of the whistleblower would provide genuine levelling effect for people who stand up and say the right thing and who then suddenly find themselves oppose by the legal and financial resource of huge company that seek to discredit they isolate they and put they in position in which their reputation and home life struggle with an office of the whistleblower we could remove the david versus goliath situation and genuinely ensure that speak up and do the right thing count would hope that the propose office of the whistleblower would be designate body to which people can report when they have make disclosure currently different regulatory body can take whistleblowing declaration in fact member of parliament be prescribe people whistleblower can make declaration to we without necessarily incur penalty very few of we know that and very few of we be able to progress disclosure to the next stage the propose office of the whistleblower would be require to collate datum on where whistleblowing declaration be be make from public body and other organisation crucially that would tell we where there be problem be sure that even today there will be employee in the nhs the civil service other public sector organisation and the private sector who make disclosure to manager while yesterday somebody else make disclosure to different manager about the same problem but no one be collate that datum to say actually this be problem in particular sector we should probably look at this and take some action now and prevent genuine wrongdoing malpractice malfeasance or even death from occur our current whistleblowing arrangement be far too reactive they rely on somebody stand up and speak out and they rely on that person take risk after an event have happen it become almost situation of say here be the evidence to correct the wrongdoing that have occur we need to change whistleblowe culture in our country so that when something be happen and we see it or somebody else see it they feel compel and also support to make that declaration that be very important because quite often the people who be do the wrongdoing in the first place the people who be undertake malpractice malfeasance or corruption do it because they think they can get away with it they do it because they think nobody be watch they do it because they think the risk be less than the reward they can personally derive from cover up fraud or any form of non criminal activity by make it clear that we now empower individual citizen of the country to stand up and make declaration and be protect and support in do so those who want to do wrong will think again that will prevent our have to spend million of pound on redress money that we can put to well use in this country hope that this short bill although it have long title will go some way to rebalancing power in this country by allow those brave soul who often take on the mighty giant the opportunity and the support they need to do the right thing know we have get their back question put and agree to order that gareth snell liam byrne robin swann richard foord sarah champion mr jonathan brash

very constructive debate on second reading of the bill in particular wish to express my appreciation for the universal support that the house have show for the provision of this vital funding it be clearly subject close to the heart of many of we across the house look forward to further discussion on this important bill today as the committee be aware the extraordinary revenue acceleration be an ambitious scheme design to provide ukraine with total of billion in additional support to be repay by the extraordinary profit generate on russian sovereign asset hold in the european union the united kingdom contribution of billion be join by pledge from the united states the european union canada and japan the bill contain only two clause they be both straightforward clause grant the government the legal spending authority to fulfil the commitment we have make to provide ukraine with the uk contribution to the extraordinary revenue acceleration the clause empower the treasury or the secretary of state to provide the government of ukraine with fund approve by parliament as result of the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan for ukraine scheme or any subsequent arrangement that be supplemental to or modify or replace those arrangement payment make under clause will be those that be necessary to perform the uk commitment to the era scheme in of course welcome the government measure note that the minister refer to the extraordinary interest from the frozen russian asset have the government permanently set their mind against any possible actual seizure of the asset themselves perhaps in agreement with other member or eu member thank the right hon member for his contribution as we debate on second reading this be commitment across partner and with the european union to take action on the proceed of the asset that be hold for other complicated legal reason there be no intention to seize those asset at this time thank the minister for his acknowledgement of the cross party support for this measure but to back up my colleague the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis the billion from the uk be generous and will make difference but the billion in frozen asset would be utterly game change accept the minister argument at the moment about some of the more complicated legal issue know that he accept the very serious situation that the ukrainians be face on the front defend all of we may encourage he merely to continue to look at this issue and see whether he can work with colleague to find way of unpick the difficulty that he have highlight welcome the hon gentleman encouragement which take in good faith he will know that these matter be multilateral and subject to negotiation with other ally and colleague but he will also know as be sure the whole house do that we go into with strength of resolve across those country to do all that we can to help ukraine continue to mount its defence against the illegal invasion from russia any other payment beyond the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan to ukraine or any other country that be unrelated to the era scheme be not cover by the provision of the bill this money be in addition to other grant and payment that have be refer to in the house previously the clause contain provision for the uk to provide funding towards subsequent arrangement that be supplemental to modify or replace the era this provision allow for flexibility in the unlikely event that the scheme itself should significantly alter it be not intend to be use without this change in circumstance clause simply set out the short title of the bill thank the minister for open the debate the conservative government be vociferous advocate for mobilise russia freeze sovereign asset to support ukraine we drive and european partner to try to coalesce around the most ambitious solution possible to achieve that outcome the announcement on october mark progress on that journey and be step in the right direction we understand that the government position be that the united kingdom contribution should be earmark for support ukraine military expenditure include on air defence artillery and other equipment the opposition would support that we need to persevere with our effort to put ukraine in the strong possible position to counter russia unprovoked and illegal invasion matter since second reading have be fast move so let pose some question to the minister since second reading the united states have give ukraine billion fund by the profit of frozen russian asset that economic support form significant part of the overall billion package agree by member nation and announce in june the us treasury say that it have transfer the billion to world bank fund where it will be available for ukraine to draw money handle by the world bank can not be use for military purpose the us administration have initially hop to dedicate half the money to military aid but that would have require approval from congress which the president do not seek perhaps the minister can update the house on what discussion the uk government have have with the us administration canada and the european union about the use of fund provide for military purpose be any string attach to the fund that will be provide by the uk as the us have already provide its share of money anticipate in the package can the minister advise the house on the timing of the uk contribution think it be make clear on second reading but it would be helpful to have an update give the move by the us since then as the minister and the government have advise the loan that the uk will pay will form part of the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan agreement by the the loan that the uk will provide will be repay by the ukraine loan co operation mechanism establish by the european union under regulation on october the ability of the uk to have its loan repay depend in large part on decision by the european union to maintain its freeze on russian asset the eu renew russian sanction every six month and effort to extend that to three year review cycle be rebuff by hungary early this year will the minister confirm that there be risk in the event that the eu do not extend its sanction on russia that the cost of the loan will be bear by uk taxpayer and what mitigation he might consider if that situation arise finally the eu control more than two third of russia billion of sovereign asset that have be freeze by western ally follow russia full scale invasion of ukraine of those eu hold frozen asset be hold by the belgian base financial service company euroclear the profit from the eu hold asset estimate to be between billion and billion per year have be use to arm ukraine and finance its post war reconstruction we understand that the eu top diplomat kaja kallas say in an interview with the guardian on december that the european union should use the billion in frozen state asset to aid ukraine she emphasise that ukraine have legitimate claim for compensation and describe the russian asset hold in the eu as tool to pressure russia the minister respond to early intervention but can he confirm the uk government position have he discuss the matter with the eu and belgium and do he have any plan for the uk to go far on the use of those asset want to speak to new clause which have sign but first want to reiterate my support for the government and the bill as say on second reading it be absolutely right and proper that russia pay for the damage it have do to ukraine and its people the bill be an important first step in provide that financial assistance from russian asset to ukraine echo the comment from around the chamber we need to move with ally towards position of seize russian asset but it be positive first step that we be use the proceed of the interest on those asset to support ukraine on second reading mention that canada have pass the special economic measures russia regulations which collect datum on russian asset freeze they and publish the value which currently stand at billion canadian report november vol ask if the government could disclose russian asset hold in the uk in the same way new clause go long way to provide that it would ask the government to lay copy of report before parliament show under the act as it will hopefully become monie provide by the united kingdom to ukraine to the following level of disclosure the united kingdom share of the principal loan amount and interest accrue under the scheme and receipt of extraordinary profit from the russian immobilised sovereign asset under the scheme it would to an extent mirror what our close ally canada have do although do not expect to divide on new clause would appreciate it if the minister would comment on how he will report progress to the house disclose the level of russian state asset that be here and state how much of the interest accrue from those asset have be mobilise to support ukraine in its war effort thank the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for outline some of the thing in the new clause we have table want to outline in some detail what be in new clause and what we hope to achieve with it and hopefully the minister will be able to respond and outline some of his thought around report in particular new clause would impose reporting requirement on the secretary of state to keep parliament inform about three critical aspect of our support to ukraine under the scheme the report would detail the monetary support provide to ukraine include the amount disburse and how that fit into the broad multilateral agreement that ensure transparency and allow members and the public to understand the precise scale of our financial commitment the report would also provide clarity regard our share of the principal loan amount and any interest accrue such information be vital for proper scrutiny and public trust ensure that fund allocate be achieve their intended purpose finally and most importantly the report would shed light on any extraordinary profit arise from immobilised russian sovereign asset under the scheme while we can not legislate here to seize those asset directly the provision ensure that the question do not simply fade away by require regular report we maintain focus on the issue and keep pressure on the government to engage with our partner if at some future point there be an opportunity to use russian state asset more directly for ukraine recovery parliament will be fully inform and ready to act the report must highlight any discussion the uk government have have with other country about future step include expand the range of asset consider or use they in new way that ensure ongoing diplomatic transparency and accountability parliament will know if the government be push for more ambitious measure internationally or if they be hesitate while other lead in practice the first report would appear within six month of the bill passage with subsequent report every six month until one year after the relevant international arrangement cease to operate the structured timeline guarantee sustain oversight rather than just one off glance give the complexity and duration of the challenge ukraine face such ongoing engagement be critical it set framework for continue scrutiny encourage more ambitious future action and underscore that despite the bill limited scope our resolve to hold russia accountable remain unwavere through those measure we would ensure that parliament remain fully informed and ready to stand by our ukrainian ally when the opportunity to take bold step arise it be pleasure to speak in support of the bill the battle for ukraine be one of the define issue of our age in february putin launch an illegal and reckless invasion of sovereign european democracy see that happen in the third decade of the century be sobering moment we have see nothing like it on european soil since world war two it put beyond any doubt the revanchist and irredentist ambition of the russian regime and the need for all freedom love democratic people to resist those ambition at all cost the ukrainian people be fight not just for ukraine but for all of we for the value we hold dear democracy human right the rule of law and freedom from global gangster like putin by help ukraine to stand strong against russian aggression we be send clear message to dictator and autocrat around the world that we will not tolerate violation of national sovereignty or the use of force to change border last week meet ukrainian refugee in my constituency who convey not just their gratitude for our country steadfast support for their war action against russia but their sense of desperation because many of their visa run out early next year do my hon friend agree that the government should act quickly to give those people the certainty that they will continue to be welcome in the uk for the foreseeable future agree with my hon friend about visa we need to do everything we can to support the ukrainian people whether here in the uk or abroad our support for ukraine be an investment not just in its future but in the security and stability of europe and the world russia war against ukraine have not only devastate the life of million but challenge the very foundation of the international rule base order the brutality of russia action the targeting of civilian and the displacement of more than million ukrainians be stark reminder of the atrocity that war bring to ordinary people this be tragedy for the russian people too many ten of thousand of russian troop have be needlessly kill in ukraine victim of the vainglorious and deranged ambition of their leader our quarrel be not with ordinary russians it be with the regime that oppress and lie to they ukraine meanwhile have show resilience courage and an unwavering determination to protect its land its people and its freedom president zelensky and the ukrainian people have stand firm in the face of adversity as have say before they be fight not just for ukraine but for all of we let we make no mistake if we do not send the weapon and financial support that the ukrainians need to fight this war we will one day have to send our son and daughter to confront putin and his regime be proud to say that our unwavering support for ukraine unite members on both side of the house and it have unite our country too be very proud to walk around my livingston constituency and see ukrainian flag in window and garden as sign of our solidarity from provide military aid to offer humanitarian assistance and from impose sanction on russia to offer refuge to those flee war we have act with purpose and resolve and many british people include individual in this house have open their door to ukrainian refugee the uk have provide million in humanitarian assistance since the start of this full scale invasion include million to double this year support for ukraine energy system and million for stabilisation and early recovery which the foreign secretary announce in kyiv in september the labour government have step up for ukraine the uk will deliver billion of military aid to ukraine every year for as long as it be need their fight be our fight the uk military financial diplomatic and political support for ukraine be ironclad the bill provide the government with the spending authority to enable the uk to provide the ukrainians with financial assistance as part of the extraordinary revenue acceleration loan to ukraine scheme which be an important part of this effort it represent an advance of approximately billion repay from the extraordinary profit make on immobilised russian sovereign asset hold in the uk we must continue to stand with ukraine confront russian aggression and pursue putin for his war crime our response must be one of strength resilience and unity for as long as it take at time of existential threat to ukraine have be hearten by the tone from across the house towards the ukrainian people it be critical at this moment in history that this house and all european governments step up and do not give up while welcome the detail of this short bill we should be focus on the untapped countermeasure and counter offensive that be at our disposal like number of colleague gently say to the minister that we should think about the use of frozen russian asset to support ukraine in its non violent economic and political reconstruction the un general assembly have already endorse an international mechanism for compensate ukraine but we can not wait for the war to be over before we enact that countermeasure back in ukraine lose of its gdp so if it only receive its compensation at the end of the war that will be far too late by use the billion in russian central bank asset hold by free and open country now we can give ukraine lifeline as it continue its honourable defence of its country believe that this action would be not just morally justified but underpin by sound legal ground the true centre of gravity in this war be ukraine economic endurance against russia strategy of attrition and ruin but despite the effort across europe there be currently leadership vacuum when it come to push through the use of frozen russian asset to assist the decisive action that be need for ukraine victory we be see putin increase isolation with civil unrest in russia and it be imperative that we take advantage of that to date european country and the united states have provide roughly billion per month to the ukrainian people in order to keep their government function think all member of this house would endorse that approach but in the long term it be neither right nor practical to expect western taxpayer to foot the bill for reconstruct ukraine when there be legal mean for russia to pay there can be no credible scenario whereby russia get its money back after wag an unprompted war against ukraine while the victim go uncompensated that would effectively give the right of an aggressor precedence over those of its victim we must show that the un ruling and international law have tooth and that russia will face consequence for wag its illegal war we can not live in the blind hope that russia will fulfil its legal obligation as such gently say to the minister that take action now and use those frozen russian asset as form of down payment on the reparation that russia will one day have to pay be route that the government should pursue at the early opportunity it be pleasure to speak in support of this bill and to pay tribute to the government for their support for ukraine and to the consensus across the house that ukraine must be support against the barbaric and illegal invasion of sovereign nation as my hon friend the member for livingston gregor poynton say the invasion of one european state by another in february be something never think would see in my lifetime we all think that have be consign to the history book where it belong be very pleased that we be back the ukrainian people in their struggle and hope that in time the russian people can vote in free fair and democratic election to choose their own path also pay tribute to the community of northumberland who have come together to welcome family from ukraine in hexham in riding mill and in other town and village across my constituency when be out and about in my constituency be always strike by the ukrainian flag that see sometimes in the most incongruous place on country lane on the side of church and in private home it really give renew optimism to see those flag fly beneath the beautiful northumbrian sky one question that have be put to by constituent and on which would like to gently probe the minister be the future of the homes for ukraine scheme many family who have take in ukrainian refugee have ask to pursue clarity on that scheme so would be grateful if the minister could give some assurance about it or some timetable for it ultimately this short bill be need to promote and protect one of our sovereign democratic ally to protect our institution and as my hon friend the member for livingston say to avoid the need for further conflict in the year to come putin war machine could quite easily continue to impinge on our life and on people life across the rest of europe would endorse the comment that have be make by colleague think we sometimes need little bit of perspective in my constituency and in tayside and fife the hon member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward will be well aware of this we have defensive barrier that be build during the second world war the barrier in tayside and fife be build by polish and as they now be ukrainian soldier who be stand up to tyranny they build those defence to defend scotland and to defend the rest of the united kingdom as well they know that there be no point in stand up to tyranny just in one corner of europe we have to do it throughout europe those defence stand as testament to the time when the poles and the ukrainians stand by we now be the time for we to once again stand by they echo the remark make by the hon member for livingston gregor poynton about the way that ukrainians have come to our home and have enrich our society and our community know they be keen to go home but we can just give they that little bit of certainty also pay tribute to the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin for his work and that of other on frozen asset that speak to the enormous challenge that ukraine be face and that the rest of we be therefore face at exactly the same time acknowledge the work of the minister in seek to untangle those asset welcome his remark really do but some of the administrative burden be as nothing compare with the burden that have be carry by ukrainian troop on the frontline in kursk donbas and elsewhere and compare with the challenge we will see from conflict and refugee crisis should that front collapse at any point know he get that and there be agreement across the chamber on it but think it be worth underline also welcome the remark make by the conservative shadow minister the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller about engage with our european partner on this because that be pivotal fully endorse his remark about where number of these fund be be keep and about how if one move we all need to move there be unanimity in this committee and have be strike by the outstanding work do by number of colleague that unanimity and resolve reflect the magnitude of the challenge that each and every one of we face if we do not stand up to tyranny and secure the future of europe right now wholeheartedly welcome this bill which allow we alongside our partner to provide billion of loan to ukraine to be repay use profit from sanctioned russian asset and wholly support this government commitment to stand unequivocally with ukraine believe that putin and his crony should be the one who pay for the damage they have cause across ukraine to that end while this be very welcome first step do the minister agree that we should be do all we can within the rule of law to seize frozen russian asset both private and state and use they to finance the reconstruction of ukraine moreover may gently suggest to the minister that we must secure swift resolution on the proceed of the sale of chelsea football club in march roman abramovich pledge to sell chelsea football club and donate the billion nearly seven time the value of the humanitarian assistance that the uk have pledge since the invasion in to support victim of the war in ukraine however as think all member know two year on from the sale this have hit stalemate and regrettably no money have be deliver to the victim of the conflict with that in mind the government should commit to number of recommendation that the campaign group redress have work on and all of which support the first recommendation be take step to ensure that the proceed of the sale of chelsea football club be swiftly transfer to charitable foundation in the uk or adopt other exist mechanism set up to deliver reparation to victim of the conflict the second be ensure that substantial percentage of the fund be use for reparation for victim of the conflict particularly victim of gross violation of international human right and humanitarian such as survivor of conflict relate sexual violence the third recommendation be to engage ukrainian civil society victim and survivor in guide the repurposing of those fund the fourth and final recommendation be to establish working group between the government civil society and survivor to ensure that fund be distribute in an effective and timely manner very much welcome the substantial progress that the government have make in the past few month in stand shoulder to shoulder with the ukrainian people include the recent announcement of new anti corruption champion the further designation of vessel in the russian shadow fleet and increase collaboration across government to tackle putin war economy bear down on both the kremlin and the wide network of crony who enable his unlawful and persistent invasion of ukraine as my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel say the bill be an important step and welcome further initiative to support the ukrainian people as they continue their struggle to protect their sovereignty and territorial integrity in the face of putin unlawful invasion it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell he have demonstrate why he will be such valuable addition to the foreign affairs committee and congratulate he on his election to it associate myself with his comment and those of other member we often find ourselves disagree over the small of detail so be proud that we can all come together on an issue of such magnitude in unity with the people of ukraine long may that cross party support continue early this year as some member may know have the privilege of visit ukraine go over with an estonian charity drive couple of military pick up truck over from the uk as part of much large convoy that go into kyiv those vehicle be hand over to the ukrainian soldier and it bring home that there be not only support and solidarity in this country for ukraine but solidarity across the whole of europe that be why we be come together on the measure in this bill hopefully we will have an opportunity to go again and associate myself with the comment of my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel we be both on call early and know that he and other member have also make trip to ukraine and be part of aid convoy to help people and long may that continue this bill be another tool in the arsenal when it come to fight one of the world great tyrant ukraine fight against russian tyranny be not just for ukraine sovereignty but for the freedom and security of the whole of europe one strike thing in make that journey be realise just how flat europe be know that seem silly point but it bring home that there be nothing stop putin at the border of ukraine if we do not stand up against he now the fact that another of the world tyrant assad be now cower in moscow demonstrate the importance of curtail russia aggression be proud that this government and the government before have stand foursquare behind ukraine as other member have say the bill will land deafening blow on putin war machine and unlock billion contribution from the uk to the extraordinary revenue acceleration scheme which crucially will not be pay by ukraine or by british taxpayer it come from dodgy cash from profit own by sanctioned russian asset hold in the eu associate myself with the comment of my hon friend the member for livingston gregor poynton who list the various way in which the previous government and the current government have support ukraine long may that continue it be so important that we continue to stand four square behind ukraine for as long as it take urge the committee to do all in our power to ensure that the bill receive royal assent as urgently as be feasible especially as we approach winter when the battle condition will become even tough finally use this opportunity to pay tribute to the ukrainian force fight on the frontline the british troop involve in training and equip they and all those show resilience in the face of putin illegal war in closing thank right hon and hon member for their contribution thank my hon friend the members for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for livingston gregor poynton for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward for hexham joe morris for bolton west phil brickell and for hemel hempstead david taylor and the hon member for solihull west and shirley dr shastri hurst and for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins the shadow chief secretary to the treasury the hon member for north bedfordshire richard fuller and the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my hon friend the member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty for be here for this important debate all of we across the house want the same thing for ukraine to win the war and for the uk to provide the good possible support to make that happen as quickly as possible assure the house that this will remain priority for the government and the bill be an important step towards that goal turn to new clause table by the hon member for lewes james maccleary will explain why the government will not support it the new clause would impose reporting requirement on the secretary of state in relation to the era as see it those would broadly fit into two category the first would require financial reporting to parliament on the progress of the billion era loan itself that would include provide information on the disbursement make by the uk and our share comparatively to the and provide detail of the repayment that we will receive from the eu ukraine loan co operation mechanism the second category would involve produce write summary for parliament of discussion between the uk and our ally regard any subsequent scheme the reference to subsequent arrangement track to the language in paragraph of clause which provide the government with the flexibility to provide fund to ukraine via alternative arrangement that be supplemental to modify or replace the era for example where necessary to respond to unforeseen future event or material change in circumstance beyond our control will approach each of those category in turn the additional financial reporting requirement in subsection of the new clause be unnecessary because the information require to be report under that subsection will be report in any case through the treasury exist channel the first tranche of the loan will be disburse from the treasury in the financial year to march the spend will therefore be reflect accordingly in the department detailed annual report and account for this financial year alongside disclosure of any narrative associate with the spend the annual report and account will be lay in parliament before they be make public that usually happen in mid july any future spending and repayment in future year will be reflect in the annual report and account in the normal way the treasury plan to make the era support package separately identifiable in the note to the account which will allow the financial impact of the scheme to be readily understandable that will be include alongside full disclosure of the risk for example credit risk and market risk associate with the era spending turn to subsection which would require the publication of summary of discussion between the government and other lender on subsequent arrangement as the house might expect to say the government should not tie their hand by agree to provide public report on the nature of private discussion between lender that would threaten to undermine the uk credibility with our establish partner and ally hope that be an obvious point privacy allow our international partner to speak candidly to we and vice versa which be key to our diplomatic effort the house will understand that that be especially important for matter of global security such as the debate before we when discussion be make and milestone reach the issue statement and communiqué in the normal way we do not want to undermine that process with mandatory additional reporting to parliament the government be commit to transparency and accountability however and parliament will be update in the usual way when major decision be take that include through oral and write ministerial statement as the chancellor do when the uk contribution to the era be announce in october but that do not extend so far as to provide running commentary which would ultimately serve to undermine our ability to resolve sensitive matter include those relate to russian asset with our close ally thank the hon member for table the new clause and hope that my answer be satisfactory in explain the government position before close turn to other point make by right hon and hon member in the debate the shadow chief secretary ask number of question first of course ally will co ordinate our approach to the scheme in the round include repayment and mechanism for the future however as he note different country be use contribution in different way as we have report to the house our intention be to use the money for military aid to ukraine the term of the loan and how the loan will be execute be currently be discuss between our government and the ukrainian government and will be manage in the normal way as part of our portfolio of loan on timing as say we intend to get the money to ukraine as quickly as possible next year which be why we will progress to royal assent for this enable bill as quickly as possible the term of the era say that all money should be pay at the late by the end of although we intend to be quick than that number of member raise the correct point that under international law russia be liable for the damage it have cause in ukraine and must pay for that damage number of hon member ask about asset seizure have set out the government position on that but can reassure the house that although this bill be not about seizure of asset the government and our ally continue to keep all available opportunity under review so that we can pursue lawful avenue to ensure that russia pay for the damage it have cause my hon friend the members for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy and for hexham raise the homes for ukraine scheme and visa assure they that will pass those point to my colleague in the home office to consider and respond to in due course member rightly point out the support that this country have give to the people of ukraine the ukrainian armed force and our ally in support they it be timely go into the christmas period when we have many image of england on our christmas card and our tv to note the number of ukrainian flag on house church and community building across the united kingdom that be gesture of solidarity between the british people and the ukrainian people and show that we be keep they in our heart this christmas time and in our mind as we think about our resolve go into to do all that we can to help they through these atrocious situation on the border with russia among some of the excellent contribution we hear in this debate be the remark by the hon member for livingston gregor poynton that if putin be not see to fail in ukraine british troop will ultimately end up be involve in some sort of conflict directly will the minister take that message back to his treasury colleague some of we feel that the argument about whether of gdp should be spend now or in couple of year time rather miss the point because if we get to the stage where british force be engage we will be spend far more than that as treasury minister he should realise that investment in defence in peacetime can deter much more expensive conflict the government position as the right hon gentleman will know be that we will set out the trajectory to of gdp on nato qualifying spend in follow the conclusion of the strategic defence review and the spending review he will also know that we fund our armed force not just to be prepare but to be ready to contribute but clearly can not comment on hypothetical scenario in he be right to allude to contribution in the debate that rightly highlight the ukrainian armed force on the battlefield fighting not just for their own country but for the security of europe and the united kingdom think we be all clear eyed about that and therefore our responsibility to help they that be why the bill be one part of the package of support that we be put in place and will continue to put in place over think have answer most of the point substantively and so conclude my remark question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill clause order to stand part of the bill the deputy speaker resume the chair bill report without amendment bill not amend in the committee consider third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time once again extend my gratitude to member from across the house for contribute to today debate and facilitate the swift passage of the bill today and throughout the bill passage so far this

against russia tyrannical unprovoked and illegal aggression since russia full scale invasion of ukraine in february no matter which party have be in office the uk government have remain committed to fully support ukraine for as long as it take the extraordinary revenue acceleration scheme and this bill which facilitate the uk contribution be another demonstration of the uk deliver on that promise beyond the era the uk have now commit billion in military humanitarian and economic support to ukraine early this year the government announce that we will continue to provide guarantee military support of billion per year to ukraine for as long as it take and our era commitment go far still as hon member will know the bill unlock the uk contribution of billion which constitute fair and proportionate contribution to the scheme base on our gdp share within the and eu it remain crucial that we pass the bill as swiftly as possible to begin disburse fund this winter to meet ukraine

for holborn and st pancras keir starmer the united kingdom government have be determine in support of the people of ukraine it say something of the depth of support in this country for the people of ukraine that if we sweep away large proportion of the member of this house and replace they with different representative from across the country the resolve in support for ukraine would remain the same we must not give up our effort since we start our debate there have be further action in ukraine will quote the late summary from the institute for the study of war which demonstrate the urgent

we face in an ever more uncertain world recently meet the high commissioner of few commonwealth country include zambia st vincent and the grenadines and cyprus who truly value their relationship with the uk we must continue to foster good relation across the commonwealth and we can do so only if leader and parliamentarian have the opportunity to work together fully support the proposal for elevate the cpa and the icrc status within the uk to stand alongside their vital international partner this bill will allow the cpa to operate as an international organisation headquarter in london rather than within limited scope as uk charity the cpa do incredible work in engage parliamentarian across the commonwealth fully embody its mission in promote the advancement of parliamentary democracy the threat to democracy and our liberal value have never be great since the second world war so this mission be more important than ever the ability to engage openly with parliamentarian globally particularly in fragile and conflict ride region and to exchange knowledge good practice and an understanding of good democratic governance could make world of difference globally the cpa operate in over legislature in nation and encompass over parliamentarian the cross parliamentary engagement conference and the forum allow for fruitful discussion on common value and aspiration importantly this bill will provide parliamentarian with the credibility and authority to operate fully on the international stage the status of the cpa as an international organisation will facilitate an active role in global diplomacy in address the challenge of our time expand its organisational scope will also bring the ability to sign international convention and pursue political purpose such as denounce the

international humanitarian law grant the icrc certain immunity and privilege will bring the uk into line with over state and alleviate many operational challenge under its current status the icrc

protection of information and testimony will in turn protect its worker and benefit the people it be help its work in gaza sudan congo ukraine and in over country must be protect and must maintain its principle of neutrality independence and confidentiality this bill provide critical step in ensure that both the cpa and the icrc through their new status as international organisation be entrust by the government to operate fully within the uk both organisation will continue to be value partner in the uk central role in global diplomacy through the promotion of good governance democracy and the commonwealth and in address global humanitarian need hope the whole house will support the bill on third reading call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank you for your forbearance madam deputy speaker apologise for my hasty entry into the chamber which do not detract from the high importance that the liberal democrats and attach to this bill be pleased to welcome the bill back to the house on third reading and have listen to hon member over the past week acknowledge the reservoir of support across the house for both the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross on the liberal democrat benches we want to see britain deepen trust and building partnership with our ally we want to see britain set an example in its support for international humanitarian law and we want to see britain counter the rise in global authoritarianism through our commitment to institution such as the commonwealth set against the scale of these ambition the change make by this bill may seem comparatively narrow they be however no less important by alter the status of the cpa and the icrc so they can be treat as international organisation with associate privilege and immunity we will safeguard the critical mission of both body while ensure they can retain their particular relationship with the united kingdom in the case of the cpa the importance of this be readily apparent the cpa present designation as uk charity limit its participation in the work of the commonwealth to that of civil society organisation and fail to respect the spirit of co operation and voluntary association that animate the commonwealth this bill be an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the commonwealth and to continue host the cpa headquarters here in the united kingdom the commonwealth charter sign by the late queen elizabeth ii lay out the core value and principle of the commonwealth these include democracy human right gender equality protect the environment and the rule of law these be all principle and value that the liberal democrats be pleased to champion turn now to the international committee of the red cross and its thousand of dedicated employee who along with million of volunteer in national and international red cross and red crescent society comprise the rest of the broad red cross and red crescent movement the icrc be an organisation without parallel its unique mandate be an exclusively humanitarian one to protect the life and dignity of victim of armed conflict and other situation of violence and to promote and strengthen humanitarian law be sad to say that the icrc mission be as indispensable now as it be at the committee found in and when it be affirm by the geneva convention in today the world be rack by more than armed conflict in sudan ukraine gaza and across the wide world million have be make refugee and ten of million have be internally displace the un estimate that of the casualty result from recent hostility have be civilian aid worker such as those in the red cross and red crescent movement be increasingly at risk and even news welcome by this house such as the fall of the brutal assad regime be accompany by urgent humanitarian need since the beginning of the war in syria in the icrc have register more than case of people who have go miss now with assad prison finally cast open the icrc have be work to reunite family and to support ex prisoner in sudan where some million people be in urgent need of humanitarian aid the shameful russian veto of the un security council resolution draft by the uk and sierra leone which call on both the rapid support forces and the sudanese armed force to increase aid access must now encourage the government to redouble their effort to see humanitarian law uphold since the beginning of the conflict in gaza the icrc have facilitate the release transfer and return to their loved one of israeli hostage hold in gaza the committee also perform the same function for free palestinian detainee presently the icrc have be deny access to the hostage even now hold by hamas in gaza as well as to the palestinians in israeli detention the icrc therefore have no assurance that either the hostage or the detainee be receive humane treatment nutrition or healthcare will the minister affirm that the icrc must be give immediate access to the hostage in gaza and to the detainee in israel and the occupy territory to fulfil its mandate under the third geneva convention will he also inform the house of what action the department be take to ensure combatant adhere to their obligation under international humanitarian law to treat prisoner and detainee humanely by treat the icrc as an international organisation we can provide it with legal basis to protect its neutrality and continue its work in the world most dangerous and fraught region and that will be positive step however we must also recognise that while change to the icrc status be necessary they be far from sufficient to ensure that humanitarian law be upheld and humanitarian aid be deliver where when and in the quantity that it be need urge the government to stand up to the permissive attitude in international law that we witness today in many war zone affirm our share value in support of international humanitarian law and impress upon war faction the need to deliver aid without interference be glad that the fcdo support to the icrc this year look likely to exceed the million provide last year however remain concerned that the cut to the uk international development spending from of gross national income to announce in the budget will be reflect in reduce support to the icrc in and beyond at this dangerous time when support for humanitarian aid organisation be so critical hope the government will commit to increase the funding next year for the icrc and the indispensable work it do we liberal democrats come from long tradition of liberal internationalism which prize co operation base on share value the effort of both the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross be of vital importance we be proud to support they and proud to support the bill it be pleasure to follow the liberal democrat spokesperson who make it just in time say well late than never it be an important contribution want to assure the parliamentary private secretary my hon friend the member for central ayrshire alan gemmell who put it to that it look like have rather lot of piece of paper in my hand and ask how long intend to speak that it be more case of the font be bit big so can read it as oppose to the temptation of speak for far too long interruption never you should be so lucky be grateful for the opportunity to speak

in get we to where we be today this bill be about our standing on the world stage and our role as leader in the fight for human right democracy respect good governance decency and importantly togetherness the bill when sign into law by his majesty will specifically grant international status to both the icrc and the cpa and will enable both those reputable and long stand body to benefit from the immunity and privilege of all other international body that be win for all of we it be technical bill but an important one know that colleague in parliaments and assemblies across the commonwealth be look to we to get this do and today all be well we will do just that her late majesty queen elizabeth ii always say that she have to be see to be believe and she be right the same go for we madam deputy speaker because as this bill become law subject to the will of the house we will be able to look our partner neighbour and friend in the eye and prove our commitment to the commonwealth in deed as well as in word the committee stage of the bill be the first committee that sit on follow my election to this house accept that it be little less demanding than the committees on some of the other bills before we but that speak to the cross party nature of the bill welcome the support of colleague from across the house include the shadow minister the right hon member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton and the hon member for esher and walton monica harding from the liberal democrats join the minister in pay tribute to all the official in the foreign office who have work on the bill some of whom be listen and to the clerks and official here in this house they be all wonderful and very talented people wish the bill well when the question be put shortly and look forward to support it on third reading feel sure that it will receive the overwhelming support of the house as this be the last time that shall speak in the house in be go home newcastle under lyme need and be go home how will we cope you cope just fine just want to wish all colleague here in our united kingdom parliament our commonwealth kith and kin and of course the good people of newcastle under lyme who shall see tomorrow very happy christmas and peaceful calm and tolerant new year what pleasure it be to follow so many positive speech on such unifying issue can not help but observe that it be singularly appropriate that the amiable minister should be make his last contribution before christmas on this issue rather than the more fractious one early of the future of the chagos island right hon and hon member may recall that speak on second reading in support of the very sensible change that the bill will make to the status of the commonwealth parliamentary association and the international committee of the red cross by give each organisation the status of body corporate the bill ensure that the independence of their staff be sufficiently protect and that the staff be able to continue with their work unhindered the bill give clear and welcome signal that the uk be commit to support democratic institution in carry out their important and independent work have be encourage by the minister positive comment throughout the parliamentary debate regard the importance of safeguard the institutional independence of such organisation and the same be true indeed essential for the office of the intelligence and security committee of parliament have hop as say on second reading that the bill would be expand to include the isc give the very clear read across unfortunately it have not prove possible to extend the scope of the bill to cover the isc within the available timeframe so will not repeat my early comment however hope that the government have hear the strength of feeling on this issue which be about uphold the commitment give to parliament it be about ensure that this house be able to hold secret organisation to account without the independent staff who do that work be subject to undue pressure inappropriate influence or improper interference follow the recent appointment of the new committee under its highly experienced chairman elect today by the other committee member lord beamish formerly kevan jones mp with whom serve on the committee for four year trust that the government will find another suitable legislative vehicle to allow the important change that we be make to the cpa and the icrc to be apply to the isc as well give the very clear similarity between the two democratic institution cover by the bill and the office of the isc and its secretariat be confident that that measure would receive the same level of strong cross party support that have rightly be achieve for this important bill should declare that be the treasurer and international representative of the cpa uk branch the scale of the resentment and indeed anger among commonwealth country at the previous structure of the cpa be sometimes not clear in this house body have be set up to consider alternative structure in particular the cpa leave the uk and be base elsewhere because of that concern and the many year that it have take to bring the issue forward be therefore very pleased to be able to go to the interim committee which have be set up to consider alternative location for cpa international and provide it with copy of the hansard report of the second reading of the bill which be grateful that the minister and the fcdo bring forward in timely fashion that tie in deliberately or otherwise with the commonwealth parliamentary conference give undertaking that have be give repeatedly by uk representative there be demand for evidence that that would be do the unanimous support that the bill achieve on second reading go long way towards do that open up the opportunity for cpa international to start to focus on many other issue the issue of the cpa structure and legal status have preoccupy it at an international level for many year attend the conference in ghana last year and at that conference that be the dominant issue that take up virtually all the debate this year be pleased that there be an excellent debate on climate change we have new international chair in dr christopher kalila who will visit london shortly he have set out his wish to bring renew sense of purpose to the commonwealth parliamentary association which will focus not so much on structure and constitutional issue as on bring together the commonwealth parliamentary family on issue of importance across the commonwealth as the minister know we can not disguise the fact that there be difficult issue out there the issue remain extremely challenging and we can not duck that we have to look at way in which we can take that forward certain commonwealth country be promote the criminalisation of not just member of the community but their ally that be not acceptable and we have to take stand and show leadership on it we also have to acknowledge that other actor be at work it will shock labour members that when be in south africa be condemn as neo colonialist by the economic freedom fighters party who wear fetch red boiler suit in parliament to display that in fact they be ordinary work people and not part of the elite they be not supportive of the commonwealth or south africa role in it we know russia and china be active in many commonwealth country so we can not just take it as give that everybody will proceed on the basis that we would wish they to but like other who have speak regard the commonwealth as great force for good there be huge opportunity at both parliamentary and governmental level to make difference to those on the ground across the commonwealth and hope that will be at the heart of the government approach there be one or two people who would like to thank and acknowledge not least my former colleague dame maria miller who try to get the bill through whether the arrival of the hon member for newcastle under lyme adam jogee be worth pause the bill for might be matter for debate on another day praise our former colleague ian liddell grainger ian would have do well in the diplomatic service if he have choose to do so he have to step in when the former chair of the cpa international die suddenly and there be vacuum ian come in and steady the ship as well as pursue the issue within this parliament and identify its importance of course as have already be mention our former colleague in this house stephen twigg do hugely important job as chief executive of cpa international on his behalf ask the minister to ensure that the subsequent order that have to be bring forward be do so in timely fashion and that we can continue to confirm to the commonwealth family the momentum behind the process the international executive committee of the cpa be due to meet here in london in may and it would be helpful if the other part of the process could have be complete by then my final plea to the minister be for the government to make more use of the cpa by work more closely with it as he have acknowledge have be on many visit the cpa uk with member of this parliament have the capacity to act in soft power role for the government as he and other know mp can share and discuss thing that it be not necessarily possible for our ministers or high commissioner to discuss in fact when we be in ghana last year we have good discussion around the issue which would not have be possible in more formal setting just want to say to the minister that the point that the right hon gentleman have just make have support across the house many labour member want to see exactly the urgency and focus that he have just mention thank the hon gentleman for that and for his wide comment the cpa uk in particular be good way of bring together colleague from across the house know that mr speaker fully endorse and support that it have be pleasure to attend many event over the year both overseas and here with colleague from across the house to return to my point hope that the minister and the fcdo in its current guise will endorse and embrace the cpa and the opportunity to use its soft power to take forward matter that be in the interest of everybody across the united kingdom do not intend to speak again but with the leave of the house will respond to some of the important question that be raise it be good to see the hon member for esher and walton monica harding who ask important question about the terrible situation for the hostage hold by hamas we want to see those hostage release the icrc have call for the immediate release of the hostage and for access to they it continue to request information on the hostage and their current health condition and it continue to try to get access to the hostage as part of its mandate role to assess their welfare pass message to family and provide medical and other support however for that to happen all party to the conflict need to reach agreement and the icrc have no means to compel they to do so we understand that the icrc continue to meet representative of the family as do the government we all want to see the hostage bring home the hon lady also raise the important matter of funding for the icrc in the funding be million include million core unrestricted funding however in the uk be on track to provide over million to the icrc the current spending review be under way so the total amount for and beyond be not confirm but our intention be to continue structure future funding within new multi year business case to give the icrc the predictability of income that it need to plan ahead for its crucial international humanitarian law and protection programme around the world to which many member have refer join the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis in congratulate lord beamish on his new role note carefully the point that the right hon member make and have no doubt that he will continue to pursue they in the way he do thank all member who have contribute to third reading and the other debate on the bill include my hon friend the members for southgate and wood green bambos charalambous and for newcastle under lyme adam jogee and the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell join the right hon member in thank stephen twigg for his excellent work

suicide in fact the website which will not name for reason of public safety be the subject of bbc investigation link it to more than death in the uk but it be link to many more death around the world that bbc investigation which take place year ago rightly identify multiple warning to the uk government by coroner and number of police investigation to be clear this website push people to suicide by encourage suicide and by actively attempt to dissuade they from seek mental health support or the support of their family and friend it provide people with instruction on how to take their own life it have link to where substance can be purchase and it have even livestreame suicide commend the hon gentleman for bring this debate before the house speak to he before the debate this be an issue that need air and he be do we all justice by do so be aware that some stream service such as will put disclaimer in place for graphic self harm and suicide scene netflix take step far its programme reason why remove its final episode as it contain highly graphic scene of suicide that many find distressing do the hon member agree that stream service that screen scene of suicide must as an industry standard have responsibility to consider the age range of their target audience what we be ask for tonight be for the minister and this government to take action the hon member be correct that everyone should exercise great moral responsibility when put stuff out there for people to see and be influence by joe nihill mother catherine and his sister in law melanie have run an inspire campaign in the wake of that tragedy to stop what happen to joe back in april happen to other people before he take his own life joe leave note for his family and in that note he ask they to do everything they could to get this website take down so that other be not push down the same path as he catherine and melanie have save life as result of their intervention personally prevent people from go down that path what be need though be not the heroism of people such as catherine and melanie it have save life but it be not enough what be need be change in the law of course welcome the advance make in this regard through the online safety act which will turn to later congratulate the hon gentleman on secure this important debate my constituent david parfett have be in the news speak about his son tom who sadly take his own life follow his visit to very harmful site quite possibly the same one that the hon gentleman be talk about that promote how people can take their own life he source poison that way and take his own life there be britons who have lose their life after use this website we need to take action on these very small but very harmful website the online safety act contain provision for such website to be include in category the most highly regulated category yet the illegal harm code publish yesterday do not include they do the hon gentleman agree that this be massive oversight and that these website should be include in category thank the hon member for her intervention and will mention her constituent horrific experience later in my speech agree that there be much furth to go to ensure that the online safety act do what it need to do to protect as many people as possible of this website joe sister in law melanie say yesterday on social medium that the problem with these website be that they be access by people at their most vulnerable and child joe sister in law and know joe would still be here if he have access that website because the method he use be only discuss there he would have know any other way these site be run by people who prey on the vulnerable and say they too be go to end their life but year later they be still here do the same thing push method we be never go to end suicide but we know that so many people can be help the bbc investigation identify one of the creator of the site and track he down to his home in huntsville alabama in the us he be doorsteppe by the bbc reporter and he refuse to answer any question but an account associate with this creator of the site issue defiant response about the uk want to block the site as part of its investigation year ago the bbc contact internet service provider as do joe sister in law and his mother sky broadband for example respond by say that it have block the site catherine and melanie say at the time it really important to we both as it mean access be become limit to prevent other find it which be step in the right direction the hon member mention her constituent david parfett and david son tom be when he end his own life in after access this site respond to sky broadband decision as an internet service provider year ago to block this site mr parfett say it make cry it pure relief mix with anger that tom may still be here if it have be regulate two year ago my sole aim have be to stop other people be influence to take their own life respond to defiant response from the site link to the founder of the website mr parfett add these people encourage other to die and celebrate death in statement at the time ofcom tell bbc news this be just over year ago about the then online safety bill if service do comply we have broad range of enforcement power at our disposal to ensure they hold accountable in recent westminster hall debate intervene on the minister about this and congratulate the internet service provider sky and three on take action to block access to this site the minister very helpfully welcome that intervention and make the important point that internet provider do not have to wait for the act to be enact they can start make such change now she go on to say that the online safety act be landmark act but it be also imperfect ofcom need to consult mean long lead in time although it be important to get these matter right that can often feel frustrating official report november vol it be right that internet service provider do the right thing and take responsibility just as joe family have be contact internet service provider so have very much welcome the fact that three have respond to representation by block this site which will not name as have sky other response be not quite as positive or as practical vodafone respond by say that the site be block where customer have adult content filter enable bt respond by say that our fixed network level broadband parental control setting for all age block the site the response from virgin media concern and want to put it on the record it originally come back to say that it would block the site if court order tell it to we need to be clear that it be not impressive to say if court tell we to do something we will do it court order be court order and company have no choice other than to comply virgin media also refer to people change setting so that they can not access this site virgin media need to get real somebody who be in the mindset of consider take their own life somebody who be struggle to control that impulse be not likely to disable the setting to stop themselves from look at it my hon friend be make powerful speech do not come here to speak but he be discuss key topic as we move into christmas many of we be look forward to it but it can be low time for people worry about people access this content and content around eat disorder the question for any internet service provider hopefully they be watch this debate be what possible justification can they have for continue access to this site be they hide behind freedom of speech to there be complete imbalance between the need to protect the right of these young people and the wide freedom of speech argument could not agree more with my hon friend this be not freedom of speech issue this be particular website link to the death of people in our country and many more worldwide in its reply virgin media also say that it be handle this matter through its partnership with the internet watch foundation contact the internet watch foundation and it reply that we work with company to block child sexual abuse material specifically so do work on suicide relate content be afraid it be therefore poor reassurance from virgin media to point to partnership with an organisation that do great work be sure but not in relation to this specific issue press virgin media far and it say we will review the specific website you raise with we and consider if further action should be take of course further action should be take there be technological limit that sometimes mean block can not be effective but life can be save and will be save by restrict the number of people who access this site put on record that have have no answer from ee it should answer and it should act encourage all internet service provider to do the right thing and in whatever way they can to block this specific site which be link to uk death be the subject of police investigation as we understand it and be refer to in various coroner report to give sense of the scale of the challenge three uk have kindly provide with datum today that show that it have block attempt to access url that it have categorise under suicide and self harm in the past month alone three uk should be congratulate on what it have do the fact that it can inform of the number of attempt to access such site that it have block show why it be fundamentally necessary for other company to do the right thing the site be host by cloudflare major company with good reputation and corporate office in london draw the house attention to write question ask by the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis who email early about this on october he ask write question that be pass to the home office it say to ask the secretary of state for the home department whether her department have hold recent discussion with cloudflare on remove the website link to death by suicide report on by the bbc on october he be ask what the then government have do to pressure cloudflare which host this site to take it down and disrupt its operation no answer be give to that he be still await response to that question that be due an answer on october on may write to the chief executive officer of cloudflare matthew prince make it clear what have happen in this situation say the reason be write to you today be because it appear your company be host this website and would like to draw this to your attention so you can terminate your hosting of this site to protect the public in both our country the usa and the uk and across the world know successful company of over decade good standing like cloudflare with an excellent reputation would not wish to be associate with such harmful content link to the death of many vulnerable people across the world detail the whole matter as have detail it to the house and then put would be very grateful if you look into this matter as matter of urgency before any more vulnerable people be encourage or enable to harm themselves due to this website activity cloudflare cease to host its website would not be contravention of the principle of freedom of speech but choice of reputable and respected company not to give platform to website which have be link to the death of people in the uk alone such decision by cloudflare could well save life say it should be note that both sky broadband and mobile have block access to this website get no response to that letter on really serious matter hope not only that internet service provider will do the right thing but that the major company cloudflare will do the right thing and stop host this website disrupt its operation in that way could save life and believe that it would save life to conclude will ask the minister who have be do fantastic job on these sensitive issue number of question will she congratulate those internet service provider who have do the right thing in take action to block this site do she agree that those who have not should step up to save life will she assure that once ofcom power be fully enact the online safety act will deal with this specific site regardless of the number of people who access it and whether those people be under or over find it frustrating when internet service provider get back to and refer to child protection my constituent joe be when he take his own life and the constituent of the hon member for twickenham munira wilson be or when he take his own life so it be ridiculous to assume that harmful suicide relate content of this type be only danger to people under in relation to the question to the home office table on october by the right hon member for goole and pocklington will the minister take action to ensure that her department answer that question will she agree to the government contact cloudflare as the host of the site and raise concern and make representation we be talk about the death of citizen in our country will finish my remark by again pay tribute to catherine and melanie joe mother and sister in law they have be navigate this complex ever change world of dangerous activity that go on online and their action have save life they have be struggle to do so against great odd it sometimes feel like david and goliath situation note that when people be for example illegally stream football match action be take very quickly yet this website which be link to the death of people remain up there look forward to the minister response and thank member for attend the debate thank the hon member for leeds east richard burgon for open the debate and all other colleague who have contribute know that this issue will be close to the heart of many of we because it be about protect the safety of everyone include our child and young people this evening want to talk about why this issue matter and what the online safety act will do about it first would like to share my deep sympathy with family and friend of joe nihill year old man who end his life after find suicide relate content online unfortunately story such as joe be not uncommon we have hear about tom year old young man who also die from suicide as part of our work in online safety we speak to group that have campaign for year for safe internet often lead by bereaved family thank joe mother catherine his sister in law melanie and all the bereaved family for their tireless work we continue to listen to their expertise in this conversation people who be think about end their life or hurt themselves might turn to the internet as place of refuge all too often what they find instead be content encourage they not to seek help that deluge of content have real world impact suicide relate internet use be factor in around quarter of death by suicide among people age to in the uk at least death year lot of research in this area focus on child but it be important to recognise that suicide relate internet use can be factor in suicide in all age group these harm be real and tackle they must be collective effort on the hon member first point we welcome effort by all company include internet service provider to tackle illegal content so that no more life be tragically lose to suicide online safety form key pillar of the government suicide prevention strategy however we be clear that the principal responsibility sit squarely with those who post such hateful content and the site where it be allow to fester site that until now have not be make to face the consequence the online safety act have be long time come decade of delay have come at tragic human cost but change be on its way on monday ofcom publish its draft illegal harm code under the online safety act which be step change on the hon member second point can confirm that from next spring for the first time social media platform and search engine will have to look proactively for and take down illegal content these code will apply to site big and small if service do not comply they could be hit by massive fine or ofcom could with the agreement of the court use business disruption measure court order that mean that third party have to withdraw their service or restrict or block access to non compliant service in the uk we have make intentionally encouraging or assist suicide priority offence under the act that mean that all provider no matter their size will have to show that they be take step to stop their site be use for such content the strong protection in the act framework be for child so on the hon member third point assure he that under the draft child safety code any site that allow content that promote self harm eat disorder or suicide will now have to use highly effective age limit to stop child from access such content some site will face extra duty we have lay the draft regulation set out the threshold condition for category and service under the act category site be those that have the ability to spread content easily quickly and widely they will have to take down content if it go against their term of service such as post that could encourage self harm or eat disorder they will also have to give adult user the tool to make it less likely they will see content that they do not want to see or will alert they to the nature of potentially harmful content suicide forum will be unlikely to have term of service that restrict legal suicide content and user of these site be unlikely to want to use tool that make it less likely they will see such content however that absolutely do not mean that such forum what people call small but risky site can go unnoticed motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now owatemi every site whether it have five user or million user will have to proactively remove illegal content such as content where there be prove intent of encourage someone to end their life ofcom have also set up small but risky supervision taskforce to ensure that small forum comply with new measure and it be ready to take enforcement action if they do not do so the government understand that just one person see this kind of content could mean one body harm one life end and one family leave grieve the problem be that the site that the hon member for leeds east richard burgon refer to and there be many other like they do not necessarily fall into the illegal category although they still have extremely dangerous and harmful content despite cross party vote in parliament to include in the online safety act these very small and very dangerous site in category there have be proactive decision to leave they out of the illegal harm code which be publish yesterday can the minister put on record exactly why that be why can these site not be include in that category there be all sort of content glamourise suicide self harm eat disorder and other hate speech that be be promote by these small site they should be regulate to high level base on research regard the likely impact of user number and functionality category be about easy quick and wide dissemination of regulated user generate content as melanie dawes set out in her letter to the secretary of state in september ofcom have establish small but risky supervision task as mention to manage and enforce compliance among small service it have the power to impose significant penalty and as say to take remedial action against non compliant service as the hon member for leeds east mention early the online safety act be one of the big step that government have take on online safety but it be imperfect it be an iterative process and it will be keep under review thank the hon gentleman for raise this matter and for bring to our memory joe nihill and those like he who turn to the internet for help and be meet with harm on his final point on the effective implementation of the online safety act we will continue to engage with all provider in this space be confident that these measure be big step in make tech company play their part in wipe out those harm and make the internet safe place for we all the hon gentleman raise the matter of an outstanding question do not know whether he have go to the wrong department but will commit to look up that question and ensure that he receive response to it with that thank you madam deputy speaker and wish you and the whole house very happy christmas question put and agree to house adjourn
