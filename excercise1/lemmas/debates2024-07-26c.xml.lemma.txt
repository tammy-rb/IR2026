opportunity to expand the co operative economy put power directly in the hand of local people for the benefit of local community look forward to work with fellow co operator to do just that although job and opportunity be on our doorstep too many people still face barrier to employment and many be not earn enough to get by that create huge demand on local food bank and other vital support service include those offer by our local third sector organisation which do tremendous and invaluable job child poverty be scandal that blight community across the country and in my constituency but it do not exist in vacuum low pay high rent high mortgage exorbitant energy bill and the rise cost of food all contribute to severe financial pressure on family that be why welcome the announcement of the child poverty taskforce which will bring together voice inside government and those of outside expert to take holistic and targeted approach to tackle this scourge and ensure that every child have chance to achieve their goal irrespective of their background with more people choose to live in the bathgate and linlithgow constituency we be see increase pressure on vital local service which be significantly underfunde as well as pressure on gp surgery and on our local infrastructure both the avon gorge junction and the burghmuir junction be in serious need of upgrading with under investment in bus transport at scottish level our more rural community such as greenrigg newton philipstoun bridgend torphichen westfield blackridge seafield and even the town of blackburn be struggle to keep connect it be crucial that investment in vital service and local infrastructure keep pace with development and that be something that will champion in my constituency as young girl grow up in the small village of lennoxtown at the foot of the campsie hill never do think that would be stand here in the house of commons as one of female mps the high ever number of woman representative that do not just happen we be here only because of the woman who forge the way for we such as the incomparable harriet harman who have the pleasure of meeting for the first time at last year edinburgh

increase in woman member to of this place be hugely welcome we still have much work to do to achieve representation as councillor work to remove barrier to participation do my bit to ensure that council chamber start to reflect the community that we represent pledge to continue that work with hon member in and across this chamber finally think most people here would agree that our politic have be mire by division and scandal in recent year and that have undermine public trust in politician we have duty to restore that trust which be key to our democracy in scotland there have be far too much finger pointing with representative retreat to their respective trench and endless constitutional debate that ultimately deliver nothing for the people of scotland welcome the new approach of work with the devolved government and the response from the scottish government on issue such as the tobacco and vape bill and hopefully uk wide deposit return scheme this relationship reset will be far strengthen by the new council of nation and region which will facilitate return to constructive engagement and co operation in the interest of the people we be all here to serve for my part will
