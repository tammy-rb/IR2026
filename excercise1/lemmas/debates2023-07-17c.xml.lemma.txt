there be nothing that would make give such drastic advice the truth about the apprenticeship levy be that of it will be spend this year we can look in the rear view mirror and there be some report go back over time that show some underspend in the levy but they be back over time we be now spend of the levy perhaps what the hon gentleman have not appreciate be that some of the funding go to the devolved government if we examine the apprenticeship system in wales and scotland it be not patch on what we have introduce in england the progress in international reading literacy study be publish in may this year england have come fourth among country that test child of the same age nine and year old in we introduce the phonic screening check test six year old for their progress in reading and phonic in that year of pupil reach the expect standard by just before the pandemic the proportion have rise to follow transformation in the teaching of phonic in nearly all primary school of course the secretary of state will agree as she have just say to we be spend record amount of funding on school the secretary of state achieve an extra billion in the autumn statement last year and we be now spend billion on school funding we have recruit more teacher this year than last year and we have record number of teacher in the profession at but of course be happy to talk to the hon lady and the teacher in her constituency to discuss their particular concern with permission mr speaker would like to announce the publication of the government high education reform consultation response this country be one of the good in the world for study in high education boast four of the world top university for most high education be sound investment with graduate expect to earn on average more over their lifetime than those who do not go to university however there be still pocket of high education provision where the promise that university education will be worthwhile do not hold true and where an unacceptable number of student do not finish their study or find good job after graduate that can not continue it be not fair to taxpayer who subsidise that education but most of all it be not fair to those student who be be sell promise of well tomorrow only to be disappoint and end up pay far into the future for degree that do not offer they good value we want to make sure that student be charge fair price for their study and that university education offer good return our reform be aim at achieve that objective that be why the government launch the consultation in to seek view on policy base on recommendation make by sir philip augar and his independent panel the consultation end in may and the department for education have be consider the response receive be now able to set out the programme of reform that we be take forward believe that the traditional degree continue to hold great value but it be not the only high education pathway over the past year we have make substantial reform to ensure that the traditional route be not the only pathway to good career high technical qualification massively enhance student skill and career prospect and deserve parity of esteem with undergraduate degree we have see growth in degree level apprenticeship with over student enrol since their introduction in have ask the office for student to establish million competitive degree apprenticeship fund to drive forward capacity build project to broaden access to degree apprenticeship over the next two year that drive to encourage skill be why we be also invest up to million to help provider deliver high technical education in march we set out detailed information on how the lifelong learning entitlement will transform the way in which individual can undertake education and we continue to support that transformation through the lifelong learning high education fee limits bill which be currently pass through the other place we anticipate that that funding couple with the introduction of the lle from will help to incentivise the take up of high technical education fill vital skill gap across the country each of those reform have have one simple premise that we be educate people with the skill that will enable they to have long and fulfilling career believe that we should have the same expectation for high education it should prepare student for life by give they the right skill and knowledge to get well pay job with the advent of the lle it be neither fair nor right for student to use potentially three quarter of their lifelong learning entitlement for university degree that do not offer they good return that would constrain their future ability to learn earn and retrain we must shrink the part of the sector that do not deliver value and ensure that student and taxpayer be get value for money give their considerable investment datum show that there be provider from which few than of graduate progress to high skilled employment or further study fifteen month after graduate that be not acceptable will therefore issue statutory guidance to the ofs set out that it should impose recruitment limit on provision that do not meet its rigorous quality requirement for positive student outcome to help to constrain the size and growth of course that do not deliver for student we will also ask the ofs to consider how it can incorporate graduate earning into its quality regime we recognise that many factor can influence graduate earning but student have right to expect that their investment in high education will improve their career prospect and we should rightly scrutinise course that appear to offer limited add value to student on the metric that matter most to many we will work with the ofs to consider franchising arrangement in the sector all organisation that deliver high education must be hold to robust standard be concern about some indication that franchising be act as potential route for low quality to seep into the high education system and be absolutely clear that lead provider have responsibility to ensure that franchised provision be of the same quality as directly deliver provision if we find example of undesirable practice we will not hesitate to act far on franchising as have say we will ensure that student be charge fair price for their study that be why we be also reduce to the fee for classroom base foundation year course such as business study and social science in line with the high standard funding rate for access to he diploma recently we have see an explosion in the growth of many such course but limited evidence that they be in the good interest of student we be not reduce the fee limit for high cost strategically important subject such as veterinary science and medicine but we want to ensure that foundation year be not use to add to the bottom line of institution at the expense of those who study they we will continue to monitor closely the growth of foundation year provision and we will not hesitate to introduce further restriction or reduction want provider to consider whether those course add value for student and to phase out that provision in favour of broad range of tertiary option with the advent of the lle our aim be that everyone who want to benefit from high education have the opportunity to do so that be why we will not proceed at this time with minimum requirement of academic attainment to access student finance although we will keep that option under review be confident that the sector will respond with the ambition and focused collaboration require to deliver this package of reform extend my wholehearte thank to those in the sector for their response to the consultation this package of reform represent the next step in tackle low quality high education but it will not be the last step the government will not shy away from further action if require and will consider all lever available to we if these quality reform do not result in the improvement we seek our high education system be admire across many country and these measure will ensure that it continue to be commend this statement to the house yes the university of buckingham have take an excellent leadership position and its two year degree be very much welcome by many people we will introduce the lifelong learning entitlement which will revolutionise how and when people go to university what type of course they take for what period of time and how they make those decision over their entire career and lifetime
