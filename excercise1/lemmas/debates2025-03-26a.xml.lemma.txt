on on the amendment that seek to undermine the smokefree generation be sure we will hear argument from some hon member who have be listen to the tobacco industry argument and myth about how people should be free to make their own choice would say to they that smoke kill two third of its user three quarter of people wish they have never start smoke and the majority want to quit that be not freedom of choice the tobacco industry take away that choice with addiction usually at young age on smokefree place we have be clear in england we intend to consult on extend smokefree outdoor place to outside school child playground and hospital but not to outdoor hospitality setting at this time no smoker want to harm people but with second hand smoke they do if people can smell smoke they be inhale it this be particularly important for child pregnant woman and people with pre exist health condition such as asthma or heart disease the only way to stop this harm be to stop people smoke around other while understand hon member proposal to list specific place in the bill or to add additional limit to the use of the power it be right that we consult on the detail before make regulation and have the necessary power to protect child and vulnerable people from the harm of second hand smoking be grateful to the co chair of the all party parliamentary group on smoking and health my hon
