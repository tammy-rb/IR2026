the saga of the actors benevolent fund where it appear that the people who do right have be put out and the people who do wrong over and over again have be support by the charity commission could he say to the charity commission that people in parliament be watch this with some surprise of course the charity commission be an independent body but have regular meeting with it be not regular reader of private eye but will make sure that seek out that article ahead of my next meeting with the charity commission art and culture brexit what assessment she have make of the potential effect of the uk departure from the eu on the uk art and culture sector the uk art and culture sector have many strong exist positive relationship in europe and we be take number of step to deepen tie the government have develop bilateral agreement with european country and the british council offer further sector specific support include the recently announce spotlight on culture between the uk and france the uk trade and business commission find that the scottish art and film industry have lose million in eu funding as consequence of brexit so will the minister government make up for that shortfall and the calamity that brexit have impose on the sector while the uk decide not to participate in creative europe nevertheless the uk share prosperity fund which be uk wide funding initiative have match fund what be originally available from the eu and also give local authority and indeed nation control over how that money be spend bbc board complaint procedure whether she have have discussion with the bbc board on its complaint procedure the secretary of state and meet with the bbc leadership regularly to discuss range of issue the bbc process for handle audience complaint about its editorial content be an area of focus of the mid term review and as require by the term of reference the dcms have be consult the bbc on the review finding we be seek to conclude the review at pace and to report on its finding by look forward to the conclusion of the review the minister will know my view the complaint process within the bbc be utterly inadequate and think he agree with on that there be no genuine independence in that process and therefore there be lack of confidence in how that process be work hope he will factor those view into make sure that the outcome of the review take on board the need to have genuinely independent complaint mechanism so that the public can have confidence in the broadcast we be aware that research from ofcom bear out what the hon gentleman have say in that there be considerable dissatisfaction with the exist complaint procedure that be something about which the bbc be also aware and we be keen to address it in the mid term review so far we be make good progress in reach agreement with the bbc on how it can be strengthen in the future call the spokesperson for the scottish national party over the last day we have see the bbc embroil in lengthy bout of self analysis over accusation make about huw edwards for day the story lead every bulletin and refuse all request for comment feel do not know enough detail be glad take that stance the bbc have announce an investigation but the police have now say there be no criminality as originally claim by the sun what do the secretary of state think the lesson might be perhaps politician should exercise more caution before issue condemnation about develop story maybe we should remember to treat any story in the sun with extreme caution give this further example of intrusive prurience we could all remind ourselves of why there be once widespread agreement about have an independent press regulator with tooth something the conservatives once support before get frighten off by powerful press baron say to the hon gentleman that first this be matter for the bbc although the secretary of state and do ask to be keep inform by the bbc it be matter for the organisation itself and as he have suggest it have establish an internal inquiry to find out whether there be any lesson to be learn with regard to the sun it be of course member of the independent press standards organisation which have code and if there have be breach of the code then that be matter for ipso to adjudicate on bbc local radio services what recent discussion she have have with the bbc board on change to local radio service we recognise the strength of feeling about the importance of bbc local service and we remain disappointed that the bbc be plan to reduce part of its local radio output this be matter for the bbc but ministers have raise our concern about the bbc plan previously and we will discuss this issue with the interim chair and the director general at the next opportunity think that we all think that digital technology be mean to expand choice however in recent time we have see post office bank and rail ticket office closure and the bbc be use the same argument to justify the manage decline of local radio see today that we have be tell by the bbc that it want to reach of the population with its tv radio and online service after its digital plan be carry out but have see in the annual report that it say that it be already at so why be it use that as justification for the vandalism of local radio the bbc obviously need to take account of the fact that more and more people be access content online and digitally and therefore it have decide to invest more in that area however it be one that be already well provide for particularly in the area of local news it be important that the bbc do not lose sight of the fact that there be still significant number of people who rely on traditional broadcasting and value local radio as have make clear the government be disappoint by the bbc decision to reduce local radio output call the chair of the culture media and sport committee as you know mr speaker local radio be such lifeline to many of the elderly vulnerable and isolated people in our community wonder whether the minister have view on what the word public service in the bbc public service remit actually mean should that not include reach everyone with local news and information not just those who be digitally enable as say early many people still value local radio and will regret and indeed be very concerned about the reduction in local radio output that the bbc have propose particularly in the evening and at weekend have no doubt that my hon friend will take advantage of the opportunity that she have through chair the extremely important committee oversee the bbc to raise that matter with the director general again as indeed will we would say that the bbc be very good at show empty chair but there will now be empty studio if we be not careful and we certainly do not want to see the end of radio lancashire independent commission for equity in cricket report what assessment she have make of the implication for her policy of the report of the independent commission for equity in cricket entitle hold up mirror to cricket publish in june discrimination have no place in sport or wide society the icec report make for difficult reading clearly

the hold up mirror to cricket report lay bare the extent of racism sexism and classism in cricket over the past couple of year we have see scandal in cricket abuse in gymnastic whole plethora of issue unearth by the fan lead review into football and the sport of rugby union undertake review into its governance and fear that sadly there will be further such example just how confident be the minister that structure be in place to deal with inappropriate and unacceptable behaviour in sport and do he now feel that there be need to look into governance in sport more widely have make that issue priority in the time that have be in this role because it do need address hold regular meeting with the national governing body of all the sport and have lay down challenge to they we need to work

that the manchester rain hold off despite the team success on the international stage the icec report show that there be lot to do to increase diversity and participation in cricket it find that english cricket suffer from sexism elitism and racism do the government understand that they also have role to play in address those serious finding for example what discussion have the minister have

recognise that situation have just announce that we have give million and some of it be barnetted have not hear anything from the scottish government about what they be go to do for scottish charity

many of my constituent think that the bbc licence fee be an outdated regressive tax and question why they should have to fund broadcaster that they do not support and do not want to watch if formal review of the bbc funding model be indeed to take place in the autumn surely abolish the licence fee altogether have to be one of the option consider the government have make it clear that the licence fee will remain in place for the remainder of this charter period but my hon friend be right that there be challenge go forward he may be aware that the number of people pay the licence fee have fall by million in the past five year and it be therefore right that we look at possible alternative source of funding for the bbc in the long term that will be the focus of the funding review we all wish our woman team all the good down under in the world cup that start today we be all bit envious of the minister but at the same time our national team be still do battle with the football association

many other as be sure he know each province of the anglican communion be autonomous in however the primate in the anglican communion reaffirm the rejection of criminal sanction against same sex attract people and commit to respect the dignity and value of every person it be hard to see how the position take by the church of uganda align with the agreement ordination of clergy if the church

be about to be move again in yet another deckchair on the tory titanic reshuffle it be shame she be just get the hang of business question by which mean that like other tory ministers at the dispatch

coffee break and then she describe as delusional there be no hope that the government will change course year of austerity and incompetence be bake in we be talk about government who force brexit on scotland and who refuse to allow the scot even the right to choose their own future budget that tank the economy and push the pension sector to the brink of collapse an inhuman and degrading immigration regime former prime ministers who can not even remember their phone password for covid inquiry and current pm who appear to think that argue with bank on behalf of an individual be the most important thing to focus on in the midst of cost of living crisis and just day before three by election doctor nurse and teacher be all strike in england accord to the transport secretary it be

hon lady party and mine be that we honour the result of referendum know that the hon lady and her party have be campaign hard on the child policy this week so let illustrate the power and the opportunity that sit in her party hand it may interest she to know that the project black hole in the snp budget identify by the scottish fiscal commission as huge billion in the next four year be enough money not only to reverse that policy in scotland but to reverse it for the whole of the uk as minister at the department for work and pensions be amazed at the length to which the snp would go not to take control over many aspect of welfare policy that we wish to devolve to it choose instead to criticise the uk government for the decision that they be make the hon lady party be in power in scotland it pain that it be in power but it be and have be for many year so it be time that its member take some responsibility early this week in the pakistani province of sindh two hindu temple be

large organisation exclude many people who do not have broadband or mobile connection there be audible groan across the chamber at that because we all know of company that do not enable all their customer to get access to the information they need it be quite lazy one thing the government can do be ensure that we be increase competition work that the prime minister commission while he be chancellor be enable that and further competition be support by many of the bills we bring forward in this session hope that virgin media have hear what have be say on the floor of the house today and will reconsider its approach to communicate with their valuable customer the report into the north east ambulance service be now in the public domain and the department for health and social care have

our world heritage site and our quality local food and drink offering fear that we be also attractive to mps because in so many part of the northern isles they will not be bother by their mobile phone ringing it be great for holiday mp but it be bit of pain for the rest of we so when we come back in september can we have an update from her ministerial colleague on the share rural network scheme congratulate the right hon member on provide wonderful advert for any member who be not plan on holidaying in his constituency and reason why they should he raise serious matter and will certainly

community and praise it for all the work it do will my right hon friend join in congratulate darlington rotary club on its centenary and will she find time for we to have debate on the significant and tangible impact of rotary in our community across the uk my hon friend be right about the incredible contribution that rotary club make and not just to work in the uk if we be to draw up list of organisation that have help to eradicate polio around the world rotary club would be at the top of it have enable vaccination programme to take place all over the world understand that he be rotarian as be our prime minister at the same rotary club as he so think the centenary party will be quite something last week have the privilege of see the fantastic graduation show of newcastle theatre royal project which provide intensive world class affordable training for actor in the north east and newcastle also recently see the wonderful west end symphony orchestra which provide intensive one to one tuition but be about to lose its funding project be hugely over subscribed can we have debate in government time on what the government be do to ensure that the art be accessible to working class and regional talent while we be at it give that mickey mouse be probably the most valuable creation to come from an artist pen can the leader of the house tell when an art degree be mickey mouse degree say last week that the nation be not just stem powered the hon lady be great champion for that it be also steam powered the art and cultural and creative industry be incredibly important to this economy she will know that my right hon friend the secretary of state for department for culture media and sport and her predecessor have do huge amount of work to ensure that the whole of the uk get its fair share of funding to support these sector and that the enjoyment of their product be accessible to all be sure the hon lady have raise those specific project with the secretary of state if she have not have an opportunity to do that be happy to do so on her behalf she will soon be able to get clear map of all the funding that have go into her local area over many year and have see draft of the map think it be considerable although it be welcome to see school budget increase again can we look at the situation whereby school in my constituency and central bedfordshire get lot less per pupil than those just over the border in buckinghamshire and hertfordshire we be amend the police funding formula to make it fair can we please look at the same issue for school funding it really be not fair to differentiate in that way my hon friend raise very important matter and he be absolutely right we be increase per pupil funding we have introduce additional support for special educational need and we have be do lot of work in the capital programme to restore school building and enable new school to be establish however give that we be go into recess will write on his behalf to the secretary of state for education and the chancellor to ensure that they consider this matter be sure the leader of the house will agree that when minister give an undertaking in the chamber to meet with an hon member an official in the box ought to be make note and follow up that system seem to have break down and hon member staff spend an age try to chase down those in ministerial private office mr speaker be sure both you and the leader of the house will be surprised to hear that my office be recently tell that the home office switchboard have no record of the right hon member for newark robert jenrick the minister for it be not really funny clearly from what my hon friend the member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands say early this be problem affect all hon member can we have debate in government time on the quality of ministerial response to request make on the floor of this house hope the hon and learn lady know take this matter very seriously be able to get hold of people particularly during recess be extremely important if she would like to give and my office some detail about the specific issue she be try to get an answer on would be happy to follow that up and will give the home office nudge to ensure that all hon member be able to get hold of ministers during recess in particular if something should happen during the break as the government forge ahead with initiative policy and trade deal that we be unable to do when we be member of the eu would my right hon friend allow debate on brexit benefit particularly the support the uk government be give to fishing and seafood processing company and our preparedness as we take back full control of all our fishing quota in my hon friend be absolutely right one of the reason we leave the eu be to enable those opportunity across all sector but particularly fishing and food producer we negotiate successfully significant uplift in our quota share follow our exit from the eu as she well know value at about million in new fishing opportunity for the uk fleet in this year alone the uk seafood fund be invest million into the long term future of the uk fishery sector help to drive innovation support job creation and boost seafood export into new hear yell from sedentary position be not sure quite who it come from those opportunity could be maximise if the scottish government engage more with their local coastal community on their plan for protect marine area hope the leader of the house will agree that we have pretty good tradition in this country of open free democratic honest election do she share my concern that there be evidence in the recent past not just in the uk but elsewhere of malign influence on election from china from russia and even some people have say from india will she ensure that we have an early debate when the house get back since an election be imminent to look at way of protect our democracy from foreign influence of all kind this be an extremely important issue and thank the hon gentleman for raise it he will know that my right hon friend the security minister be lead taskforce design to protect and strengthen democracy primarily in the uk although it will also have benefit for other nation around the world our democracy be precious we can not take it for grant and if people start to lose trust in it the system will fail maintain that trust be one of the most important job that we have in this house and be sure that if the hon gentleman be to apply for debate it would be well attend can we have debate about law enforcement across the united kingdom the leader of the house will be aware that yesterday scotland chief constable sir iain livingstone confirm that the initial probe into snp finance look at fraud have be expand to look at possible embezzlement and misuse of fund it have already see the arrest of former first minister of scotland nicola sturgeon along with other senior snp member do the leader of the house agree that that show how serious the investigation into the snp murky finance be my hon friend question follow that ask by the hon member for huddersfield mr sheerman about trust in democracy and our institution that be incredibly important whatever our difference and whichever side of the house we sit on we should all be able to agree that trust and confidence in those system be vital that be why standard and have strong democratic institution matter we have have over police investigation into the snp the original plus that go missing have now be exceed by the in police time that have be spend on those investigation it be very sad and sorry state whatever shape future investigation take hope they be resolve swiftly because this have be sorry chapter for the first time since uk government debt have rise above of gdp with the office for national statistics reveal that net debt reach trillion as of the end of may in that context the cost of replace trident could rise to between million and million give the huge pressure on public finance will the leader of the house make statement which know my constituent in north ayrshire and arran will be very interested in set out whether she believe blank cheque for replace trident be either acceptable or sustainable in reply to the hon member for edinburgh north and leith deidre brock have already give the snp lesson in balance the book do not think this government should take any lesson from the snp government who have nearly billion between what they spend and what be in their budget in addition to understand the cost and price of everything it be also important for we in this place to understand the value of thing trident be nuclear deterrent there be no blank cheque for that nuclear deterrent but it be there do vital job if hon member can not see the merit of we have deterrent at this moment do not know that they will ever be able to grasp that any argument about the defence of this nation relate to our commitment to nato the snp purport to support that commitment but have nuclear deterrent be pretty fundamental to be member of nato if all those argument have fail in the past let try new one be sure that among the hon lady constituent she will have submariner she should ask that submariner why they be prepared to spend year of their life underwater in the service of this country these be not trivial matter and she need to grasp the reality of the situation face we many of my constituent be disappoint to see that the animal welfare kept animals bill be not take forward know that the government be still commit to enact the various provision within the bill but will the leader of the house provide timetable for that my hon friend will know that will say that further business will be announce in the usual way he be right that we be committed to the measure in that bill we think that we will be able to bring forward some of they fast use other mean such as statutory instrument rather than through the passage of the bill as previously schedule will announce business in the usual way but can give he the assurance that we be committed to those important measure which be manifesto commitment can we please have debate on the issue of tackle the trafficking of woman for sexual exploitation we know that tackle demand have to be at the heart of any strategy the organisation for security and co operation in europe have just produce country report on the uk which say with regard to prevention the uk do not appear to be take substantive step to tackle the demand that foster traffic for sexual exploitation despite the international legal obligation to do so at the home affairs committee yesterday the guard minister the hon member for derbyshire dales miss dines say for sex work the demand be there it be unfortunately part of human nature would like it to be outlaw the right hon lady raise an important matter shall certainly make sure that the home

hepatitis trust for hopefully help we to get there five year before global target this be an important matter will join my hon friend in praise the work of the hepatitis trust those target be ambitious but we be determined to smash they year early she will know that we have be do tremendous amount of work globally to combat hep as she will not have the opportunity to raise this with the secretary of state before the recess shall also make sure that he have hear her interest in this area since we have be suffer from excess death in the uk so far this year we have be see around excess mortality on weekly basis that mean that around more of our constituent be pass away each week than the five year average have be request debate on this matter regularly for the past six month to no avail can understand why the government do not wish to debate this topic but the silence from the opposition party be perplexing may ask the leader of the house when the public will get an opportunity to witness debate in this house on this issue of life and death that be affect they their friend and their family be sorry that the hon member have not be able to secure debate on this matter he be sit next to the chairman of the backbench business committee who be forever announce opportunity to secure debate perhaps if he would write to in more detail about what he have do to secure debate can advise and assist he far on may the leader of the house tell that she would again take up the matter of redundancy modification order with the department and chase up official for and perhaps suggest that the minister meet know that the leader of the house can carry great big sword do not agree with she on nuclear weapon but will she use that great big sword and poke the department because have have no response be sorry to hear that the hon lady have not have response what will do be contact the department again on her behalf in such case where the department be just not respond we will also call in the permanent secretary and will do that on this occasion will follow up this afternoon as know the house be rise today to urge they to contact the hon lady at least to give she an update on the matter when my constituent lose power scottish power transfer she on to prepayment meter as an emergency fix three month later her meter have not be repair properly cause major ramification include she falsely be contact by debt collector my constituent and my team have be in constant communication with scottishpower but the situation remain unresolved will the leader of the house ask the secretary of state for energy security and net zero to make statement on hold large energy company to account for poor customer service be very sorry to hear about that case and will of course ensure that the secretary of state have hear what the hon lady have say hopefully someone from scottishpower medium or public affair team will be tune in to the chamber and will have hear our dismay at those poor standard of customer service we hope that the situation will be rectify small business lease retail space in railway station have take financial hit as result of industrial action train operate company accept that refund for rent on strike day should be make available but say that the decision be out of their hand and that the department for transport be block the refund yet in response to recent write question the dft tell that the train operator should be deal with this matter could the leader of the house please confirm whether she expect write ministerial statement today from the transport secretary clarify the situation if not could she please write to he and ask he to intervene so that official either unblock the refund request or empower the train operate company to take this forward themselves so that small business stop get stick in the middle the hon lady have do we service by raise this matter will get on to the relevant department this afternoon and ask that it be clarify which be sure would be in the interest of all our constituent be incredibly proud that student from around the world choose to come to study in my city of dundee at one of our two world class university however the newly publish road map for scottish green industrial strategy pinpoint the failure of the uk government to support international student as one of the key impediment to build scotland green economy with some within the tory party want to go far and limit which university would be able to take in international student it look like the tory party be more interested in deport rather than develop and retain talent so can we have statement from the uk government ruling that out with commitment to do more to offer welcoming environment for student and graduate would correct the hon gentleman we have very proud record of accept international student and we do huge amount of outreach work to attract international student here we be one of the most popular place for they to study and we be do huge amount through the british council and other organisation to promote british education around the world if he have specific urge he to write to the relevant departments he can question the education secretary on october and the home secretary on september the un protocol on trafficking which have be ratify by the uk state that victim of modern slavery do not need to have be physically transport during the course of their exploitation the uk modern slavery act however require physical transportation for it to be human trafficking offence under uk law perpetrator of this heinous crime would receive far more lenient sentence than if they be charge with trafficking can we have debate in government time to discuss bring the uk definition of traffic in line with that of the un will certainly ensure that the home secretary and the ministry of justice have hear what the hon lady have raise from my experience as former secretary of state for the department for international development can tell she that we do some incredible thing around the world to combat not just crime take place in the uk or facilitate from the uk but crime where the victim be in other part of the world what our national crime agency do not just for the uk but for many nation around the world be incredibly impressive and we should be very proud of it with your indulgence madam deputy speaker may say this every week bring to business question an issue from across the world on behalf of persecute churchgoer with christian belief those with no belief or those with other belief and every week the leader of the house consistently honestly and sincerely take that matter to the relevant minister or secure meeting letter or reply that do not go unnoticed and thank she for it on behalf of people across the world who have no voice early this week isis boast about the increase attack against christians in mozambique the democratic republic of the congo nigeria and kenya the group claim that militant have plunder christian village and massacre local and that the rate of attack for the first half of be increase on the precede six month one of those example be the lhubiriha secondary school in uganda which this house discuss on june however as the leader of the house and other know that be only the tip of the iceberg with most attack receive little to no attention in the medium will the leader of the house join and other in statement condemn those attack and express solidarity with the survivor thank the hon gentleman for his very kind word with the exception of the chairman of the backbench business committee the hon member for gateshead ian mearns whom have exclude from my league table the hon gentleman have attend the most business question session of anyone in this house he do we great service because he be always raise matter that should get airtime and enable we all to send the message that we be focus on the plight of the people he mention we be deeply concerned about the recent increase in attack against christians particularly in mozambique the drc nigeria and kenya the foreign office be follow those situation very closely these attack be deplorable and the uk will continue to use its influence in the un the council of europe and elsewhere to highlight these appalling human right violation and galvanise action to protect freedom of religion and protect people who be be particularly persecute christians be prime among they tata group gigafactory investment be pleased to update the house about the significant investment announce by tata group just yesterday the confirmation that tata will be invest over billion to build new gigafactory the large in europe believe in the uk be historic moment and major vote of confidence in our automotive sector across government we have work closely with tata for the past two year to help secure this crucial investment for the uk and its decision to invest here be testament to our strong partnership with tata tata announcement represent one of the large investment we have ever see in the automotive sector and be part of new wave of investment as significant as those make in the that be help to turbocharge our transition to zero emission vehicle it will also be the group first gigafactory outside india directly create up to highly skilled new job alongside thousand of further job in the wide supply chain for battery material and critical raw material tata say that the battery gigafactory will produce high quality high performance sustainable battery cell and pack for variety of application within the mobility and energy sector as the anchor customer the new gigafactory will supply jaguar land rover future battery electric model include in the range rover defender discovery and jaguar brand that mean we will soon see car from jlr iconic british brand manufacture in the uk power by battery produce in the uk and develop use technology from research and development centre in the uk before be export to market all over the world battery production at the new facility will commence in and we look forward to confirmation of the site location once due diligence have be finalise when operational tata expect it to be one of the large building in the uk and plan to maximise its renewable energy mix with an ambition for clean power the investment be also an important reflection of the uk position as key location for european and global automotive manufacturing with an initial output of gw the new factory confirm yesterday will be one of the large in europe as well as be significant moment for the uk this investment will play an important part in strengthen economic resilience across europe in the highly integrate supply chain for the automotive sector and other key sector use the faraday institution estimate it will provide almost half of the uk require battery production by boost the battery manufacturing capacity we need to support the electric vehicle industry in the long term the government be commit to support the automotive sector and the electric vehicle supply chain to take full advantage of the move to zero emission vehicle and we be put this commitment into action through the automotive transformation fund the british industry supercharger and our strong programme of support for research and development we be work alongside industry to unlock further private investment in our ev supply chain and we have long stand and comprehensive programme of support for the automotive sector include the atf the advanced propulsion centre and of course the faraday battery challenge this investment be an important milestone in enable uk make transition to net zero however it do not stand in isolation it build on other announcement that have be secure with the support of government include nissan and envision plan to secure billion to create an ev manufacturing hub in sunderland ford commit total of million to make halewood the first ev component site in europe and stellantis invest million to transition ellesmere port to electric van manufacturing the transition to zero emission vehicle give we once in generation opportunity to shape the future of manufacturing over people be directly employ in the automotive sector and be delighted that yesterday announcement mean that thousand of new highly skilled job will be create in the next few year just for this project alone this fantastic news from tata show that the government be get behind business to unlock the barrier to growth and secure further investment and it will be real boost to the entire sector look forward to build on the momentum and continue our strong relationship with the sector so that we can move the uk forward in the race to net zero and support the delivery of the prime minister priority to grow the economy commend this statement to the house thank the minister for advance sight of the statement anyone who care about and have knowledge of the automotive sector know how important these battery factory be to the future of the uk without battery be make here it be unlikely there will be long term future for automotive production in this country and for too long the uk have be far behind where we need to be therefore everyone should welcome this news and breathe huge sigh of relief that we finally have positive development in all the urgent question debate and statement we have have this be what we have be call for however this relief should also come with the humility to appreciate that there be still great deal to do if this factory proceed as plan the uk will have gwh of capacity by but at that point germany would have over gwh hungary over gwh and china over gwh therefore hope there be resolve in government to make sure that this be just one of several major announcement of this kind of course to secure this investment substantial amount of public money have have to be spend the minister do not actually reference that can she provide some clarity on the medium report we have see about how much exactly that will amount to this approach of use public investment to leverage in much great degree of private investment be the approach that we have advocate in labour green prosperity plan government ministers have at time publicly disagree with this proposal but we always know they be in talk that involve the same approach therefore put it to the minister that it would be far well to set out that government approach openly transparently and honestly in order to attract more potential partner and be able to negotiate from strong position some might call this an industrial strategy because the truth be that the uk be desperate for this announcement if it have go to another country such as spain thing would have look very bleak indeed that be why we be all so relieved but that be not if we be frank the optimum negotiating position to find ourselves in can also ask the minister about local content crucial to our future success be build up domestic supply chain for these factory will the government be specify minimum percentage of local content require by this factory in order to receive the generous subsidy that have be agree in addition will the government be encourage the development of advanced battery chemistry in the uk to aid domestic job creation but also to limit any risk from geopolitical event that have the potential to disrupt supply chain in future we also need to consider this announcement alongside the wide policy environment for automotive in the uk specifically the rule of origin requirement under the trade and co operation agreement and the government phase out of internal combustion engine from even with this welcome announcement these timescale look incredibly tight do not believe anyone can seriously countenance tariff on vehicle export to the eu which would be the outcome of fail to meet the rule of origin requirement can the minister update we on progress towards deal can the minister also update the house on the government position on the phase out timetable be she aware of concern that maintain that timescale without sufficient domestic production effectively mean only chinese vehicle stand any chance of meet consumer demand in the short term surely we should be think holistically about the whole sector it be not about different level of ambition just query as to the good way to get there finally can ask the minister about industrial energy price so much of the transition to net zero require more competitive industrial price than the uk currently have we know that have be and be material factor in the deal so can the minister say whether precedent have now be set that will have consequence for other sector such as steel if deal be strike for their decarbonisation in conclusion repeat my welcome of this announcement welcome the government conversion to labour way of thinking hope it be sign of many more good thing to come warmly welcome the government decision and the announcement by tata which highlight the uk tech potential order beg the right hon gentleman forgiveness be be distract by another right hon gentleman who ought to know well and therefore do not call the minister to answer do apologise think maybe we get bit noisy as we be try to fully digest the slightly delusional response of the opposition front bencher the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds to this statement our job as representative of the automotive sector be to praise protect and promote not to play politic especially with investment this substantial tata investment be so substantial it be of the gigawatt that we need and fundamentally we need to have by with tata and envision we be two third of the way there obviously we want more but we be not go to be complacent we should not compare ourselves with the rest of europe when their need will be substantially different from our but let we take moment to reflect on what be happen internationally this be global race to achieve net zero tata have decide to come here to the uk because it have faith in uk worker uk technology and uk innovation it have confidence in the uk supply chain but fundamentally it have confidence in the uk government policy when it come to advanced manufacturing and the automotive sector the hon gentleman speak about the automotive transformation fund which be billion fund to support exactly this sort of initiative but let we just reflect on the bonanza be not sure that be the right term that the opposition be offer it be billion in their plan which be lot of money for the taxpayer to front up for an un cost plan that as far as be aware be not endorse by anyone in the advanced manufacturing sector and what they want to achieve as we be get close to our summer holiday the billion of un cost promise that the opposition be make be bit like line in the sand we can look down at they but the tide of reality will come in the opposition proposal mean nothing to industry or to job creation they be create within the westminster bubble interruption if the opposition do not believe they should listen to the society of motor manufacturers and traders the umbrella organisation for the automotive sector it have talk about the substance in the uk supply chain which will be part of this initiative go forward unlike anywhere else in europe we have fantastic supply chain with graphene silicon carbide wafer be learn so much power electronic battery and powertrain it be substantial boost to our supply chain in the uk as the hon gentleman know be work not only on our critical mineral strategy but on our supply strategy to make sure we be use uk innovation and uk good across all our supply chain and in particular in the automotive sector urge he to have some humility and to reverse and to praise promote and protect the sector and definitely not to play politic with it that be very weak thing to do there be challenge deal with the rule of origin as the hon gentleman know not only the prime minister but the secretary of state be in intensive talk with the european union this be an issue not just for the uk it be also about car make in the eu be transport into the uk it be two way system urge everybody in the house who have contact with european counterpart to ensure that they make it very clear that this will be damaging for european car manufacturer as well let turn to the zero emission vehicle mandate have take many delegation to the department for transport which be responsible for this bit of policy and be keen to back business the consultation have conclude and result will come through and we will continue to work with the dft my position have always be to back the automotive sector the hon member for stalybridge and hyde do not seem to appreciate how substantial the investment be we should be focus on the billion the job and the resilience in the supply chain the small firm across most of our constituency that will be get some support because of this fantastic confidence in the uk car and automotive sector and fundamentally in uk policy when it come to advanced manufacturing and now call dominic raab warmly welcome the government announcement and tata decision which highlight the tech potential of the uk do the minister agree that our long term strategy as think she be set out be that we will not be able to engage in bidding war on subsidy with the us china and the eu and that our comparative advantage will be shore up the supply chain in the context of ev battery which mean lithium deposit in the south west and our emerge refinement capacity in teesside warmly welcome my right hon friend statement and agree with every single point he make he mention the lithium mine in cornwall which will eventually produce enough lithium for electric car and vehicle there be such success for our supply chain because this government have strategy that be embed in the real world politic of deal with the automotive sector and our critical mineral refresh be exactly the support require for the lithium mine in cornwall it be not just about the financial support it be also about the ecosystem fundamentally the organisation have faith in initiative such as the faraday battery challenge the advanced propulsion centre and the tech in the uk all the component that be require be here in the uk and we have be able to link that ecosystem and supply chain together which give tata the confidence to come and build the big gigafactory in europe here in the uk thank the minister for her statement and early sight of it agree that battery manufacturing capacity be important as part of our move towards evs away from petrol and diesel vehicle and towards all our target to achieve net zero it would be remiss of not to mention that few year ago as be sure the minister recall dundee be give the most ev visionary city in europe award by the world electric vehicle association in japan let turn to the statement itself billion or so investment by tata that good substantial investment by envision in battery production in sunderland plus the other investment the minister mention be of course all welcome yet that be broadly comparable sum around billion to the investment in the ev charge network we have be promise by do the minister think we be on track to have the right balance between investment in the supply chain and battery production capacity and in the ev charge network that network be where most driver intersect with the system and it be the large cause of frustration when it do not work or break down do not think it get any more positive from the snp on this point be pleased that the right hon gentleman welcome the billion investment and the more than job and the confidence we have in the advanced manufacturing sector in the uk that be such positive response to what this government have be able to achieve be not aware of the dundee point but will go away and look it up so many people have be responsible for get this project over the line and so many have be campaign for gigafactorie in particular my hon friend the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger have be campaign for gigafactorie for long than have be in parliament so huge thank go to he and to everyone else who help to get this project over the line on charge point as the minister of state department for transport my right hon friend the member for hereford and south herefordshire jesse norman say in last week debate on the automotive sector chargeuk have commit to invest more than billion in the development and operation of charge infrastructure before we hear in that debate that some colleague feel the investment in their constituency be not substantial enough we need to make sure that as demand for ev vehicle grow there have be much more demand and many more sale recently the charge infrastructure stand up to that as the minister responsible for the automotive sector know we be do everything we can to fulfil our part of the bargain as it be but we need to make sure that charge infrastructure be roll out as fast as it can be substantial target be be meet and the transport minister be keen to take up constituency case to make sure that the roll out be fast as it can be be absolutely delighted by this announcement number of my constituent work in the vauxhall van factory in luton which make fantastic vivaro van that we want to get electrify will the minister say little more about how we complete the final piece of the picture so that every car plant in the uk be reassure that there will be uk make battery yesterday announcement be fantastic but one or two of we be concerned about that last piece hope to get an invitation to visit that plant and my hon friend constituency and will of course do my good to promote vauxhall van what be really exciting about this initiative be that it be about produce battery not just for jlr but for the whole market which be crucial with the tata and envision gigafactorie we be two third of the way to get to the gw that the faraday challenge believe we need we be not complacent and be still go to do everything we can to secure further investment and seek further growth in this area but for the moment we need to accept that this gigafactory could have go anywhere in europe and there be huge talk about where it be go to be but tata have confidence in the uk and decide to come home to we may say madam deputy speaker what pleasure it be to see you back in the chair on regular basis wish you and everybody else who work in parliament very good recess when it come this be very welcome announcement tata be good company and this be big day and big announcement of course this investment should have be in huddersfield would say that would we have wonderful engineering skillset do not want to be downer but warn the minister of this by the time building work on the canal system be finish everybody have lose their shirt on their investment because the railway come unexpectedly and all the investment be wipe out have recently visit jcb which have develop hydrogen power vehicle will the minister make sure that the government focus equally on hydrogen many of we believe that rather like the railway and the canal hydrogen will come almost out of the blue and be the major much more sustainable future mode of transport the hon member be absolutely right that huddersfield be great place we be not complacent if the right opportunity investment and partnership be put forward we will of course consider that we want to make sure that we continue to grow our gigafactory capacity know that the hon member be go to touch on hydrogen which he talk about often the work we be do with the atf be not just about electric vehicle but about how we adopt all new function technology to get to the first stage of zero emission and then to the next stage and so on there be opportunity for hydrogen project to come forward just few week ago visit major construction project where not only the vehicle on site building and develop the port and the infrastructure be go to be hydrogen but the vehicle move on and off the site be to be well hydrogen be very much in our sight too warmly welcome this announcement do my hon friend agree that it show this government commitment to real and tangible green investment in the crucial automotive industry in its supply chain and in many connected business throughout the uk include the environmentally exemplary forward think transport logistic company in my constituency brit european brit european sound like one of the firm need to meet no doubt my hon friend will invite to visit and look forward to meet the firm with she she be absolutely right this be huge vote of confidence in our ability to adopt new technology to achieve net zero it be not just about find and secure new source of critical mineral we be at the leading edge of battery recycling too the uk battery industrialisation centre will help we to stay at the forefront of recycling my constituent be desperate to embrace the transition to electric vehicle whether car van or bus but electric car remain far too expensive and the charge infrastructure barely exist and where it do exist it be not reliable although investment be welcome we need consistent strategy if the government be serious about reach net zero urge the minister to look again at reintroduce incentive to take up electric vehicle will she consider give local authority statutory responsibility to roll out with pandemic style urgency the ev charge structure that we so desperately need when the council in my constituency be conservative lead it have substantial charging point infrastructure roll out plan which it have secure itself when council be ambitious it be amazing how much work can be do we know that sale of electric vehicle be up as be ev export and manufacturing and price will come down as more come on the market be slightly anxious about the sort of incentive the hon lady be ask for if it mean just another extra cost to the average taxpayer we have really good charge infrastructure and fantastic supply chain as this investment increase confidence in our supply chain manufacturing will continue to increase and the car will become even more attractive my constituent like her want to leave lean and greener footprint on the earth this be fantastic news for the uk economy with thousand of skilled job and investment in the transition to low carbon future do my hon friend agree that while labour continue its rather odd tribute act to new labour and the like of lord prescott who famously have two jag it be the conservatives who be deliver inward investment in our country and the uk car industry that will deliver much more have learn that it be not good use of one time to focus on what the opposition be offer because they turn so quickly by the time one have close the book they have just publish they have change their mind let we not fret about that my hon friend be absolutely right investment in the automotive sector be on fantastic trajectory with not just this commitment but those from stellantis ford envision and nissan that be because we have really stellar agenda on how we create and adopt new technology to ensure that advanced manufacturing in the uk compete internationally as we do with steel include by help with high energy cost which be now come down we work hand in glove with the industry we do not sit around in westminster bubble create new budget that be completely uncosted and endorse by no one in the sector yesterday and today news be fantastic for the automotive sector too welcome the announcement genuinely do but we be mile behind european competitor some of that be brexit relate but mainly it be due to the lack of an industrial strategy which be even more important in the net zero relate sector this government be mile behind right across the ev sector other country be ramp up incentive but this government be slash they as result sale be plateaue the charge network outside london be postcode lottery with some place charge desert scotland have strategy from day one that be why we have twice as many rapid charger per head than even london when will the government treat this issue with appropriate urgency be afraid the hon gentleman be just wrong first car sale be up car manufacturing be up and car export even into europe be up be not sure what his view be he welcome the billion investment to create the large gigafactory in europe but just can not bring himself to dwell on the good news it bring to so many of his business that will no doubt be involve in the supply chain help we to deliver the car that will now have uk make battery like so many welcome this statement it provide an incredible positive message for the uk and for the way we be attract business of the right sort however we must remember that there be an exist motor supply chain and it will be take on many challenge as the industry move across from what we have now into the electric market one of the supplier in that market space be gestamp in newton aycliffe it supply motor manufacturer all over the world and be tremendous company the minister have be ask for invitation to visit other business so invite she to come and see gestamp and to have good conversation about the way the supply chain be be impact by these tremendous investment my hon friend be such champion of the business in his constituency may provide he with some confidence secure this investment be about provide assurance to everyone in the supply chain that there be now big game for they to play there will be far more production sale and obviously work for they to do my hon friend have invite previously it be an outstanding engagement and look forward to visit he shortly chair the automotive council so meet lot of small and medium sized enterprise but if have not already meet the firm he mention suggest he give my private office little nudge and will make sure correspond with the firm shortly by germany be set to have time more battery capacity than the uk while the us be set to have time more capacity welcome yesterday announcement of tata group investment in uk gigafactory but will the minister confirm exactly how the government plan to ensure that this will be just the first not the last such announcement the hon gentleman have do his homework but the most important point he need to remember be that to meet our demand in the uk we need gw that be not decision we have take it be piece of work do by the faraday institution compare we with the usa or germany do not really work well because we be try to deal with the manufacturing that we have in the uk so we need gw this announcement provide gw and we have gw with envision and nissan which may go up to gw if they wish to expand potentially we be two third of the way there but we do not want to be complacent when draw international comparison we have to ask how many of the country whether the usa or germany be two third of the way to meet their battery need this be of course not the first or the second step because we have nissan already with envision but yesterday announcement be substantial and we will of course continue to go forward it show huge confidence in the uk supply chain and will no doubt attract further investment this be absolutely fantastic news for the uk much of the supply chain in east lancashire can grow far and fast with government commercialisation and focused investment and support will my hon friend confirm that the government be commit to make the uk lead player in the whole of the ev battery space and that they will work with business such as emerson and renwick in hyndburn and haslingden to support growth in the supply chain my hon friend be true champion of her constituency and all the firm within it be keen catch up with she now we know we have this fantastic deal and to see what more we can do for the many firm in her constituency we want to make sure that everybody in the supply chain can be involve in this programme of work as it come through we have number of initiative whether it be the automotive transformation fund or the faraday challenge to ensure that we be do everything we can to adopt the new set of technology rule and de risk any new technology that firm have in place at the moment we think that that will boost small firm but of course if we can involve any more we will do that and look forward to sit down with my hon friend and see what more we can do for her constituent of course this new gigafactory announcement be very welcome but it have take time how will it impact the industrial energy price the minister have not answer that question and we know that that price be barrier to decarbonisation and that address it will ensure the transition to net zero and low energy bill which need to be prioritise across all sector and industry in our transition as result of putin invasion of ukraine and high energy price we introduce substantial programme to give energy intensive firm the support that they need the next phase of that be the energy supercharger which as the hon lady will know the secretary of state for energy security and net zero have be talk about we know that energy price will fall in the near future and that there will be change in the mix of energy cost tata come to the uk not only because it be obviously the good place in which to build gigafactory and have fantastic skillset but because we could offer competitive energy price we have have conversation about that with number of firm and investor when energy price be high and we be deal with energy intensive industry we make sure that we provide the necessary support to protect those firm and their employee thank the minister for her statement and welcome tata investment the adam smith institute have say that secure sustainable foreign direct investment be fantastic but that the uk should also be introduce supply side reform so that we can continue to champion carbon reduction on global scale in the light of that what step be minister take to introduce supply side reform be work with most industry representative to establish what we can do about the supply side not just through reform but by give they the assurance accessibility and resilience that they need to get their product into the country and continue manufacture whether in the chemical or the aviation sector we be work closely with industry and hope to present supply side input strategy by the autumn have press the minister many time for support to enable good skilled job in the automotive sector and supply chain to be retain in the uk include those at vauxhall in my constituency to which she be obviously welcome to pay visit at any time may now press she to tell we how many public money or subsidy arrangement have be enter into by the government to support tata welcome choice of the uk for its gigafactory if she be coy about answer that question may also ask how much of the billion automotive transformation fund be leave to support exist business such as stellantis also in luton south know that visit to luton south be outstanding and hope that we can secure date soon the hon lady have ask very good and clever question as she have say the atf amount to billion and in due course with due diligence the commitment from tata will be make public however the number on which we should focus be these tata be invest billion to build europe large gigafactory which be guarantee to create more than job and support potentially firm in the supply chain those be the number that we should be proud of today have secure such stellar investment in sector that all of we in the chamber because we be here on thursday afternoon clearly wish to protect and promote we win this investment over any other european country tata could have go anywhere but it come here because it have confidence in our worker our company and our ecosystem thank the minister for make such positive statement everyone be enthral by the announcement that tata be to invest billion in an electric car battery manufacturing site in somerset which be wonderful news for commerce and job in the uk not to mention our contribution to the commitment make at and but can the minister tell we whether site outside england will be consider in the future it be say that four battery factory be need have the minister consider or be she consider northern ireland as one of those location with the aim of boost commerce in all region of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be committed to that aim and know that the minister be it be good to know that we can all gain advantage from this it be great that we have major commitment to one of the big gigafactorie in europe that will generate even more investment and more interest in build gigafactorie in the uk we will of course consider all proposal for site that be bring forward by commercial partner who see value in building gigafactorie in the uk this commitment shore up what we have take we towards where we need to be in and will

opportunity to raise whole range of issue and with your patience madam deputy speaker will do that last month mark the sixth anniversary of the grenfell tower tragedy be certain that colleague will remember that night with great sadness and know that many of they share my desire to see lesson learn from that tragic evening and to ensure that constituent in building with similar cladding and fire safety issue be protect from physical risk and financial burden in the six year that have pass series of ministers have make bold statement about protect leaseholder from the cost that those leaseholder might incur in protect themselves even today hundred of my constituent and equal number of constituent in nearly every urban constituency be live in limbo those affect be predominantly in property that be under metre high which the government deem not to require survey though mortgage company conveyancer and insurance company most certainly do constituent in defective building be suffer from cocktail of potential danger and they have no funding or recourse to remedy and no ability to pay for the work require to move or to move on with their life there be complete imbalance between the power of the freeholder and that of the leaseholder and tenant the government continue to make positive statement but be afraid that they continue to let down many hundred of my constituent on more positive note have be delighted to learn of the continuation of funding for the next month for the special school eye care service small pilot of that service be run across the country be delighted to visit the service in action at the excellent gibside school in my gateshead constituency urge the government to commit to national roll out of the service in the long term it be service for visually impair child with special educational need and disability for whom it be difficult at the good of time to get accurate eye test and spectacle be also delighted to report to the house that the state of the art conference facility earmark for site in the heart of gateshead close to the baltic centre for contemporary art the sage gateshead which be our regional music centre and of course the gateshead millennium bridge will begin construction in the autumn hope that over the course of the next year many member will have the opportunity to see gateshead in all its glory at this brand new facility want to take moment to recognise the groundbreaking district heating system develop by gateshead council in my constituency the system supply many household and business in the centre of gateshead and be continually expand the system operate use natural gas but there be plan in the near future to convert the plant to use the heat of mine water use the north east proud industrial heritage to generate clean energy for the people of gateshead as we continue to deal with the climate crisis be sure that all member will commend gateshead council cut edge investment in clean power and energy efficiency be afraid that that mark the end of the more upbeat chapter of my speech have long campaign against the council tax system which believe have be unfit for purpose from the outset we all breathe sigh of relief when we get rid of the poll tax but my constituency have among the high council tax rate in the country despite feature highly on every single measure of poverty and need the system hand huge financial advantage to authority whose property be above band on average by their very nature such authority be often in the more affluent area of the country conversely area such gateshead have council tax base make up almost exclusively of band and band property couple with the removal of the majority of the revenue support grant gateshead council have have to hike council tax rate to fill some of the gap want to draw this house attention to local government finance more broadly gateshead council annual budget have be almost halve in real term since hugely reduce the council ability to maintain vital and good quality public service that be happen despite significant hike in demand for adult social care and child social service this summer two of the six public leisure centre in gateshead will close as the council battle with huge hole in its budget in the face of rise cost and need the area of high deprivation and poverty be see council tax rate skyrocket while service plummet we in gateshead be watch the gap between wealthy and less wealthy area widen rapidly we be pay far more for service that be mere shadow of their former self while people in many area of the south east pay much less for far more no government should be take decision that make the life of ordinary people more arduous difficult and poverty stricken this can not be allow to continue gateshead have proud track record of offer safe haven for those seek protection from some of the bad regime and war tear area around the world regularly meet family who have settle in gateshead and now call it home but also meet many family and individual who be the opposite of settle many of they have be in the united kingdom for year many be still wait for decision on their application many have skill and quality that our community and our economy urgently require the late figure from the home office demonstrate the disgraceful scale of the problem as of march this year asylum application be await their first decision and have be ongoing for more than month it be desperately worry that the number of people wait for decision have grow exponentially from in to in the government must get grip on this crisis as matter of urgency yet they appear to be use the figure to justify an incredibly troubling policy direction the majority of those people have flee some of the bad tragedy in our world and our community be well for have they finally let turn to couple of more topical issue just this week follow bbc investigation it have be reveal that more than current or former worker for the mcdonald fast food chain many of they vulnerable young people have complain of instance of allege sexual harassment relate to sexual assault of racism and six of homophobia that be very poor employment record for any employer no one should go to work have to run the gauntlet of sexual assault or harassment or discrimination on the ground of their race gender or sexuality declare an interest because these allegation be bring to light follow tireless campaign work by the bakers food and allied workers union whose parliamentary group chair mcdonald have allow sexual assault bullying harassment and racism to happen on its watch but while all that have be happen on its premise it have steadfastly ensure that one kind of activity certainly be not allow trade union activity worker be prevent from get together to protect themselves from some of the bad excess of an employer that have clearly be turn blind eye to all sort of nastiness on its premise it be necessary but not enough to look at whether any law or guidance have be breach here as the tuc general secretary paul nowak have say all the guideline and indeed law in the world count for little if worker do have access to strong independent union this be not just matter of toxic culture develop inside one company mcdonald this kind of abuse result from power differential arise from situation where vulnerable young worker often on zero hour contract be desperate for shift and therefore dependent on the largesse of their manager it be critical that the next labour government act to ban the use of zero hour contract and ensure that trade union have statutory right of access to workplace in order to communicate to worker and free they from the anti union monger of their employer finally note my entry in the register of members financial interests as chair of the rmt parliamentary group want to say that our public transport network have be dismantle and decimate by the patchwork quilt of private operating company run train and bus for shareholder profit not for passenger service if as country and government we be remotely serious about tackle climate change and lethally poor air quality in some place we must urgently address the inadequate and for too many community non existent public transport network the most recent decision to close almost all ticket office across the country show once again that this government be intent on run our vital infrastructure simply as profit make entity although it be shroud in the pretence of offer great accessibility to staff it be clear to and many of my constituent that it be nothing more than naked attempt to cut cost sack hard work staff reduce access for the frail disabled and vulnerable and bolster profit not only will it have negative impact across the network it will have an exclusionary impact on those who be not able to use smartphone or to see or properly access automatic ticket machine or who have significant disability and accessibility issue good quality affordable and reliable public transport be the backbone of any modern and high perform economy but for too many year we have see that vital public infrastructure chop up and sell off hand to company with neither any experience nor any interest in operate for the public or economic good of the country which carve out profit at the expense of their staff their customer and the local and regional economy then hand back the rein when they have squeeze out every last drop of profit that be why network rail london north eastern railway northern and transpennine express be all now in public ownership we have see cut to service cut to staff and cut to maintenance yet huge increase in price cancellation and delay with taxpayer many of whom have no access to any of these service foot the bill for the government largesse we must put an end to this go round and return to run our public transport in the public interest may apologise to you madam deputy speaker to the chair of the backbench business committee the hon member for gateshead ian mearns and to all member have not miss sir david amess adjournment debate in year be sorry

the hon member for gateshead ian mearns for his work with on the high speed rail london west midlands bill committee long time ago for nearly two year and for the exemplary way in which he and his committee run the backbench business committee all who come to make application be grateful for the serious consideration give by member of that committee and the way they manage to schedule so many debate that be of interest to our constituent and important to the nation and that give mp the chance to say what they want to say be afraid that can not be here for the wind up speech at because today be the day of st margaret of antioch the patron saint of st margaret church westminster across the road from here as parliamentary warden will be at that service want the minister to get other together and have meeting with and representative of the former sergeant gurpal virdi an excellent police officer in my previous constituency represent the family of stephen lawrence after he have be attack one police officer in that investigation do well many other do not there be similar attack not fatal one on foreign student in ealing gurpal virdi leave his police station find two of the suspect find the attack weapon and go to see the family later on he ask whether the attack have be record as potentially racist when he come back from holiday his home be turn over by terrorist search squad because he be think to have send message to himself say you not want here national front he be sikh and that message be also receive by other minority ethnic officer there be no need to take too many note because most of this be record in book he have publish call behind the blue line contribute one of the foreword and the other one be contribute by dr richard stone the jewish human right doctor who be one of the adviser on macpherson stephen lawrence inquiry both richard stone and know what we be write about and we know gurpal virdi gurpal virdi manage to get out of the difficulty that some people in the police be put on he he be later commend by bernard hogan howe when deputy commissioner one of his task in the police be work in the battersea police station when one of the sergeant be cressida dick people who have be at the top of the metropolitan police service have know about he and his case for long time in write to the metropolitan police commissioner the director of public prosecutions and the home secretary explain why the propose prosecution of gurpal virdi for what be originally describe as indecently assault someone under the age of in police van in be an impossible prosecution and should not go ahead the prosecution do go ahead and after week and half trial in southwark crown court end on july the jury take about minute to come back to court with their conclusion if we allow they minute to get back to the jury room five minute to go to the rest room five minute to have discussion and minute to get back to the court we can see how long it take they to decide that the case be not proper one to have be bring and to establish his innocence then ask whether the police could review how the prosecution happen also ask the crown prosecution service and the attorney general how it happen what be now the independent office for police conduct put to the metropolitan police the question of whether it have act properly the metropolitan police refer that to its directorate of professional standard most case of historical sex abuse be investigate by the sapphire group but it be not interested in this it have pass it to the directorate of professional standard who be the people who actually do the investigation when the iopc or whatever it be call in those day refer it to they the directorate of professional standard come to the conclusion there nothing wrong here be go to spell out briefly some of the thing that be wrong first the metropolitan police and the cps hold press briefing announce that gurpal virdi have assault somebody under the age of they have know from the day after they start investigate that the complainant be over they accuse gurpal virdi of use collapsible police baton up the bottom of this young man when there be another police officer in the back of the van and another in the front they have never find the driver and the person they believe be the other person in the van deny there be an assault secondly they say the arrest be make in different place from where the complainant say it happen thirdly they say it be different kind of police van fourthly they say there be no serious assault and most importantly that there be no collapsible police truncheon or baton that be not big surprise because the allege event be in and collapsible police baton be issue in year later this case be supervise by gold group at scotland yard so we be talk about senior officer with the cps how do they manage not to notice that the case be impossible could go on at great length but make this point through the minister to those responsible when we have this meeting would like they to explain how the prosecution manage to avoid pay any attention to the only documentary evidence that be leave gurpal virdi notebook have be take by the police and destroy what be available be conviction notice in the lambeth east juvenile court from spring about the complainant he have be arrest month before by an officer with gurpal virdi the complainant never mention that arrest which definitely do take place he have make up nonsense about the time he be arrest in the autumn of but there be no evidence whatsoever that gurpal virdi be involve other officer be name the officer in charge be name but he make no statement when ask he say know nothing about it if the complainant think that he have be mistreat by gurpal virdi in the autumn of one would expect that he would have mention that at the time of his arrest which certainly do happen in the spring of he do not mention it at all the investigate officer do not even interview the other police officer who be know to have be part of that arrest that be the level of either incompetence or target of good police officer that we be see here want the police the iopc the cps and ministers to get together in meeting preferably with gurpal virdi and his lawyer matt foot of birnberg peirce to go through what need to be establish so that people can have confidence in the metropolitan police in the future if they decline that confidence be not go to return we have all hear sir mark rowley speak recently about historical thing that he be go to put right and about the officer he say he do not want to keep in his force many of those involve in what have be talk about will have retire wish they no ill but want to know that no other person like gurpal virdi one of the good people have know can be subject to something like the early incident with the racist material he do not produce or be put through totally bogus charge after they have retire all the evidence available show that he be not involve and that the crime do not happen and could not have happen be not satisfied and will not be therefore if have to come back this time next year for another adjournment debate will but will name name will name the name of every officer involve everyone involve in the crime prosecution service and the other would prefer not to do so would prefer to get this sort out believe that if the commissioner agree with the iopc and the cps they could get two people to look together at what be available and what happen they could then produce report the metropolitan police could then say that they have learn the lesson and if they feel like it apologise to gurpal virdi for the third time it be pleasure to rise today to speak once again in the aptly name sir david amess summer adjournment debate although we sit on opposite side of the house the one thing that he and have in common be our fierce passion for the community that we

over the last year we have see some real progress and that be largely thank to all those who be campaign so vehemently at grassroot level awareness be be raise we now have prepayment certificate

far away from here and rattle through or different individual case do not intend to try to emulate he in that congratulate my friend on harrow council the new conservative lead council who have get to grip with the labour overspending and disastrous service that have go on for more than year the administration have have to get to grip with provide decent service and deal with budget that be not properly construct in local government ridiculous bureaucratic situation can arise and will mention one case one of my erstwhile constituent have be transfer from harrow council to bournemouth christchurch and poole council under current legislation bournemouth christchurch and poole council do not have to take up the case of this vulnerable individual so we be leave with the ludicrous position where harrow council be try to provide care and fund someone who be literally mile away that to be something that we need to consider and to fix let move on to the key issue of the day the ridiculous decision by the mayor of london to expand the ultra low emission zone to outer london the judicial review take place on july the mayor be currently do everything he can to distract everyone from the disastrous expansion we be wait for the result of that review and the judge in the case have agree to try to get the review announce by july the mayor be now recruit propaganda specialist to promote the scheme at salary of he might actually just withdraw the scheme and let we get on with our life even labour mp in london be now turn on the expansion the labour candidate in the uxbridge by election be apparently in favour of ulez then he be against it and now he have be kidnap by his labour minder in case he actually speak to voter about the subject the mayor completely ignore resident view as of the population of outer london be against ulez start petition in my constituency against it which more than people have already sign be look forward to the judge strike down the position so that we can get back to consultation and turn the mayoral election next year into referendum on ulez the key be that nurse or clean work night shift and on much low income than most of society will have to pay to get to and from work if they start their shift at pm and finish at am they pay twice in order to get to and from work there be not even an option to use public transport because there be no service at am and frankly transport for london be frequently on strike anyway the mayor be true snollygoster unfortunately he have dreadful dealing with tfl especially on the metropolitan line which run through part of my constituency in more than one in seven train be cancel bear in mind that many of the station that we be talk about in outer london receive only one train every minute that mean that many commuter wait up to an hour or more just to get to and from home be very disappointed that tfl continue to disrupt the service by strike it be cause havoc for traveller who need to get to work hospital school and so on hope that rather than take strike action next week and labour colleague join the picket line we can engage in sensible discussion and get everyone back to work as fast as possible there be truly ridiculous proposal which have astonish even concern cluster of high rise building in edgware technically it be in the neighbouring borough and constituency but on small site there be plan for one block of storey and five other block of storey that will totally change edgware town centre morph it into canary wharf twin and overwhelm the infrastructure it will affect my constituency as well to make matter bad the construction will take more than four year kill the business and small and medium sized enterprise already on the high street be pleased that my constituent be respond to my consultation on that and so far be totally opposed after long and challenging selection process be delighted that the former leader of harrow council councillor susan hall have be select as the conservative candidate to become the next mayor of london next year she have track record of make sadiq khan feel very uncomfortable have be leader of the city hall conservatives since before stand down to focus on the mayoralty many of we will have watch the debate that she have have with sadiq khan often knock he off his pre write script and expose his failure to tackle issue head on the vision be very clear london be safe with susan as the mayor of london be also the police and crime commissioner be confident that she will bring to the role exactly what she be promise as the chair of the greater london authority police and crime committee she will reverse ulez on day one and invest million in the metropolitan police carry on the good news be pleased that stefan voloseniuc who be good friend of mine have be select as the conservative party candidate for brent and harrow which be currently represent by labour ulez back krupesh hirani stefan emanate from romania and we have very large romanian population in north west london include adult of romanian extraction in my constituency alone clearly it be great to see people from romania take an active part and be sure that stefan will be an excellent candidate for we in my position as chairman of the all party parliamentary group on israel be concerned that there have be lot of false and misleading propaganda both in parliament and online regard the recent counter terrorism operation in the jenin camp we should be clear that the jenin camp be be use as base for terrorist organisation and use to orchestrate attack against innocent civilian the israel defence forces have act on precise intelligence information and directly target terrorist organisation indeed during the operation several hundred improvise explosive device and thousand of grenade be discover and even holy site such as the al nasr mosque have be find with pile of ammunition and explosive device the idf neutralise conceal ied in densely populate area clearly highlight the extraordinary terrorist activity in the area and be sure that the israeli security force will continue to combat the threat of terrorism one of the area have be particularly active on in this parliament have be the holocaust memorial and learn centre be pleased that the holocaust memorial bill have pass on second reading and now go on to the select committee stage be grateful to the whips for appoint to the committee to examine this be not sure that will be feel grateful by the end of september but we will wait and see this will act as memorial to commemorate the man woman and child who be lose during the war it will also be an education and learning centre with an accurate account of this slice of history with testimony from british perspective on the islamic revolutionary guard corps in iran the position in iran remain at critical stage there have be progress from the government on tough sanction but frankly it be not enough we must proscribe the irgc in its entirety it be terrorist organisation and should be highlight as such the jewish chronicle have highlight the fact that uk university have fund drone research which be transfer to iranian university and use directly to produce drone these be then transfer to the russians to combat the ukrainians whom we support and we salute their brave war against the illegal invasion by russia do my hon friend agree with that academic need to recognise that they do not live in status free of geopolitic and national security we need to see prosecution bring against some of those academic because they break sanction legislation evade sanction and help undermine sanction if we see that we may finally see academia recognise that it can not continue to partner with the chinese communist party military organisation or iranian military organisation academic must recognise that unfortunately in some situation they be aid those who would undermine our national security thank my hon friend for that intervention and agree completely move on briefly be delighted that my supported housing regulatory oversight bill be pass and have in fact receive royal assent it have be long journey and would like to thank everyone involve include crisis ministers stakeholder and council now we will get on with regulate the rogue and force they out of their unfair treatment of vulnerable people on the india trade deal hope we will see it come out very quickly lot of progress have be make but we still have not get to the final trade deal on smoking yesterday it

party parliamentary group on smoking and health which chair at the event dr javed khan the public health minister my hon friend the member for harborough neil and other include the opposition spokesman the hon member for denton and reddish andrew gwynne speak extremely well however we be not go to hit the target unless prompt action be take swiftie everywhere will be delighted that martyn

without its now namesake and star contributor sir david amess he be certainly hard act to follow and even in his absence today that remain the case he be an exceptional mp someone who show great kindness as know he do for many colleague there be lot of thing want to speak about the first be case that be open by my office in august follow the withdrawal from afghanistan my constituent be desperately try to help his young wife leave kabul speak about this case many time in the chamber she be the daughter of translator who work for the allied troop and be in immeasurable danger there be some case that you can not help but form an emotional attachment to and for my team this be one of they as such when we find out last month that the young woman have finally reach scotland after almost two year countless letter to countless ministers and hundred of call to uk visas and immigration there be enormous relief have take many an opportunity in this place to criticise the home office and its process but today want to give some praise the change to an account management system for members have transform the relationship my team have with the department with open and honest dialogue about case now be the norm be grateful that the majority of case my team take to the home office these day be resolve within reasonable timeframe the thing about casework be that member never know what be go to land on their desk next some case be straightforward some be frustrating to resolve and some be little bizarre but every single one of they relate to real person face real problem that be have detrimental effect on their life even during the busy period it be so important that we do not start look at casework as number game that be proud to say be something that my team and be always keenly aware of there be some case where we do not even know where to start in order to resolve it such as the one that have my chief of staff call around registry office in mexico to track down marriage certificate on behalf of couple who contact with visa issue when they be move overseas despite have very short timescale to work on we manage to pull off great result for they some case seem like they should be straightforward but get the right result be hard than it should be my office and do not admit defeat easily though which be how one of my team manage to secure in backdate pension credit for constituent along with goodwill payment some case be complex by nature because we be limit by the provision of government policy and only change in policy and legislation will provide the support constituent need there be no well example of that than the green deal mis sell scandal which be widespread in scotland and have have long last hugely devastating effect on many household impact that be worsen tenfold by the soar cost of energy over the past year or two still have open casework relate to that scandal but very little recourse be available to those constituent have write to ministers and meet with number of they but unfortunately there be little appetite to reopen the case the one leave those that be not resolve by the initial response to the scandal be the one that will not be easy to fix instead some victim have have to take their case to tribunal and my constituent now have to wait for the outcome of those case will continue to advocate on their behalf though will not accept that there be nothing ministers can offer do the hon member share my disgust that year after be tell by ministers in this place that they be quite willing to accept that all helms customer have essentially be rip off and should be recompense we be still wait for compensation for our constituent could not agree more lot of we have be fight for those affect by green deal selling unfortunately helms do not get its comeuppance child maintenance service relate casework have also dominate lot of time in my office this term short while ago be delighted to bring two of my constituent to an all party parliamentary group meeting where they speak about their experience with the system and the difficulty it have cause they let someone explain in their own word how the system have fail they can be very powerful some cms case have be open with my office for two year or so and not for lack of effort to get they resolve be pleased to say however that the long standing case be recently resolve with constituent finally be allow to move to collect and pay after year of her ex partner refuse to keep up with payment perseverance be key in many of these case never take no for an answer because recognise that ultimately it be the child who lose out there be another kind of inquiry that every member get from constituent often hundred every month span broad spectrum of issue be of course talk about lobby email have always be clear that any constituent who write to will get response so every one of these email relate to any policy be read and get personal answer over since the start of this year alone no matter the issue be it the cost of living the minimum wage pension or perhaps the sale of live lobster on amazon or new classification and restriction on import reptile wherever possible take my constituent concern and turn they into action sometimes send letter to the minister responsible sometimes if the opportunity present itself raise it here in the chamber as do the boys need bins campaign which aim to improve the provision of sanitary bin in male public toilet and to remove the stigma around male incontinence when constituent ask follow her father bicycle accident to raise the importance of wear helmet on the road do so during recent session of business question constituent request dictate the majority of my diary even when be down here in london attend specific debate at their request or drop in at parliamentary event to hear more about particular issue they elect to make their voice hear and that be what strive to do every day be here one of the most rewarding aspect of this job be see the impact our work have on real people and spend time with our local community have lovely time at two big constituency event recently start with landemer day in rutherglen long stand traditional gala day it be wonderful to see young rutherglen high school student ruby crown the landemer queen support by her court and the many attendee on the day also enjoy summerfest in cambuslang early this month although sadly it look as though that may be the final one after quarter of century organiser liz and john and the event committee have do their community proud and know that be not alone in my appreciation of their hard work over the year there be set to be another community fun day event in hillhouse this year but unfortunately thank to group of youth the community council now have mountain to climb to make it happen the youth break into the storage unit where donation for the local food bank and equipment for the fun day be be store and set it on fire deliberate act of destruction just for the sake of destroy something thousand of pound worth of equipment use for the benefit of the community now need replace the community council have my full support and hope it can reach its fundraising target unfortunately antisocial behaviour seem to be an issue in many part of the constituency at the moment that have be voice to by many small business in the area it be not abnormal to see rise in that behaviour over the summer month as school break up and good weather push more people outside find myself speak to local police officer about it often and place on record my thank to the local inspector for my area who have engage openly and regularly with and my team also wish to place on record my thank for the hard work of the royal burgh of rutherglen cambuslang halfway hillhouse blantyre burnside and meikle earnock community councils which do so much work for the resident in the local area it be very much appreciate by and many of my constituent have five more thank to give today and have save the good for last as member of the house we all know how important it be that every member of our staff care about our constituency as much as we do after all we could not do our job effectively without their support behind we can say with absolute confidence that every member of my staff have the same passion for the work and the people we serve as do so take this opportunity to thank kim glendenning natalie burgess gillian mair hannah nicol and rowan clark for their continue dedication loyalty and hard work for the constituent of rutherglen and hamilton west will come to close now be surprised be call so early so thank you madam deputy speaker wish every colleague across this house member of staff and house staff restful summer break be increasingly concerned about development in bosnia country for which have great affection watch what happen there have understandably go off the international boil which be unsurprise consider what be happen in ukraine but we should not forget what have happen there in the past and could easily happen there again in my view the situation in bosnia be rather like pick up lemonade bottle and shake it around when we put it down we think it be still clear and there have be no change but try take the top off bosnia could easily be like that bosnia have population of about million people on fundamental religious ground the population split three main way though everyone be racially south slav muslims make up about and they be often call bosniaks eastern orthodox christians represent and be often call bosnian serbs the roman catholic population often call bosnian croats be about the house will recall that the bosnian serbs attack their neighbour in seize large tract of ground which they horrid word ethnically cleanse of non serbs as the war go on the croats and muslims also carry out their own version of ethnic cleansing an estimate million people be drive from their home by the end of the war in september the united nations authorise deployment to bosnia of military force call the united nations protection force the un troop be dub peacekeeper but actually they be hardly that there be no peace to keep in bosnia and the unprofor do not have the mandate to enforce it either although several british army observer medic and liaison staff be already on the ground in sarajevo and elsewhere britain main contribution to the unprofor be battlegroup base on the battalion the cheshire regiment and reconnaissance squadron of the lancers actually about troop deploy under what be call operation grapple in november some might recall that be the unfortunate british battlegroup commander since then british military personnel have be involve in bosnia one way or another and service personnel have lose their life among those death be my escort driver lance corporal wayne edwards and my interpreter dobrila kalaba both be shoot in the head by sniper and their loss still haunt as be responsible for they or responsible for where they be the war which start in shortly before be first there continue until the massacre of srebrenica in july and end with the dayton peace accord in that stop the fighting and establish triumvirate of uneasy power sharing between the three major side bosnian serbs bosnian croats and bosniaks dayton be suppose to last only few year until politic could be adjust to make bosnia somewhat democratic and viable state but the dayton arrangement have become the status quo and they be crack at the seam for several year now the bosnian serbs in so call republika srpska have be seriously threaten to break away and periodically the bosnian croats be make similar growling noise almost all authority on the region believe that if that happen we could easily see the renewal of civil war between and approximately people be kill in the bosnian civil war and as have mention million people be displace from their home please god that tragedy must not be repeat number of we in the house speak regularly on this issue and fear that sometimes colleague feel that it be repeat mantra and we be just fearful for no reason or there be not an escalation my right hon friend mention dodik secessionist policy dodik have now introduce new law that disapplie to republika srpska the constitutional court of bosnia and herzegovina ruling do my right hon friend agree that that be the most acute threat to the dayton agreement that we have ever see when we raise our voice in the house and say we be concern it be because of meaningful change that put at risk peace on the ground thank my hon friend who be very good friend for intervene on an extremely pertinent point to which will return in little while believe that we the british be in good position to influence what happen in bosnia our reputation be high as result of the action of our diplomat soldier and politician over the year in that respect should mention my very good friend the late lord paddy ashdown who be the high representative he be outstanding and his reputation for deal with very tricky situation remain untouched by anyone else since when visit bosnia people always say to that they wish paddy be still there in my experience the one thing that bosnians respect be well motivated and professional people who be not corrupt who be on the ground know what they be do and be prepare to act paddy ashdown be certainly that do not suppose it will come as surprise to colleague that our armed force fit the bill quite well too currently we have very few military force on the ground in bosnia and we do not contribute to the so call eufor the european union force in bosnia which be utterly and completely useless and do nothing but wander around the country flag wave sit in vehicle and send back irrelevant report gather we have few staff officer at the nascent nato headquarters recently establish there although for some extraordinary reason be not allow to visit the place when be there recently have be to bosnia three time in the past month for several year have argue that it would send significant signal be we to send british battlegroup to bosnia perhaps under nato command suggest this again and it should happen soon especially as there be grow evidence of the increase malign influence of russia among bosnian serbs as care about bosnia find it particular tragedy that around people normally leave the country every year out of population of million they be predominantly young well train people imagine if similar proportion about our young in the uk be to leave each year it would be disaster for our country and for our future bosnia be heavily bleed the very people who should be the future of the country those people would not be leave if they believe they could have decent job and raise their family in society that be fair and not corrupt be afraid that corruption remain endemic in bosnia know that our ambassador and ministers especially the prime minister trade envoy for the region my hon friend the member for cleethorpes martin vickers who be here but have disappear do not warn he that be go to refer to he be fully aware of the situation and my hon friend work really hard on it on that point let pay credit to my very good friend the chair of the foreign affairs committee who set aside quite lot of her time for care about what happen in the balkans but for that reason she have be pillory and threaten point out to the house that we have brave lady here who stand up and speak for people and try to help they obviously bosnia remain personal to our armed force pay blood price to help the people there remember one of my soldier say when tell he that we might have to withdraw because those be the order be get we can leave this place sir these people these woman and child these man they would be massacre if we be here we ve get to help they we not leave think my god go to have mutiny think the people of bosnia be superb in all three so call ethnic religious group the decent people of bosnia just want to be give the chance to live their life in safety to have their child educate and their politic work and for corruption not be endemic we lose british personnel try to help they do that they must not have die in vain we should do all we can to help the people of bosnia it be pleasure to follow the right hon and gallant member for beckenham bob stewart certainly concur with his remark on bosnia would describe myself as fairly assiduous attendee on thursday in this place but in eight year this be the first recess debate that have take part in do have eight year worth of recess issue to discuss but obviously this be busy debate compare to some previous one so have have to pare down my remark the fact that the debate be so well subscribe be testament and fitting tribute to sir david and add my own tribute to those who have discuss he and the great work he do here with smile on his face at every turn also remember jo cox another colleague of ours who be take both members be take carry out the bread and butter of good constituency mp take part in constituency advice surgery remember they both recently meet senior staff member at recovery across mental health ramh for short which be third sector mental health organisation situate in paisley that provide essential support throughout renfrewshire hear at first hand the very real challenge that the workforce be experience we all know that there have never be great pressure on public finance in part due to global pandemic and the war in ukraine but mostly as result of year of tory austerity the scottish government be try desperately to balance the book while also meet the ever increase demand for government support and intervention and balance those book get hard every year time and again the uk government be ask to step up and tackle the broken social care sector and provide the additional funding it so desperately need the potential ripple effect if step be not take to address issue in the sector will be catastrophic without these organisation the public health and social care sector will become overwhelmed which will have negative impact on the quality and standard of care the third sector fill void leave by the nhs and local authority and help to ensure that individual can live independently in the community with adequate support the third sector workforce continue to be let down overwork understaffed underpaid and crucially under represent with the pressure and high level of moral accountability put on staff many be now experience burnout perhaps we be head for national social care crisis so we must do more as chair of both the all party parliamentary group for scottish sport and the all party parliamentary group on white ribbon uk be all too aware of the barrier that woman and girl face in the sporting arena participation and representation be essential in drive gender equality while improve the health and wellbeing of woman and girl and that must happen through grassroots approach have the opportunity to meet kyniska advocacy which campaign for progressive policy in woman sport with the ambition of enact change it be essential that the sporting world ensure that both man and woman have equal opportunity and level of respect and crucially that they feel safe in take part in sport particularly with those in position of trust also recently meet with miss the founder of the campaign group end sexual misconduct in sport who bravely share her live experience to raise awareness and to end sexual misconduct in sport as mention at business question this morning she have ask that all professional sport team in scotland and hopefully beyond sign up to sexual misconduct policy the fact that so many team be fail to do so speak volume about the struggle we face if we want to encourage current and future generation to take part in sport safely protection be paramount as number of recent scandal have show huge amount of work remain to ensure that sport be place where woman and girl can feel safe and where perpetrator of abuse be deal with appropriately we all have responsibility and duty not only to be oppose to misogyny but to actively call it out the making of excuse for locker room chat because boy will be boy far empower the misogynist narrative and that must stop just this week glasgow united fc announce that convict rapist david goodwillie have be select for an upcoming match that horrendous decision again send the wrong message not only to the victim of sexual violence but to young fan who idolise these team and sportsman as show in the case of mason greenwood industry must do more to tackle gender base violence and that start with the development of domestic abuse policy and procedure be all for give people second chance but they must at the very least show remorse for their action if they wish to be give that opportunity sporting institution and our player be influential public figure and can significantly challenge sexual misconduct in sport and they must do more like many parent these last few week find myself catch between ticketmaster and the plead angelic face of my taylor swift love daughter the step design to deter secondary ticketing result in chaotic frenzy with many customer who register for code to purchase ticket be unsuccessful and those who be successful attempt to sell these free code online for astronomical price ticketmaster have also implement lead booker policy on uk tour date result in severe implication for ticketholder as many parent who manage to buy ticket for their child must attend the concert because they be unable to pass on all the ticket to their child or their friend we often talk rightly about the largely unregulated secondary ticketing market we need to take action on the obscene excess profit of ticket merchant such as ticketmaster for example regular ticket on the aeg site be be sell for each or thereabout and aeg fee for four ticket be just for process transaction that take mere second surely that be not right in fact it be more than most band would make from ticket sale for regular concert it be crazy that that be allow and we must do more we should also ban dynamic pricing for concert which mean that no price be publish prior to sale with ticket price on demand mean they often cost hundred of pound and allow ticketmaster and aeg and the like to include excessive charge follow my election eight ago have work with women against state pension inequality campaigner in seek to secure justice from uk government who be keen to wash their hand of the whole episode the campaign push for fair transitional state pension arrangement for all woman bear in the who have be affect by change to state pension legislation bring in by the tory government more than woman across my constituency be affect by the change that raise the pension age initially from to and then to and by the lack of notification communication and clear guidance by the government result in many woman have to make life change decision have detrimental impact both financially and emotionally in the parliamentary and health service ombudsman rule against the government in the waspi battle with the watchdog rule that the department for work and pensions be guilty of maladministration by fail to provide adequate notice to million woman however the waspi woman continue to be let down with delay in settle compensation ongoing two year after the ruling constituent of mine be one of the six test case the ombudsman be look at her situation be misrepresent in the stage finding it have have to be look at again so hope it will be resolve it be essential that in these final stage of settlement waspi woman receive the compensation they deserve with no further delay many woman have wait for year and many have die sadly we need to get this do and get it do soon finally august will see the world cycling championship come to scotland it be massive event with more competitor than the commonwealth game in it will be the first time almost every discipline of the sport come together in one place so we can see all the good competitor on earth push themselves and their bike to the limit the rider in the tour de france will be there to try to win the right to wear the rainbow jersey for next year and the event will hope capture the public imagination know that road across the central belt and beyond will be line with people cheer on their favourite it will be broadcast on the bbc free for everybody to watch sadly however as mention this morning and as we be see certainly across the scottish news headline today our man national football team do not enjoy that level of exposure its match have be lock behind paywall during the most successful spell for the scotland man national team in year that have be incredibly frustrating for most scottish football fan particularly during cost of live crisis when every penny be prisoner and additional tv subscription be at good not priority and often simply affordable early this year host summit of the main broadcaster in scotland and the main right holder viaplay there be real willingness to discuss what be complex issue and work constructively to see what can be do but the bottom line be this be about much more than right fee and subscriber number we have see that today with viaplay try to exit the uk market and sell on its football right which include the league cup in scotland and the scotland man national team it also hold the right to the welsh and northern irish man national team have many phone call to make on this issue after this debate be over both our man and woman national football team play huge role in our national culture and more so than most because our opportunity to perform on the international stage have be little limited in recent year sadly the government have major role to play in work with the footballe authority broadcaster and regulator to recognise that importance and the need for people in scotland to enjoy the same access to their man national team as that enjoy by their counterpart in england and wales through channel and respectively it be time for the secretary of state to meet because be promise meeting back in december my office have chase month after month have raise this twice now at business question and have even raise it at prime minister question but can not get meeting with the secretary of state hope give the news today will finally get that meeting it be great pleasure to speak in this sir david amess adjournment debate there be number of issue that would like to raise before the house adjourn first on health be delighted that we have secure million for new community diagnostic centre in scunthorpe that alongside our new which have have the pleasure of look around thankfully not as patient be very significant for scunthorpe and once in generation improvement in our local healthcare provision be particularly delighted to see how pleased the staff in the be with their new facility and the fact that they have be consult and involve in the decision that be make as the be design alongside that good news want to raise the issue of access to nhs dentistry which continue to be concern for my constituent would like to press the government again on the idea of tie in which know have be discuss so that those we help to train as dentist then spend certain percentage of their time deliver nhs dental care to patient my constituent should be able to access an nhs dentist with ease and want to push the government to ensure that that be the case again on health it have be privilege to work with the family of local man david hopkins who sadly die of brain tumour alongside david wife nicki have be work with the all party parliamentary group on brain tumour we have look carefully at how we can get the million that the government have commit to brain tumour research into the hand of the researcher while we be delighted that the money have be put in place and it be hugely significant we have to expedite the research and the testing that be require so that we can help these patient it have similarly be privilege to work alongside our local charity the beat go on which be found by stephen and gill ayling follow the tragic death of their son nathan be little bit old than nathan be but we go to the same school and regularly speak to people in the constituency who remember he very fondly we be incredibly proud of stephen and gill in scunthorpe their campaign to improve the diagnosis rate of cardiac condition in people age between and have already save life stephen and gill come to london early this year and we meet the minister for primary care and public health who be extremely helpful want to raise again with the government the need for further research into the effectiveness of screening and to consider what be do in other country and in sport would be grateful if the department of health and social care could provide further update on that and specifically on the potential for review want to raise the excellent work be do by those at prostate cancer lincs and humber superb local group that support our community and raise awareness they seem to be everywhere go they be incredibly prolific and be really grateful for all the work they do when family or individual be affect by cancer whether it be prostate or another form of the illness it be incredibly difficult it be an honour to spend some time recently with joanne sowerby joanne be really special person and the work she do in our community through hope house be exceptional provide support group counselling and therapy and help to access home cook meal know that the work joanne and her team do make huge difference and want to register my thank to she before the house rise another area that require continued engagement be transport while the government bus fare scheme be welcome in scunthorpe and have go long way to address the affordability of public transport the reliability of local service provider have be problem in recent month on our train however be hopeful that under new management we will see improvement in rail service and hope to raise the specific issue of ticket office in the house later this evening it would be strange day be to stand up in the chamber and not raise the issue of steelmaking welcome the secretary of state for business and trade to our steelwork in may where be able to explain again to the government that we make the fine steel in the world in scunthorpe have say this in the house many time none of we can go single day without need to use steel and that will remain the case we use steel for everything we do from defence to growth and we must never ever lose the ability to make our own before the house adjourn want again to raise my concern about the long term future of steelmaking if we ever lose the ability to make our own steel we will still need to use it and will simply have to ship it from all over the world from place very far away that will choose how much to charge we and we will face all the ethical environmental and strategic concern that that inevitably bring know that the government have be good supporter of steel in the past through the safeguard and through pay people wage in scunthorpe we remember that well in my constituency want to press the government again before we adjourn to continue to recognise the strategic importance of this industry and its importance to my scunthorpe constituency in closing want to mention the redbourne centre an outstanding residential home in my constituency that visit recently think be suppose to go for half an hour but end up stay for two hour because it be so wonderful thank all those who work in the care sector in my constituency and throughout the country the work they be do at the redbourne centre be incredible particularly enjoy hear from gentleman who live there about how he have visit parliament when he be child and his memory of visit the chapel of st mary undercroft put on record my sincere thank to everyone in my constituency who work in that sector also want to wish you mr deputy speaker and all right hon and hon member safe healthy and enjoyable recess too would like to add my voice of thank and gratitude to all the various officer of this house in the speaker office the ways and means office the doorkeepers hansard the various vote offices the table office and the admission order office and all those who make our job in this place so much easy thank they and wish they all the very good for the summer recess of course they will still be here work while we go back to our constituency but it be important to place on record our thank and gratitude to they want to draw couple of matter to the attention of the house we recently have budget debate for northern ireland that be very painful process it be so punish that it have probably set back the prospect of restore the devolution settlement to northern ireland it be very important that we put on record that even if an executive be call back they would not have the resource available that be necessary to run northern ireland we constantly hear in this place about the necessity of barnett consequential which send money back to northern ireland but under this budget settlement any barnett consequential that northern ireland would get would have to be pay back immediately to the chancellor of the exchequer and the treasury and could not be use for the thing that they would normally offset such as teacher pay police service recruitment nurse pay and all the thing that be now slowly but surely be address on the mainland of great britain that be significant problem for we if we take teacher pay in northern ireland the average first year teacher in northern ireland will get between and less than their counterpart here in great britain depend which part of gb they be in that disparity in wage be atrocious and we can take that through all the pay arrangement in the various public sector area whether it be police nursing junior doctor teacher or civil servant it really be quite disheartening for those member of staff we be feed the idea get the executive back get it up and run and you can address these problem but we can not because the resource will not be there it be important that put that on the record we do want to see function northern ireland executive but they have to function under proper circumstance be poise to ask the question of how we can address that it be important to say that there must be resource somewhere that will allow we to redress this lack of money will address that in the second part of my speech which be about what believe to be national scandal of public waste even corruption in some aspect that must be address by the government the much hype much promise project really need to be examine closely by this house in my view it be deprive this kingdom and its people of billion of pound of resource which could be use in much well way but which be currently be siphon off into the single big white elephant this country have pursue someone in this house have to stand up at some point and say the emperor have no clothe with regard to the emperor have no clothe it be waste of public resource for one be pro infrastructure project want to see infrastructure project would love to see proper high speed rail network from the very far east from leeds right the way down to the capital that would be great but it be never go to happen certainly not under this be wasteful mad and utterly out of control project that the house must look at there be debate in westminster hall about it way back in in which we call for full debate in the chamber that have never take place have ask front benchers for that debate as have other member but it have not happen though there have be many promise neither the government nor the opposition want it to happen and do not know why ask the library to outline for which build company in northern ireland be work on the project there be many promise give that the project would be bonanza for company across the whole united kingdom but that have not be the case many company have be leave out some of the people who have lose out have support and donate to my party that be not personal register interest it do not have to be because the support be for the party but put that on record in the interest of transparency and openness be make these comment because of the waste to the rail service the money spend on the project could have be use to plug many of the gap that colleague across this house want to be plug on march this year the national audit office and on july the public accounts committee publish report on the subject they be the most depressing reading because they confirm our bad fear about euston redevelopment and other aspect of the project that force lord berkeley in the other place to say time seem nigh to cancel both project euston and the wide programme before any further public money be waste despite the various requirement for euston have be know for the last eight year nothing have happen on that project in fact there have be almost decade of complete waste there be no agreement about the number or development of platform or the station lie out no design solution have be put in place all the problem be know well before royal assent be give to the high speed rail london west midlands act way back in yet in madness the government pursue that have result in the big waste of public money eight year into the planning process we be call halt to some of the building understand that in recent week the chief executive officer of mr thurston have have to stand down he have retire after six and half year his legacy be one of blow budget be initially schedule to start run in but there will not be single train run by then under the current construction and budgeting guideline it could be the or even before it be up and run meanwhile the initial budget of billion have be completely blow in sit in this chamber when the minister tell we that the budget for would be billion two month later the chairman of allan cook raise the figure to billion matter of month later the oakervee review say sorry it will actually be over billion how can the government be so wrong in their calculation they be not out by few million but by ten of billion of pound that be wholly unacceptable and wholly inadequate ltd late report show that the chief executive receive over per year in salary yet the management of this project have be an unmitigated disaster and we be no near an train run than we be way back in when this whole thing start those in charge of seem to have be temper expectation recently the secretary of state for transport have have to pause the work on euston station for two year because believe it or not it have already exceed its budget of billion and the cost now stand at billion meanwhile the eastern leg of phase from the west midland to the east midland have fall in the pecking order and probably will not happen either there be no money for nurse there be no money for junior doctor and there be no money for police officer there be little money for education there be little money for other project and there be little money for some of our defence expenditure yet hopelessly this white elephant keep get fund and keep get either silence or support from member in this house that have to be call out the government must take long hard look at this over the summer and recognise that this white elephant must cease to be fund thank you mr deputy speaker for allow to take part in the debate name in honour of our late colleague sir david amess participate in these debate with he for many year indeed participate in an interview with he to promote his book three week before he be sadly kill he be great friend also pay tribute to my right hon and gallant friend the member for beckenham bob stewart who be sit in front of it be to the huge benefit of the house that he do not suffer the same fate as his driver and his interpreter in that car his speech demonstrate loudly and clearly to the house and the nation how important it be to have colleague here with different skill and different knowledge may add very briefly to what my hon friend have say we be all aware that my right hon friend the member for beckenham bob stewart do great service to his country in bosnia for which he be rightfully award the distinguished service order he be far too modest to mention that but think that it be worth put it on the record none the less be grateful to my right hon friend for add to my tribute now want to raise two urgent issue relate to shoot and farming before do so should declare my interest as chairman of the all party parliamentary group on shooting and conservation vice president of the british association for shooting and conservation shoot partner and farmer very much regret the necessity to raise the unexpected policy change on the part of the department for environment food and rural affairs that will deprive shoot release gamebird on special protection area with metre buffer zone of the benefit of general licence force each of they to apply to natural england which will then advise ministers on the signing off of each individual licence to release gamebird ask the house to bear with as explain the importance of that decision which defra take in full knowledge of the shooting calendar and communicate to shoot even though bird have already be order and be about to be release it have cause chaos around the country and result in an animal welfare crisis threaten redundancy shoot closure and the bankruptcy of rural business in short this be disaster for rural affair something similar happen in the spring of when after legal challenge by anti shoot pressure group natural england revoke the general licence to control pest bird at precisely the point when the protection give by shoot to ground nest lay and fledge bird be critical for their survival there be similar outcry from shoot at that time and the then secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend the member for surrey heath michael gove react very differently he take over natural england function and issue new general licence which allow the necessary control he be minister who know what be right and he be not overawe by natural england what difference from the way in which the matter be be handle today in this case it be unacceptable for minister to treat stakeholder like mushroom promise they consultation and engagement accept the need for early notice and then keep they in the dark that be precisely what happen in this case despite early promise shoot organisation be give only few day notice of significant policy change with the feeble excuse that circumstance do not permit consultation minister know that supply of game bird be order in november and december before release in the following june and july that be contain in their evidence to the court in the judicial review in so they should have know that their decision would leave shoot in an impossible position expect imminent delivery of thousand of bird that could not be release and could not be cull with very limited market for resale bird over nine week old can not be keep in pen because they would attack each other hence the animal welfare crisis to which defra have offer no solution yet shoot have be refuse licence with estate threaten with bankruptcy military shoot which provide social benefit for veteran have be shut down and shoot with excellent conservation credential over decade have be refuse licence even though they protect rare and magnificent bird specie that inhabit their land who will protect those specie if the gamekeeper have be make redundant meanwhile the application process for licence be in an almighty mess with decision delay application muddle and lose shoot leave wait for week for decision and those that have be give licence in some case subject to unworkable and increasingly bizarre restriction it be simply not possible to keep bird ready to be release now until september and to get bird in any number at that date and it be unethical to shoot such young bird when the season start why have this happen defra justification for this disaster be the prevention of avian influenza ai but that justification be deeply flawed no game bird have ever be release when infect by ai there be no record of any wild bird be infect by the release of game bird outbreak of ai in the uk do not correlate to the area in which game bird be release and do not occur when game bird be release the netherlands have similar level of ai yet it have no game bird release this be not game bird issue the shadow habitat regulation assessment provide by natural england to ministers in january have not be share with the people whose livelihood and business be now be destroy will the minister undertake to publish and share it with all those affect if the assessment justify such drastic change in policy for shooting presumably defra request similar assessment for other activity that occur in special protection area for example do ministers request assessment on waterbird feeding event seabird tourism event and birdwatch event such as the call to come and see two wonderful bee eater at trimingham that event attract more than birdwatcher that be fantastic but it must have carry risk of transmit ai furthermore public access to the coastal path and bird ring activity all carry risk of transmit ai if ministers do not request assessment for those activity will today minister explain why shooting be single out be tell that the decision to change the policy be make as late as april it should have happen many month early but shoot organisation be not inform for over month be also tell that civil servant be under an explicit instruction not to communicate any change to the shooting organisation ahead of time wonder whether that be an instruction from official or ministers let give the house some example of the impact on shoot of defra decision colleague tell this week that syndicate shoot rent by work man in the north that have be the only shoot in the area to protect nest hen harrier for year have be refuse licence community shoot operate around military firing range involve veteran some of whom have post traumatic stress disorder and welcome the social engagement that the shoot provide be also refuse licence here be some quote from people who run shoot disaster we have the first day shoot on the october no chance the bird will be hardy and fit we will have to refund gun unsustainable loss for we and court action with supplier and possibly death by gas for lot of healthy bird believe an october release date would be workable solution for any shoot just show the lack of knowledge and understand the people process these licence have shoot will be force to close lead to catastrophic consequence not only to job and business in these area but also to conservation it will bankrupt the shoot two gamekeeper will lose their job just not practical at all give that these people have legitimate expectation that defra would honour its promise to engage early and consult with the industry and legitimate expectation when they order the bird that the licensing regime would not change will the minister commit to provide compensation to those shoot that have and will lose out entirely because of defra decision the minister know that and many colleague seek assurance on numerous occasion that this problem would be sort out and we be give those assurance very much regret the necessity to say that those assurance have not be honour in the light of that and the catalogue of mistake and injustice will the minister not take the obvious decision that address the problem that the department have create for itself and other and immediately renew general licence for all shoot locate on specially protect area that general licence have subsist for decade and can not see why we need it to be withdraw at this juncture secondly would like to raise the urgent issue of the high level stewardship scheme which number of people in my farming constituency have contact about in the last week the deadline be approach for many to transfer from the high level stewardship scheme and apply for the new mid tier countryside stewardship scheme the main difficulty in complete the application be that the rural payments agency and defra website be not function properly in relation to the new scheme to exacerbate the delay in move to the new scheme the rpa be provide little to no communication with those farmer who have query about how to apply for the scheme mean that desperate constituent try to apply before the deadline be contact my office for help and support the deadline for many be come up in the middle of next month and urge the department to provide the communication and support require to help those try to transition to the new scheme as they have be advise to do this be cause great consternation for my constituency farmer and no doubt many other farmer up and down the country at their busy harvest time of year in view of these communication problem with the rpa will the minister consider delay the deadline for application to the mid tier countryside stewardship scheme that seem only fair consider the difficulty people be have with communicate with the rpa in closing mr deputy speaker wish you mr speaker colleague all our very hard work staff and the hard work staff in the house happy recess and chance to recharge their battery it be privilege to speak in this debate and to remember the late sir david amess who rattle off so many issue when he use to speak in the debate be take he as my

several issue wish to raise today first want to thank all those in nhs supply chain for movement on our campaign for nhs uniform to be standardise in the equivalent debate three year ago talk about putney scrubbery which at that time with covid hard upon we have mobilise lot of volunteer to make scrub in hospital as they do so they find out that the nhs scrub be not fit for purpose they be make for man who be much big than most of the staff and they be not standardise across hospital which make it difficult to do laundry service and cost lot more money we have be campaign on this issue as result follow hard work by staff at nhs supply chain this have be turn around some people get involve in the consultation and now uniform that be more comfortable fit for purpose and save money be be develop so be grateful to all of those who have help with that campaign my next issue be probably the big question be ask by putney resident at the moment where be the renters reform bill every week with bated breath have look at the order paper to see what be on in the next week in here but have never see that bill will the minister explain at the end of this debate to the private renter in my constituency which have an average rent of more than month where the bill be why do have to keep ask about it why be it take so long it have be day and four prime ministers since the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may first promise to scrap no fault eviction back in april that be announce with huge fanfare but it be never follow up the situation be get desperate since then more than household

mortgage rise be pass on by landlord many renter be face homelessness have speak to many in the past few week the deputy prime minister reiterate the line at prime minister question recently that the

of the summer recess leave renter across the country wait yet again thank all the school in my constituency that have welcome to visit they get lot of question and answer get all sort of question be give hard time rightly by lot of young people from across the constituency but every time talk with school and young people they raise one issue above every other mental health we need to talk about child and adolescent mental health service and the long waiting list quarter of million child in the uk with mental health problem have be deny the help they need because the nhs be struggle to keep up with the demand for service some of gps believe that mental health service for child and young people be critically fail and have deteriorate in the past six year minister have fail to deliver on parity of esteem for mental health service and child especially be be badly let down labour have plan for this we will provide specialist mental health support service in every secondary school we will put an open access mental health hub for child and young people in every community provide that much need early intervention prevention we can not wait until we be in government we can not wait for that to do something about this matter seek response from the government on their solution to this issue they be very welcome to steal and implement labour plan for improve our mental health service my next issue be drive test waiting time this have be concern for many of my constituent who have be wait an extraordinary amount of time to get their test book many be unable to take up new job because by the time they have manage to book test they have lose their job offer that be very concerning recently have to book test with my daughter and find that it be hard to get test date than to get taylor swift or glastonbury ticket we wake up at on monday morning go online and then find that there be people in the queue ahead of we for the test we have to wait half an hour for the queue to go down and then we jump on the last remain test in the whole london area which be many mile away from we in north london this crisis be go on and do not think that it be be raise enough in the house which be why be do so now in england the average wait time for test be week before it be just six week which be an acceptable amount of time but wait about six month on average be just not acceptable in london it be bad of the test centre in london have wait time of week the average be and half week in the many write parliamentary question that have put to the department for transport have ask exactly how long people be have to wait how many londoner be able to get test in london and what the situation be across the country the department could not give information on that official say that they have no datum because the moving and the rebooking of test mean that they do not know when people first book their test that be not good enough if the driver and vehicle standards agency do not even have the datum on waiting list time it can not fix the problem will the minister look at the system as it really be not work at the moment and take this matter up with the department for transport and the dvsa the next issue which have cross party support be my campaign to ban plastic in wet wipe it have come long way and know that member be wait with bated breath to find out what the next step be introduce my private member bill in and it be support by member from across the house billion of wet wipe be use every year and because they contain plastic they do not break down they block sewer they add cost to our water bill and they cause environmental damage in our river and ocean there be consultation which be great and it end in february last year supplier retailer and all part of the industry be unite in say that ban could be achieve tesco and boots have lead the way as retailer ban plastic in all the wet wipe that they sell which amount to billion of wet wipe year producer and retailer agree that date could be set and that they could introduce ban the government plan for water be publish in april there be the opportunity to get the ban it include an announcement from the government that it would be do fantastic so far so good but there be no actual ban and there be no actual date instead we have promise of another consultation ask the minister today why be there another consultation when will it be launch and when will the actual ban come in wish to finish on the climate emergency one of the first thing do when be elect mp for putney be set up the putney environment commission it be wonderful thriving group of activist and local people who want to take ownership of our local environment and tackle the climate emergency globally nationally locally and in our own garden we hold recent meeting focus on the need to save nature and how much of nature deplete country we be compare with other country local people in putney roehampton and southfields see the datum they see europe be scorch as we speak with record break heat and they see the inaction of the government and they be horrified they do not want to stand by and do nothing about it it be not just the people of putney who be concerned about the failure of the conservative government to do enough on the environment the climate change committee have highlight area in which the conservative government be fail on energy and climate those include failure to reform the planning system to bring more home grow power online failure on renewable failure on energy efficiency failure on make new home green failure in comparison to other country failure to take global climate leadership failure on heat pump failure on hydrogen for home heating failure on the delivery of nature target failure to deliver on international commitment instead go backwards failure to grasp the opportunity to protect consumer failure on worker and skill failure to address the uk second highest emit sector which be building and failure on fossil fuel and stop more coal mine from be build the government have fail to ensure that their own departments such as the department for environment food and rural affairs and the department for levelling up housing and communities meet the committee priority they have also fail on green financing which should be underpin all of those action the government should be go far and fast on climate action hope there be time for reflection over the summer recess and that action on the climate can be speed up incredibly we can not wait for the labour government who will take that action we need it now today there be train strike and an nhs doctor strike my son graduate from university next week but be tell last week when he should have have his mark that it have not be allocate so he will be graduate without even mark after three difficult year at university under covid that be because the government have fail university staff and

sir david amess summer adjournment debate resume begin by apologise to the house as have discuss with madam deputy speaker and the minister can not remain until as result of today train strike it will take long to get to the airport and then back to scotland appreciate their understanding of that will also begin by reflect on our late great colleague whom this debate be name after be with sir david amess on foreign trip less than hour before he be murder and in many of the discussion that we have throughout the day and in the evening during which he lead the delegation with great skill as he always do he mention how much he enjoy this adjournment debate raise issue on behalf of his constituent we can see from his contribution over the year just how passionate he be about this place this debate chamber and the issue he be able to highlight it be fitting memory of sir david that we hold this debate at the end of each term the first issue would like to raise be national issue and then want to go on to more local issue in my constituency of moray the national issue be the news that have break in scotland today about viaplay withdraw from the uk as reference by the hon member for paisley and renfrewshire north gavin newlands that news have be meet with lot of concern understandably people will be worried about their job and they be in our thought at the moment should of course declare an interest as football referee with the scottish football association include in the scottish league cup this weekend which be sponsor and broadcast by viaplay there be also concern about the future of viaplay coverage in scotland its coverage of the scottish league cup and of course our national game member who have already raise this issue have be right to highlight that the performance of steve clarke and his team in recent month have be something that all of we scottish football fan have welcome and celebrate we be look forward to the qualification campaign continue after the incredible result that we have already see although the news about viaplay be concern also think it be an opportunity because like other member across the house be concerned that we can not watch our national team the scottish man team on free to view tv despite the contract have recently be agree between viaplay uefa and the scottish fa there be an opportunity to review the model of deliver the national man football game on terrestrial tv hope that the bbc stv and channel look again at the offer they can make in that regard as get those game on free to air tv would be welcome by our fan across the country let turn to some local matter first want to discuss some health relate issue understand that health be fully devolve to the scottish parliament and the scottish government but be in fortunate position in that sit in both our parliaments and give that have raise both these health issue in the scottish parliament would like to reiterate they here in the uk parliament the first be about access to gp surgery there have be significant campaign in the village of burghead and hopeman to retain the surgery in those two coastal community as they be vital facility for the people live there the save our surgeries campaign have do outstanding work to raise the issue not just locally but on national news too there have be strong outpouring of support for that campaign with thousand sign the petition to maintain at least one of the surgery but the response from nhs grampian and health social care moray have be appalling and disgraceful and disrespectful to the people campaign for the surgery continuation the chief executive of nhs grampian recently write to after raise concern with she she tell that part of the consultation do not include the basic question of whether the surgery could remain open when highlight that in the press the board tell that it have miss out word in the letter to which should have state that the question be not main part of the consultation this have lead many people to believe that there be never genuine consultation to keep the surgery in burghead and hopeman open and that it have be agree from the very beginning that they would close however nhs grampian do not count on the outstanding support locally for facility in either but hopefully both burghead or hopeman will continue to support the campaign in any way can the other health issue want to raise be the future of consultant lead maternity service at dr gray it be come up to five year since our community be tell that there would be temporary downgrade of that facility for one year in that five year period my wife and have welcome two beautiful boy into the world four year old alistair and two year old james alistair be fortunately able to be bear at dr gray but due to complication when my wife krystle go into labour james have to be bear in aberdeen follow blue light journey in the back of an ambulance from elgin sadly our story and experience be share by far too many moray mum and family we have be promise time and again that the facility will be bring back yet we be now five year on from the original decision to downgrade it temporarily for month welcome the fact that the new public health minister have agree to meet local campaigner keep mum and other in moray during the summer recess to discuss this issue and to come up and see the importance of get that full consultant lead facility open again at dr gray the situation have be go on for far too long and will continue to use opportunity such as this debate and other to highlight the importance of the full restoration of the service so that we can ensure that the outstanding staff at dr gray can continue to provide that high level of care as locally as they would like the other issue want to raise be that of infrastructure we have hear from other contributor about infrastructure project and one that would like to focus on be the dualling of the which be critical route in scotland that go from the central belt through perthshire and up to the highland many of my constituent use the daily or weekly to get to and from the north of scotland back in the snp promise to fully dual the but that promise have not be deliver indeed this week the inverness courier host summit on the dualling of the that be attend by the snp scottish transport minister it be welcome that she travel to inverness to hear the concern of local resident and campaigner but many be leave unhappy with the response they hear among the comment be those of laura hansler who say she do not believe that the will be dualle in her lifetime she have be campaign because she see daily how dangerous the road be but give the delay we have see under the snp scottish government she do not think the road will be fully dualle in her lifetime despite the promise that have be make we also hear from bill lobban the convenor of highland council and an independent councillor who feel that there be no answer from the meeting crucially we hear from fergus ewing an snp msp and former cabinet secretary who say that he feel it be to his shame that there have not be enough progress on dualle the route in the time his party have be in government and that the minister have fail to answer the three main point and concern that come out of the summit it be of real concern that although there have at least be more dialogue there be no further action on dualle the route we be tell that when the be fully dualle the between inverness and aberdeen which go through my moray constituency would be fully dualle as well we be no far on and indeed the future of the dualling be now in far more doubt because the snp bring into government the scottish greens who be anti car and anti road building that vital infrastructure upgrade be now under serious threat because of the greens in government try to stop critical network be bring up to the level expect not only do my constituent want it but business in moray say that it be crucial for their future as well want to stick to the time limit that have be impose because so many member want to raise so many issue but this have be great opportunity to raise in parliament just some of the crucial issue that have be work on as mp for moray and will continue to work on in the summer recess like other mr deputy speaker wish you and all member and staff all the good for the summer recess wish to speak about number of constituency issue first recently have the privilege of opening on behalf of the company brit european in middlewich in my constituency its new vita nova centre brit european start life in my constituency just under year ago with one horse draw milk tanker take milk from local farm to dairy today it be lead transport logistic company with fleet of hundred of vehicle provide transport solution across the uk and into europe and have its own driver academy be so impressed with the innovative approach by brit european lead by ceo graham lackey who be support by group sale director rob mcninch both of whom have travel here to listen to this debate from the gallery that want to take this opportunity to commend the company for the development of its new site it have focus on carbon neutral build work off grid and ensure that the whole site be environmentally efficient let give some more detail the new centre have repurpose an exist steel frame building from elsewhere for the company modular building while the driver welfare facility workshop it facility and part store be all make from repurposed shipping container the entire site of acre be build on redesign concrete slab that be thin than normal concrete foundation and have hugely reduce the carbon footprint for the whole build ground stabilisation technique be use in construction to avoid dig into the ground thereby avoid the need to remove soil dump it off site and replace it with quarried material this alone save thousand of transport truckload of material focus on off grid the vita nova site have full solar array and battery power storage system and innovative wind tower be plan that be quieter and less obtrusive than traditional large windmill turbine remarkably they have be print use recycled plastic on site so again avoid transport and with no concrete foundation they can easily be move they be the first of their kind in england colloquially call moo poo methane capture from dairy farm slurry pit be be use to charge brit european vehicle this be time well than release kilogram of methane into the atmosphere and be another world first the rainwater harvesting system provide of the site total water need and be use for flush toilet and vehicle washing and none of the water that fall within the site can run off to the surround environment without be clean via filter tank in final stage of off grid development brit european be develop software and switch system to co ordinate all power generation so that at any point in time it be use the most environmentally beneficial energy source available in other word it link the solar wind moo poo and battery system together and utilise the energy they produce before go to grid the whole build be on brownfield area so the company work with environmental expert to come up with planting scheme to restore the site to its pre industrial state it be believe the site be first industrialise in the late work include carefully select tree and shrub bat and bird box and measure to encourage animal such as hedgehog even more admirable be brit european generous offer through the road haulage association to pass on this innovation to other transport or logistic business across the country this exemplary innovation have not be easy but when graham lackey be ask why he have do this he reply to reach sustainability as business be simply the right thing to do for my child and their future it give great pleasure to commend brit european innovative work today be very proud to have such forward look company in my constituency elsewhere in my constituency be the steep incline of mow cop will the government consider improve the guidance for local authority on winter

that the world and the medium be very keen to talk about this we be successful in our bid to secure million from the levelling up fund for the community of rutland and melton many ask why do rutland

touch on the need to insert social mobility core conservative value into the way we fund local government know it be unlikely that the funding formula will get the overhaul this country need but meet the chancellor yesterday and be work to see if we can get social mobility include alongside deprivation in the funding formula that would well recognise that sometimes in the most deprived area in our country people still have access to jobcentre or to employment or training opportunity within minute walk when you see rural poverty mr deputy speaker it stay with you and you do not forget it because those individual may not have access to bus or petrol for their car nor the ability to go to shop or medical care or anything else that be why be fight to put social mobility into our funding formula

agree some time ago to name in memory of our great friend we still miss he and must confess that do in particular especially that famous cheeky amess grin reassure the house that be not go to try to emulate he and raise different topic in half as many minute nevertheless there be five particular area that would like to touch on before the house adjourn for the summer first as those who be here at education question on monday may recall have launch campaign for new special need school in south essex we already have number of very good special need school in essex but they be now almost without exception heavily over subscribed and we simply do not have enough special need place particularly in the south of the county to deal with ever increase demand as result many parent end up have to go through long appeal process desperately try to get their child into an appropriate school for those who be unsuccessful their child be shoehorn into mainstream education which sometimes lead to behavioural problem and even to mainstream school themselves get bad ofsted report as result we need to cut through this gordian knot and expand capacity be therefore talk to the cabinet member for education and lifelong learning in essex county council councillor tony ball as well as ministers at the department for education and couple of local multi academy trust to see whether we can find suitable option to open new school hope to have more to say about that by the time the house return in the autumn but for the moment pledge to do my good on this in that hope will have the support of my constituent especially parent with special need child secondly we have have real problem at king edmund school in ashingdon which suffer triple whammy first it be close like many other school during covid and secondly it have to have large block demolish because of reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete or raac the third whammy come when they demolish the building and find that it contain large quantity of asbestos which no one realise be there the school have to be completely close while the area be thoroughly decontaminate be glad to report to the house that the new block be now in the early stage of rise phoenix like from the ash thank the permanent secretary at the department for education who at recent meeting of the public accounts committee publicly apologise to and my constituent who be adversely affect by this difficult situation be assure by the headteacher mr jonathan osborn that the apology have go down very well with staff parent and pupil alike so want to register my thank this afternoon on their behalf on related matter hockley primary school have also unfortunately be discover to be suffer from raac have recently check with the academies enterprise trust which run the school it be in the midst of detailed engineering survey assist by the department to assess the extent of the problem in the meantime other aet school in the hockley area include plumberow and greensward have rally round to provide alternative place for hockley schoolchildren we await the result of the engineering survey with great interest but be do everything can in the meantime to facilitate the provision at least of temporary classroom for the autumn term on the hockley primary school site itself if that can not be achieve very much hope it can will work with aet to ensure that there be some kind of plan perhaps continue to use some of the nearby school thirdly we have very unfortunate situation in wickford whereby both the town main supermarket be close pende redevelopment and the old market in wickford high street have have to close and be look for an alternative venue many other member wish to speak today so to cut very long story short my wickford constituent have be leave face something of perfect storm regard their ability to shop locally be do everything can to persuade basildon council to find new site even temporary one to allow wickford market to reopen and also to persuade aldi which be in the process of rebuild and expand its supermarket in wickford to keep to its ambitious timetable and make sure that the store be open before christmas this year my wickford constituent be also frustrate by the fact that abellio greater anglia knock down half their train station without have proper plan to rebuild it have raise this issue with abellio on multiple occasion and now understand it be close to submit planning application for new station design to basildon council this summer which would hopefully allow construction to begin sometime next year it be important that abellio keep to that timetable and intend to remain very much on its case until it do so that lead on to the related matter of ticket office not just in wickford but at all the other station in my constituency fully intend to respond to the consultation about proposal to close ticket office prior to the deadline next week but suffice it to say at this juncture that be oppose to the proposal which be mistake the saving that might be generate from do so be more than outweigh by the potential inconvenience for traveller particularly those who be visually impair or otherwise disabled the other monday morning when be wait on the platform at rayleigh station even see that lo and behold the ticket machine be not work in short believe the game be not worth the candle very much hope that minister include the rail minister who be decent chap and to whom speak personally about this recently and the train operator might yet be persuade to reconsider fourthly want to raise some issue relate to shelter housing accommodation in my constituency some in the house with good memory might remember my previously refer to sheltered housing scheme know as sangster court also know as gangster rayleigh run by notting hill genesis such have be my frustration with nhg over the year that in the last sir david amess summer adjournment debate on july last year say in the house can only express the hope that notte hill genesis will soon be overtake by large and more professional housing association that will do much well job for my constituent official report july vol be therefore delighted to receive letter only yesterday from mr matthew cornwall jones the group director of asset and sustainability for nhg confirm that it now intend to sell on the sheltered accommodation it currently own in essex include in my rayleigh and wickford constituency be not sure whether that will be meet with joyous rejoicing in sangster court but it be certainly meet with approval in my office yesterday very much hope we will be able to find another major social housing provider such as perhaps sanctuary which have have its own issue but be now gradually improve to take over nhg property in essex and run they more successfully in addition have have some dreadful experience with property management company call firstport which manage number of privately run sheltered housing facility in my constituency ironically as part of its branding it claim to prioritise customer you could have fool for instance at king georges court in rayleigh it take firstport more than seven month to fix lift partly as result some very ill elderly resident have to be carry down flight of step by ambulance paramedic who be do their good because the lift be not work be glad to report to the house that the lift be now finally function again but firstport could hardly have make bad job of it if it have try the concept of any sense of urgency seem totally alien to it furthermore firstport run another facility call oak lodge in hockley which visit recently at the invitation of the resident only to see number of maintenance defect include back fence that be effectively fall down and have not be repair despite multiple complaint by the resident incidentally they be also upset by increase in their bill especially their energy bill which they regard as completely disproportionate firstport be particularly poor at reply to correspondence include from member of parliament put on record today that very much hope it will follow notting hill genesis example and hand its home over to someone more competent to run they do not know what the non executive director of firstport do all day but hold the company executive director properly to account do not exactly seem to be their top priority fifthly everyone who know sir david be well aware that he be great animal lover so it be partly in his memory that be support the conservative animal welfare foundation the crate escape campaign to phase out the use of cruel farrow crate for sow and their piglet and the soon the well sir david be very keen on this issue and hope and believe that we will get there in the end lastly mr deputy speaker take this opportunity to thank you all our colleague all the staff of the house my excellent westminster team adele oliver felix and mellissa and all my supporter in my constituency hope they all have relax summer recess and that we can all reassemble safely in the autumn thank the house this be the second time have speak in this debate the first time be two year ago and follow david amess can even remember where he be sit in the chamber at the time have refresh my memory on what say in that debate raise for the first time the issue of improved public transport link north from newbury up to oxford and specifically the need for new bus route that would link newbury to the town and the science park up what we call the knowledge highway of the be delighted that two year later after countless survey leaflet email to constituent meeting with ministers and meeting with oxfordshire county council west berkshire council and various bus company the new bus route will open on monday want to say how grateful be to the government for the million bus service improvement plan funding that be give to west berkshire council in recognition of the fact that rural area be often not well connected and also want to put on record my thank to oxfordshire county council west berkshire council and thames travel for take the rare and unusual step of create new bus route that cross two county since it be perfectly obvious that this debate actually work it seem as good time as any for to raise my next infrastructure campaign which be for bridge over the level crossing or at least some part of the adjacent railway line in thatcham that may sound like small issue but what be in fact significant signal problem cause resident of that town extensive delay at peak time every single day many of my constituent say that they wait between minute and an hour per journey when travel to and from work dread to think how many hour be lose to they each day have already meet the transport secretary to discuss the problem and be grateful for his support so far although have not ask he for any money yet and will visit the site and meet the signal team tomorrow my constituency predecessor now lord benyon make some initial effort and have tell that if nothing else he can explain to where the plan to build bridge go wrong in the past however think that there be sensible practical solution to the infrastructure blockage problem and know that the magic of this debate mean that the bridge will be build very soon want to raise briefly two further issue another campaign that have be run for about two year involve the waiting time face by family seek diagnosis of either autism spectrum disorder or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder from the west berkshire child and adolescent mental health service when become the local mp the waiting time be frequently as long as three year and hear heartbreake story about child who be unable to access the curriculum or be experience serious social difficulty and in some instance be not even at school think that every family in my constituency who be affect by that be well aware that have be campaign to bring wait time down to month maximum we have have great deal of support from the government in west berkshire camhs receive an additional million to reduce waiting time and as result it be able over time to recruit more healthcare professional it set itself firm target of see all child seek an autism diagnosis within two year by march this year it be currently of the way towards meet that only handful of case be take long than that however in the most recent phone call receive from the service be tell that the month target be still challenge because of an increase in the number of child be refer for autism diagnosis at this stage it be not clear to the service or to why that be the case but it will obviously require more attention the present approach be to triage the child with the high need so that they do not wait any long than year but be determined to drive down overall waiting time to year for all those family will continue my campaign to achieve that and will seek assistance from ministers as to how it can be do finally want to say something about water quality my area be cover by thames water which have have to say be work with constructively since the implementation of the environment act three chalk stream run through my constituency and thames water pledge that this summer it would produce water management plan set out how it would achieve an reduction in the use of storm overflow into the chalk stream by that be firm commitment while be keen to work with the water company also write to ofwat on may ask whether it would consider tie bonus payment and shareholder dividend to environmental performance do not mean that in discretionary sense suggest that if any water company be fin for illegal discharge it should be mandate that it do not pay bonus to senior manager or dividend to shareholder and that give that banker lose their bonus if they break the law so should water company executive receive an encouraging response from ofwat but it be not really matter of dispute that thames water be in state of flux with the resignation of its chief executive officer and we do not know what its future hold put it on the record that when parliament return hope that we will have much great clarity on the future of thames water and that we can continue to work constructively both through what hope will be the publication of its wastewater management plan and through tough sanction implement by ofwat to ensure that we get there join colleague in pay tribute to our late friend sir david amess be lucky enough to be put by the accommodation whip on the same corridor as sir david when first arrive here as an mp will never forget the conversation that we use to have while wait for the lift in parliament street which never work he be always interested in colleague and what they be do he take genuine interest in parliamentarian and this house we really miss he and remember he in these time on happy note extend my good wish to you mr deputy speaker and all the staff in the houses of parliament in advance of the summer recess and wish they very restful recess be tell by hansard that today will be my mention of carshalton and wallington so no prize for guess the topic of my speech today will highlight few thing that my constituent be face which hope that the minister who be delighted be in her place will take away to the relevant government departments to pursue over the summer do not think that it will come as any surprise that the no issue that get from resident on the doorstep and in my postbag be sure it be the same for every member of parliament at the moment be concern about cost of living pressure such as meet the mortgage rent payment energy bill and other bill warmly welcome not only all the initiative that the government have take include the energy bill relief scheme the household support fund and the uprating of benefit and pension in line with inflation but the way the government have try to promote those scheme know so many people who have benefit from go on the help for households website they have find support that they do not know be out there have be try to work alongside local stakeholder to ensure that people be adequately signpost to the support available together with the department for work and pensions and the local jobcentre we have set up monthly drop in cost of live advice session in roundshaw and st helier and we be look to expand that to other area of carshalton and wallington particularly area of deprivation where the need for such support be acute those session have be so well receive every month more and more people come to those drop in event hope that the government can encourage the dwp to continue to do that in other constituency because it have work particularly well in mine move on to some news that be sad to receive yesterday the environment agency be about to issue an intention to approve the increase in the amount of waste that the incinerator in beddington can burn the incinerator be approve champion in fact by the liberal democrats be not surprised that once again none of they could be bother to turn up today the lib dem run council have again let down resident of carshalton and wallington regard this monstrosity of an incinerator which be force on resident against their will we be tell at the time this will be it no need to worry of course it not go to burn more and more waste this extra capacity be not need it can burn the household waste from the four borough that it receive waste from at the moment absolutely fine without need to increase capacity would like the government to again look at the permit variation process for incinerator if the permit amount of incineration in this country be build we would have more than double the government own estimate need for incineration it be not conducive to our net zero ambition we need to look at why we have massive overcapacity in the planning system for incineration hope that the government will continue to look at that in detail next come to what be no doubt the issue of the hour in london and in the uxbridge and south ruislip by election ulez we inner and outer london mps bang on about ulez but it be important to continue raise the issue can not overstate the damage that ulez will do to business to the poor and to charity in my constituency and across the whole of greater london and outside it be think particularly of those constituency in which people do not have the right to vote to get rid of the man who be impose ulez on we the mayor of london he have the audacity to say that people should get out of their car and on to public transport yet in my constituency he have scrap the go sutton bus and the tramlink extension he have announce the new superloop in my constituency that be just reannouncement of bus route that have be there for over decade he have announce no new service whatsoever there be nothing come to help people make that transition to public transport there be absolutely no support in place in central london he be cut the historic no bus route and the scrappage scheme have prove an absolute flop welcome the fact that the government have very strong line on ulez but we should continue to make it absolutely clear that it should not go ahead look forward to hear the judgment of the judicial review hopefully by the end of the month in the time leave to would quickly like to touch on education an area of particular concern for my constituent we have some of the good school in the country they feature in the top school for grade result every single year and the teacher in my constituency do an absolutely fabulous job day in day out be absolutely thrilled that the government have recognise that and award record funding increase of nearly million to school in carshalton and wallington that be incredibly welcome in order to give all our young people the good start in life could encourage the government to continue look into the issue of childcare the reform that have be make be absolutely welcome but there be certainly more to do we on the women and equalities committee can tell the government that childcare issue adversely affect woman in particular as it be almost always woman who bear the brunt of they we hope that the government will look to go far in their childcare reform but welcome the effort make so far be delighted that my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris mention special educational need in her speech join she in urge the government to go far and fast with their ambition to bring down waiting time for an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis because the wait time be completely out of control in my constituency many family who can not afford to are be force to go private to get diagnosis of course under the children and families act diagnosis be supposedly not need to get an education health and care plan but almost entirely child be be refuse ehcp unless they have one we be up against brick wall to be honest when it come to deal with child and adolescent mental health service in my constituency be sure that it be the same across the country know that the government and in particular the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend the member for lewes maria caulfield be grasp the issue with both hand and be very keen to get it sort welcome that and wish the under secretary every success but hope that the government can come back to we in the autumn with more flesh out action plan for get wait time down and allow child to fulfil their potential want to touch on police as be sure many colleague will historically my quiet corner of south london have be know as one of the safe borough of london the london boroughs of sutton and of richmond upon thames be often in competition with each other to be the safe london borough to live in however post pandemic there seem to have be concern increase in what some might view as low level crime but it be truly worrying to the people who experience it can not begin to say how many time as be scroll on facebook or nextdoor in particular see ring doorbell footage of people go up and down residential street at night try car door and front door not always with success but their doing be often link to crime elsewhere in the area welcome that the met have now change its approach and agree to attend every single call out for burglary for example that have result in several thousand additional arrest in london for this crime and that be to be welcome hope that the home secretary will be able to reiterate our ambition to bring down crime be very supportive of the met action plan for london but we do need police and crime commissioner for london who get that and want to tackle that we do not have that with our current mayor so sincerely hope that londoners will see fit to get rid of this fail mayor in year time let finish up on the nhs as someone who have work in the nhs who be bear at st helier hospital in south london and whose life be save not once but twice by the staff at st helier thank the government

in the past year have run quite number of event and campaign locally and could not have do so without the help of lot of different people begin work experience campaign last year because find and think most member would find this if they check that work experience have dramatically decline in the post covid period with so many people work from home it have be one of the thing drop yet it be crucial for people in their school year and later teen to get experience of the workplace understand how it work make connection and observe how they should behave start the campaign because young

run couple of crime summit with locally they be organise after people have report an increase number of crime incident particularly antisocial behaviour and also business burglary the summit be very much for constituent to be able to raise their concern directly with the police and find out what be go on but think it be fair to say that the police find from hear from people locally that they could be do well particularly in the handling of antisocial behaviour from the focus they give it locally when out and about to how people report it people be say when want to report an incident it take minute online to do your form and the police be unaware it take that long and have go away to address that also want to thank few colleague on the government benches the minister for science research and innovation for take part in my science and tech forum which he do with company in harwell and milton park so that they could talk about the challenge they be face the secretary of state

infrastructure hear that every single day since be first elect every week when knock on door and in every email receive know my constituency be not the only one face this challenge but there be particularly an issue when it come to health service we all want grove station reopen well road and so on but we have not see an increase in the number of gps that we need for the people we have in the constituency health survey run early in the year find that of people feel we do not have enough gps for the number of people we have locally the great western park estate have be wait eight year for its promise surgery and we have another estate be build right by it western valley these two estate alone will add people to the area and there be not single new doctor much as the lib dem run council and local health leader all say they be commit to try to solve this problem we be just not see any progress be go to keep bang on about this because when people feel that an increase population affect their quality of life it be no wonder that they do not want to see more people be add to their area they become resistant to house when they might not have be before and we just have to bang people head together and try to make some progress in this area my second issue be more local one which be the aea technology pension campaign part of aea be privatised transfer to new company in the and the advice that employee receive about their pension at that time prove to be inaccurate and misleading lot of people transfer their pension without know the increase risk that they would face and that company go bust those people end up in the pension protection fund and have push for year to try to get someone to look at their case finally this year we get the national audit office to look at it and the public accounts committee have also look at it we now await the government response but be very pleased that people be support our campaign my hon friend the member for newbury laura farris be one of the people who have be support it because those people have be try for so long to get their case hear and now it be finally be hear my third issue be the local electricity no bill be the lead sponsor of that bill and just under half of member in this place now support it it would remove the barrier for people who want to be able to generate energy locally through renewable source at the moment the start up cost be too high it cost in the region of million to get go which be far too much for village or local organisation that want to generate energy we have be work on that bill collectively work closely with the minister in charge the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie and be just on the cusp of make progress can not talk about that progress at the moment but although the amendment be not accept in the lords we have have very constructive relationship with the minister in the commons we be go to have some good news to announce on that front which think will make the bill supporter very pleased my last thing as say be just special mention be patron of number of local charity that have talk about in this place before such as and secret santa but be also patron of charity call team mikayla it be incredible how many of the charity in my local area be set up by child this young lady mikayla beames have brain tumour at the age of

it be an incredibly proud moment for she deserved recognition just want to take this opportunity to congratulate she mr deputy speaker wish you and everybody who work in parliament very restful recess as always it be privilege to follow my hon friend the member for wantage david johnston as many member have already say we all aspire to represent and promote our community in the way sir david amess be famous for unlike he do not have town that be big enough for to campaign to make it into city however do have newton aycliffe which have its birthday this year it be also the birthday of its community newspaper newton news and for newton press it be year get that wrong two week ago so need to correct that detail at the start would like to commend the hon member for swansea east carolyn harris for her work on the menopause and give call out to constituent of mine kathrine winter who work very hard in that space as well also offer my support to rob potts in his campaign to be the police and crime commissioner for durham and darlington in the upcoming election and encourage the current pcc to make sure that the community retain its complement of police officer which be currently under threat because the facility be be challenge by have to share with the fire station that need to be sort in the short term and also critically in the long term do not want to have to wait for rob to get elect before we get this sort out it need to be do much early than that the main theme want to talk about be opportunity through education education be lifelong opportunity be elect on manifesto that recognise and promise to address the need to equalise educational opportunity across our nation break for summer recess give we an opportunity to look back on what we have do so far and will talk about the progress we be make in sedgefield it have always be accept that the good way to improve your situation or to get out of poverty be through work and the well your education the well the chance to take work opportunity when they arise it be important that the government help to deliver the platform and that student be able to make informed choice in of the school in my constituency be rat good or outstanding now be as the appg for leave behind neighbourhood that chair find education be critical even more so in leave behind neighbourhood so thank local trust for their support look to the dormant asset scheme to deliver community wealth fund to help these community since the government have commit to invest in number of our local school include woodham academy ferryhill station primary school forest park school and greenfield community college be thrill at the work go on at woodham academy in newton aycliffe the complete rebuild of this secondary school be expect to be finish in september next year so we be one academic year away from its reopening the development be fund through the department for education school rebuilding programme and facility include swimming pool sport hall and fitness studio as well as benefit student it will be open to the community outside school hour woodham academy be do everything it can to ensure that the building be green from the ground up with heat pump and photovoltaic panel to reduce the carbon impact it will have electric vehicle charge facility but also cycle parking and think the government need to continue their effort to encourage our child to walk or cycle to school wherever possible ferryhill station be another local school benefit from the rebuilding programme build in the century the school have be enjoy by generation of student but it be definitely show its age although ferryhill station plan be at an early stage than woodham as former chair of the governor at the primary school be confident that they will be just as ambitious and look forward to see the outcome from next year we will also have forest park school small special educational need school for student age to that be focus on enable they to grow academically and socially it plan to offer adapt extracurricular activity so that student who find standard offering difficult to access can still enjoy they have be to the school the way it be develop be outstanding and really look forward to its delivery development at greenfield community college in aycliffe will also help to deliver improved provision and look forward to those concluding as we all know though school be nothing without excellent teacher have visit many of the school in sedgefield and applaud all the teacher teaching assistant kitchen staff and estate staff who deliver for our young people all of they make fantastic effort throughout the pandemic year and many have make huge difference but our young people have still have the most disrupted education of any generation for many year congratulate all those who persevere and have continue their education call out in particular the ferryhill ambassador for their community engagement hardwick primary in sedgefield for be nominate as one of the top school worldwide for innovation and deaf hill primary for its success in the kellogg breakfast club award when call out some school but miss out other know it be risk but from welbeck in the north to hurworth in the south bishopton in the east and heighington in the west and everywhere in the square mile in between there be example of excellence as student progress their opportunity come from have choice and apply themselves it be crucial that their choice be inform and that they see option like university technical college south durham rat third out of school in england for student enter an apprenticeship question have be ask about some utcs and level but the partnership utc south durham have with hitachi and gestamp mean we have an outstanding facility in newton aycliffe as the prime minister and the secretary of state for education have say university choice need to be clear student need to be very aware of the life option that will arise from their choice and the university have to provide course that deliver full value sedgefield be not bless with university but we be surround by they we have durham newcastle northumbria teesside and sunderland all of which give complementary opportunity for student to choose from be an alumnus of durham study night class at teesside and have be to the newcastle and northumbria campus while space must be leave for those who want non vocational study it be imperative that university engage with business to deliver the workforce of the future have talk with many business about their need and have see some fantastic engagement recently particularly in durham and northumbria in support of our grow space and semiconductor industry northumbria university recently receive million award from the uk space agency to develop new laser base communication system good public transport service be essential for our student to get to school or college but such service be not available for people in the trimdons ferryhill cornforth fishburn and sedgefield in particular just like my hon friend the member for darlington peter gibson believe it be imperative that arriva and our local council get together to solve the bus problem that exist in our area have listen carefully to what the hon gentleman have say be member of the education committee in order for our student to get to college or apprenticeship they need not only good public transport but good quality independent and impartial career information educational advice and guidance to direct they there in the first place and to show they what opportunity exist be afraid to say however that independent and impartial advice be not always available in many institution that provide education to those below the age of can only agree about the need for that information drive around an industrial estate in aycliffe that have job and lot of box in it behind each one of those box there be so many different career and opportunity get visibility of that be absolutely crucial be pleased to say that north east mayoralty have be create cover the area from newton aycliffe in my sedgefield constituency all the way through northumberland to the scottish border the area have be allocate one of the investment zone and hope it will position itself as an arc from sedgefield to blyth recognise innovation and science throughout the north east attract the right prime to support that should be critical part of the role of the new metro mayor when they be appoint that prime could then be key platform for build career path and educational pathway for the north east student student need to know about how such pathway can lead to great career when it come to communicate opportunity role model be great tool one of the good role model have come across be our new chancellor of durham university dr fiona hill with her story from the back street of bishop auckland to washington dc or as she call it from the coal house to the white house fiona be commit to support social mobility and could not be more supportive of what she be try to achieve while highlight extraordinary story like fiona we need the breadth of opportunity to be visible too we need to shine light on and support the extraordinary business and research in our area because that will inspire people to apply it be through personal application that opportunity arise in my youth there be golfer call gary player who say the hard work the lucky get we need to inspire our young

the many interesting point that have be raise will not do that nor will make lengthy reference to my constituency instead would like to offer some hope would like to counter the declinist narrative that say the uk be in bad way that our prospect be poor that this government be do the wrong thing to the wrong people make ill advise decision about the company we keep all for the wrong motif and that thing will continue to go downhill disagree think that that be selective at good and misrepresentation and falsehood at worst the fact be that the uk have great past and prospect of great future incidentally point with which know sir david would have agree wholeheartedly the evidence be that we be do many of the right thing we be build important link for the good of reason from strong foundation the world be increasingly unstable point the defence secretary himself make recently and yet our system have outlast other and adapt to bad this speech be about the importance of our union the most successful political union in history and why it have work why it matter now and why it be the foundation for our future let we consider these foundation we benefit from helpful geography temperate climate and strategic location the sea have act as both barrier and connector to the rest of the globe internally connection and infrastructure of canal road and rail have make we strong as we have trade among one another our system of common law offer an unparalleled environment for the flourishing testing and implementation of idea contrast that with restrictive regulatory approach that seek to predict and control we still have in our society culture of police by consent albeit much test one we enjoy safety in our street and of course the security and fiscal firepower that come with be the fifth or sixth depend on who we believe large economy in the world we stand here today as inheritor of these great asset of system that be stable and provide for smooth transition of power despite considerable test from without and within what part of we could have endure what we have be through as whole on its own or achieve what we have together on its own of course these foundation include our identity who we be and what we think value be not recipe or menu and truth be not some kind of sushi bar conveyor of ever change delicacy that pass before we truth too do not change what then have we struggle for and fight over be these not the thing we value where have be the act of courage beauty genius and tragedy to secure our freedom establish democracy promote fairness inspire hope and vision and protect our border for without they what be we we have build institution on these thing cenotaph in every village speak of the ultimate sacrifice pay for share endeavour be conscious that by election be happen today they speak to the great system of check and balance we have put in place to secure the thing that we value here note the big heartedness of union think it have to make room for those who do not want to be part of it contrast that with the self diminish purity spiral of other way of thinking the union must embrace the difficulty that come with that sense of inclusion to exclude be to deny itself be our story not one of different part come together at different time for different reason and in different way do our own personal story not also reflect this be this britishness we have by merit of be throw together on small set of rock on the periphery of europe the story we each carry speak of this my mother be naturalised british citizen be bear in wales and be proud welshman and proud to be british when we look at the demographic we find that one in eight scottish one in five welsh and one in nine northern irish people live in another part of the uk be not the story of the union simply collection and weave together of our own story cord of many many strand that be not easily break and with strength that care when covid fall million job be save through vital furlough and self employment support this government act two million people repeat million be add to universal credit in seven day nothing else like that have be see on earth we now have energy support tailor and with price cap estimate at billion what then for those link where do they take we here confess concern because support our democratically establish devolution and institution but our union be no federal construct the unintended consequence of devolution have be to replace covenant with contract trust with transaction and nurture relationship with burgeon regulation who of we would manage our own relationship in the way we approach devolution sadly it have facilitate institutional capture devolution have become for some tower that must be build ever strong and ever high that do allow we to see far but it take the occupant no close to the promise land they seek look outward beyond our shore we have prove for example in the commonwealth our ability to form deepen and maintain work relationship country seek our help and heed our advice and today we be respect around the world we have the world fourth large diplomatic network with post in country we be member of the united nations security council and the our system of common law which have already mention be emulate and be be implement around the world now as result of this government we be the only country on earth to have free trade deal with the two big trading bloc the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the european economic area of course we be also stand up to russia do not want to lead on this but we have the fourth well fund military and we lead coalition of country in the gulf ensure the safe passage of good and fuel through that stretch of water in time of domestic crisis we mobilise member of our armed force for the covid support force in every part of the uk such foundation have build strong relationship for we and what have we do with they favourable environment have help we to establish history and tradition of manufacturing and innovation the connection that be around we have make we force in international trade deliver one of the world large economy and establish london as lead global city in my recent speech on artificial intelligence in this chamber highlight the risk of regulatory reproach to that industry uk common law by contrast foster immense opportunity the right environment for the most exciting technology be here in the life science we have again see that regulatory approach have chilling effect the eu clinical trial directive stop of trial and double approval time and the european medicines agency take twice as long to approve cancer drug as the united states food and drug administration instead in this country because of the action of this government we be see pharmacology investment through the like biontech and grail and the potential to unleash uk biobank and the genomes project through genetic engineering the potential productivity gain for farmer within generation be staggering in fact when it come to research and development four of the top world university be here in the uk unencumbered by trillion eu bail out we have be able to invest further third in our own raise it to record billion have be deliberately provocative in some of those illustration mr deputy speaker and some of they be contest but that make my next point the opportunity order before you do that could you finish by pm please be introduce an eight minute limit thank you mr deputy speaker be go to say that the opportunity to contest those idea and the crucible for do so be here in the uk what then of the future leadership be look within look up and look ahead we have do that through the darkness of world war conflict and suffering we have respond to the threat of pandemic and war in ukraine we have lead we have see beyond the boundary of the eu that we be constrain by the first part of any plan for this country must therefore be collective response together as united kingdom we be not prepare for the last war or for old customer aukus and the cptpp be all about respond to the future and the opportunity and threat there what well testimony be there than the fact that we be the most attractive country in the amongst to year old nation do not define itself through introspection but through action as we emerge from the storm of recent year we british find ourselves once again the author of our own distinctive story as with the britain of previous age the story be likely to offer fresh source of collective pride beauty and dismay we will write this together with the value we defend and the word that we speak will finish by call on the minister to bring the minister for the union the

funding for our school order sorry but we have to leave it there thank you very much but in sir david inimitable style you get lot in there on march this year the home office state that within four month that be now raf scampton would be up and run to its full capacity of illegal migrant it be now the end of july and as of today there be zero migrant house at scampton in may table write question ask when work would begin all the home office basically say in the ministerial reply be shortly and as soon as possible the home office have not even take control of the site from the ministry of defence it have not commence the survey work need even to establish an implementation plan it have not do an airwave control plan and it have not develop mitigation strategy for safe entry to and exit from the site it have not make any proposal regard how to manage the wide range contamination on the site we know there be certainly asbestos on the site unfortunately despite my request the home office refuse to release the material safety data sheet for scampton early this month table write question ask what assessment the home office have make of the potential radioactivity level at scampton receive an email from cold war raf veteran who spend nine year at scampton service vulcan bomber he report during that time the raf ensure that our work clothing be regularly launder to ensure complete removal of all radiation particle in the interest of our health and safety the vulcan aircraft be cover in radiation particle particularly during high level sortie and we be tasked to wash they down on regular basis at specially prepare area on the airfield the wash teams be supply with special protective clothing to undertake this task be afraid that the home office reply be less than reassuring it merely assert that it will ensure that all accommodation be safe habitable fit for purpose and meet all regulatory requirement the government have utilise class emergency power for their plan they notify west lindsey district council of that on april so their emergency power will expire on april under class any and all development relate to those power must be remove from the site by april that be under eight month from the actual date illegal migrant be expect to arrive at the site west lindsey apply to get the former officer mess list on march it have chase that up and understand that it will be present to the department for culture media and sport imminently but we be still wait perhaps the home office should accept our advice that scampton be far more complicated site than it anticipate at the beginning of this saga any temporary housing of migrant there risk be so temporary as to be useless and ineffective meanwhile we have million regeneration package sign seal and champ at the bit for delivery this be once in generation opportunity we can transform scampton into mixed use site protect the history of the base while open up commercial aerospace defence hospitality and educational opportunity there will be red arrows visitor centre the runway will be keep open for use and the sky will still be use for red arrows training and practice flight business jet will be able to use scampton open up opportunity for enterprise across west lindsey space innovation business park would bring research and development to lincolnshire drone and other unmanned aerial vehicle can be develop at scampton the midland aerospace corridor can be an engine for growth there be plan for business incubator to help small business to grow into large one scampton holdings want to promote small business even beyond the business incubator zone by create number of low cost live work unit to help microbusinesse the protection of raf scampton history be at the heart of the regeneration package it would see historic building use by the dambusters restore and utilise for educational informational and touristic purpose scampton will become centre for aviation heritage and the maintenance of historic aircraft conference centre will link it with hotel and hospitality facility but scampton aviation history would not be dead the runway would be keep operational and license under the civil aviation authority the restrict flying zone above and around scampton would be maintain it could still be use by the red arrows the last time the red arrows leave scampton they come back because the airspace be ideal even though they will not be base on the ground they will still be able to use the sky the long term hope as say be for scampton to be develop as spaceport there be potential for horizontal launch of small satellite since raf scampton closure be announce in west lindsey district council have move heaven and earth to try to come up with good regeneration bid my fellow lincolnshire mp and know how badly thing can go when surplus ministry of defence property be just dump on the open market no consultation with local no discussion about local need or priority and no crafting of investment or creation of economic opportunity just flog it off and it be no long the mod responsibility that be what we see with previous disposal be determined and west lindsey be determine that we must not let that happen this time here be an ideal site just mile from lincoln and precisely where our economy could use shot in the arm west lindsey district council engage with local people and community and consult and listen to stakeholder business and partner the simple goal be to create sustainable future for raf scampton that unlock the full potential of the site the plan that west lindsey and scampton holdings come up with be fund commercially viable and deliverable it would keep the airfield open create cascade of further opportunity it would protect the important heritage of the base and add amenity for people around west lindsey lincolnshire and the whole country to make use of meanwhile the home office plan throw spanner in the work as we have see its propose timeline have be wildly off course the investment opportunity that we want to unlock require immediate access to the site in order to kick start delivery key feature of the site such as the runway and its associated operational function be be neglect even the grass be grow and building many of they list be at risk if the restricted airspace be permanently stand down it would negate many of the air space and satellite investment that we want to deliver west lindsey have bring legal challenge to the home office plan that be proceed at pace my understanding be that if the environmental impact assessment be find to be flawed the class emergency power may be render invalid we seek assurance from the secretary of state that scampton will not be use to accommodate illegal immigrant until final resolution be reach after the judicial review we in west lindsey in lincolnshire be part of the great united kingdom time and again this proposal have be announce we have state that we be willing to do our bit but all the home office seem to need be bit of hard standing somewhere anywhere in which to temporarily house these economic migrant in portacabin accommodation choose scampton of all place which be on the cusp of remarkable game change regeneration be the height of folly it be mind numbingly unwise it show that any claim of the government to join up thinking be totally divorced from reality all be not lose there be still time for minister to drop these plan have show how much trouble they cause and how little reward be to be gain from carry they through if our court case fail and somehow the home office be allow to advance with its proposal we will need to see how much of the site can be free up as soon as possible the home office want to use only of the footprint surely the majority of the site can be hand over to west lindsey and scampton holdings so that they can crack on with the regeneration that be so dearly need let they get on and finish the job apologise for have to speak so quickly but this be an incredibly important issue there be an impending court case and lot to say and everything must be put on the record in this house first

prime minister present report with the idea of develop freeport see the advantage of that to my constituency and establish the freeport all party parliamentary group to push the government in that direction be delighted that that policy be adopt and the freeport in the humber be now establish and open for business another thing that would make the area even more attractive to potential investment be the conclusion of the greater lincolnshire devolution deal which have be in and out of various ministers file for number of year it be crucial if we be to get the good advantage

which be one of those issue that have come to the fore every now and again all government and council make what seem like routine decision and then it suddenly come back to bite they suggest to the minister that this might be one of they and that it need some further consideration the rail sector have do much in recent year to assist in particular blind and disabled people and it be those people who be most up in arm about this project compromise be surely available may suggest one perhaps before implementation and hope that implementation be delay preferably long delay we could at least know where the staff will be redeploy and the hour for which they will available at the station there be railway station in my constituency and only one at cleethorpes have ticket office the objection from north lincolnshire council which have be send to the secretary of state say the council have previously work in partnership with transpennine express to refurbish and upgrade the ticket office at

experience the anticipated benefit from the council contribution yet again public money have go into improve facility that only short time later be close this be economic madness urge the minister to

rise to present petition to urge reversal of the decision by darlington borough council to end the provision of two hour free car parking in our town centre it have be sign by more than people in just few short week with both the lead petitioner and the seconder own and run business in the town centre since monday july people drive into town have face parking charge lead to increase cost for resident and put the viability of our town centre and its trader in jeopardy with local business already report reduction in footfall since the reintroduction of charge fully endorse this petition and its content the petition state the petition of resident of the united kingdom declare that the removal of the two hour free car parking in darlington town centre will have detrimental effect on the local community and on the local economy far declare that it must be reinstate by darlington borough council the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to encourage darlington borough council to turn immediately on their decision to re introduce these car parking charge in darlington town centre and the petitioner remain etc scunthorpe station ticket office motion make and question propose that this house do now wood be grateful to have the opportunity to raise the propose closure of the ticket office at scunthorpe train station wait for an adjournment debate for several week and two have come along at once feel fortunate today thank the minister for his time today know he will be have busy day so be grateful we have the opportunity to talk about this issue early this month many member include receive an email from transpennine express to tell we that in conjunction with train operator across the country it will be consult on close number of ticket office that it be responsible for staffing and reduce the number of hour that staff be present in station the proposal as they stand be for the entire closure of the ticket office in scunthorpe station and to change the number of hour that staff will be present in the station currently it be staff from be to pm monday to saturday that will change to be to pm on sundays the current hour of be to pm will change to be to pm that be ridiculous it be halving of the hour that staff will be there to be clear that be completely and entirely unacceptable be particularly concerned about the impact the cut could have on elderly resident in my constituency the closure of the ticket office will force people to use the machine or their phone or to pay for ticket at home use their computer my understanding be that old traveller be less likely to be digitally connected and to have the know how to use the machine accept that for some it will be fine but for many it will not in the absence of ticket office they may find themselves stuck they be also more likely to be dependent on cash one in five old people rely on cash for payment accord to age uk and under these proposal it may not always be possible for people to go into station and buy ticket use cash that can not be right the minister will know that have express concern about the propose ticket office closure at darlington with million of intervention in darlington station it seem short sighted to lose that facility do my hon friend agree that the need of disabled people include those with visual impairment and wheelchair user who can not reach the screen of ticket machine will be severely impact my hon friend be spot on in his observation be also concerned about the impact that the closure could have on disabled people and that issue have be raise with by disabled member of my community in scunthorpe accord to the uk consumer digital index from lloyds bank people with disability be less likely to have digital skill for life mean that in the absence of ticket office they may be leave at disadvantage it be just not acceptable that we would make it hard for disabled people to travel around the country on top of the difficulty in access ticket the reduction in staffing time be of huge concern in relation to disabled member of the community and passenger who need extra help customer with hear impairment for example may find it difficult to obtain information if staffing hour be reduce particularly if they rely on lip read the screen that have the information up for the train do not always work can give my hon friend practical example use scunthorpe station last thursday after attend an event just outside the town the ticket office be close check train time before and everything be run get on to the platform the information board be not work and no train turn up at the due time people be leave scratch their head try to find out the information from their phone the information have to be readily available for all people include blind people and the disabled and fully support my hon friend in her effort to keep the ticket office open thank my hon friend for that intervention which we do not even set up ticket machine be of course not infallible they can break and can take while to be replace or repair it will simply be more difficult for some passenger to get the good deal possible without have person there to speak to be also concerned about have wait room open without staff supervision which may make they magnet for antisocial behaviour something that we work really hard in scunthorpe to tackle we do not want to invite that be not alone in make these objection they be share widely by resident in scunthorpe ahead of the debate and immediately after the proposal be announce reach out to my constituent on this issue we be not backward in come forward in scunthorpe and my constituent have be very clear what their view be of the respondent to the survey an overwhelming be broadly people who use the station we have record that information do not support the closure of the ticket office and the change to staffing hour one of the key issue that respondent highlight be the importance of recognise the impact that the sole use of ticket machine or online purchase would have on elderly or disabled people respondent point out that some people might not be able to use the ticket machine or purchase online without assistance with highlight customer service many state quite simply that they prefer face to face service and the ability to ask for advice on the quick route and make other general inquiry regardless of what time they be at the station do my hon friend agree that many of our resident understand that get people out from behind the screen and on to the platform would be helpful but when hour be reduce nobody be there to help resident understand when the train be come in accrington we see lot of delay at our train station and if nobody be at the ticket office we do not know what will happen next do she agree that the reduction in hour be key in this process my hon friend be absolutely right be quite prepared to be pragmatic about this issue if the reality be that the staff member would be able to help for the exact same number of hour but that be simply not the case another issue raise by my constituent be safety and security they say that they be very concerned about solo and elderly traveller and people travel late into the evening recently pick up family member couple of time who have be away to do course and be use the train service to do that would not like to think that at on winter night there would be no member of staff at the station on its website transpennine express state this more modern approach to customer service will mean the traditional ticket office be no long require as our staff will be able to help customer purchase ticket on the concourse in its impact assessment specifically for scunthorpe it say that customer will experience more visible staff presence at station struggle to understand how that can be the case when the staff will be there for only half the amount of time they be there at the moment to that just sound like nonsense they be warm word from transpennine express but you have to get up little early in the morning to sneak something like that past the resident of scunthorpe scunthorpe ticket office be not unused nearly ticket be sell there last year and an awful lot of resident rely on its service to buy their train ticket know that the decision have be take by the current transpennine express management but the government be not fully remove from influence over it feel that it be my duty as constituency mp to represent my constituent view on this matter and push the government to ensure that ticket office remain open closure would undermine the effort that the government have make to improve customer service on our railway this come after period when we have receive substandard level of service in scunthorpe close the ticket office would be an obvious backward step hope that the minister have take on board the view of my constituent and will do all that he can to ensure that we keep ticket office open thank the staff who work at scunthorpe ticket office this must be very worrying and difficult time for they they do fantastic job and my complaint be no reflection on they they do wonderful job and express my sympathy to they at this time congratulate my hon friend the member for scunthorpe holly mumby croft on secure this debate on the proposal regard the scunthorpe station ticket office scunthorpe station as she state be manage by transpennine train which understand propose to close all ticket office window at scunthorpe station and move staff to other station area where they be well place to help passenger buy ticket to provide advice and to give assistance there have be huge shift in the way passenger purchase ticket nearly half of all ticket sale in rail be make online around one in every transaction take place at ticket office in down from one in three decade early equal to of rail revenue understand from transpennine train that statistic for scunthorpe station reflect this position with of transaction from scunthorpe station be make from the ticket office the figure that have be supply to show that be equivalent to transaction per day from the ticket office it be important that industry take step to modernise the passenger experience by move staff out from ticket office to be more visible and accessible around the station these reform will bring our station in tune with what customer expect from other modern and responsive service include supermarket and bank where customer assistant help with information and support and help make digital transaction on the shop floor welcome the fact that the rail industry have start this process by launch consultation on the future of ticket office under the ticketing and settlement agreement process that process set out well establish mechanism that train operator must follow when propose major change to ticket office opening hour include closure do my hon friend agree that member of staff can be more visible only if they be physically in the station it be impossible for member of staff to assist passenger buy ticket from ticket machine if they be not there the aim be redeployment aim as understand it from the train operator but take the point with regard to hour my hon friend will be aware that just set out the process this be consultation process ultimately it fall back to the passenger group who represent passenger to discuss these proposal with each train operator if they be not satisfied that for example the accessibility requirement will be meet which have to be legally meet they will rescope those change if they be not agree by the train operator and the passenger group feel it need to be take far it will be for the secretary of state to determine her point be well make will just leave it there give this be live consultation train operator begin the passenger consultation on july this be an industry lead process with each train operator manage its own station by station consultation understand my hon friend be particularly concerned about the impact of the change on elderly and disabled passenger indeed my hon friend the member for darlington peter gibson make the same point as part of the ticketing and settlement agreement process train operator must set out the improvement or alternative they propose to put in place to support the need of passenger and include that in the notice send to the other operator and the passenger body to which just refer each operator approach must take into consideration the potential impact on individual with accessibility need recognise that not everyone have access to smart phone or the internet and that some passenger will prefer to use cash or to speak to member of staff this week meet with accessibility group again to hear their view directly and to encourage they to work with the train operator to help shape these idea also meet with the train operator this week and reiterate the need to ensure proposal work for every passenger scotrail look at this in term of ticket office hour and whatnot last year after the consultation it row back from the idea it be go to close only three ticket office and to reduce lot of hour the minister say that each operator be look at individual station but be little confused travel from glasgow central on regular basis avanti have plan to close the glasgow central ticket office even small percentage of those ticket the queue go literally from the platform to outside the station be quite lot of ticket the lner have choose not to close the edinburgh waverley ticket office with broadly similar ratio in ticket sale why be one closing and the other still open what be the difference between they it be certainly the case that number of station be not part of the propose closure just over ticket office will remain open another example be manchester where the ticket office at manchester piccadilly will not remain open if these proposal be follow through but victoria and oxford road ticket office will remain open give that the hon member be also the snp shadow transport spokesperson will do he the honour of write to he so can set out in more detail exactly why one station have be choose over another and the methodology indeed perhaps can put that in the library for all to read as modern ticketing and payment method be roll out more widely we will work with industry to ensure that everyone remain able to buy ticket staff will be available to provide additional support to those who need and want it include by help passenger to use ticket machine and provide the type of assistance that my hon friend the member for cleethorpes martin vickers say occur under the current system in the event that suitable ticket can not be purchase from the station of departure passenger will not be expect to travel out of their way to buy ticket and will be able to buy en route or at their final destination for lot of people there be great deal of anxiety about the idea of get on train and go somewhere when they do not have ticket in their hand or on their phone be probably bolshie enough to get on the train and hope can sort it out somewhere along the journey but many people will not be if that change need to go ahead it need to be widely publicise and people need to be give the confidence to be able to travel in that way my hon friend make very good point it be certainly uppermost in my mind that there will need to be additional training forty three per cent of all station currently do not have ticket office and it be perfectly possible for passenger from those station to travel as they do now sometimes ticket machine be not operate at that particular juncture the staff on the train will be aware of the situation and will act accordingly on the train use be use to people get on board and say ve be unable to purchase ticket can purchase one and in all my year have never experience any response but yes that absolutely fine rather than go down the penalty fare route my hon friend make good point though and will make sure it be follow up will the minister give way will and then will make little progress want to raise point relate to his comment about move staff out of the ticket office on to the platform to provide assistance at darlington station the ticket machine be in front of the barrier urge he to make sure that where staff be move out from behind the counter they be on the right side of the ticket barrier so that they can provide assistance make one further point with regard to the time an app can provide people with the opportunity to purchase before train leave the station my hon friend have make some good point today include about the design process encourage hon member to continue to come up with the example of where thing need to work well ninety nine per cent of all ticket be available from ticket machine or online but that mean that be not be work at pace to increase that number my hon friend be right about the whereabouts and location of staff they need to be there so that passenger can buy the ticket and then access the barrier we will follow that through and encourage he also to continue to come up with example some operator be propose change to staff hour at station such as transpennine proposal for scunthorpe station as mention by my hon friend the members for scunthorpe and for hyndburn sara britcliffe transpennine have tell that it be clear in its consultation that all currently staff station will remain staffed but take the point about the hour reiterate to my hon friend the member for scunthorpe the point about the consultation process and the appeal process should an appeal need to be make rise have stir my hon friend the member for cleethorpes from his place if we take at face value what the train company be say that this be an effort to save money and they be move staff out of the ticket office on to the platform be the minister reassure by they that there will be saving there will of course be some member of staff who will not wish to make that journey as their job change to be multi skilled and multifacete within the station as oppose to solely work behind the ticket office in such case where there be number of ticket office staff available perhaps one may come out and do that multifaceted role but the other two may not wish to go on that journey that may be an issue for they and the station recognise though that member have highlight the challenge of situation in which only one staff member be present and perhaps the hour be not exactly the same refer again to the live consultation that should be feed back people will be aware of the appeal process because have just detail it and we will of course see what occur at the end of the process hope be not repeat myself when say that passenger will remain able to secure staff assistance and will continue to have access to station facility such as wait room and toilet as currently provide be the minister concerned about the possible risk of antisocial behaviour if we move from have staff station to unstaffed period of time in the evening which be what be propose in scunthorpe the london underground move from have ticket office staff to the type of model be describe and do not believe there be any impact vis vis antisocial behaviour again encourage my hon friend to put forward such point there will of course be engagement and there be requirement to meet threshold to ensure that group with characteristic be look after and that we do not increase antisocial behaviour encourage she to follow up on those point which assure she have raise myself my hon friend refer to station safety follow the reform the uk rail network be one of the safe in europe and we will never compromise the safety of passenger on our railway as the industry take forward vital reform safety remain top priority for all and certainly for it be expect that move staff out of ticket office will make they more visible to passenger and hope that it will enhance safety when member of staff be on the platform will the minister give way will give way one more time my hon friend be work hard be so grateful to the minister do not mean to be flippant but should point out that although move staff out from ticket office may make they more visible move they entirely out of the station so that they be not there certainly will not be particularly worried about period of time when there will no long be staff at the station hear my hon friend point refer of course to the fact that there be consultation hope she appreciate the argument be make that while the staff be there if they be away from the ticket office and on the frontline they be accessible can give information and can make people more secure she make the point that if there be reduction in hour there will not be member of staff there refer again to the feedback to the consultation but absolutely take that point do not want to pre empt anything in respect of the outcome but her voice be hear in the chamber and her point be on the record mr deputy speaker no doubt want to wrap up so should get to the end of my speech encourage my hon friend all right hon and hon member and all constituent to respond to the consultation and will encourage transpennine train and all other operator to take those response into account as they finalise their approach the consultation provide the opportunity to scrutinise the train operate company proposal to ensure that they will work for passenger passenger will be able to find out more about the proposal at their local station or online if passenger want to raise view they can contact the relevant passenger body london travelwatch or transport focus the passenger body will consider any feedback from the public on the ticket office proposal will meet they shortly to ensure that they have the resource to fulfil their important role believe that the industry propose reform should enable staff to provide more flexible agile and personal service reiterate that my hon friend should encourage her constituent to engage in the consultation process for scunthorpe station ticket office as that be the good way to ensure that their view be consider once again thank my hon friend for secure this important debate on station ticket office wish you mr deputy speaker wonderful summer and thank all the staff in this great place include the police who keep we secure wish everyone all the official who work across whitehall as well as all our great people inside this building wonderful summer will be spend three week on the
