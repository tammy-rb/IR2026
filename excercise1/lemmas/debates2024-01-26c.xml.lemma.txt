may first thank the hon member for ogmore chris elmore for bring the bill before the house and all the other hon member who have speak on this important matter today he have be incredibly constructive and pragmatic in our deliberation on what we should do in this area and thank he for that it be always pleasure to work with he on this issue and we have work together on number of issue over the year would like to express my wholehearte agreement with the intent behind the hon member bill his speech be incredibly touching and he speak passionately about the need for the bill but also about the devastating impact on individual his point about the future plan of one life suddenly go to ash be incredibly powerful and express my sympathy for mr thorpe whom he refer to in his speech it be always great pleasure to take forward legislation that make meaningful difference be lucky enough to take through parliament two private member bills prior to become minister one be on parental bereavement leave and people ask why do this not exist in the first place when people say that to we as be sure they have say to the hon member about his bill we know we be on the right track in my experience we normally do not do these thing on our own we do they jointly and his work with my hon friend the member for broxtowe darren henry have be really important in bring the bill forward it be clear that we should look at what more we can do to support employ parent who lose their partner around the time of their child birth and who do not currently qualify for statutory leave entitlement because they do not meet continuity of service requirement that is they have not be in the job for the require length of time to qualify the principle of this bill have support across the house and be pleased to hear that reflect in the debate again thank my hon friend the member for broxtowe who have long campaign on this issue we meet his constituent in my early day as minister and thank he for bring it to the house attention we be always keen to do something when we could and be delighted to say that we now have the right time and space to do this it be pleasure to meet he and his constituent mr horsey who be in the gallery today in the department the year before last be sure the whole house will join in express our condolence to mr horsey for the loss of his wife bernadette and in send our good wish to he and their son tim will take the time to address some of the point raise by hon member today but will first put on the record why the government support the intent behind this legislation lose partner be truly devastating experience for anyone the combination of the terrible grief and as my hon friend the member for congleton fiona bruce say loneliness in these situation the shadow minister the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas call it unimaginable which be an apt description with the challenge of care for new baby must be incredibly hard my deep sympathy go out to anyone who find themselves in this terrible position the united kingdom have generous range of entitlement and protection design to support parent to balance their family and work commitment and maintain their place in the labour market while raise their child for example maternity leave and pay paternity leave and pay and share parental leave and pay among other maternity leave be rightly available from the first day of woman employment recognise the special circumstance of pregnant woman and new mother parental leave and share parental leave be not day one leave entitlement for mother father and partner all parent must meet continuity of service requirement as such if mother die in the first year of child life father or partner who have not meet continuity of service requirement for paternity leave or share parental leave will not have the statutory right to take leave so that they can care for the child in those tragic but thankfully rare circumstance they will need to rely on the compassion of their employer to provide they with adequate leave and job security as the hon member for ogmore say though some of these people be fall through the crack the intent of the bill be to provide more support for the grieve and survive parent when their spouse or partner have tragically pass away the legislation will support people in those terrible circumstance to take time away from work to care for their new baby without the risk and associated stress of be make to return to work before they be ready to do so be delighted that the government be able to support this positive development in the parental leave and pay system however as be the case with any legislation it be crucial to ensure that it be not only well intentione but practical and effective in achieve its intended effect it be therefore important that set out to the house today as have previously discuss with the hon member for ogmore the government view that the bill will require amendment in committee to fully achieve its intended change and operate effectively alongside exist parental leave legislation be delighted that the hon member have agree to work with to do that and that we have share understanding of the need to create legislative framework that not only support family in their time of need but do so in way that be clear fair and effective committee stage provide we with the opportunity to fine tune the detail of the bill and address any potential gap issue or inconsistency to ensure that it achieve its intended purpose will of course provide more information on the necessary change ahead of committee stage but will take moment to highlight some of the area in which we be consider amendment first we will need to consider what type of parental leave good meet the intention of the bill secondly we will need to analyse whether it be right to confine its scope to the death of the mother or whether it should make broad provision for the death of other parent thirdly we need to make sure that the change we make integrate well into the wide framework of parental leave legislation finally we intend to remove the pay element from this entitlement will explain why shortly the hon member for ogmore and be in agreement on the removal of the pay element as member will have see the text of his bill do not refer to pay although hear and understand his clear ambition to include it at future stage concur with his point though that we should never let the perfect be the enemy of the good all the uk statutory parental pay entitlement have continuity of service requirement include statutory maternity pay statutory paternity pay statutory share parental pay and statutory adoption pay they be design to ensure that parent have make reasonable contribution towards their employer business before that employer be require to administer statutory parental payment continuity of service requirement be design to achieve balance between the need of employer and those of work parent will be able to give more detail in committee on the change we intend to make to the bill in the spirit of collaboration encourage all member to engage constructively in committee our priority be to work together to deliver piece of legislation that meet the need of bereaved family provide they with the support they require during one of life most challenging chapter in response to the shadow minister point about worker right the government be commit to support the participation and progression of parent in the labour market to ensure that it be fair and work for parent our manifesto pledge change to enhance worker right and support people to stay in work the government have deliver on those commitment by support package of six private member bill help new parent unpaid carer and hospitality worker give all employee easy access to flexible working and give worker right to request more predictable working pattern we have be pleased with the successful progress of that legislation through parliament where it have receive cross party support result in six act successfully receive royal assent the government have already make good progress on lay secondary legislation in due course to implement those new act the employment relations flexible working act for example will give all employee with week continuous service the right to request flexible working empower employee to ask for working arrangement that suit they and their unique circumstance take the point raise by my hon friend the member for bury north james daly about homeworke flexible working do not necessarily mean homeworke it can mean different working time to suit people parental responsibility for example different time during holiday and it do not necessarily mean that people have to work from home he be right to say that worker should work where they be most effective and where employer require they to be the protection from redundancy pregnancy and family leave act will provide great protection to woman who be on maternity leave or an employee who be on adoption or share parental leave in redundancy situation that legislation will help to clamp down on poor or inappropriate practice such as discriminate against pregnant woman or new mother or wait for woman to return from maternity leave and when the current protect period end make her redundant the employment allocations of tips act will make it unlawful for business to hold back tip gratuity and service charge from employee ensure that staff receive the tip they have earn this package of legislation will increase workforce participation protect vulnerable worker and level the play field ensure that unscrupulous business do not have competitive advantage the legislation build on the strength of our flexible and dynamic labour market and give business the confidence to create job and invest in their workforce allow they to generate long term prosperity and economic growth protect and enhance worker right while support business to grow remain priority for this government we be determined to build high skilled high productivity high wage economy key part of the uk economic resilience be our strong flexible and dynamic labour market it be labour market that give business the confidence to create job and invest in their workforce and allow they to generate long term prosperity and economic growth it be labour market that rightly bear down on unscrupulous employer and protect those keep to good working practice promote more competition in uk market to build high skilled high productivity high wage economy my hon friend have great experience and it be great to hear from people with experience at the sharp end of business it be not an easy place to be have fairly long business career myself for year before politic and we know that people be our most precious asset it be good business to look after our workforce not only because of the individual concern and the loyalty that bring but because of the loyalty of other member of the team when they see how someone be treat their staff it be important to recognise that what we be legislate for be not ceiling but floor it be minimum period of leave that people can be offer and of course the minimum level of pay clearly an employer can pay more than that expect by law and know that many employer do so understand that mr horsey be well treat by his employer that illustrate that most employer be good employer and we in the house should always recognise that when we be legislate we want labour market that promote competition and choice so that consumer have confidence in market and business compete on level playing field turn to the specific point the hon member for ogmore raise point about the number of people affect maternal death the number of people who pass away during pregnancy or within day of that be around as he say some will have continuity of service requirement we therefore think that this legislation will benefit just under people year that be our good guesstimate because there be so many different move part but that be the kind of number we be talk about that be not huge number but the legislation be very important to those affect by it note the hon member point principally about pay it be first step on the road but it be very important step and future government of whatever colour they may be may go far he also raise the complexity and take up of share parental leave take up be in line with estimate and have double over the past few year in july the share parental leave tool be deploy the tool enable parent to check their eligibility and plan their leave and it have be well receive think that also cover the point raise by the shadow minister the hon member for harrow west the hon member for ogmore also ask why parent with other employment status such as the self employ be not entitle to this support the government support be focus on employ parent as they do not generally have the same level of flexibility and autonomy over how and when they work as self employ parent employee have contractual requirement to work regular hour and have an employer who have control over when they work where they work and how their work be do due to that employee have the great level of employment protection to balance the lack of flexibility that their employment type provide in other way my hon friend the member for bury north talk in his intervention and his speech about the burden on business obviously all legislation should include an impact assessment include financial impact assessment on business the impact assessment result be de minimis think that be below million which be not significant impact we therefore do not think that the change will create significant burden on business we have engage with business representative organisation and payroll professional throughout the policy development of these change they have respond positively and understand how the change will increase flexibility for family we be work with his majesty revenue and customs to plan communication with business to ensure that they fully understand the new arrangement and we will continue to engage with they while we finalise guidance to ensure the smooth introduction of these change my hon friend the member for congleton rightly talk about the uk commission on bereavement and the important work that it do she also refer to cross departmental bereavement strategy which may include bereavement counselling for people in key situation that be little outside my remit but she may continue to press for that across government
