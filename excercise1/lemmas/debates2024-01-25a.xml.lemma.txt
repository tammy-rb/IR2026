come on call nicola richards at time when we be begin to see inflation fall recent development in the red sea be extremely concern not just in term of security but because of the huge cost to shipping

government say that it would be deeply unfair but the outgoing first minister have reject their call and number of hospitality business have already close their door this year will the minister join in urge the welsh government to maintain the support that business need instead of cut their foot from under they just because welsh labour can not manage budget the hon gentleman be absolutely right

cover by the legislation to overturn conviction for the legislation to work postmaster have to come forward when ask one of my constituent this weekend why they have not come to soon they say it be because they have sign non disclosure agreement but also because they have have to sign the official secrets act think that be so bonker that do not believe it until read page of nick wallis book

completely at liberty to talk to their mps about any aspect of the post office thank my right hon friend for all the work he have do in this area understand that the requirement to sign the official secrets act relate to the confidentiality of mail it do not relate to the confidentiality of issue regard mistreatment by post office my right hon friend be absolutely right to raise that point and will certainly raise it with post office ltd but can confirm that that would not prevent somebody from speak out include to their member of parliament call the shadow secretary of state the minister know that we be willing to work with the government on way to exonerate the sub postmaster and get they compensation as quickly as possible the proposal will have to be imperfect but they represent clear option for resolve this terrible issue as way to ensure safeguard against any potential future misuse of precedent could cross party agreement be establish as an essential provision for the exercise of power of this kind thank the hon gentleman for the constructive way he have engage with we on this issue know that the justice secretary speak to the leader of the opposition this week on this very matter and we be very keen to engage with the hon gentleman too he be right to say the solution be imperfect we believe it be the least bad option but of course we will engage with he and

all prosecution that arise from the horizon pilot scheme will now also be include in the exoneration give that although people be technically prosecute without official horizon datum it be very much

put out leaflet to make sure that business be aware and the introduction of the model will of course be stag the hon gentleman need to be careful about what labour plan will be this week the eu ambassador to london reveal the fact that labour desire for food and veterinary agreement be likely to lead to close dynamic alignment between london and brussels in the future which be directly against his party leader state policy of no dynamic alignment post office horizon system compensation for sub postmaster what step her department be take to encourage sub postmaster who be affect by

year from the back benches and the front benches have come to light because of whistleblower who be hugely important we be review that work the research for the review be near completion the government will set out the next step in due course and yes of course would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that too have constituent who although she be thankfully not prosecute be force over period of more than decade to pay back thousand of pound every year and it amount to six figure sum as the hon member for stoke on trent central jo gideon say this be not just about that pecuniary loss this be about the impact on my constituent family will not go into her personal detail but they take real hit and wish she have come forward to soon meet she couple of week ago and it really have wreck her life she have not yet have any compensation through the shortfall scheme so urge the minister to ensure that such people be properly compensate the hon lady be absolutely right to raise that point yes the compensation scheme be there to compensate and provide redress for financial loss but also quite rightly for personal loss loss of reputation impact on health those kind of matter there be two route open to compensation the fix sum award which be pretty much an immediate payment or someone can go for full assessment of loss which take into account all those matter interim payment be also available we have pay out million in total across the scheme be happy to help the hon lady with that specific case and we be look to try to expedite the payment of full and fair compensation to all individual be work on daily basis to try to do that sme late payment what step her department be take to help tackle late payment to small and medium sized business the government be commit to tackle late payment that be why we launch the prompt payment and cash flow review which be publish alongside the autumn statement the review include amend payment performance reporting requirement for large business and provide the small business commissioner with more power to investigate late payment small business be the backbone of our economy but unfortunately late payment continue to blight the ability of small business to trade with an average of million year be lose unfortunately that be on the increase with increase in appreciate what the minister say about another review think we have one few year ago but what specific action be the government take to address this appalling abuse of power which be contribute to small business go under year the hon lady be right to raise this issue and early set out specific action such as give the small business commissioner more power and produce league table we work closely with the good business pay campaign which produce league table on this issue and name and sham the people responsible be important the government be lead the way and from april firm bid for government contract worth more than million will have to demonstrate that they pay their invoice within an average of day tighten to day in april and to day in the come year steel industry whether she have have recent discussion with the chancellor of the exchequer on take fiscal step to help support the steel industry the chancellor and meet regularly and obviously we know and recognise the importance of the steel sector in the uk economy our commitment to the sector be clear and we will be invest more than million in the port talbot site to ensure that steelmaking continue in the uk without that investment the job at the port and the job in the supply chain would have be at risk we be work with tata and we have set up transition board the hon gentleman know about that because we both serve on it and we have provide more than million of support for affected employee and the local economy last friday tata announce that it will provide an additional million of support for employee face redundancy the option be make no long continue at port talbot or the investment that we have provide minister keep spin this line that tata steel be threaten to close down the port talbot work and walk away but they know that be an empty bluff because the cost of dismantle and remediate the port talbot steelwork be vast and utterly prohibitive against that backdrop let we be clear be it the case that no string be attach to the million of taxpayer money that have be give to tata steel be that million give by the prime minister to tata steel with green light to make steelworker redundant would not want steelworker to think that we be not work together and the hon member and work together and will be work together to ensure that steelworker be protect as much as possible think it be extraordinary that the position he be now put forward be that it would have be well to risk the absolute loss of steelmaking in the uk and then allow the taxpayer to pick up the cost to manage the site it be bluff believe it far more preferential that we make the large investment ever in steelmaking to protect more than job at port talbot and the job in the supply fundamentally we have steelmaking order it might be well that that conversation be carry on outside rather than go on across the benches while the minister be reply at the heart of our decision be two thing continue steelmaking at port talbot and protect steelworker we have recently hear from my right hon friend the secretary of state for defence how the west be face pre war world will the minister ensure in her conversation with the treasury that it understand the vital strategic importance of virgin steelmaking capability here in the uk my hon friend have huge amount of knowledge of the steel sector and be huge champion for scunthorpe she know that we be work incredibly hard with the company in her constituency and we be wait for it to respond to the business plan go forward we know how important virgin steelmaking be and we accept because technology have move on that go forward of all steel can be make in electric arc furnace call the shadow minister mr speaker the uk steel industry the trade union and labour be propose an industrial policy worthy of serious industrial country those be not my word but those of the world economic editor of the daily telegraph writing yesterday he also say that the government minimalist plan do just half the job leave the uk with stunt second tier industrial base the only country lack sovereign capability in weapon grade primary steel he be right be he the billion that labour be propose have no plan behind it and we be not tell what hard worker across the country would have to pay to fill that black hole labour have ask for transition to green steel it would want we to protect steelworker and obviously would want to protect advanced manufacturing in the uk customer want clean steel port talbot could no long function with its age blast furnace and our package will save job at port talbot co

what step her department be take to ensure that regulator support economic growth at the autumn statement we announce the decision to extend the growth duty to ofgem ofwat and ofcom alongside series of reform to the duty to hold regulator to account for deliver growth in the sector they regulate we be also currently consult on proposal to strengthen the economic regulation of the energy water and telecom sector be grateful to the secretary of state for that answer but on retain eu law reform in the june to december reporting period there be only two regulatory reform of note which be on wine marketing and working time calculation the rest be technical correction what step be she take to speed up reform of retain eu law to ensure that regulation work for business and enable growth be glad that my hon friend read the report that send out this week on what we have be do however disagree that only two reform of note have be deliver we have repeal or reform more than measure the port

the schedule for and there be many other mechanism in the retain eu law programme to deliver on that road map so that we improve our economy and make it more competitive by make sure that our law be tailor to our economy in support of economic growth the right hon member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss cut million from environment agency budget when she be at the department for environment food and rural affairs rather than bring economic growth that serve to bring sewage growth sewage discharge double between and be delighted to hear yesterday that the government will adopt my water quality monitoring bill but will they also restore some of the cut environment agency funding to bring back power as well as duty spending review where we can look at these thing will be come up shortly but really have to challenge much of what the hon gentleman say it be misrepresentation to say that the issue go on with sewage be to do with the action of my right hon friend the member for south west norfolk elizabeth truss this government have be take reform through the environment act to improve the situation throughout multiple government include the one in which his party the

vegetarian version hon member oh could not the secretary of state put that into her point action plan and get on and do something or do she want to risk forever be know as cowran beastie laughter thank the right hon gentleman for his esoteric question we be continually remove barrier to us uk trade and we be trade with the us more than ever before if he have specific example that can help with so that he can enjoy his burns night would appreciate it if he write to and we will look at the matter in detail with many bank close on high street the post office be pick up so much slack but in

the minister review that and ensure that the post office can take far great volume of cash from rural business thank the hon gentleman for his work on this matter which he and have discuss on many occasion the limit be there to try to prevent money laundering but it be important that the check be proportionate have raise their impact on number of occasion with the financial conduct authority

post office there be great opportunity not just for inghams fish and chip shop but for the post office banking framework to make that relationship more lucrative call the shadow minister postal worker be the bedrock of our community but they be be force to work at unsustainable level something that sadly have not be recognise in ofcom report on the future of universal service obligation the input of postal worker be critical to successful royal mail so please can we have confirmation that their view will be consider in any future decision that would make perfect sense we read the ofcom report into the review of universal service obligation with interest our clear position be that we will retain six day service for our citizen and business but those view will be take into account the secretary of state have often state her support for post brexit regulatory reform and divergence and do so again in answer to an early question be she in position to deny report in today that the government have pledge to introduce requirement that all future regulatory change will be screen to ensure that extra barrier in the irish sea be not create that could be significant impediment to divergence from eu law can not comment on the ongoing northern ireland political process to which be not participant however it be clear that we retain the ability to diverge agree with my right hon friend that if we be to seize the benefit of brexit we need to find that comparative advantage over the eu in our regulation otherwise there would be no point remind she that be the business secretary

happy to write to he about it royal mail customer will have welcome the minister reassurance this week about rule out reduction to the current six day week service however many customer already feel short change by what be often an inadequate service in their area do the minister agree that any propose change must protect the small business whose business model rely on the six day service and customer right the hon gentleman be right to raise this issue the service have not be satisfactory and royal mail have be fin million by ofcom as result it have employ more postal worker to address those problem and we be see some improvement but he be right to raise the point about our six day service be vital to business particularly those in the magazine and greeting card industry what assessment have the minister make of the result of private sector trial in relation to the introduction of four day week will he meet in due course to discuss the result of those trial thank the hon gentleman for that question it be clearly up to business to decide if they want to trial four day week we have make no assessment of any result it be our belief that we should not run stalinist economy where we tell private sector business how to operate their workforce and on what day of the week he may differ on that particular perspective but we have introduce important reform that help business work more flexibly include the flexible work change that be introduce recently the gosport branch of asda be the first in the uk to ballot for strike action employee cite issue include low

the uk the government maintain that we want to ensure that we keep steelmaking capability in the uk at the moment we import ore to make steel when we talk about virgin steel many people assume there be no import in the supply chain but there still be even now and whatever change we make will require some import however we be make sure that our steel industry be more resilient than ever before at

scottish national party associate myself with the remark about holocaust memorial day ask the house to note that tonight be burns night when we celebrate the work of scotland great national bard new year new tory civil war just what the uk need with talk of doom loop massacre and extinction if only members of the leader of the house party have listen to she the last time she woo they for leadership she warn they that if they vote for the former chancellor as leader it would murder the party know that the leader of the house be furiously busy with all her minister for clickbait responsibility those anti scottish article and sneer video do not write themselves but as her government grind punch drunk and exhausted to an election should we not debate some of the key legacy of the last year of tory rule where should we start there be still the scandalously unresolved scandal such as infected blood the waspi woman women against state pension inequality campaign and post office horizon to name very few but have the leader of the house have time to reflect on recent comment from sir michael marmot professor of public health at university college london he say that britain in be start to suffer from victorian disease again and that britain have become poor country with few rich people it bad to be poor in britain than in most other european country poor people in britain have low income than slovenia perhaps the leader of the house will cast her eye over the late joseph rowntree foundation report which say that more than one in five people be in poverty in with about million in very deep poverty that same year have she not manage to look at that yet that be unsurprising as the tories seem genuinely untroubled by poverty in the uk my colleague and have ask they about it many time but their eye just glaze over comfortable guess with the choice they have make as the pm have say perhaps we should start our tory legacy debate with an emerge threat the electoral commission chair warn recently that the government strict new rule on voter id risk exclude certain voter group and leave the conservative party open to the charge of bias and many other have think for some time that this be simply an attempt at voter suppression from the government so do the leader of the house agree with an erstwhile cabinet colleague that the new tory rule be simply as he put it an attempt at gerrymandering will she bring debate on this important issue to the house before the next general election what bunch of rotter we be with our anti scottish article it appear that the hon lady be plan to follow in the footstep of many great antipodean election guru by use brilliant new strategy of equate criticism of the snp performance with criticism of scotland itself the latter be landmass of approximately square mile populate by brilliant creative stoic people the former be ramshackle separatist movement full of people who have turn maladministration into an art form there be one tiny flaw in this new political tactic from the snp if we conservative dislike scotland so much for some reason the hon lady never get round to explain why on earth would we strive so hard to keep it part of the union of the united kingdom why would this conservative government give scotland the large funding settlement it have ever have why would we have offer its citizen who be wait for nhs treatment additional help and option which the scottish government turn down if want to do scotland down would join donate and campaign for the snp to whose member would point out that the trailblazer for bring back victorian disease to britain be glasgow watch the hon lady inaction and that of her party be like watch your much love neighbourhood be clobber by bunch of gangster let we call they the hole in the budget gang hit business take your cash make your life misery and keep the local police force very busy this new political strategy from the snp like everything else that it do will fail call the father of the house will my right hon friend ask the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to make statement next week on the instruction to the advocate for his department at the holocaust memorial bill select committee yesterday on number of occasion the lead advocate say that the design have not be award to sir david adjaye or that he be not the architect refer the leader of the house to the press notice on october in which the department and the cabinet office say that sir david and his team would design the memorial the then secretary of state my right hon friend the member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid and the mayor of london congratulate sir david and sir david be quote as say that it be architecture as emotion believe that the advocate may have inadvertently tell the committee thing that be clearly contradict by the fact six year ago and by every other quotation until sir david adjaye become name that could not be mention will the leader of the house please ask the secretary of state to consider make statement to correct what be say to the committee yesterday and perhaps acknowledge the four holocaust survivor who give evidence and look at what they say thank my hon friend for again diligently raise this important issue understand that the forum in which he can do so be limited which be

other group can do to ensure that continuity as the next question time be little way off will ask official in the department to contact the hon lady to see what more can be do to assist may we have

consequential however we in scotland can only hope and as keen follower of the problem that we have with the scottish government the leader of the house will be aware that it be probably forlorn hope

we have housing crisis and even as we speak my council and other across scotland be try to figure out how to fill the gap that the scottish government have leave be however disappoint that there be no

my surgery who have have to remove the tooth of her six year old daughter with plier because she be in so much pain and could not access the treatment her family need as the nhs dentistry recovery plan be long overdue would it be in order for the house to receive ministerial statement on when we may finally see some progress on this issue be sorry to hear about the situation in the hon gentleman constituency happen to know from recent meeting with the under secretary of state for health and social care my right hon friend the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom who be responsible for this policy area that she be do lot of work which she will be keen to bring to the house attention in short order the hon gentleman will know that the government have give considerable uplift to local commissioner to ensure that provider be in place from memory think million be give at the start of last year know that my right hon friend the minister be interested in what commissioner have do with that money as it be flexibly give it be not ringfence although it be specifically give for dentist treatment she be look into that matter and will be interested to see what the answer be in the hon gentleman constituency secretary of state in the house of lords commons scrutiny procedure committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the procedure committee dame karen bradley will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of her statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech may emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair and not to the relevant government minister front benchers may take part in questioning with permission would like to make statement on the procedure committee report commons scrutiny of secretaries of state in the house of lords which be publish yesterday thank both the backbench business committee for find time for the statement and the clerks of the committee who put the report together in very short order to ensure that we could report as soon as possible in the new year on this important matter you will know madam deputy speaker that mr speaker ask the committee to examine this issue after the appointment of lord cameron as foreign secretary he ask we whether any historical precedent could be adapt to allow non members to participate in commons proceeding and whether option for scrutiny should extend beyond departmental question to statement urgent question and debate would like to thank the colleague who respond to our survey and those who submit evidence to our inquiry almost nine in of those who respond to our survey want to see more direct accountability of lords secretaries of state in the commons around think it should include departmental question time urgent question and statement almost two third think it should take place in the chamber some colleague raise concern that change our procedure to facilitate scrutiny would legitimise the appointment of more senior ministers in the lords the constitutional question of the house in which senior minister sit be not in the procedure committee remit but our clear preference as mps the elect representative of our constituent be that secretaries of state should sit in the commons that be why our recommendation be limit to this parliament to deal with the issue that the house face now they should not set precedent for the future we have great respect for the work of the house of lords in its scrutiny of the government the other place have great expertise and experience of foreign policy and international affair among its member the foreign affairs and international development committees do excellent work hold the foreign commonwealth and development office to account and support their call for lord cameron to appear regularly before they as secretaries of state in the commons appear regularly before their departmental committees but their work complement scrutiny in this chamber it do not replace it as the chair of the international development committee the hon member for rotherham sarah champion tell we select committees and the chamber have unique mandate function and purpose they be not synonymous scrutiny by elect mp on behalf of their constituent be fundamental part of our democratic system as be debate across the dispatch boxes between ministers and the opposition therefore every mp should have the ability to directly question the foreign secretary the minister for development my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and his ministerial colleague do an excellent job but the foreign secretary be ultimately accountable for the fcdo as the leader of the house acknowledge in her evidence to we there will always be some issue that the house and our constituent would expect the foreign secretary to answer for we consider proposal for use westminster hall or committee room instead of the chamber but they would restrict participation to fraction of the house we do not believe that be acceptable or practical that be why we have recommend that for the rest of this parliament secretaries of state who sit in the lords should appear at departmental question time make ministerial statement and answer urgent question that secretary of state in the commons would normally do they should speak from the bar of the house not the dispatch box which should continue to be reserve for member of this house such an arrangement will rightly require the agreement of the house of lords we be confident that the lords will agree that in the modern age and at time of grow global tension it be not tenable for the foreign secretary not to be scrutinise by elect mp on behalf of our constituent therefore urge the government to bring forward the necessary motion as quickly as possible follow yesterday debate on the situation in the red sea there be no retrospective vote on uk military action the debate be respond to by the minister of state from the foreign commonwealth and development office the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell who be brilliant minister and answer expertly in the light of the work of the right hon lady select committee on accountability for secretary of state in the house of lords do she think that another precedent be lord carrington he resign during the falklands war for not have anticipate the argentinian invasion despite warning from member of this house the question of whether vote be require for military action be not matter that the procedure committee deal with but be sure colleague on the front bench hear that point on the matter of lord carrington the hon gentleman will recall that at that time the prime minister appoint deputy foreign secretary to sit in this house so there be somebody with the ability to answer for the whole foreign and commonwealth office as it then be in this chamber however the hon gentleman make pertinent point thank my right hon friend for ably chair the procedure committee in its deliberation and for compile this topical and timely report will she assure member such as myself who can perhaps be regard as sceptical of innovation in this house that the proposal contain within this excellent report be deeply wed in tradition indeed it be the case that in the duke of wellington come to the bar of the house to answer question from mps now while the duke of wellington and lord cameron may have enjoy rather different campaign in europe it be none the less deeply wed in tradition be grateful to my hon friend the chair of the public administration and constitutional affairs committee know he be very very concerned with matter of the constitution and with ensure that we look at precedent can assure he that as mr speaker ask we to we start from historic precedent he rightly cite the example of the duke of wellington in who believe receive the plaudit of member while at the bar of the house think painting of such can be see in the national portrait gallery congratulate the right hon lady and her committee on an excellent report very much agree with its recommendation the leader of the house say that the government would respond shortly have she have any indication from the government that they will accept the committee recommendation she say that it need the agreement of the lords what sort of timescale be there for how quickly that process can be agree thank the hon gentleman for his question and for his comment about the report the report be publish only yesterday so would not expect to have hear any response from the government yet be sure that the leader of the house will ensure that response be forthcoming shortly he be absolutely right we have to bear in mind that the other place be an independent body and its member be govern by its rule which say that member should not appear before this house without explicit permission from the other place that include appearance in front of select committees bill committees and so on we will wait to see how long such matter might take but hope that the other place will recognise and acknowledge the real concern in this place that we should be able to properly scrutinise we have to remember that in this house we represent the people who send we here the other place have great expertise and contain some great mind but it do not speak on behalf of constituent in the way that we have to as elect member that be an important distinction thank the chair of the procedure committee for her statement and for her very succinct and helpful answer we all know lord cameron and recognise his ability and quality to do the job that we need be very conscious that we live in very dangerous world where there be war and rumour of war to cite the bible with the foreign secretary in the other place that leave gap in accountability today believe that that accountability gap have be address do the committee believe that accountability in this house be the priority and that our constituent deserve that as well thank the hon gentleman and hon friend for his comment would have be disappoint if he have not contribute so be very grateful he stay to take part he be absolutely right this be the concern that the committee have have throughout that there be democratic deficit if we can not raise concern on behalf of our constituent we be in our constituency hear what our constituent be concern about so we know what people on the ground be feel that be no criticism of any member in the other place but they simply do not have that day to day contact with constituent that be why we feel that it be so important particularly in the world that we see today that we be able to scrutinise properly the work of the fcdo and the secretary of state we be not suggest that the secretary of state should take part in debate we accept that debate be different matter but there will always be statement and some urgent question to which it be appropriate for secretary of state rather than minister to respond again this be no criticism whatsoever of the excellent ministers in the fcdo but at time secretary of state have to be the one who respond and that be what we have put in our report backbench business holocaust memorial day beg to move that this house have consider holocaust memorial day thank the right hon member for stratford on avon nadhim zahawi who be not in the chamber the hon member for east renfrewshire kirsten oswald and the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for co sponsor the debate let also pay tribute to two organisation the holocaust memorial day trust and the holocaust educational trust both of which devote much energy and time to organise the event that help we to commemorate the holocaust without their excellent work we would not keep alive the memory of those who lose their life in the nazi death camp or indeed those who be kill in other genocide from rwanda to cambodia and from bosnia to darfur without they our effort to learn the lesson of history would weaken and fade away this be the last time shall have the privilege of participate in this important debate but it could not be more difficult and depressing time to do so have just return from short visit to israel we go to support the people who live on kfar azar kibbutz that we have visit in february last year many of those live on the kibbutz be people commit to peaceful co existence with their neighbour in gaza but tragically many be kill on october many who survive be distraught because their love one be capture as hostage and many especially the woman be treat with the utmost abominable sadistic cruelty sexually assault in utterly inhumane way and then murder israel and its people be experience national trauma and real existential fear for their survival with memory of the holocaust at the heart of their mind and the same be true in gaza with innocent civilian experience similar national trauma an identical existential fear and comparable terror of genocide as they live with bombardment death injury displacement and lack of humanitarian aid so we meet at deeply depressing time to reflect on the holocaust with many ask themselves when will the world ever ever really learn from our past but the truth be that we must keep try this year focus for holocaust memorial day be the fragility of freedom that theme allow we to reflect on how by well understand the past and well understand how easily freedom can be erode we can act today to make the world well place for those flee persecution today want to raise these matter in the context of my own family experience like other lose close relative in the holocaust my grandmother whose last write word to her son my uncle be do forget completely and my uncle whose wife write in letter plead for his release he only number to you he everything to but have other relative who escape day before the start of the war and be disperse across the diaspora as they seek safety they too be victim of the assault on jews they too suffer hugely and they too should be the focus of our concern as we commit ourselves to its never happen again my grandfather come to england on march he be and have just recover from prostate operation and an embolism in his leg we have powerful account of his experience and emotion in the diary that he keep he describe his last visit to his parent graf in vienna in tear because he would never visit those graf again he recall how his parent my great grandparent visit the graf of their own parent my great great grandparent in poland in tear because they be drive out of their home by pogrom never end cycle of violence my grandfather describe his feeling few day after arrive in england because of the lack of language skill very lonely depressed can not memorise miserable pronunciation live like recluse even six month later he say that those who stay in vienna may have save themselves from all the horror and all the difficulty of emigrate he talk about antisemitism in britain and how it reach up into the government when the only jew in the cabinet be sack by neville chamberlain on his arrival in britain my jewish refugee grandfather be classify as an enemy alien that be later change to friendly but he be still an alien at am on june in the middle of war that lead to the death of million jews my grandfather be in his bath and there be knock on the door he be arrest remove from his home and intern he try to ring his doctor to certify his illness but then as today no doctor pick up the phone he be take to huyton in liverpool and give number group number number he be house in overcrowded condition with rubber sheet straw and blanket in the early day he be not allow to write or receive letter the sanitary condition be dreadful and the german jews find themselves house with german nazis his freedom be indeed fragile our treatment of jewish refugee be unconscionable fast forward to my own experience come to the uk from egypt stateless in after the creation of israel egypt become an increasingly hostile environment for jews my father have stone throw through the window of his office and with the memory of the holocaust still raw in his mind he decide to get the family out of egypt we be reject by three english speak country and the uk finally to my father eternal gratitude give our family of six entry visa to this country my father freedom be indeed fragile five year later we be still stateless and my father apply for british nationality at that time my mother be die in hospital and my old sister and brother be away at school and university so be at home with my young sister she be six and be nine home office inspector come to tea remember that occasion vividly as instead of our usual boil egg and toast we have to eat cucumber sandwich and fruit cake which absolutely hat have grow up on succulent fresh fruit in the middle east bad of all we be interrogate two young girl on their own for full hour on who our friend be what book we read and what game we play my freedom be indeed fragile deal with hostile not friendly environment that remain forever lock in my memory what do all these story tell we my family know and indeed the family of million of refugee know that freedom be never guarantee we should understand that how we treat those who escape persecution and genocide be central to our reputation as country that boast humanitarian approach to genocide and the holocaust commend the right hon lady for secure this debate and for the tone of her speech most of we be proud friend of israel think of what the nation of israel be put through because so many people would not speak out and we see the result in the horrific atrocity that be remember today do she agree that we remember not out of sense of morbidity but out of the absolute necessity to ensure that the lesson teach by the slaughter of the jewish people be learn by people of all faith so that it be never permit to happen again completely share that sentiment express by the hon gentleman as be say we be not as good as we proclaim to be my grandfather do not feel welcome and do not feel want as nine year old girl the asylum seeker who try to come here today face similar hostile environment they be tell by lead government politician that they pose an existential threat to the west way of life that they be part of hurricane of mass migration that mp feel besiege by asylum seeker and that asylum seeker be invade britain we should reflect on what we say and what we do today before we exercise any moral entitlement to condemn the atrocity of the past the language we use today matter the law and practice of today design to exclude many of those seek freedom from persecution which make mockery of our commitment to the victim of genocide matter the fee we charge for visa today matter and our refusal today to allow those seek asylum to work matter the hostility my grandfather face in and the trepidation feel when subject to question in echo through the generation all of this contribute to our credibility in the debate on the holocaust and subsequent genocide so before we applaud ourselves for keep alive the memory of the holocaust we should think about how fragile freedom be then for those who seek to escape death and how fragile it remain today we must take responsibility and stand up to genocide wherever it rear its ugly head and we must protect those who seek refuge in britain if we stand by while genocide unfold or fail to protect those who need it the most the horror the like of which my grandfather father and even myself experience will have all be for nothing freedom be one of our basic value so surely we owe it to our child and our child child to be able to stand up and really mean it when we say never again call the father of the house apologise to you madam deputy speaker and to the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge for miss the first minute of her speech be try to get transcript of the hearing yesterday at the select committee on the holocaust memorial bill when four of the witness be joanna millan anita lasker wallfisch dr martin stern and dr lydia tischler each of whom be holocaust survivor some in the house will also have be present at the holocaust memorial commemoration when the holocaust candle be light five of they be light be ask to stand in for someone who have have transport difficulty do the one for those who have suffer at darfur we have be give good introduction to this debate with the move speech we have just hear hope it will be possible to put on wide record the experience of the four people have cite who come as witness to the committee have be produce by baroness ruth deech who herself talk about how her family have be destroy in the nazi holocaust we have rightly be remind that our hand be not clean it would have be possible for the state of israel to have be create in the and possibly million people would have thus survive three quarter of the jews in europe die have say in the past how much welcome the emphasis that the holocaust commission have put on education which have be follow up by word from the uk holocaust memorial foundation have say that have have vague idea that perhaps of my grandfather extend family have die but we now know that the real figure be more than and possibly more than that kind of education matter do not claim to have have the family experience that the right hon member for barking have have but think that more of we will know and understand more if we have personal connection of some kind have speak in the past about my first cousin once remove george woodwark who be one of the westminster medical student who think they be go to help people suffer from malnutrition in the netherlands but be divert to bergen belsen where they help to save the life of two third of those who be still breathe at the time of liberation on another occasion we should have further debate about the controversial proposal for memorial in victoria tower gardens but do not want to disturb this debate by go into too much detail about that now what will say be that if people get the chance they should go to the holocaust galleries at the imperial war museum and if possible read copy of the book the holocaust produce two year ago by james bulgin which describe how thing grow will quote paragraph from the book about adolf hitler hitler early year of adulthood be spend pursue an unsuccessful career as an artist in vienna service in the first world war change his life however give his aimless existence new sense of purpose and direction radicalise by the shock of defeat he become convinced that jews have conspire to ensure germany downfall these idea be first introduce to he by soldier he be convalesce with after be injure during the war after the war he be send to spy on nazi meeting but become enrapture by the message of the movement by he have become the leader of the nazi party in hitler lead an ill fat attempt to overthrow the government which become know as the munich putsch he plan to take control of the bavarian state government and then march on berlin the uprising be quickly suppress and hitler be arrest he be sentence to five year in prison for treason but be release after just eight month that be decade before hitler take his national socialist party the nazi party from do pretty badly in the last election in the to do reasonably well in the proportional representation election in the people who think they have control of germany think they would make he chancellor as way of control he they be wrong in any education associate with the holocaust or whatever name people choose to call it because the holocaust be relatively recent name for the horror the terror and the intended annihilation of whole people we need to understand that people can come up in the way that adolf hitler do they may have go to meeting find small group turn it into more powerful one recruit private army and start march around with the aim of take control if that sound familiar from recent event in other country so be it we have to beware of private militia we have to give the state monopoly on resist the potential of violence so that it can resist by force those who be behave dangerously badly we have to ensure that message be not know just in this country but in other country as well when first stand for election there be about country around the world that have reasonably democratic political system in which people who lose election accept the fact they have lose that number increase to about or while the number of country in the world rise from about to we be now think go backwards more people may have well standard of life but do not think they have well standard of democracy the flexibility of people who be willing to use election as way of accept defeat not way of guarantee victory matter we have to have way of controlling and if necessary confront with force those who would use force to subvert our country or any country or would try to launch genocidal attack on whole group of people define by their race or religion or for those who be jewish the overlap of the two when there be the attack on october in israel on israelis someone write to say why do they keep pick on we there be million jews around the world but the number would probably be three time high if it have not be for the holocaust we have responsibility to get well education about the holocaust go we ought to ensure that people do not just get the chance to see an exhibition but that in virtually all part of their life whether geography history current affair or international relation they understand how people rise to take control of their country people should be able take part in something that be different and an alternative understand that will not always get my way within my own party within parliament and within the country might not always be re elect it be important that we learn the lesson that democracy be about try to achieve good purpose but be willing to be defeat and to try again without take to the street with gun or go into exile even more importantly we have to ensure that people do not find themselves dead because of other people prejudice and very cruel behaviour too thank the backbench business committee for make time for the debate be grateful for the way in which the application be deal with when we go to the committee feel that we be push at an open door its willingness to find time in the chamber be exceptionally welcome because this year of all year it be important that the debate take place right at the heart of parliament it would have be no less powerful in westminster hall but it really matter that it be here pay tribute to my co sponsor the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge her speech be one of the fine have hear in my year in parliament it would have be powerful just for she to share her family experience but for she then to take that experience and draw parallel and lesson for the world today make it wholly exceptional contribution she will be remember and miss in future holocaust memorial day debate next year it will be year since the end of the second world war with every year that pass the act of memorial become more and more important member can do the math for themselves be bear in year after the end of the second world war be bear into world where many of the old people in my community have live experience of it they have fight in different part of the world or make contribution on the home front grow up read that be root in the second world war the victor the hotspur and warlord so even in that way there be context that understand which be unavailable to my child who grow up with full of japanese anime or whatever if they have child they will doubtless look at blankly and say what be you talk about as we get far from the live experience and those who survive the holocaust or serve in the second world war become rare moment such as this become more important as the right hon lady say the work of organisation such as the holocaust memorial day trust and the holocaust educational trust pay particular tribute to the work of karen pollock become more important too in the community that represent in shetland we have our own story to tell on holocaust memorial day the shetland bus be fleet or progression of small fishing boat that go from lunna and scalloway in shetland to bring those who be flee persecution and whose life be at risk in nazi occupy norway to safety in shetland and then in the united kingdom mainland when we talk about the shetland bus we talk mostly about the work that it do in bring down airman and other to safety but it should be remember that no few than refugee come to britain through that route they be fugitive of the gestapo they be not all jews but many be indeed come across an article in the jewish chronicle from that highlight an episode that have never hear of share it with the house because it be remarkably potent to think of the contribution that my small community right at the very north of this country close to norway than to london be able to make in that struggle it record individual story from individual sailing bring human face to brave secret expedition just one example be the bus first loss nils johansen nesse after drop an agent in bømlo norway nesse fishing boat siglaos start the return journey to shetland in dreadful condition aboard be seven passenger rescue from norway include three child after several hour at sea battle the weather the siglaos be attack by enemy aircraft nesse who hold his position at the steering wheel sustain injury to the leg and the head the boat return safely to shetland but nesse lose the fight for life age today on calm day in this picturesque close knit harbour town it hard to imagine such heroic endeavour take place imagine they we must because it be part of history and part of what bring we here today we have to recognise the context of today debate what be happen in the world and what be happen in israel and gaza as we speak apart from anything else we know that the jewish community in this country feel so much more at risk and vulnerable than ever as consequence of what happen on october there be balance to be strike the focus have to be on what happen otherwise we risk disrespect those who perish and those who survive it and the family for whom it be live experience but surely the whole point as other have say must be to ensure that it do not happen again that be why when read story about restaurant opening in jordan call october frankly despair it be something that have to be call out and deal with wherever it happen as somebody who have massive reservation about what netanyahu be do in gaza and we can debate that another day look with horror at the incipient antisemitism that be creep up in so many different way let we not forget that antisemitism something that be wholly irrational but that we never seem to eradicate be at the root of what happen in the holocaust the price of it not happen again be that those of we who care about what happen in the past have to be honest open and courageous in call it out when we see it start again if we wait until it have take hold it will be too late be go to talk to the house about my own personal experience of genocide bosnia in be in germany command an infantry battalion in when ring my mother say mum my camp be beside this ghastly place call bergen belsen do you know mum it have rectangular mound with sign that say here lie body it heathland it foul place she say know robert say how would

about we be all responsible for what happen in this world and genocide happen so easily do not understand what my mother be talk about until few month later when go to bosnia as the british united nations commander there be one hell of lot of kill around we be appalled to be honest go into bit of funk about it could not believe what be see will not repeat some of the stuff that see but how about crucifixion on barn door people scalp people eye pull out with implement that be design just to do that and woman in tree because they have be rap and have then hang themselves they be mainly bosnian muslims be horrified and then feel what my mother have tell about shame why have not be able to stop this have soldier and arm and be represent the great mighty world forum of opinion the united nations yet near woman child and man be be murder stupidly they be all south slavs they just have different religion thing get bad let give the example of ahmići on april the european commission ambassador ask to try to stop the battle and ask how he say deal with the politic you deal with the line think you ve get the good deal mate anyway go to the frontline as go to the bosnian muslim frontline up on the hill above the lašva valley commander say to we be not stop this battle be try to stop the battle and bring about ceasefire we be not stop this the commander say because at ahmići village woman child and man be be massacre and say no that can not be happen do not think that could actually happen in this day and age so say look if go there with my man and discover you be wrong and come back will you stop fight he say yes come off the hill and go down into the valley be with my platoon about man and have four armoured vehicle we be attack as we drive along the valley by the joker bosnian croat special force but we just ignore they as their attack bounce off as go into ahmići the first thing see be the minaret crippled and broken it have be bring down then go all the way through the village it be linear village about mile long when take my man all the way to the top say to alex watts my platoon commander put section on either side of the road in sweep position let go down and find out what happen walk down the road with my platoon commander in front of we start find house that have be destroy and then at one house the soldier call over and ask to take look in the doorway be man and teenage boy they be dead they have be burn around the back of that house the man find cellar when go in be hit first by the smell then my eye focus and see what be in there it look like body there be bone and head there be head bent back and see the eye rush outside and be sick think god how can this happen and be there with this great un the people who be mean to police the world and have fail then have to make decision my instruction from the british government the ministry of defence the politician be that be neutral and be not to get involve this be not my war be there purely to deliver aid think that be appalling the whole point of the united nations think be to stop people die so extend that role bit escort aid but if people attack respond pretty robustly not but my man my man be great do you know how we have to clear up that village do you know what genocide mean it mean some poor devil with shovel have to clean it up in this case they be my bandsman who be actually medic why do choose the band to do that it be because they be slightly old than most of my man for some reason be sure that people will understand this feel that year old should not be involve in clear up body think that chap in his perhaps marry with some sort of sanity should do it rather than an year old lunatic do mean lunatic mean boy with all the testosterone in he also have girl sorry that be the wrong term it woman these day you can not be girl if you be over as be tell on the course go on remember this corporal in the band shovel up the remain of body and say sir this be europe in not europe in this be appalling say gosh yes yes the next day find whole family father mother boy and girl the little girl who be about seven be hold puppy they be all dead they be all in line where they have be shoot say oh gosh pick they up take they to the morgue we do that we take they to morgue it be horrific can you imagine what it be like for our soldier to see that all they see be their own family their sister we take this family to the morgue and think well that it do the next day go down that road again guess what the family be back in front of their house guess what else wrong morgue they be muslims have take they to the croat morgue just could not believe it we then have the problem of what to do with the body no one be go to deal with they it be nothing to do with be not mean to get involve in the war but have to deal with they because of the disease the smell get my royal engineers lovely bloke to dig big pit and we make mass grave we put about body into that pit even then we get it wrong no one have teach how to make mass graf because we put they into the pit in plastic bag until the international committee of the red cross delegate who happen now to be my wife come along and say what the hell do you think you do say bury people she say you not bury they in plastic bag that not how you do it so she lead and my man empty the body out horrendous that happen in europe and as the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge say watch out because it happen elsewhere this happen in europe and we could not understand it when we talk about the holocaust memorial theme be fragility call it the fragility of decency people decency can rapidly be shatter after all all those people see be normal human being think do know hell with this pick up my satellite phone and ring the security council of the united nations from bosnia get through to the operation room and say the security council be visit bosnia next week come and see what be happen out in my area do think anything of it but next week be tell the security council of the united nations be come to visit you think my god must be important of course be they come and remember say to the argentinian security council member look sir we have to do something about this this be genocide they refuse to accept it as genocide for several year always call it genocide it be call crime against humanity the definition of genocide be simple fundamentally try to eliminate group of people for be group of people that be separate he say totally agree the security council of the united nations set up the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia within month have give evidence in four trial at the icty and have give evidence that be difficult my man find it difficult your soldier find it difficult if there be theme this year it be one that have run along the same line forever genocide occur not just in the second world war by the way it extend back well into the and have occur repeatedly since our job be to highlight the fact that it have occur our job be to make sure that we shout loudly that genocide have occur in the past and we like to think that it will not occur in the future but it damn well will let we try to lessen incident of genocide by shout as loudly as we can never again what an honour and privilege it be to follow the right hon and gallant member for beckenham bob stewart know he take this opportunity every year to remind we that the kind of barbarity he see be ever present in our world and that the only thing to do be to try to bring attention to it and to stop it from happen again be truly grateful to he for his personal testimony also thank my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge what privilege it be to listen to her speech too be so grateful to she for talk to we about her experience and the lesson that she and we must draw from they there be so much she say that be absolutely spot on and she be absolutely spot on that the language we use today truly matter join colleague in express my gratitude to the holocaust memorial day trust and the holocaust educational trust for the amazing extraordinary and dedicated work they do at time when hatred and mistrust be surge this work be more important than ever when reflect on the holocaust simply marvel with horror at how ordinary people could herd child toddler babe in arm woman elderly people and the infirm into gas chamber to kill they the industrial slaughter of human being they be vulnerable human being include tot who in the normal course of the world we would do our utmost to protect whether they be ours or not just fail to comprehend what make ordinary people act in that way and fail to comprehend the scale and depravity of the holocaust this year mark the anniversary of the genocide in rwanda so if hon member will allow shall give voice to the testimony of daphrosa one of the survivor of that atrocity and put it on the parliamentary record before the genocide daphrosa live with her husband and five child her husband have good job as customs officer and she have open her own business run bar from the side of their home they be happy her husband would always come home with present for the child and they would go out together to the lake they have fun they be rich but they be happy for year before the genocide though hatred and suspicion word have be grow fuel by divisive politician and medium incitement daphrosa hear the rumour be spread and rumour that her husband be supporter of the rebel discrimination and segregation start to take hold with shop refuse to serve tutsis and even some church refuse to offer the eucharist to tutsis her husband be scared but even when trouble be be stir up in the year before daphrosa feel protect her hutu neighbour sometimes drink at her bar eat she praise chicken and call her grandma daphrosa hutu housekeeper promise to protect she but prejudice against tutsi people be strong and the dehumanising bile spread over the radio be powerful enough to turn those same neighbour into killer rapist and torturer when the genocide begin daphrosa try to continue with her normal life on the third day of the genocide she and her child flee but her husband be capture and beat and she be force to return home her injured husband be sit in chair in the living room daphrosa and her daughter be force to take off their clothe the housekeeper who have promise to protect they be the first to take part in their rape daphrosa eld son be call allan she remember he as the model child clever with great future in front of he allan try to stop the rape but the man beat and slash he until he die and then throw he behind the chair they rap daphrosa and then her daughter they slash her breast and they mutilate she her husband be force to watch the nightmare terribly injure from blow with hammer and nail club he do not die until the next day on the third day of their torment the militia bring community officer with they she take away the child supposedly for protection but daphrosa hear the man joke that the girl would soon become their wife daphrosa be leave in home that have become live hell with the corps of her husband and her son neighbour come to the house to loot it simply ignore her plight step over she and even step on she miraculously daphrosa four young child survive the two young innocente and eric be take in and hide by neighbour after be remove from the house the old girl aline and tina be find alive in the capital kigali after the war however as we know survival do not mean an end to suffering daphrosa aline and tina all fall pregnant as result of the rape they be subject to and they be infect with hiv at time when medicine be extremely scarce aline own testimony tell how she be rap countless time after be take away from her mother and their home not only that but after their return as the only survive tutsi from their village aline endure further torment from the taunt of neighbour who spread rumour about how she have be infect at the time of the genocide aline be year old when she tell her story year later at the age of she be live in despair while her rapist now live happily with family and child in her word have no future have no life to be honest struggle to imagine how anybody could endure such trauma and cope with the mental and physical scar of that ordeal as we know so many other endure these same terrible experience and as many as million rwandans be murder in less than day the scale be truly shocking there be many appalling echo of the holocaust in what be do to daphrosa her family and the hundred of thousand of other of course there be difference but like the holocaust the rwandan genocide be build on decade of institutionalised racism like the holocaust it be fuel by dehumanising propaganda like the holocaust it be organise and systematic in its brutality and like the holocaust the genocide in rwanda be perpetrate collaborate with and resist by ordinary people ordinary people such as daphrosa neighbour who see what be happen and make horrify choice about how to respond unlike the holocaust the rwandan genocide happen in most of our lifetime just year ago never again rang hollow in in truth fear it ring hollow again today it be pleasure to follow the hon member for west ham ms brown who remind we of the importance of the experience in rwanda just as there be echo of the holocaust in rwanda as she share with we the testimony of that particular family in rwanda there be echo of what happen to some of the people in the october attack breast slash people rap and brutality take place in front of family thank she for share that when use to deliver holocaust education as secondary school history teacher use to put up picture for my student of the holocaust and those appalling scene that we all know too well we use to show the video footage and the picture of the gas chamber and of the body of murder jews pile high never do think that would have the experience in my lifetime of visit the site of pogrom and smell the rot flesh of jewish people who have be murder that happen for three and half week after october when visit israel with my hon friend the member for hendon dr offord that be memory and trip that will live with we all although in my year in parliament have take number of parliamentary trip have never undertake visit that have be more important to and important to in my lifetime not just as member of parliament we visit kfar aza the kibbutz that the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge speak about it be found by peaceniks and lead by peace love leader who be also the chair of the regional council and who be pick out and shoot by hamas fighter on his own doorstep specifically because of his leadership of that peaceful group at the time of our visit we could still smell the blood and the flesh that be still rot in that community as my hon friend the member for hendon will attest we also visit the base where the body or should say the body part be be identify do not think either of we will forget the emotion we feel when the door be open to where the body be be keep in the refrigerator the wave of smell come towards we be truly shocking have deliver education on the holocaust never think that in my time would bear testimony and see the body and smell murder jews it be truly horrendous visit but one be very proud to have make and be pleased to come back here and at least share that experience when deliver that education on the holocaust to year student what do teach teach they about boycotts and how people be tell not to buy jewish good and product teach they about jewish community facility and synagogue be attack teach they about how jews use to huddle in dark space about how they be hold in captivity against their will and about the people shout on the street for the death of jews teach they about how child be indoctrinate with hate against the child of israel be afraid all that be what we be see today across large part of our own country and indeed across the west we now see jewish product in shop attack we have see jewish school in canada shoot at not on one occasion but on two occasion we have see jewish business torch in other part of the west and of course we have have march on our own street where people have call for the death of jews it be the same message but in different era it be not the brownshirt of the nazis on our street or the street of europe parade through scream and shout that society need to be cleanse of jews they have be replace be afraid to say by hard left activist and associate useful idiot be polite way of describe they call for socialist intifada they be join by progressive lgbt group and feminist who would not last second in hamas control gaza the cry of the jews be our misfortune have be replace on our street by call for jihad call for an intifada and demand for muslim army to rise up and fight israel it be no long nazi cross international border to murder and round up jews it be islamist extremist in hamas and the palestinian islamic jihad and of course in hezbollah if it have its way those group be as clear in their intention to commit genocide against the jewish people as adolf hitler be in his rambling that be not to say that we do not still have problem with far right antisemitism and racism of course we do but it have now be join by those sinister group and alliance of islamist extremist and hard left activist what be the response to the atrocity on october by some of those people it be not to come out in sympathy after the event of that pogrom it be to stand outside the israeli embassy within hour demand boycott of the state of israel as have call out before be afraid that even in this place some people have spend lot of time on their foot criticise the response to the atrocity of october and not lot of time condemn those action we have see that in the medium and civil society football pundit and actor who have never utter word about yemen or the child kill there or about sudan and the million of people displace find time to add their voice and offer we commentary on israel sometimes promote ancient blood libel we have even have member of this place tweet about an attack on hospital that never take place blood libel jewish bloodlust that be what that feed into some of they never apologise for that of course yesterday we even have somebody accuse the prime minister of have blood on his hand who have blood on their hand for october it be hamas and the thousand of civilian who follow those fighter into kibbutz kfar aza kibbutz and other community and step over the body of murder jews to loot and pillage their home that be who have blood on their hand some people in this place would do well to remember that have be attack for dare to call people out for give free pass will continue to do that the bile and hate for that come up as result do not bother include from people target my post on holocaust memorial day with word such as zionist scum be proud zionist have never be prouder to be jew or zionist people attack my facebook page and tell about the zionist rat hostage and that nobody care about the because dare to say freely as think have right to do in this chamber that think some people be not contextualise the response of israel with the event of october and be give free pass to terrorist will go on do that because will not be silence by those who seek to bully and from member of the community who would otherwise be scream and shout about the gender base violence that take place on october not peep not word why not be it just the pressure of people inboxe be it something deep and more sinister do not know but find it hard to understand how that be not call out why be that gender base violence not acknowledge why do we not have young people on the street of this country march against what happen to those young jewish woman on october the most brutal rape breast slice off people shoot and then rap necrophilia and under age girl subject to the most appalling abuse look at our street what do we have nazi and soviet era propaganda marching down our street and it be not be tackle the police stand by as people call for jihad they say that it be about context the anti zionist stuff on our street be directly out of the soviet propaganda playbook which itself draw heavily from nazi propaganda look at what be happen in our school just couple of week ago mention at prime minister question the letter be produce by pupil in our school that include such phrase as do not believe all jews be bad and phrase challenge member of parliament on why they believe the western medium narrative that hamas be terrorist organisation where be that come from it be come not from the school but from within community in this country in jewish area in this country we have flag put up illegally that will not be bring down like many hon member have watch the minute video of the slaughter of people on october and the same flag be proudly display on the breast and lapel of hamas fighter that flag be not be remove in jewish area because people be scared council be scared to remove they and can not guarantee the safety of people who take they down imagine if we have swastika up how long would they last be not compare the two flag of course not but in jewish area where concern have be raise about these trigger incident something that would be so trigger in different way would be deal with very quickly we have see that across the west what do want from my government what do want from this country want it to stand up for the value that think it stand for want the right to have different view without be subject to threat of violence know that many member of parliament who have different view on this have have their office and inboxe target and have be threaten those be not the value of britain the value of britain be that we allow and respect people right to have different view that be what want my government to protect want to feel safe on the street want jewish people in this country to feel safe come into central london on weekend which they do not at the present time want our democratic value to be defend want to live in country in which child be not brainwash with hate be it hate against jews hate against member of the muslim community or any other hate want government and institution that stand up and say that be not acceptable and we will do something about just stand up and say we all condemn it but actually do something about it leave parliament this year have never feel more ashamed or sad about the state of some of our institution about our democracy and about people right to express their view freely without fear of be subject to violence or threat of violence that be what be currently happen on our street it have happen on other issue as well and it be dangerous in the time that have want to refer to two holocaust survivor meet this week one be eve kugler who speak at the foreign office event this week she give we example which be all too familiar today of grow up in germany and of experience kristallnacht her father be take off to buchenwald but fortunately the whole family be eventually able to escape so much of her story and testimony ring true today with regard to boycotts the smashing of jewish business and all the rest also want to mention briefly john hajdu another survivor meet this week he be bear into jewish family in budapest hungary in he share with his experience of be hide in cupboard by non jewish neighbour again that ring true with october when jewish child on those kibbutzim be hide in cupboard it do not save some of they of course after hiding john be eventually force to live in the ghetto those who be not take to concentration camp be force into about building where at least people live in each overcrowded flat he describe the situation there as pretty grim as member would imagine his experience be horrific but fortunately during the liberation of budapest he be free minute before the ghetto be about to be blow up as recount those two story they make think that john and eve at least have one fortunate thing that some of the people who be affect by october do not have they live to tell their story right now in gaza there be jewish people who do not have voice who can not tell their story those be the hostage who remain and in the brief time have would like to name just few of they would like to name all of they but appreciate that that be not go to be possible today think particularly of liri albag karina ariev and noa argamani who as member will remember be the young girl on the motorbike see plead to her boyfriend as she be whisk away into gaza her mother be die and want her daughter home but hamas refuse to release she think of romi gonen carmel gat inbar haiman judi weinstein arbel yehud maya goren and doron steinbrecher think of daniela gilboa year old naama levy year old and agam berger year old all woman hold currently by hamas think of the bibas family the ginger haired family member might remember the little baby who turn year old in captivity his parent and of course his brother ariel think of omer shem tov the year old israeli at the nova music festival meet his mother in early november she be desperate for news about her son and utterly distraught of course he have no voice today in this place and neither do so many other think of amiram cooper year old oded lifshitz gadi moses and shlomo mantzur people who be not too different from my parent age they should be at home with their family enjoy the peaceful life of their retirement and their dotage of course it be not just israelis who be hold bipin joshi be nepalese citizen and avera mangisto be tanzanian there be so many other name wish could mention shlomi ziv tsachi idan matan zangauker andrey kozlov ohad ben ami sahar baruch uriel baruch ziv berman gali berman rom braslavski but of course can not name they all today as end my contribution those be the people will be think about the jews who do not have voice who again be be hold as jews be hold or year ago in dark tunnel in cupboard and in cage as we have hear how be this happen again it be now and here we be again jew hate which never really go away be manifest itself for all to see in all of its gory disgusting detail it be an honour to follow the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy thank the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge and my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael for secure today debate and allow we to talk about something that have always be important in this house holocaust memorial day have always be the day on which we remember and recommit ourselves to ensure that the holocaust do not happen again but this year it be particularly important that we be aware of it two thing have happen to personally since the last time speak in one of these debate like my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland be of that generation for whom the holocaust be always history we be tell about it by our parent who have be child during the war and have hear about it we have no personal experience of it but information and knowledge about it be everywhere it be in in the film that we see and the book that we read everything from the diary of young girl by anne frank to schindler list we be aware of it but we do not actually believe that it would or could ever happen again because we would not let it happen again it would never have happen in this country anyway because we would not let it happen however since october have become increasingly worried that we in this country be just fraction complacent about the danger that anything like the holocaust darfur or cambodia could happen here just over year ago go to see good with david tennant in the west end it be an absolutely wonderful play it be about good liberally minded academic whose good friend be jewish and who live in pre war germany he become complacent about the nazis and what they be do he gradually become seduce and involve and it have cataclysmic ending the other thing that happen be hear the first report of what be happen in israel on october be in taxi on my way to the airport to fly out to friend wedding in spain and remember think oh my god what happen this be horrific have no idea of what be to follow few week ago be speak to handful of student at the university of glasgow and we be talk about various issue on campus they tell that they have be to debate about an international chain of coffee shop that happen to have an outlet just off campus it be all very civilised chat and strong debate and then one of the student who be jewish tell that one of the other student have say but it only jews that go there anyway be utterly horrified that comment like that could be make in meeting of young people in this country that be not the only example visit the synagogue in edinburgh recently where hear the concern of ordinary people about what they be experience every day the jewish student association at edinburgh university be one of the large and fast grow in the country but its member feel completely isolated jewish student have write to association across the country to every university ask for support against the antisemitism that they see creep into their daily life and only handful reply do my hon friend agree that the answer be for people to engage with the live experience of jewish people and to understand the profound effect that it have on their life my constituent natalie cumming have write about the experience of her family flee persecution both in russia and the horrifying experience of her sister who survive auschwitz and whose story she retell in her book that book be one of the most difficult read of my life and think that people need to engage with those story and understand so that they do not repeat that kind of prejudice go forward my hon friend be absolutely right it be about listen to hear and engage with the experience of holocaust survivor it be about hear the direct relating of tale as we do at mr speaker ceremony early this week because survey in america have discover that of young americans do not believe that the holocaust actually happen and something like another believe that the holocaust be exaggerated that it be minor event we be in very dangerous position at the moment antisemitism be creep in everywhere we hear of it every day from people who be find that it be become part of their daily experience and we be not aware of it we be all good liberally minded intelligent people how easy it would be for we to get draw in and not realise what be happen around we to let it happen by the time we notice it would be too late few year ago visit yad vashem the holocaust memorial in israel and one of the thing that strike be that it be build on hillside it be dark scary and depressing we hear the tale we see the remnant of people life that be destroy by the holocaust and it have an oppressive feel to it however as we move towards the end we see the light at the end of the tunnel and we come out to breathtaking view of israel at the moment feel that we be truly in such dark spot and we have to make sure that we do not get trap and pull far into antisemitism become accept in this country we have to remember the light be at the end of the tunnel and strive for that absolutely and totally agree with the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine and be bit shocked by this because it have come up on as teenager live in little village in prosperous agricultural area in the north of the south island in new zealand it be mecca for european immigrant who flood into the area and the school be co educational and multiracial there be plenty of schoolboy spat especially on the rugby field as member can imagine but do not remember any racial aggravation at all most of the man of my parent generation be involve in the second world war almost all of they serve overseas from new zealand and when they come back they tell story include some of the horrific one we have hear today like typical teenage boy get fascinated and haunt the village library for appropriate book inevitably in read they read the book on the nuremberg trial and associated book and to say be morbidly horrified would be one of the big understatement ever that be probably cap in when see at full screen cinema the film sophie choice as father that scene of the gestapo officer walk the wee girl away be the stuff of nightmare and it would have scar any parent the united kingdom medical and dental profession be very multiracial there be lot of people from the middle east but also many jewish people some of whom rank not just as colleague but as friend many be among the good of the profession with list of achievement to their name that go across the whole page most of they live in north london and periodically they have make aware of the progressive rise of what see as irrational antisemitic abuse sometimes associate with violent activity this activity and violence increase in the run up to the last election and then seem to dull down bit to however the hamas outrage on october woman man and child rap torture murder and behead and some hostage light the fire again as have see for many of we this be the stuff of horror but it have be submerge in the rise of these attack on jewish people include the professional jewish people in our community these people have nothing to do with what israel do to hamas and no say in that and what be happen to they be complete disgrace with hint of the early day of the nazis in germany the attack be frightening and the most vicious as have explain to by very senior top notch dental practitioner who be an expert on number of key thing and who be treat child she have tear in her eye as she be tell this on tuesday night be the attack on social medium those attack be come on special social medium for the profession so we would assume that every single person write on it be intelligent and educate yet the vile abuse on it be ghastly we be be ask to reflect and hope that we do on whether as many have say this could be the thin edge of the wedge it must not happen again grow up in household where it be common to hear family member discuss world war two know about hitler the sudetenland neville chamberlain and winston churchill and have hear about barnes wallis and the dambusters to my shame however have to say that be an adult in full time employment before begin to understand the meaning of the holocaust be grateful to my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge for secure today debate and for her personal testimony also want to commend the other speech we have hear particularly the contribution of the right hon member for beckenham bob stewart my education have be assist by few very specific thing one be the work of the holocaust educational trust will never forget go with group of sixth former from local school to auschwitz one bitter cold february morning do not know who be more distraught by what we encounter these young sixth former or but it be total education and it leave an impression on that will never forget be also extremely grateful to scott saunders the chairman and founder of march of the living who have do so much to help inform and educate people particularly about the event in poland but also about what happen in the concentration camp be indebted to he for help to learn that before the nazis invade poland in there be million jews live in poland but by the end of the war less than of they have survive my hon friend be make an excellent speech include in highlight the work of the holocaust educational trust mine be one of those family in poland there be now very few survivor leave and think it be important that we recognise the experience of my father generation or the baby boomer generation go with he and my own child to auschwitz last year but also the work of independent researcher and organisation such as the wiener holocaust library in bring home to we what happen we have the very last of that living testimony so we need to encourage all those in the second generation and those research body to keep holocaust education alive my hon friend be absolutely right it be something of theme today that we must do everything to remember and to preserve that memory so that people do not forget as have say scott saunders be one of those who assist also read fairly recently book about witold pilecki there have be lot of excellent book about the holocaust and about certain aspect of it but he be the polish resistance fighter who actually volunteer to go into auschwitz to gather information about what be happen that be then give to the ally and we choose not to act on it we hear early in the debate how we maybe should not always feel so proud of our own record and think that be another example of where with hindsight admittedly we should have do well go back to my hon friend point the other thing that have really help have of course be listen to the testimony of holocaust survivor they be all amazing people but two in particular have have an impact on mindu hornick mbe who live near birmingham who be send to auschwitz when she be year of age and never see her mother or her brother again and harry olmer mbe who be just an incredible man and an inspiration to anyone who meet he when hear protest about current event in gaza wonder what we have learn deplore the killing and the suffering we be see there want ceasefire and an end to the killing an endure peace and two state solution with palestinians and israelis live side by side in recognised and secure independent state want that as much as anyone else but struggle when hear marcher demonstrator and protester chant ceasefire now in one breath and from the river to the sea in the next what be they say what have they learn and what be they advocate some know well what they be do but other need to stop and spend little more time learn the lesson of the past they need to reflect on how little their behaviour show desire for peace and how much it be encourage division and hatred also wonder at the genuinely concerned people who contact about the death and suffering in gaza but skip over the october attack and who use with ease term such as war crime and genocide to condemn israel and the israelis but seem to have overlook an attack on israeli civilian that be base on torture mutilation rape murder and hostage taking some even tell that the hamas attack need to be understand because of israel previous behaviour they usually show little knowledge that israel pull out of gaza and remove all its settlement there in in accordance with the peace accord and be promise in return demilitarised gaza that could become something like singapore of the middle east two year later hamas take over gaza and it have be launch pad for attack on israel ever since the nazis take people in they use excuse and demand they talk about the suffering of the german people they blame the jews they offer seemingly plausible explanation for their action and they lie about their intention while lay plan to exterminate million people be and always will be friend of israel and the israeli people be not fan of the current prime minister and totally disagree with he and other who oppose two state solution believe such view be an obstacle to peace and that such attitude and behaviour risk give succour to those who oppose the very existence of the jewish state but will not accept the blaming of the entirety of the jewish people for thing dislike and will not demand high standard of the world only jewish state than we do of any other nation we need to remember the holocaust and the way that seemingly decent people resort to cowardly wicked and savage behaviour design to wipe out the jewish people those who shout for peace and ceasefire but not for peace and reconciliation have not learn those lesson their shrill cry and disruption of meeting and event organise by those who will not support they be dishonest and irrational and show how much more we need to strive to learn the lesson of history and why we can not ever afford to ignore real genocide and the event of the holocaust royal assent have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that his majesty have signify his royal assent to the follow act and measures post office horizon system compensation act northern ireland executive formation act church of england miscellaneous provisions measure church of england pensions application of capital funds measure holocaust memorial day debate resume it be an honour to follow the hon member for birmingham selly oak steve mccabe and thank he for his commitment to the jewish community in birmingham and to israel it be deeply appreciated have sometimes think that struggle to grasp the scale of the holocaust because every time we hear someone testimony we think we understand what the holocaust be yet it be always only tiny fraction of it every story in the holocaust be completely unique differ factor and testimony include the country someone be bear in where they be make to move when tension start to rise in europe where or how they manage to hide how they be round up and what happen to their friend and family then story differ in how people watch their parent be murder how they care for young love one how they get by and how snap decision they make save their life or those of other the holocaust be the murder of million jewish man woman and child but it be so much more than that the number million be huge but on its own it do not encompass the true scale of suffering it be million of people who do not get the opportunity to wake up in the morning in their home and feel safe million of people who do not have the privilege of make normal everyday decision to get married start family go to school or have career it tear humanity apart and steal the future from million jews and their future family the seventh of october be not on the same scale it be not over the same long period of time and it be not carry out by the same perpetrator it be not even on the same continent but october be the big loss of jewish life in single day since the holocaust on tuesday meet delegation of family member of hostage with the leader of the house brave year old tell we that she lose friend on october can anyone imagine lose friend in one day sadly many jewish family know what that feel like have really struggle with this mr deputy speaker accusation of genocide be throw around too frequently and be the last person who would ever wish to draw comparison with the holocaust as lord pickles say early this week there can be no comparison with the holocaust we now have the jewish state and that be design to ensure that history do not repeat itself it be bear out of the need to do just that however it be true that october be the large murder of jewish people since the holocaust and sadly the comparison do not end there visit israel at the beginning of the year have the chance to visit the exhibition that survivor of the nova festival have create it be heartbreaking on table lay shoe clothing and other item of ordinary festival goer who just go to dance could not help but see the table of shoe and be remind of the pile of shoe in auschwitz lie next to this table of clothe and shoe be make up the kind of make up use in auschwitz you see personal item that make you wonder what that person might have look like or how they might have live when see brand such as do not have to think about that know exactly how they look and how they might have live know exactly what they be do on that fateful day when their life end know that they be not any different from young woman in their or they be do what normal young people around the world should do they be dance have hop my visit would help to understand how the attack happen and perhaps the true motif think it be probably part of the natural human mind and reaction to try to make something so huge and terrifying make more sense hear story about family murder in kibbutz we visit kfar aza we hear about mayor who will never stand for re election because he bravely try to defend his community and about the young couple who be go to get engage and how they texte their parent in the last moment of their life before be slaughter hear about teacher set on fire in her house watch minute of this footage until then some of the most disturbing image have ever see be of the holocaust and image of body strew across bergen belsen upon the liberation but have never know what body look like after be torture shoot in the head or burn until the only thing leave be their tooth have see footage of two young boy witness the brutal death of their father wonder how they survive why do the terrorist so calmly help themselves to drink from their fridge while they scream why be they not take as hostage why be other child take hostage why be other child and baby murder without chance the event on october start with rocket follow by massacre at music festival they slaughter people one by one set car alight rap woman and girl and throw grenade into bomb shelter it do not end there they go hunt for soldier in military basis rap more woman murder more people and take more hostage they go house to house have already identify who live where hamas enjoy every second of it even boast in call to parent that they have kill at least jews no two story from october be the same feel completely overwhelmed try to grasp the scale of it and the scale of the fear if be confused now how must they have feel on that day and every day since never believe would use today as an opportunity to talk about something other than the holocaust firmly believe that be what today be for there be other day in the year to talk about everything else but also know what holocaust survivor today be think and can only begin to imagine how they be feel they have dedicate their life to tell their story much like the survivor of october be now do they be furious that october happen it be never mean to happen again every year we stand here and say never again we rightly label those who seek to distort or deny the holocaust ever happen as antisemite they have the evidence and plenty of it but to they fact do not matter because they believe they have deep understanding bear of their hatred for jews holocaust denial be antisemitic so what about those thousand who do not believe that october happen they do not believe woman be rap they argue about how many baby head be cut off or if they be at all some who have kindly write to tell that october if it happen at all be actually carry out by israel recount how have witness minute of death and destruction make no difference to their view one theory within holocaust denial be that the holocaust be carry out by european jews some believe that nazis and zionists work together in partnership and that as result of have scamme the world the state of israel be bear that theory feature in book call the other side the secret relationship between nazism and zionism write by president mahmoud abbas in the same theory but set in be now gain traction on social medium particularly among young people they believe that october be carry out by israel to legitimise military action against hamas or that israel have be fund hamas or that israel be exaggerate claim of the death and destruction at the hand of hamas what be this theory at its core you tell will not even ask that we say never again one final time in this place before we make it reality instead people should understand what have happen to the jewish people in october last year and since we have the large increase in antisemitic incident on record in response to the large murder of jewish people since the holocaust the chief rabbi sir ephraim mirvis last week make an important intervention he say that claim israel be carry out genocide be moral inversion which undermine the memory of the bad crime in human history he say it be term deploy not only to eradicate any notion that israel have responsibility to protect its citizen but also to tear open the still gap wound of the holocaust know that it will inflict more pain than any other accusation will finish by quote holocaust survivor manfred goldberg who selflessly have spend so many year educate young people here in the uk with his testimony he say the majority of people in this country be not jew hater but they be often our silent supporter and all that it take for evil to flourish be for good man to stay silent on this holocaust memorial day the day we remember the million jewish man woman and child murder by nazis let we also think carefully about the current rise in antisemitism and what we as individual be go to do about it if october be fresh warning to the world about where antisemitism can lead let we remember that it be against that backdrop that we be see record increase in antisemitism none of we can afford to stay silent it be pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for west bromwich east nicola richards who give such testimony of what have happen thank the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge for open the debate in her customary fashion tell we the story of her relative and what they suffer and remind we that we should not be comfortable about what happen in the united kingdom when jewish survivor arrive indeed it be even more important today that we recognise the atrocity that be direct towards the jewish community before the second world war and that continue today declare my interest as co chairman of the all party britain israel parliamentary group and the all party parliamentary group on holocaust memorial which we hope will be erect alongside this place some year on from the end of the holocaust we still have people persecute and attack people base solely on their religion it be unacceptable and be proud that the government be committed and steadfast in their support for israel and the wide jewish diaspora the theme of this year holocaust memorial day be fragility of freedom that be particularly fitting give the unstable position we find ourselves in today all over the globe although there will always be mild tension between community we have to remember that there be war rag in europe terror war rag in israel and gaza attack in the red sea the sudan war and grow concern on the asian continent have never feel more grateful to live in this country and to work in the heart of thriving free and fair democracy we often take for grant the privileged position of be able to get up in the morning work in career of our choosing and be confident that we be be represent by elect individual look to represent our view we do not fear for our life every moment of the day and we be not on constant alert for potential rocket sadly that can not be say for the rest of the world population or even the jewish population in this country as my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy refer to each year the remarkable survivor of the holocaust grow old and sadly year by year their number decrease it be therefore vital that we make continue conscious effort to learn their story and the true history of the holocaust so that we not only let they live on but educate each other to ensure that we never allow the same atrocity to occur have have the privilege of visit many of the holocaust site across europe and in israel over my year in parliament each time find the most remarkably strike thing to be that despite the abominable and unimaginable condition that jewish prisoner have to live through somehow they maintain hope that liberation would occur hope be one of the strong most determined and powerful attribute person can possess many interview with liberated prisoner from the nazi concentration camp describe their fellow inmate lose hope and thus sadly pass quickly thereafter without hope they lose purpose and die remember from book read that there be rumour around one of the camp that they would be release on specific date in the prisoner hold on to that bit of hope for several year until several day before the allege release date they realise it be malicious lie from the nazis prisoner recount how almost instantaneously many of those dishearten people die for they their hope be over and they could no long hang on last week the temperature around london plummet when leave home my car thermometer be regularly read minus or even low be lucky to be wrap up in my hat scarf and coat but could still feel the bitter cold that put into perspective how harsh the condition be for the people in the camp where temperature frequently reach minus and below and blanket of snow cover the camp imagine that with minimal clothing bare foot and body of skin and bone it must have be unbearable with people then physically and psychologically torture on daily basis it astound how they never give up and remain hopeful that one day they would be free have an overwhelming amount of respect for the survivor of the holocaust who so importantly and bravely share and recount their story over and over for the benefit of other to live through those circumstance and then be brave enough to share they continuously with other be phenomenal feat but it be crucial antisemitism be not new and it do not originate with hitler throughout europe jewish people have be subject to antisemitism since the middle age the hatred escalate significantly after the great war when the reparation place on germany and its ally be extreme we have the wall street crash follow by the depression lead in turn to rampant inflation in germany and the collapse of the weimar republic last year relate some of the challenge face between the war in this country particularly on the growth of antisemitism but we should remember that the same thing happen in the united states grow from the traditional hostility of christianity towards judaism jews have be target since the middle age america be rife with antisemitism from the early colonial day however as jews represent only small part of american society it remain dormant antisemitism flourish in the with the arrival of million jewish immigrant flee eastern europe particularly from part of the russian empire where persecution be frequent towards the end of the century condition for jews worsen with the passage of ever more restrictive legislation and recur government initiate violent attack against jewish community commonly know as pogrom consequently jews begin flee in great number to the united states many americans who originate traditionally from north west europe or scandinavia grow increasingly anxious about the arrival of mass immigrant from southern and eastern europe whom they consider to belong to inferior race and they frequently question their religious belief we rarely talk about the antisemitic movement in america more often than not we concentrate wholly on nazi germany but it be grave situation across europe and also specifically in the states antisemitism become ever more common in almost every aspect of american culture what struggle with be this what be it that people hate about jews be it about religion what be it that have come across the age just do not get it thank my right hon and gallant friend for that intervention it be hard to understand blind prejudice but that be what it be people be possibly fearful of the success of those who strive to do well for themselves their child and their child child that be the only reason can think of that people be jealous of what jewish people have be able to do solely through their own effort turn back to what happen in the united states newspaper and magazine be commonly print antisemitic attack there be racist cartoon antisemites represent high position in the federal government there be jewish exclusion from social club and discrimination in employment opportunity many town adopt zone regulation to prevent the sale of land and house to jews from follow the example set by the lead university of harvard many prominent educational institution impose strict quota on the number of jews they allow to study throughout the renowned car producer henry ford publish weekly newspaper call the dearborn independent which attract an audience of over people he launch vicious and persistent campaign against the international jew he blame the jewish community for all that be wrong with society from threaten the capitalist system to undermine the moral value of the nation notably he even blame they for the great war many mile across the globe that narrative be gain traction in germany with the rapid rise of the nazi party under adolf hitler hitler of course be prominent member of the german workers party follow the establishment of the weimar republic and often firm favourite in the party for his engaging and passionate speech throughout the hitler would ferociously campaign across germany promote his party value of anti communism antisemitism and ultra nationalism appeal to both the left and right of the political spectrum and gain considerable momentum as result the political landscape in germany take sharp turn follow the wall street crash in the economy slam to halt and the usa loan that be help repay the great war reparation soon dry up the nazis use that polarise landscape to exploit the crisis and loudly condemn the rule government slowly but surely the nazi party be gain more and more support in hitler run for the presidency but face defeat to the incumbent paul von hindenburg the nazi party become the large party in the reichstag but it be still short of an absolute majority despite initial hesitation from hindenburg hitler be appoint chancellor in although not yet dictator that be pivotal moment for hitler and his party soon after the reichstag be set on fire hitler be quick to hold the communist accountable for such action and persuade hindenburg to pass the reichstag fire decree which severely curtail all liberty and right of german citizen hitler begin to use that to eliminate political opponent and then all those who oppose he with the groundwork for dictatorship firmly in place in follow the death of president von hindenburg hitler merge the chancellery with the presidency and become führer the sole leader of germany the nazi persecution of the jewish community continue subtly at first then more and more discriminative until in it take an exponential and unignorable turn the night of kristallnacht be significant moment in the persecution of jews in germany until that point although still despicable the repressive policy have be largely non violent however on the night of kristallnacht the nazis torch synagogue vandalise jewish home school and business and murder over jews in the aftermath some jewish man be arrest and send to the concentration camp after kristallnacht the condition for german jews grow increasingly and drastically bad as we know by the end of the holocaust some million jews have lose their life truly shocking figure it sadden that almost year later the jewish community be again be unjustly marginalise the conflict in gaza follow the horrific terror attack on israel by the hamas terror group on october be terrifying example of religion base hatred still occur today the repercussion include huge surge in antisemitic hate in the united kingdom it be truly appal that in this country today schoolchildren have to hide their uniform on the bus to protect themselves just because they show they to be jewish my constituency of harrow east boast large number of jewish community the cultural economic and diverse contribution that they bring be invaluable and we should celebrate not condemn what they have bring to our society it be at time like this in this country that we need to come together as one to fight hatred not ignite further cultural war israel be small country and it be highly likely that jewish people in the uk will have family friend or connection who be suffer from the deadly attack that hamas be inflict on the state of israel every single day urge hon member to reach out to friend or local people and offer their thought prayer and support at this undoubtedly difficult time we must always remember the great struggle of the jewish community and learn from the holocaust to ensure that never again will such grave action take place we must do so for the sake of not just our generation but future one to come and out of respect for all those who sadly lose their life during the holocaust will end with an important point from zigi shipper do not hate feel humble and privileged to take part in this solemn debate this year as in past year it be an opportunity to show the house of commons at its good it be an honour to follow the powerful intervention by the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge the right hon member for beckenham bob stewart my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy and other every year in prepare for holocaust memorial day struggle all over again to comprehend how well educate highly cultured and seemingly civilised society in germany could turn on its jewish citizen with such cold hearted barbarism those jewish community have be part of central and eastern europe for century and be so dehumanise by hate fill nazi propaganda that most people just stand by when their jewish neighbour be herd in ghetto and then on to truck and train bind for the death camp holocaust memorial day be an opportunity to remember series of genocidal crime include the holodomor perpetrate on the ukrainian people about which have speak in past debate but it be hard to think of anything that can match the sheer scale of the evil perpetrate by the nazis in carry out murder on an industrial scale brutally cut short the life of six million jewish man woman and child and million of other just because they be gay roma sinti disabled or because they be brave enough to resist the nazis we need to remember the hero who step up and save people sometimes put their own life at risk there be hero here who organise the kindertransport and save many life we also need to reflect on this country approach to its mandate in palestine and its decision to seek to reduce jewish migration there in the just when so many be try to flee attack in europe it be possible that many more could have escape the nazis if the british mandate authority have take different approach even after the savagery of the holocaust be fully reveal british resistance to jewish migration to the holy land continue those jewish people try to make new life for themselves in the jewish state that have be promise be turn away and leave in displace person camp some be even send back to germany from where they have come as everyone have say it be crucial that we remember the victim of the holocaust at time when antisemitism be rise again in way that be utterly unacceptable in any civilised society the come day be an opportunity once again to warn young generation of the appalling consequence of antisemitism and where it can lead would recommend that anyone wish to understand what happen visit yad vashem in jerusalem it be the only museum that have reduce to tear one of the most powerful exhibit be the display of shoe take from holocaust victim at the concentration camp these personal possession suitcase glass and shoe provide one of the define image of holocaust remembrance like my hon friend the member for west bromwich east nicola richards feel palpable sense of shock few week ago when see another collection of shoe and belonging forever lose to the jewish people who own they see that in an exhibition in tel aviv on the hamas terror attack on the nova music festival the item have be retrieve from the nova site and provide truly chilling and harrowing reminder of the yad vashem display see the nova exhibition as part of trip to israel declare in my register of members financial interests during that visit too see the chilling minute film of footage from the october attack do not want to see the film but feel ought to the horror of that footage stay with in my nightmare and mean that literally it haunt my sleeping hour once you see it you can not ever unsee it do not want to dwell on the horror that the film contain but be strike by the brief clip show of young people hide in portaloo or seemingly in rubbish skip at the festival those scene be painfully reminiscent of the holocaust and of scene portray in film such as schindler list of child desperately try to find any hiding place to escape the liquidation of the ghetto and deportation it be horror to see those scene replay just over day ago we should be in no doubt in this house of the genocidal intention of hamas towards israel and all jewish people intention in their found charter and which they have reiterate many time since the october atrocity want to conclude with reflection on the recent brave article by chief rabbi ephraim mirvis respond to those who accuse israel of genocide we should heed his word that misappropriation of the word genocide be an affront to the victim of the unspeakable crime that we remember today as he say its use in this context be the ultimate demonisation of the jewish state it be moral inversion that undermine the memory of the bad crime in human history as we say never again on holocaust memorial day and we renew our commitment to combat antisemitism and racism let we remember the november march in london where hundred of thousand turn out to support israel and the jewish community many with placard tell we never again be now our vigilance against anti jewish hatred must never cease wherever and however it manifest itself it be year since attend my first holocaust memorial day event in hendon would have think that after all these year there be nothing leave to say but today contribution show that there be ever more to say which in many way be great disappointment the first event be hold in marquee in hendon park welcome the idea of holocaust memorial day but do question the sustainability of such an event and whether it would continue in the long term in antisemitism be not the issue that it be today and certainly not as it be lead up to and include the holocaust perpetrate by the nazis the first event be well attend by many people many be jewish which be not surprising because many of my constituent be of the jewish faith holocaust survivor also attend such as my good friend renee salt and be as pleased to see she then as be each year as my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet theresa villiers say over the year have welcome attend the event never say that be pleased to attend because that be not appropriate value attend it over the year barnet council have acknowledge more than the shoah the name that jewish people use to describe the holocaust perpetrate by the nazis past speaker have include not just survivor of the nazis and their relative some of they even elect councillor in barnet but people who survive the bosnian massacre the rwandan genocide and the purge in cambodia for many year have be interested in the holocaust be interested in how it happen how it come about why no one speak out against it why ordinary decent middle class germans either do not know about it or refuse to accept that it happen and what consequence remain today remember read art spiegelman maus book when be teenager he bring the horror of the holocaust to from the third generation since the war in the late it should be remember as the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael remind we that it be just year since the end of the second world war at that time for people who have experience the war such perception of event would be the same as the one have of the falklands conflict in spiegelman book end with his father emigration to america so it have be leave to other author such as leon uris in his book exodus to describe what really happen to most displace jewish people after the war it have be acknowledge and be not dispute that the uk refuse to take refugee from jewish community after the second world war many other country in europe also refuse some population take part in the murder of jews alongside the nazis other have simply misappropriate jewish land and property and be not give it back jewish people have nowhere to go and it be vital that homeland be provide for the survivor israel be the historic homeland of the jewish people and it be the right course of action to re establish the country on may almost half of all jewish survivor of the holocaust today live in israel about live in north america and about in western europe approximately survivor live in britain many of they in the hendon constituency as lord blencathra tell the holocaust memorial bill committee this week the way different generation discover our history have change many now read information from the internet we all know that not everything that appear online be entirely accurate but this have an impact on what people learn and their perception of past and current conflict for many people around the country the holocaust be something they know happen but it do not impact they but that be not the experience of many people in my constituency yesterday speak to neighbour of mine who tell about her daughter university experience at university college london as she say they be liberal jewish family who have jewish faith but be not orthodox you would not know by look at they that they be jewish unless my constituent daughter tell you she be jewish it would not be apparent but what her daughter have hear in lecture and in the university itself be thing she refuse to leave unchallenged have know she for many year and she be not belligerent person but student have tell she that there be no arabs in israel all jews be wealthy and jews control the world all the usual trope that we be

daughter say that it be not competition or even privilege to have such tsar but that explanation be reject and demand be subsequently make for an anti islamophobia tsar for no other reason than there be an antisemitism tsar young people in my constituency be now fearful of attend university and it be obvious why jewish student be hold responsible for the action of the israeli government and the same be now steadily creep into our school there be clear link between these attitude and the terrorist attack in israel on october those attack be no different from what the nazis be do their intention be to kill as many jews as possible and it remain real concern to many of my constituent just like the holocaust denier there be denier of what happen in israel on october will struggle bit at this point mr deputy speaker can not turn around and look at my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy we do visit israel few week after the attack and we do see thing that certainly never expect to see and do warn my right hon friend the member for chipping barnet not to watch the minute video we see not only that video but another video when we be at the shura base the colonel believe it be in charge open the mortuary just like my right hon friend the member for beckenham bob stewart what remember be the smell it be the smell not only of blood and death which have smell before but formaldehyde some kind of chemical use to preserve the body many of the body approximately be leave there because they could not be identify the reason they could not be identify be that some be headless some be just head some be limb and some be body fuse together by fire what really upset and my hon friend the member for brigg and goole be when the colonel whip his phone from his pocket and show we video will not even mention what be on it do not talk to my staff or my family about what be there but it be something that be not in the minute video and it be not something that can be forget the event of october be also quite personal due to the fact that nathanel young be one of the first to be kill he be student in my area at beit shvidler school recently visit the school and be upset when see his photo on the wall the photo show he with and lord cameron at the chanukah event at no he be part of the choir remember he distinctly because of his exuberance and vitality in the week since october have receive several email from constituent this have be touch on by hon member today and it be important to outline some of what people have say to one email say be write to you today as concerned member of your constituency and more importantly as british jew who be increasingly fearful for the safety of my family friend and community recent event have compel to express my deep concern about the rise of antisemitic incident and the apparent inadequacy of the response from law enforcement follow the advice from the police on october instruct our son to conceal their jewish symbol while travel to school my family and be already grapple with heighten sense of vulnerability as community we have observe instance where the police seem to turn blind eye to chant and unpleasant behaviour during weekly march foster an environment where antisemitic sentiment be allow to flourish unchecked recent event have leave question the assurance we once hold that if these protest be to turn violent the police would intervene decisively she go on to mention the alleged assault on group of israelis in leicester square on january she conclude by say that she feel that she can not allow her son to use any hebrew or jewish sound word when travel out of fear that he may become target for senseless violence it be deeply dishearten to realize that in london jewish people feel compel to hide their identity and censor their innocent language for their own safety antisemitism be not restrict to my constituent have be subject to two incident in recent week the second of which remain under consideration for prosecution so can not say any more in conclusion will be attend holocaust memorial day this year in hendon will value it as much as ever there will be day when the shoah will be an ancient historical tragedy but unfortunately that will not be for many more year yet be grateful to the backbench business committee for grant the time for this debate be very happy to be co sponsor of it be very grateful to the right hon member for barking dame margaret hodge for the way in which she open the debate it be very important that we have this debate every year in the chamber and this year it be all the more pressing like other would like to put on record my thank to the holocaust educational trust and the holocaust memorial day trust for their year round work as well as their support at this time of year it be burns night tonight and his famous line man inhumanity to man make countless thousand mourn well stand the test of time when we look at the world today and when we look to the holocaust and the continued impact down the generation like the hon member for brigg and goole andrew percy be often frustrate by the increase polarisation of politic and view there be far more shade than black and white and public discourse be always the well for appreciate that and try to at least understand the spectrum of view that be different from one own on this particular issue perhaps it be the exception that prove the rule the importance of holocaust remembrance and understand why it matter be something black and white there be one clear way in which to look at these issue in an age of increase tension global flux and the grow influence of those whose very purpose be to foster hatred for other we need to be ever more clear about the need for never again to mean exactly that but it will not happen without specific and concerted effort the theme of this year holocaust memorial day be fragility of freedom to thing seem that bit more fragile and that bit more strained and be strike by hear the same point make early this week by rabbi rubin the senior rabbi of scotland often speak in this place about the importance of freedom to follow the religion of one choice or to follow no religion and across the globe that freedom be increasingly under threat we be witness eye water spike in antisemitism and islamophobia we need to mean what we say and stand up against that hatred against the misinformation and disinformation the trope and the troll and the plain holocaust denier the hon member for hendon dr offord make good point about the significant challenge in the online space we also need to be vigilant and face hard truth intolerance and hatred be increase and those who peddle hatred here and throughout the world do feel empower the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley speak powerfully about the huge danger pose by people spread conspiracy and the effort to erode and deny democracy we need to remember that genocide do not just suddenly happen in faraway place they be always the product of the gradual and deliberate othere demeaning dehumanising and diminishing of people simply because of their identity as be point out by the hon member for west ham ms brown they be fuel by ordinary people act in extraordinarily awful way empower by the encouraging and normalising of hatred that lead to the industrial scale evil describe by the right hon member for chipping barnet theresa villiers be fortunate to attend my local holocaust memorial event at the start of the week as do every year these event have be without exception profoundly move and this year be no different be grateful to east renfrewshire council and the holocaust memorial day trust especially kirsty robson for put it together so

young woman whose mother be catch up in the rwanda genocide read we poem that she have write about the experience of her mother and so many other it be entitle we all bleed the same and you could have hear pin drop the point that that young woman make that point about the fragility of freedom be illustrate very effectively by individual history the right hon member for barking talk about her own family journey much of which seem to have be highly dependent on chance it strike that it could have be very different story we need to remember that we be talk about people and family not just about the unfathomable number that we think about so often when reflect on the holocaust while neglect the individual who perish at the event we also hear from geraldine shenkin who speak powerfully about her lovely mum marianne grant whose story have be capture in material use in scottish school thank to the work of vision schools scotland as well as in beautiful book of her mum art which be now on permanent display in kelvingrove art gallery and museum geraldine be exceptionally brave in tell that story and know that in do so she spar we some detail because she be aware of the number of schoolchildren who be in the audience suffice it to say that her mum endure the most terrifying inhumane and shocking treatment as she survive theresienstadt and auschwitz before her liberation from bergen belsen marianne grant be an artist and while in auschwitz she be force to draw for dr mengele know as the angel of death whom she recall walk back and forth in front of her nose in his black uniform as she draw like clock pendulum the horror that she experience be beyond our imagining but of course they would have be unimaginable to she too until her life be turn upside down in that most horrific way the same can be say of the life of henry and the late ingrid wuga kindertransport child who escape and later meet married and make their home in my constituency they have change countless life with their work tell our young people about the reality of the holocaust and we owe they both huge debt of gratitude for that henry wuga be about to turn and be sure that the whole house will want to join in send he our very good wish the importance of that kind of work share the truth about the holocaust be ever great meet gather the voices again this week and hear more about martin anson whose story be so important he talk about the grow anti jewish sentiment in his bavarian home town in the early his activity in the anti nazi movement stormtrooper assault his family on kristallnacht and his imprisonment in dachau before he manage to emigrate to scotland just before the outbreak of the war his son steven tell about trip that he make last year to his father former home where stone call stolperstein have be lay down in the ground unusually to record that someone who have live there have survive usually the stone record those who have be lose on that visit steven be strike by the warm welcome that he receive from the family who be currently live in the house it be an incredible story to hear and the generosity of spirit of the current occupant be think ray of hope in very harrowing history it would not be holocaust memorial day debate for without my touching on another ray of hope offer in the person of jane haining the scottish matron in budapest school who refuse to leave her young jewish charge despite know what the danger be and who pay for that decision with her life she say if these child need in day of sunshine how much more do they need in day of darkness that sentiment be one worth hold to at time when everything seem bit more fragile and less certain than the circumstance that we have perhaps become comfortably use to jane haining be the only scot to be name as righteous among the nations at yad vashem it will take all of we all of here but all of we in our community too to say that we will not tolerate semitism we will not accept hatred and we will not accept people be othere and demean because of their identity freedom really be fragile and all of we together be the key to sustain and strengthen it let we try to heed the terrible lesson of the past let we try to work hard together to keep alive the voice of those who survive so that those who come after we can hear their testimony too and can protect that fragile freedom it be great honour to respond to this important debate on behalf of the opposition commend my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge for introduce it and the backbench business committee for allow the time my right hon friend tell we about her family personal experience during the war and immediately after it she speak about the fact that freedom be fragile and that have certainly be

wiesel say it have swallow an entire people people with hope and memory this week we honour those hope and memory and the rich individual live that lie behind the dreadful statistic that have be reference across the house throughout this debate we also remember the many other kill by the nazi regime include more than quarter of million disabled people up to half million roma and sinti people and thousand of lgbt people many of whom have have to fight to be recognise as victim these crime be the most terrifying consequence of identity base persecution today people around the world and here in the uk continue to face deep hostility because of who they be over the past decade we have see rise in hate crime of every category gypsy roma and traveller community face persistent discrimination many people continue to face hostile environment and in the month since october as we have hear today we have see an unprecedented rise in incident of antisemitism and islamophobia this holocaust memorial day we must all remember our common humanity we must remember too that the prevention of atrocity begin at home and we must seek to unite our community to prevent hatred and polarisation and to warn against the danger pose by insidious hatred this year fragility of freedom theme be call for we to reject complacency and to pay attention to the process that restrict and remove the freedom of those target for persecution as soon as the nazis take power in they weaponise every lever of the state to erode the freedom of german jews by pass decree and regulation to limit the participation of jewish people in public life the nuremberg law proscribe marriage between jews and non jews and in so do rob jewish people of their freedom of religion and self identification as nazi horror spread across europe jews in occupy country be force into ghetto and deport to concentration or extermination camp this be the ultimate manifestation of violence which take away their freedom to live but it do not come from nowhere that be why this year theme ask we to remember how climate for genocide be create it be reminder that freedom can be vulnerable and that we should not take it for grant by provide focal point holocaust memorial day ensure that we come together to remember and to mourn victim of genocide each and every year local activity will be take place all over the uk this week and pay tribute to the many organiser who be ensure that generation of young people continue to hear these vital message it be estimate that more than such local activity take place across the uk around january each year which be magnificent achievement also pay tribute to the holocaust educational trust and the holocaust memorial day trust which have work hard to embed understanding of the holocaust in our education system it be thank to the holocaust educational trust that learn about the holocaust have be compulsory part of the national curriculum for more than year since its lessons from auschwitz project have allow student in school and college to visit auschwitz birkenau in the face of dangerous holocaust denial and distortion these lesson be of paramount importance recognise the essentialness of holocaust education we have support the holocaust memorial bill from its outset just like holocaust memorial day the holocaust memorial and learn centre will provide yet another essential focal point for genocide education and commemoration in the uk it will preserve the memory of the holocaust convey the truth about its nature and crucially serve as fitting tribute to the million jewish people murder by the nazis be pleased that today debate have give we the opportunity to come together to reject hatred and to strive for well future never forget the life family and community lose to the most horrifying violence this be the first time have attend holocaust memorial day debate and have to say that be rather glad it be must be honest with the house that if have have any idea of the raw emotion might have dodge it but be so glad that do not it have be sad and it have be frightening but every word have be worth hear thank the house and all those who have contribute to today debate it have be true privilege to be here to hear it as many right hon and hon member have note the theme of this year holocaust memorial day be the fragility of freedom it be not just about the fragility of freedom in emerge democracy or elsewhere in the world it be about the threat and the challenge to all mature western democracy frankly we have grow complacent about our right and privilege and about our freedom to think speak write congregate worship and pray too much of it be under attack whether by social medium the ease of populism or the search for the simple in complex world so much that we hold dear be under pressure so let we come together as this debate have show the house can do at its good to champion and defend all that we cherish and hold dear to our heart but let we do more let we not just be armchair or indeed green bench democrats let we be as my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy suggest muscular and robust in our stance and in our defence because in collaborative defence there be courage there be hope and there be opportunity the big number of the holocaust make it hard to envisage as all big number and statistic do so let we pause for moment not to think of million as just another statistic follow the auschwitz memorial twitter feed or feed as we now have to call it and virtually every day it present picture or picture of man woman and child these ordinary folk be starve take from their home persecute and incinerate the true meaning of the word their faith let we recommit to always see these people for what they be people fellow human being and never as just statistic whether they be jewish bosnian rwandan or cambodian what we must always remember as many contributor have remind we so powerfully today be that down the century the jewish people have always be force to look over their shoulder with pogrom the holocaust displacement the protocols of the elders of zion and the dreyfus case they be people always worry that they be only temporarily tolerate rather than permanently welcome my right hon friend the member for barking dame margaret hodge be go to call she my right hon friend add poignancy

land of which we know nothing but on our doorstep and just in secondly for what it be worth wish to say personally to he because he speak of his shame and the shame of his mother that he have nothing to be ashamed about he and his man do their good and that be all we as democracy can ever ask the hon member for west ham ms brown be currently in westminster hall for debate about religious freedom

three daughter and who would not be move to think that those horrible event take place just few short week ago common theme have be smell sense that be often not speak about enough we talk about our

great friend of mine have be part of the medical team that go into belsen and until his death he always speak about the smell that be still on his skin we should remember that always the hon member

happen again we have lose the battle have we not what be the holocaust and why should we remember it we can remember it for the horror the statistic the figure and the scale but the eternal shame to use the phrase of my right hon friend the member for beckenham be that it be man inhumanity to man we should all be ashamed and embarrass by it because it show at the darkest and base moment of humankind precisely what we can do to each other in the name of doctrine theology ideology it be terrible thing that we have somewhere deep within our dna let we resolve to keep it bury my hon friend
