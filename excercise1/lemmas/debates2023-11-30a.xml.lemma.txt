approach which have be catalogue of failure include the recent fiasco with the government export website which be so deficient that firm be force to seek essential information from foreign government website what immediate step will the department take to provide some stability and ensure uk business can excel in export think the hon gentleman might be talk about something that happen three year ago which we fix he talk about the export support service website business have actually be praise it interruption business have be praise it they very much have be we have an expert toolkit which have be develop by business and trade official what be interesting be that all he say be that labour have plan to remove export barrier we have actually be remove export barrier labour talk about plan with no detail no one be take it seriously at all the conservative party be the party that represent business in the house of commons audit and corporate governance reform what recent progress her department have make on bring forward legislative proposal on reform of audit and corporate governance we remain committed to reform significant reform have already be deliver to the financial reporting council to strengthen its capability and drive up audit quality the institute of chartered accountants of scotland have brand the government decision to leave the audit and governance reform bill out of the king speech as lost opportunity and huge blow to the interest of uk business and the public the government have be promise the bill since will they reconsider that backward step and make the uk corporate regulatory framework fit for purpose in the century time and again opposition party seek to wrap business up in red tape whereas conservative be keen to cut red tape consultation with business reveal concern about impose additional reporting requirement while the government be look to simplify and streamline exist requirement this week the business and trade committee take evidence from wilko business collapse such as that of wilko carillion thomas cook and patisserie valerie have be consequence of failure in the audit process cost people their job and hurt investor and supplier audit reform be recommend by the then business energy and industrial strategy committee in and the government offer to bring forward draft bill know the minister want to reduce red tape but do he agree that some form of action be now pretty urgent be delighted to give the select committee evidence on wilko the administration report on wilko be continue and clearly we need to see the finding but investigation so far have not show that director misconduct play an instrumental part in wilko failure although think it be clear to all concerned that there be failure in management that lead to the company demise call the scottish national party person how strange the change from minor to major in that response financial transparency and accountability be essential component of economic stability for three year now the government have be promise legislation and improve check on company finance but they have repeatedly fail to deliver how can the minister justify leave the audit and governance bill out of the king speech when it be support by business regulator and auditor alike we work very closely with the financial reporting council no one can deny that the frc have change its approach completely and be now much more effective regulator sir jon thompson do fantastic job when he be there and the current chief executive richard moriarty and chair jan du plessis be follow his work we be confident that the frc can make sure that the uk corporate regime work effectively without tie business up in red tape fire and rehire what step she be take to prevent the use of fire and rehire practice what step she be take to prevent the use of fire and rehire practice the government consult on draft statutory code of practice on fire and rehire early this year the government response and the final version of the code will be publish in spring next year the code set out employer responsibility when seek to change contractual term and condition of employment and be design to ensure that dismissal and re engagement be use only as the last resort the very fact that only last week cruises feel able to say it would impose new contractual term on worker through fire and rehire tactic show that some employer still feel that they can use these tactic with impunity in spite of the government promise to clamp down on they thank the minister for his answer but be there any way he could bring in the legislation more urgently so that we can protect our worker properly agree with the sentiment behind the hon lady question in term of bring legislation forward as quickly as possible of course we have to get this right have to say that be not fire and rehire situation it be fire only situation which be strongly condemn by this government and by many other stakeholder and civil investigation be ongoing into the matter surround that case but yes the hon lady be right and we be keen to get the new statutory code of practice in place as soon as possible we expect that to be in spring next year and once it be in force the employment tribunal can increase employee compensation by up to when an employer fail unreasonably to comply with the code last week concern be raise that the carnival group be make provision to fire and rehire hundred of staff work on cruises and cunard line revive memory of last year when ferries sack over of its employee and replace they with agency labour while the government sit back and let it happen do the minister agree that the only way to provide worker with the security they deserve be by legislate to outlaw fire and rehire tactic once and for all if not it be time the government come clean with the british public and admit that they will always side with bad boss that be not the case at all we take these matter very seriously but we do not think that completely ban fire and rehire be the right thing to do because there be some situation in which company need to restructure quickly we think that employee proper consultation right should be observe where they be not observe and where an employer do not follow the statutory code of practice employment tribunal can impose significant uplift on redundancy payment we think that be the good way to deal with this by strike balance between company and their worker call the shadow minister fire and rehire be rife in this country research publish by the chartered institute of personnel and development find that between march and july employer change their employee contract through fire and rehire technique the government promise in march that they would take action follow the scandal and we now learn that it will be full two year since that time before anything actually change give the propensity for use fire and rehire tactic can the minister tell we how many employee he estimate will have have their contract change through fire and rehire in that two year period do not have that number to hand we want to strike balance between employer and their workforce we condemn what do we need to bring in new measure on fire and rehire and we have commit to do that consultation be clearly need to make sure those provision be fair on both business and worker that be what we be do right now and we intend to bring those provision before the house next spring high street outlets what step she be take to encourage business to open outlet on high street what step she be take to encourage business to open outlet on high street in addition to small business rate relief under which business with rateable value of less than pay no business rate whatsoever in his autumn statement the chancellor announce further business rate support package worth billion over the next five year to support small business and the high street my constituent in flitwick have be dismay over the past few year as their high street have be gradually hollow out lose much love business and recently both their post office and banking facility sadly that be far too familiar for people in town and village across my constituency where business be weigh down by high cost pressure and business rate system that no long seem fit for purpose or fair when will the government commit to bring forward the comprehensive business rate reform that my business be cry out for so that we can get back to revitalise much love high street thank the hon gentleman for his question and welcome he to his place in the house of course we be very concerned about the high street the pressure on the high street be largely cause by change consumer habit but the government have step in to ease pressure such as through the billion energy bill support scheme and the billion business rate package the hon gentleman talk about completely scrap the current business rate system which labour have commit to do but it be incumbent on labour to set out how it will replace the billion that business rate currently add to the exchequer what be the solution it be not right for he or other simply to say they will scrap that billion without set out how they will replace it the vanishing of debenhams wilko and paperchase have leave huge hole in our town centre have lose wilko in both ealing and acton analysis show that the incentivisation of out of town retail be the culprit labour have five point plan to revive our high street put community first what be the government do about all this do not accept that although of town shopping can put pressure on the high street local authority have to be very careful when they give planning consent for out of town shopping centre that could put pressure on the high street that be clearly an important part of the planning process but it be not the responsibility of central government of course would be interested to see that five point plan but if it include the scrapping of business rate which raise billion ask the labour front bench team once again have yet to receive an answer where be that money come from labour run leeds city council have decide that it want to bring parking charge to my market town of wetherby it currently have no parking charge do my hon friend agree that the investment we be make be all very well but if local authority make it hard for shopper by increase their cost that will choke off the high street rather than help it thank my right hon friend for his question and he be absolutely right to say that some local authority see parking charge as potential revenue raiser but this be in effect tax on business local authority can of course make charge where appropriate but they should only cover the cost of maintain those car park they should not be punitive tax on business there be street in the west end of this city important to our economy that would certainly benefit from the ability of tourist to reclaim vat be there my right hon friend raise an important point that this department have look at carefully we be concerned about the impact of the withdrawal of that tax concession on business not just for these business themselves but for the other business that rely on foreign visitor be talk about hotelier restauranteur and so on we be keen to look at this matter the chancellor commit in his autumn statement to review the evidence to see what impact this be have we will look at that with great interest and make our view know strongly to the exchequer export small and medium sized business what step she be take to help small and medium sized business to export what step she be take to help small and medium sized business to export the government export support for sme include the export support service the export academy more than export champion our network of nearly trade adviser and support provide around the world through the

easy than ever for uk firm to sell into international market last week welcome the duke of gloucester to my constituency to award local sme garadry the king award for enterprise for its innovation in international trade how can such business have confidence in the government support for sme when britain export growth be among the bad of the economy and be forecast to be fall certainly welcome the royal visit that the hon lady have in her constituency it be always fantastic to see that support particularly for exporter however think she be bit off on the datum when we look at export datum we see that we have billion worth of export in the month to the end of september we be head towards the trillion export target and that figure be up by almost billion or the figure from five year ago which be before brexit in the government launch rebrande trade show programme pilot to great fanfare but between november and march only two business in the uk be fund under the programme we now hear that the scheme have be shelve will the minister explain what have happen to that initiative which have launch number of household british fashion brand abroad and which serve as vital gateway under the last labour government for sme to access new market the last labour government be of course in office rather long time ago it be not always incumbent on successive government more than decade later to keep previous labour government scheme go the scheme to which the hon gentleman refer be pilot which do not yield the success that we might have hop however will take no criticism from he and the labour party for the support we be give to exporter we be spend million over this spending review period to support sme to grow and succeed internationally and we have record to be commend as the prime minister trade envoy to kenya may welcome the fact that this week the government hold the successful global investment summit and be take step to help british business to export recently return from nairobi where visit some of the uk flagship investment include in infrastructure and clean energy will the minister provide an update on the africa investment summit next year also ask that the

award she have continue her fine form today she do an amazing job for the country as the prime minister trade envoy to kenya and her recent visit in september be big success particularly on the infrastructure side of thing she have already refer to railway and other infrastructure she mention the uk africa investment summit which will take place in london next year and will further our engagement with kenya and other african country foster modern partnership in trade and investment in area such as resilient infrastructure clean technology and renewable energy welcome my right hon friend back to his post pay tribute to he and to the secretary of state for the international trade deal that they have strike during their period in office the uk have strategic relationship with number of gulf nation what progress be be make on free trade agreement with the gulf cooperation council if it be more challenging to strike deal across all nation what bilateral trade agreement can we explore in order to exploit the opportunity for those nation to invest significantly in the uk be excite by the prospect of the deal with the gulf cooperation council with which the secretary of state be very much engaged and be look forward to be re engage with it it be huge opportunity for we as the late figure show that total trade between the uk and the gulf be worth more than billion we be look forward to move the negotiation forward and get very good deal for the uk call the shadow minister welcome the minister back to the department for business and trade and look forward to help he hopefully to do well this time around accord to the international monetary fund over the past decade british food and drink export include from sme rise by just which be the low growth of any country the us canada italy and japan all see their export grow by between and government ministers will not negotiate veterinary agreement with the eu which would help they have cut funding for trade mission and now the secretary of state have cut funding to go to trade show too why will ministers not share our ambition for britain to have the fast export growth rate of any country of course the hon gentleman and have be around in these job for while he be possibly the last trade minister under the last labour government so will not be take any lecture from he on how to improve uk export we have be finance dozen of global trade mission and we be spend million over the spending review period on export in general on the export figure he neglect to mention service export which total billion in the month to september that be huge increase of on our performance in before brexit retail crime what assessment she have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of retail crime on high street business the government be clear that violent and abusive behaviour towards any public face worker be never acceptable and we recognise the implication that such incident can have on business as well as victim on october the government launch retail crime action plan which include commitment to prioritise police attendance at the scene where violence have be use towards shop staff where an offender have be detain by store security or where evidence need to be secure by police personnel the government also launch project pegasus unique private public partnership that will radically improve the way retailer be able to share intelligence with the police in recent week like many colleague have visit shop in my constituency as part of usdaw the union of shop distributive and allied workers freedom from fear campaign have hear from staff about the daily level of verbal and sometimes physical abuse they face and the huge loss from theft will the minister say more about what the government be do to stem that tide of lawlessness particularly for independent retailer who may not be part of the pegasus project will she also say how much be be lose to theft because that cost all of we as customer as well as cost retailer the hon gentleman make an important point this be not victimless crime it impact shop worker and customer credit be due to the hon gentleman for visit the shop in his constituency overall crime be down by since and down by since last year however he be right that shoplifting be up which be why the action plan be so important the action plan work for our high street because it be about ensure that the police be determined to collect evidence and to go after repeat offender and organise gang project pegasus be key because it be public private partnership we have create an extra offence with long sentence for those who be violent towards shop worker with those extra programme of work and evidence collection more people will be convict so those who be involve in crime against shop will spend some time in prison regulator statutory duties if she will make comparative assessment of the adequacy of the number of statutory duty of the competition and markets authority and other regulator report to her department the cma have primary statutory duty to promote competition both inside and outside the uk for the benefit of consumer which provide the cma with clear strong focus on deliver for consumer in our recent steer to the cma we do point out how very important it be that it focus also on economic growth regulator such as the cma have huge power so parliament must give clear instruction about how those power should and should not be use do the minister agree that the cma instruction be model of the kind of clear and strong legal duty that leave no doubt in regulator mind about the job that parliament have ask they to do will he join in push for equally clear and focused duty for other economic regulator where sadly the same can not currently be say thank my hon friend for his question and for his very important work in this area know that reduce the regulatory burden be cause that be very close to his heart and to the heart of those in the chamber today who support his amendment in the recent digital markets competition and consumers bill that view be also share by myself and by the secretary of state we be very keen to make sure that as well as ensure that sector be well regulated our economic regulator focus on competition and economic growth disagree the competition and markets authority be not only the dog that do not bark but the dog that do not bite we see multinational corporation and investment fund of such size that they have more power than sovereign government when will the government give the cma the power and authority need to tackle the corporate monopoly and cartel that have so much sway over our life the hon member raise an important matter that be why the government be legislate in this space through the digital markets competition and consumers bill which give the cma huge new power particularly over some of our large online platform platform that have what we describe as strategic market status this be world lead legislation that will tackle many of the example of detriment that he will be aware of and that he raise in his question today high street postal services what step she be take to maintain access to high street postal service the government protect the post office branch network by set access criterion and minimum service level to be provide by branch across the country more post office have open this year than have close the network be as large today as it have be for five year with around branch open above the target that we set for the post office the minister mention that more post office be open actually they be close the clapham common post office in my vauxhall constituency have be earmark for closure and there be no current plan to replace it be fight this closure along with my hon friend the member for streatham bell ribeiro addy and local ward councillor in the communications workers union this be pattern that we be see across the country it have be identify that postal shopfront have close across the country in the past year with those closure we be see elderly and vulnerable people people who need their post office on the high street have to travel far will the minister tell what more he and the government be do to protect these vital service the hon member be absolutely right to raise this issue the post office have launch public consultation regard the clapham common post office the post office maintain that local will continue to have good access to service there be post office within mile of the clapham road branch and three further branch within two mile nevertheless the government support the post office network with significant amount of financial billion over the past year so we do continue to support post office we know how important they be to constituent and other colleague in this house be very happy to meet she to discuss this particular case cptpp ratification what her plan timetable be for the ratification of the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership we be work at pace to ratify the cptpp which we hope to bring into force next year we be the first european country to join the cptpp and know how powerful it will be for british business and consumer which be why this government be progress legislation as quickly as possible with second reading of the bill have take place in the other place on november we be already play our part as the second large economy in the agreement the secretary of state meet other cptpp minister two week ago in san francisco to discuss the blossoming future of the agreement across the house over period of time member work with organisation such as the trade justice movement have express concern about the inclusion of investor state dispute settlement procedure within treaty because they restrict our own country ability to regulate raise that issue in september and suggest that as the government have do with australia and new zealand we agree in separate letter that the settlement procedure will not be include in this treaty be then tell rather curtly that it be too late actually it be not too late there be the potential to do side letter as we have with other country to exclude an investor state dispute settlement procedure in the light of the government negotiate remit for the free trade agreement with canada the government be specifically seek to exclude that procedure wonder whether the government might think again it be good to be spar with the right hon gentleman again from the dispatch box we have both have few up and down since we last go head to head cptpp do not compromise the uk right to regulate at all it expressly preserve the right of state to regulate proportionately fairly and in the public interest it be worth remind the house that the uk have never lose an isds case such procedure actually help to protect uk investment abroad british investment in canada total billion in which will be cover for the first time by these protection as say if we can not trust canada in international affair who can we trust assure the right hon gentleman that the deal can not be ratify until the legislation have be approve by parliament and the deal have complete the constitutional reform and governance act process business export what step she be take to help increase the number of business that export the government publish export strategy focus on address the challenge that uk business face when export the government continue to promote exporting and to support company through our network of international trade adviser sector specialist and the export support service all our service can be access on in my constituency have company such as eyeol lindal valve peli biothermal friction marketing signature flatbread and small business all of which export globally the small business export through amazon that be fantastic as there be evidence that business that export can pay their staff more but what be the good way to get business that have not yet realise that the world be their marketplace export not just to europe but around the whole world commend my hon friend for be long stand champion of his constituency exporter as the prime minister trade envoy to south africa and mauritius he know only too well the importance of export the government export strategy be clear we have clear programme to assist small and medium sized enterprise particularly first time exporter all of our service can be access via and we have network of international trade adviser locally for bedfordshire who be able to help as well business in essex export what step she be take to help support business in essex to export as fellow essex mp can

export finance my department be help essex company such as icon lifesaver in colchester to secure potential sale of over million in the us colombia and estonia kestrel liner agencies which be headquarter in my constituency and last year receive its third queen award for international trade have also benefit we be focus on priority trade barrier in particular which could boost uk export by around billion over five year the secretary of state will know inside out what the wonderful county of essex have to offer when it come to business export we have company such as wilkin sons and wicks manor and many other producer who will sell the produce that household across the country will enjoy this christmas at home and abroad will the secretary of state highlight how she be work across government with other departments to reduce the barrier to export that cover for example produce manufacturing cost energy cost and even the processing of animal remove barrier to trade be one of this government top priority my right hon friend will know many of the thing that the government have be do include subsidise energy bill because we recognise the difficulty that manufacturer and processing plant face at the moment be particularly focus on resolve trade barrier we have resolve trade barrier worth more than billion to business include those in essex over the next five year food producer in her constituency specifically will be pleased to know that just last month when be in japan for the we resolve barrier restrict export of cooked poultry from the uk to japan which think will provide festive boost to uk exporter worth an estimate million over five year arm export licences israel whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of revoke arm export licence to israel whether she have make an assessment of the potential merit of revoke arm export license to israel since the barbaric terrorist act by hamas against israel on october and the subsequent conflict in the region the government have be monitor the situation very closely the uk support israel legitimate right to defend itself and take action against terrorism provide that that be within the bound of international humanitarian law export licence be keep under careful and continual review as standard and we be able to amend licence or refuse new licence application if they be inconsistent with the strategic export licensing criterion no one be suggest that israel do not have the right to defend itself but as the secretary of state say and we agree within the bound of international law the mass killing of civilian in gaza should concern we all without resort to platitude about the relative toughness of the uk arm export control could she please identify which arm export licence be currently in force include open licence for end use by the israeli defence and security force and provide detail of they to the house do not believe that be something that be able to do or should do can tell the hon and learn lady that last year we grant standard individual export licence for military good value at million to israel if there be specific issue that she would like to highlight we be prepared to look at it but she will know that security and defence export be not necessarily well discuss on the floor of the house or in public for obvious reason state that supply military equipment that be use in the commission of violation of international humanitarian law be at risk of complicity in humanitarian catastrophe in continue with those licence and supply uk arm to israel what assessment do the secretary of state make of the potential for uk government complicity if israel be find to have commit war crime in gaza by the ongoing international criminal court investigation be quite surprised that there be not word of condemnation and the implication that the uk be complicit be really not the sort of thing we would expect from british member of parliament in this house completely disagree with the premise of the hon gentleman question the government take our defence export responsibility extremely seriously and operate some of the most robust and transparent export control in the world india trade deal what recent progress she have make on negotiate trade deal with india be pleased to confirm that advanced talk with india be ongoing we be in round with discussion currently focus on good market access service and investment we remain clear that we will not sign until we have free trade agreement that fully benefit the uk people and economy we be focus on the deal not the date total trade in good and service between the uk and india be billion in the year to march an fta with the fifth large economy in the world and one of the fast grow would be massive boost to the uk economy and put uk business at the front of the queue to supply india grow middle class which be expect to be quarter of billion consumer by this be an important exploitation of brexit so will the minister do all he can to bring this deal over the line as soon as possible for britain my right hon friend of course have lot of experience in complex negotiation and can say that we like he will not be satisfied until we have the right deal he be right that deal with india would be big step forward in the uk post brexit strategy to refocus uk trade on the indo pacific region which represent one third of global gdp my negotiator and continue to work at pace and we will negotiate until we have secure the right deal warmly welcome his interest in do more trade with india steel industry what step she be take to help support the steel industry the government recognise the vital role of the steel sector and be work with the sector to achieve sustainable future we have announce million of support towards joint billion investment with tata steel to achieve the transformation of port talbot and we be also in talk with british steel we have provide the steel sector with million in energy cost relief since and announce the british industry supercharger decisive measure to reduce energy cost for energy intensive industry in community across the country particularly in wales through port talbot steel have create high pay productive job for generation but we be the only country with steel industry in decline thousand of job be be lose what we need be long term plan that support steelworker and their community to maintain those good job into the future and transition to net zero so why be the minister make short term decision instead of deliver on the long term industrial strategy that community such as mine and our steel industry and worker desperately need that be just not correct especially the comparison to the the decision over port talbot have be hang around for quite some time and we be able to work with tata steel to ensure that job be confirm long into the future tata steel employ more than people and that be under serious threat until the investment be secure now consultation be take place with the union and the reality be as the medium have note that the union themselves be not sure how they want to take this forward we be absolutely sure that we want steelmaking in that area and that job should be secure that be why we offer the support that we do have write again to the secretary of state to seek specific confirmation of the government position on virgin steelmaking sovereign capability in this country will she ensure that that specific question be address when receive response my hon friend be first and foremost an advocate for the steelwork and steelworker in her constituency obviously that letter will be on its way and thank she so much for raise it we be use to this government flip flop all over the place it would be funny if it be not so serious for business export and job so when we hear the treasury tell everyone who would listen that the government response to the carbon border adjustment mechanism would be in the autumn statement we be not surprised that it be not the future of steel investment and growth rely on clear and certain path from government we can not have our business disadvantage any more so what be the decision on the cbam if this government can not decide be it not time to make way for one who can decision have to be take while respond to the consultation that take place we have be absolutely determined to ensure that steelmaking will remain competitive in the uk which be why we have be able to support the steel sector with high energy cost and put over billion in place to deal with decarbonisation technology when it come to tata the support we have pledge involve an investment of over billion to ensure that job remain secure in the future and negotiation continue with british steel as well that be the support that we have provide and will continue to provide for steel in the uk topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility this week host more than global ceo and investor at the uk global investment summit which be an extraordinary success the prime minister set billion target to beat and we triple it secure billion of investment and more than job the success of the gis be vote of confidence in the uk my department work support by the billion business tax cut in the autumn statement be secure our country as world lead business and investment destination many people be aware of the incredible story of the redcar steelwork site be reborn as teesworks create job and unlock billion in private investment few people be aware that stockton very own freeport business park be be build at the airport do my right hon friend agree that teesside as the home of the uk first and big freeport offer unique opportunity to those invest in the industry of the future do agree and my hon friend be quite right to praise the progress that have be make on deliver teesside freeport the freeport have already be successful in secure several landmark investment include from seah wind which be invest million in build an offshore wind manufacturing facility that will create around high skilled job and build on the measure announce in the autumn statement last week to far strengthen the offer of uk freeport my department will continue to work with freeport in teesside and elsewhere on secure high value investment this be the department in charge of growth investment and export in the late figure follow the autumn statement growth have be downgrade business investment be still forecast to be the low in the and good export have decline both to the eu and to non eu country give that there be so many amazing business and sector in the uk how do the government account for their poor performance will not allow the hon gentleman to spin his way out of what be actually very good news story for the government the fact be that the uk have overtake france to become the world eighth large manufacturing nation we be the world fifth large exporter we be grow fast than germany and france and have receive more investment than they combine we be the top investment destination certainly for financial service we be do well perhaps this be the moment for to tell he what business tell at the global investment summit that they be unimpressed by the labour shadow ministers they have meet that their offer be unimaginative and that they be repetitive and have no vision for the future of business in the uk we follow the secretary of state twitter feed and quite simply we do not believe she want to ask the secretary of state about late payment in the nine year that the government have spend consult on late payment business have go under while wait to be pay why do the government new plan on late payment apply only to firm contract with the government why do they not rather follow our proposal to make sure that all public company disclose their payment practice have be work with the federation of small businesses and other on late payment the hon gentleman will have hear the measure announce in the autumn statement this be an issue that the government take very seriously disagree that we be implement our plan in partial way we will resolve this issue but be afraid that completely disagree with the opposition have do quite lot on this and many business have praise the measure that we announce in the autumn statement on november the government sign memorandum of understanding with the us state of florida this be the seventh such agreement that the government have sign with state in

the procedure committee look into the matter but the government could and should do more to ensure that we be able to raise issue directly and regularly now we have have no foreign commonwealth and development office statement this week or last only an urgent question yet again the government be be drag here instead of respect the house of commons and it be just not good enough the next question to the foreign office will be on tuesday december will the leader of the house ensure that some progress on hold the foreign secretary to account be make before then it be not just foreign policy decision that member be keen to ask lord cameron about question about his dealing with greensill capital continue to rumble on thank to diligent work by my deputy my hon friend the member for blaenau

committee to ask she to consider whether lord cameron failure to declare that information to the committee be potentially in contempt of the house will the leader of the house encourage the chair of the committee to investigate that will she also ensure that lord cameron do not wriggle out of frequent appearance in front of the foreign affairs committee it be not just his lordship who be dodge scrutiny because that be the government try and test tactic on every front day by day they be erode the convention of this place with their cavalier approach to scrutiny and good government on monday members debate minimum service level regulation for rail without the opinion of the government own independent assessor because they do not give they enough time to look at they yesterday we have report stage of the data protection and digital information bill and the government table new amendment some really substantial at the last minute it be outrageous even the former leader of the house the right hon member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg not someone often agree with think that the government take dictatorial approach to new legislation it have also emerge that the government leasehold and freehold reform bill not only will not apply to new flat but now will not even apply to the sale of new house we have flagship bill to ban hold that do not even ban leasehold what shamble this be child play and no way to run government finally this week see some serious question about what can only be describe as the possible bribery of sit member the hon member for ashfield lee anderson be record reveal that he have be offer lot of money to join the reform party the offer be five year of an mp salary as insurance for defect these allegation be incredibly serious and tantamount to bribery from rival political party potentially in breach of electoral law it have subsequently emerge that the government chief whip be make aware of these enticement be offer month ago and believe they to be serious and potentially criminal have these matter now be pass to the police if so when if not why not why have it take secret recording to bring these very serious matter which go to the heart of our democracy to the attention of this house first may wish everyone happy st andrew day be sure speak for the whole house when say that our thought be still with the hostage who be still in gaza and their family we hope that situation can be resolve quickly first the hon lady raise the issue of the foreign secretary be answerable to this house she will know that senior foreign office minister be available to lead on matter and on very serious issue the prime minister would speak from this dispatch box the foreign secretary have be forward lean and suggest number of thing that he think would be highly appropriate for how he could be hold to account in this place and directly by member of this house no decision have be take yet because we be wait to hear from the procedure committee it be right that matter for this house be deal with by the committees of this house the foreign secretary have be forward lean know that many member have be concern in particular about liaison with member of this house who have hostage family live in their constituency whether they be british national or have connection to britain the foreign secretary be meet and have offer to meet all such family and he be in touch with hon member who be in that situation when the procedure committee bring forward measure it be always sensible in its deliberation be sure those measure will be put in place the hon lady criticise we for not allow scrutiny of legislation her point might have have more traction if in yesterday sit we have not finish an hour early part of the reason for that be that only one opposition back bencher speak in the debate think we be have vote when report should have be conclude the hon lady talk about the leasehold and freehold reform bill she will know that bills can be amend during their passage through the house and we have commit to include ban on new leasehold house during the bill passage despite what have be report that commitment have not change the hon lady talk about migration and emergency legislation and will put that in context it be slightly ironic that labour be eagerly await further legislation from we on these matter when labour member have oppose all the new power that we have bring in to protect our border they fight against we in end free movement and deport foreign criminal they would wish to take an extra people every year from europe and labour in wales be give asylum seeker month the legislation will be bring forward shortly but be not hold my breath on the opposition support it further business will be announce in the usual way call the father of the house welcome the news that the leasehold and freehold reform bill which will bring in modern housing term will have its second reading in week or so through my right hon friend may say to the government that even if we have to add thing to the bill as it go along that be well than have to wait another year for this overdue opportunity to reform effectively the scandalous abuse within leasehold which be load so much against million home occupier the tenant of leasehold home draw my right hon friend attention to the name day question table for the foreign office about the acid attack on shahzad akbar on sunday in england if minister think it be appropriate to make an oral statement will she please encourage they to do so it be just as shocking to have commonwealth country suspect of an acid attack on one of its national human right lawyer in this country as it be to have the russian attack in salisbury and the alleged indian attack in canada may ask my right hon friend to draw to the home secretary attention the letter he will have receive today from the human right lawyer clive stafford smith ask whether the police force in the relevant area be right to assess the risk to this man as low when in fact it be high and whether be it true that the local police have switch off the automatic number plate recognition system for some reason when that might have help to detect the culprit of this terrible acid attack thank my hon friend for his warm welcome for the leasehold and freehold reform bill will certainly ensure that the home secretary be aware of his concern with regard to that police force he will know that the next foreign office question be on december but will certainly ensure that both the foreign secretary and his lead minister in the commons be aware of his concern about that terrible attack be sure that the heart of all of we in the house go out to those innocent who have suffer in gaza and israel and who continue to suffer too wish the house very happy st andrew day to you mr deputy speaker and to we all on this special day have first word of thank the leader of the house have describe in this chamber

much be she scared by the bagpipe as child we certainly look forward to her reply to that be afraid that that answer from the leader of the house illustrate comprehensively the attitude and contempt on the government side of the house for the people of scotland maybe she need to refresh her government grow army of scriptwriter in edinburgh pay for of course by taxpayer money no more free out of date trumpian rant please the leader of the house have claim that she take an interest in the welfare of scotland child so obviously she will have see the remarkable new assessment of the scottish child payment post on the london school of economics website by number of academic expert in social policy and economic it say that the scottish government payment be predict to have monumental impact on reduce child poverty rate and that they will transform scotland from be one of the most unequal place to live in europe to be one of the most equal feel that this house should be give an opportunity to debate it as child poverty in england rocket give her state interest will she please confirm that she have read that assessment if not would she like to send she copy or maybe it be really all about clickbait and social medium reach and she do not care at all let add some more adjective to what the hon lady describe the snp really have surpass itself this week in be self obsess self pitying and self delusional have hit on why it be lose the case for independence if scotland be to take the leap surely it would want its leader to be the sort of people to step up take responsibility and work hard to improve their opportunity but despite the scottish government be one of the most powerful devolve administrations in the world they can not accept responsibility for anything give that the snp have be in power for year and in every single year its budget have be high than in england who do the hon lady think be responsible for scotland decline performance increase waiting time hike in drug relate death and increase in the attainment gap what about the year that the scottish government have miss their cancer and housing target the rise crime the soar violence in

broadcaster hansard may not have pick up that there be mixed view to that news across the chamber obviously the bbc be operationally and editorially independent it be up to the bbc to determine how it deliver its service but it must ensure that it continue to provide the news content require to deliver its remit as set out in the charter and the agreement the first purpose of that be to provide impartial news and information to help people to understand and engage with the world around they the government expect ofcom as the bbc independent regulator to ensure that the bbc be robustly hold

evidence take before the treasury committee on the morning of november on the autumn statement hc oral evidence take before the treasury committee on the afternoon of november on the autumn statement hc beg to move that the bill be now read second time this be landmark moment the economy have turn corner have rightly support people through covid with billion of spend and then billion over the winter to support people with energy cost we on the government side of the house know that we have to pay back what we have borrow the labour party oppose every single measure to do that and every difficult decision but because of those difficult decision we be in the position we be in today because of those difficult decision the chancellor can put forward an autumn statement that focus on grow our economy support business and crucially cut taxis and that be what we be here to talk about today will the chief secretary to the treasury tell the house for the record how many labour back benchers be here for this milestone debate think by my count none which be unfortunate and think speak to their lack of the commitment to cut tax that we have on this side of the house the bill will cut taxis for million work people it have three measure the reduction in national insurance contribution in class primary main rate the reduction of the nics class main rate and the removal of the requirement to pay class nic we be prioritise national insurance for two key reason first we want to put more money in the pocket of work family and nic be the most targeted way to do that secondly well reward for work make work more appealing and the more people work the more there be boost in growth let take the house briefly through the measure in the bill the first be the reduction in the employee class nics main rate which the chancellor announce in the autumn statement by reduce the main rate by two percentage point from to on earning between and we will cut taxis for more than million employee that will save the average worker more than year and they will see the benefit in their payslip right at the start of the new year as this legislation will come into effect on january thank the minister and the government for what they be bring forward the cut in national insurance in the autumn statement be welcome step and my constituent tell that unfortunately many be also say that the average work class family include many in my constituency will still be face the high taxation level be not be churlish not for one second want to make that clear but can the minister encourage and my constituent that there be more to offer from the autumn statement and that those people have more to gain thank the hon gentleman for the opportunity to talk about this because it be important taxis for the average worker will have go down by since we have not hide from the fact that we have to make some very difficult decision to pay back our covid debt and those have fall on the highest pay because that be the value that we espouse as party because of those difficult decision which be oppose every step of the way by the opposition we be able to cut taxis for everybody that be what the value of conservative members be all about we will cut and reform national insurance contribution for the self employ by cut the class rate by one percentage point from to from april finally we will remove the requirement for self employ people with annual profit above the national income tax personal allowance of to pay class nic also from april those who pay voluntarily will still be able to do so and assure hon member that low pay self employ people who make voluntary class contribution will not pay more the bill simplify the system for self employ taxpayer bring it close to the system for employee and not only put more money in their pocket but reduce the administrative burden as result of change in the bill self employ person who be currently require to pay class nic every week will save at least per year take together with the cut to class nic an average self employ person on will see total saving of in that will benefit around million people importantly those with profit under the small profit threshold of and who pay class nic voluntarily to get access to contributory benefit include the state pension will continue to be able to do so the government be commit to tax cut that reward and incentivise work and that grow the economy in sustainable way these measure do just that the office for budget responsibility state that the autumn statement package will reduce inflation next year and measure in the bill will be worth more than billion year the large ever cut to employee and self employ national insurance vote for these measure be vote to give million people an average yearly saving of more than these reduction in tax will not only benefit those in work accord to the office for budget responsibility they will lead to the equivalent of almost people enter work because they will ensure that work pay and will drive more people to seek employment there be another point here and that be about choice hope that the opposition will support these measure today if only for the reason have already set out the public support they and business support they if the opposition do not support they it will represent choice the shadow chancellor the right hon member for leeds west rachel reeves have often speak of her fiscal rule that will have debt fall in the final year of the next parliament at the autumn statement last week the obr confirm that public sector net debt be set to fall in that final year with headroom of billion implement the permanent tax relief for business investment plus the legislation before the house today represent choice to use around billion of that billion of headroom on these measure there be path here if the opposition want it to deliver the billion year they could use up every penny of headroom reject full expensing and reject today tax cut but what they can not do what the obr the financial market and every secondary school math textbook will not let they do be vote for our policy today borrow an extra billion year and still meet their own fiscal rule the number simply do not add up that be what mean by choice the opposition have to choose do they stick to their plan to borrow an extra billion year which the institute for fiscal studies say risk send inflation interest rate and mortgage rate up or do they choose our plan to bring inflation down taxis down and debt down they can not have it both way if the shadow treasury team have no answer today it will fall to the leader of the opposition to grasp the issue rather than anonymous briefing to the bbc over the weekend he will have to make choice that be the difference between be the party of opposition and be the party of government credibility with the public over credibility with their activist this bill represent the choice make on this side of the house have speak at length about why we have make they hope that the shadow financial secretary to the treasury the hon member for ealing north james murray can inform we honestly and straightforwardly on which side of those choice his party will land if he can not we can all conclude as lord mandelson himself say only few month back that labour be not ready to be the party of government commend the bill to the house whatever the chancellor say last week and whatever the chief secretary to the treasury say today the truth be that the conservatives can not hide from the fact when it come to the level of taxation in britain today the inescapable truth face family across the uk and the truth that the government can not hide from be that under the conservatives the tax burden in britain be on course to reach its high level since the second world war as the resolution foundation make clear in its blunt analysis of measure in the autumn statement personal taxis be go up not down any cut to personal taxation announce last week be more than eclipse by hike in tax that this government have announce before the freezing of national insurance and income tax threshold for six year be now expect to cost taxpayer billion they be not just give with one hand and take with the other it be bad than that as say last week it be as if the conservatives have nick someone car but then expect they to be grateful when they pay for the bus fare home do the hon gentleman recognise the context in which the autumn statement be make be he not cheerleader for the furlough scheme and the financial support provide during covid and the energy price shock do he recognise that that need to be recover but because of the difficult decision we have take we be now in position to reduce taxis the context in which the autumn statement be make be year of conservative economic failure there have be tax rise in this parliament alone and the tax burden be set to rise to its high since the second world war that be the context that the british people be face and that be the context in which the autumn statement be make the impact on people across britain be brutal as result of the conservatives decision on personal taxation household will be leave face an average tax rise of from the government look across all taxis we know that by the end of the decade taxis in the uk will have rise by the astonishing equivalent of for every household in the country that be the context in which we be debate the bill second reading let make it clear for the benefit of the chief secretary to the treasury that labour welcome the cut in national insurance that the bill include we believe that taxis on work people be too high and we have long say that we want to see they come down when they can be cut in an economically and fiscally responsible way we will support the bill but we believe that the government need to be honest with people the conservatives need to be honest and admit that they be responsible for the big hit to living standard on record and that this have be the big tax raise parliament that our country have ever see this be not the first time we have debate national insurance rate in this parliament just over two year ago stand here opposite the financial secretary predecessor more accurately his predecessor predecessor predecessor predecessor to debate second reading of the health and social care levy bill that bill introduce in percentage point increase in national insurance contribution for employee and employer an increase that we rightly describe at the time as new tax on work people and their job official report september vol hon member may recall that when the government publish that legislation their own tax information and impact note on that tax rise confirm there may be an impact on family formation stability or breakdown as individual who be currently just about manage financially will see their disposable income reduce we oppose that legislation and it be clear to wide coalition include the federation of small businesses the british chambers of commerce the cbi and the tuc that it be the worst possible tax rise at the bad possible time as time go on the then chancellor now the prime minister realise that he have make mistake he try to make partial turn in last year spring statement by increase national insurance threshold yet the institute for fiscal studies quickly point out that that move would not undo damage already do its director paul johnson confirm almost all worker will be pay more tax on their earning in than they would have be pay without this parliament reform to income tax and national insurance contribution despite the tax cut measure announce today later last year the percentage point national insurance rise be finally reverse yet as we know only too well any benefit that many family may have hop to gain from that turn be rapidly eclipse by the tory mortgage penalty follow the conservatives catastrophic mishandling of the economy the impact of that recklessness be still with we today as mortgage holder across the country face hit of month when their current deal end the truth be that whatever the conservatives do they keep make work people bad off that have be true over the year that they have be in power it have be true over the past two year of change to national insurance and it will be true after the bill become law the chief secretary to the treasury have be try desperately to paint today national insurance cut as the answer to the cost of living crisis last week she claim that taxis for the average worker have go down by report november vol believe she repeat that claim today yet analysis by the house of commons library make it clear that national insurance and income tax on the median earner will rise from in to in will she confirm or will the financial secretary confirm on her behalf whether she stand by her early remark and explain exactly how those figure be calculate the experience of people across britain be very different from the picture that she be try to paint perhaps the answer to the question of the shadow chief secretary to the treasury be that the income tax starting point have double from around to more than that provide the extra take home pay every year that he be puzzle about the hon gentleman promote inadvertently as be the shadow financial secretary to the treasury but thank he for his vote of confidence our point be that today tax cut which we support must be see in the context of year of the conservatives in power year of economic failure with tax rise in this parliament alone and the tax burden on course to be the high since the second world war whatever the chief secretary to the treasury might say people across britain be experience life very differently from how she paint it however welcome the measure in the bill may be they come after tax rise in this parliament alone the british people will not be fool no matter what statistic the government contrive or the gloss they try to put on their record people across britain need ask themselves just one question do they and their family feel well off now than they do year ago the answer be resound no at last week autumn statement we learn not only that the tax burden be still on track to be the high since the war and that inflation have be revise upward across the entire forecast period but that growth rate have be cut for next year the year after and the year after that it take some gall for the chancellor to say that he be deliver an autumn statement for repeat today by the chief secretary to the treasury since the office for budget responsibility report that next year growth rate have be cut by more than half low growth have dog our country for the past year the autumn statement make it clear that the conservatives still have no plan to get our economy grow as it should since under the conservatives gdp growth have be stick at an average of year down from in the labour year before if the economy have continue to grow for the past year at the rate it grow under labour it would be billion large the equivalent of per household every year as we all know because of that low growth the conservatives have have to keep put up taxis on work people low growth and high taxis have make people across britain bad off that be the reality of the past year of the conservatives in power the bill tax cut can not even remotely compensate for the damage they have do to our economy and the living standard of people across britain although we support today tax cut we know that our country need economic growth to make work people well off and to get our public service off the floor that be the plan from labour we be the party of fiscal responsibility and of business with plan to make work people well off come the next election it can not come soon enough people across britain will look at the conservatives record and the bleak achievement they will claim in this parliament real disposable household income will have fall the furth follow year of pay stagnation real average earning be not forecast to return to their peak until four million people have be drag into pay tax with million more in the high rate the big hit to income on record next year real term income will be low than it be before the pandemic this the big tax raise parliament britain have ever see whatever the conservative say or do and whichever way they try to twist and turn reality have catch up with they we have be here before we remember the conservatives promise to cut income tax ahead of the election back then people decide that it be too little too late come as it do after tax rise in that parliament as this parliament approach its end today conservative party be show itself to be even more divided and desperate than in the late as the next election draw near and the conservatives try to cling on to power the risk grow that they will get more desperate with their promise and more reckless with taxpayer money britain need plan to get the economy grow and make work people well off that be what labour be offer and why general election can not come soon enough call the chair of the treasury committee be not sure that have ever hear more grudging shadow front bench speech on measure that the opposition support they support they so wholeheartedly today that none of their back benchers have show up to speak to they endorse the measure in the legislation the chief secretary be right to point to the turning point that the uk economy have reach this year thank to the step take year ago to ensure that fiscal policy do not cut across the central bank aim to reduce inflation to its target thank to that inflation which might have be as high as last year have fall to that mean that today the earning of the average uk worker be rise fast than the rate of inflation we be see real earning growth that be the turning point that be talk about the shadow minister and the chief secretary both talk about the choice that the chancellor could make on this occasion in the evidence that the treasury committee take this week on the autumn statement we see the clear impact of the chancellor choice on two long stand challenge for the uk economy slow productivity growth and the fact that not everyone have return to work since the pandemic when we get to the finance bill will expatiate far on the supply side measure on the labour market and permanent full expensing but today will focus on the national insurance contribution element which the office for budget responsibility also consider to be supply side measure in the evidence that we take we hear from the member of the office for budget responsibility professor david miles that the choice to go for the national insurance contribution reduction in the autumn statement create definite positive as an incentive to work the obr forecast that it will bring close to full time equivalent extra worker back into the workforce that be so important paul johnson from the institute for fiscal studies note in his evidence that compare with similar cut in income tax rate cut to national insurance be more progressive it benefit people in work but only on their earning up to that be important context for the choice that the chancellor take also welcome the simplification of taxis concept our committee be commit to far too many thing in our tax system act as disincentive to do an extra hour of work there be too many complicated withdrawal rate the step take on class and class contribution represent simplification of the tax system interestingly we be tell in our evidence session that the change to class and class reduce the incentive for people to incorporate to gain tax advantage we should have tax system that be broadly neutral on those two thing professor miles tell we that he think that the national insurance cut be unambiguously more positive incentive to work the office for budget responsibility do not see the measure as inflationary he also say that some people at the margin who think it perhaps be not worth work might now be persuade to actively try to get job and that the measure will help retain people in the labour force to conclude my short remark on the narrow measure in the bill want to focus on the evidence that we have receive on the choice that the chancellor take on national insurance and how that be very much focused on the structural challenge that the uk economy face call the snp spokesperson we have hear an awful lot about choice at the start of this debate what be abundantly clear for family in scotland and across the nation of the uk be that the government have choose to ignore the burn cost of living crisis that they put in place for family let be unequivocally clear from the outset that the chancellor attempt to masquerade the bill as meaningful support for people be nothing short of farce say to he at the statement that it would not bear scrutiny and it have not bear scrutiny family in scotland already grapple with the harsh reality of the soar cost of living be acutely aware of the uk government role in their deteriorate financial situation no amount of tory spin can disguise the stark truth of their policy or the fact that those family be face with future of perma austerity under westminster the autumn statement be critical opportunity for meaningful intervention it be to say the least profound disappointment it offer scant relief to household across scotland household already beleaguer by the catastrophic decision of this uk government the audacity of the chancellor in try to package the reduction in national insurance rate as major tax cut be an insult to the intelligence of the scottish people we be witness funding for public service push to breaking point due to year of real term cut to the scottish budget the scottish government have seek to protect worker and service and be have to do that with diminish resource yet the uk government have shamefully neglect to prioritise investment in the nhs and other public service which will accord to the obr see cut of billion in the come year the bill in legislate for the change to national insurance outline in the autumn statement be glaring example of the government disconnect from the reality on the ground the change announce by the chancellor some to take effect from january onwards be mere drop in the ocean of what be urgently need now by family struggle with rampant food price increase punish increase in rent and mortgage and the dreaded prospect of another winter with soar energy bill the government could have listen to our plea to provide energy bill rebate to reduce the price cap and more instead they will preside over increase in the energy price cap to land on january hardly happy new year for those who can not afford now to switch on the heating let we dissect the fact the main rate of nic for employee be to be cut from to change affect those earn between and for the self employ the rate drop from to with the flat rate nic charge also be scrap for some on paper those change might appear beneficial but in reality they be superficial the resolution foundation torsten bell aptly note that taxis be up not down this be no generous gift to the public it be thinly veil attempt at distraction the institute for fiscal studies highlight concern trend despite these nominal cut we be face the most significant rise in taxis in recent memory the tax threshold freeze since will largely if not entirely counteract any benefit of the chancellor cut to nics next year for someone with average full time earning that mean saving of in ni contribution but an increase of due to the unchanged tax threshold the chancellor so call giveaway then amount to paltry for the average earner far cry from the over boast about today from the detrimental effect of austerity to the chaos of brexit and now the mismanagement of the cost of living crisis it be abundantly clear that the westminster government be liability for the work people of scotland they be leave to shoulder the burden of westminster disastrous decision our public service the very foundation of our society be under threat the chancellor spending plan particularly his silence on they post march signal disturbing turbo boost of austerity the obr report ring alarm bell the uk government fiscal strategy be shroud in uncertainty and wishful thinking the scottish government be hand real term reduction in the block grant yet be expect miraculously to maintain public service with for example health budget increase of less than for inflation sit even today at so that nhs money equate to only million blow away by inflation before it arrive leave only the cold sting of sharp cut in reality the autumn statement and the bill will serve as stark reminder that westminster government be fundamentally misalign with the value and need of the people of scotland our aspiration for fair just and prosperous society can not be realise under such governance independence remain the only viable path to ensure the wellbeing and prosperity of the scottish people in conclusion it be imperative that the government acknowledge their failing even at this late stage and take decisive step to truly support household and public service across the nation and in scotland until such time we in the snp will remain unwavering in call for real help for people struggle with rise rent and mortgage struggle to pay for their shopping and terrify of the cost of their energy bill this winter our value be to champion the interest of the scottish people to safeguard our community and the family who live in they we will continue to call for the real power of independence to deliver on they it be pleasure to speak very briefly in this debate my starting point be the concern feel when listen to my right hon friend the chancellor of the exchequer make his autumn statement and highlight this aspect of the measure he be take to hear cry of not much and big deal from some on the opposition benches it be important to reflect that even if we be look solely at the class national insurance contribution element the amount that add to household income equate to more than the cost of child school uniform for year it be quarter of what the average household in the uk spend on christmas these be significant amount of money for good many of our constituent indeed for one of my constituent who be affect by the ultra low emission zone policy it would even pay their ulez charge for fortnight take in concert with the rest of the measure it will make significant difference to many household budget and ensure that people have more money in their pocket in the new year represent constituency that accord to the ons be very much constituency of worker we enjoy very high level of employment and self employment very low level of unemployment and be very pleased to say high household income on average than the rest of the uk but within that there be many many worker those who be begin their career or who have face unstable employment for whom this will make real and practical difference for that reason alone enormously welcome the measure we will be vote on today would like to offer the chief secretary and the treasury team an issue for consideration which arise out of something see in my constituency it have be the subject of lot of debate in this house in the last week or so in the conservatives stand on manifesto that set target of an additional foreign student come into the uk that manifesto commitment have be achieve we know that it earn we in foreign currency income around billion year it be big earner for the united kingdom than our oil and gas industry so it be incredibly important to our economy part of the thinking behind it be that many of those worker would become long term resident of the uk especially in area of great need our national health service caring profession and the technology industry hear from good many constituent about the challenge they still face recruit those worker to ensure that my constituent who need an operation can get it on time and that business can grow home office figure show that very large proportion of those people leave the united kingdom at the conclusion of their study but that some stay concern have be express about whether those who transition into work after be foreign student or those who be here for brief period on working visa and subsequently move abroad pay sufficient amount into the uk economy to cover the cost of the benefit they may well receive right hon and hon member have highlight those who come to the uk under care worker visa but who bring with they dependant who have significant health and educational cost would the treasury team in due course give consideration to set differential rate of national insurance contribution for those who come to the uk on those type of visa in line with the measure already take of charge those apply for those visa significantly high fee and the national health surcharge it would then become absolutely clear to everyone in this country that people who be here for short period will pay contribution that reflect the potential benefit available to they whereas those who be lifelong citizen for whom those cost will be spread out across their entire work life will enjoy the benefit of low rate every country in the developed world have face similar set of challenge around interest rate and cost of living we all know what the reason be the impact of covid and the impact of rise us interest rate which set basic interest rate and mortgage rate across the whole of the developed world however as my hon friend the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin say the turning point have clearly be reach most of we can see and feel in our constituency the sign of return to growth and sense of prosperity the fact that wage be now rise ahead of inflation be hugely significant to the living standard of all people but especially to those on low income the measure be here to support today be incredibly important commend the treasury team for bring they forward it be pleasure to join this debate albeit one attend by literally zero back benchers of his majesty loyal opposition this debate and the change to national insurance raise narrow issue of the amount of tax be pay by our constituent wide issue relate to the question pose by the shadow minister the hon member for ealing north james murray be you well off today than you be in broad still question about the value and purpose of life and what matter most to our constituent shall touch on all three in turn on the narrow issue the national insurance payment moot in the bill there be widespread agreement that they be good news for our constituent because they mean low tax it be recognise that there be social justice in the measure because they be not applicable to those earn more than year we already know that no party in this house will oppose they on the narrow issue therefore the chancellor the treasury and those involve in create the bill have clearly get it right as my hon friend the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin point out this can easily be see to be one of the measure by which we judge turning point in the wide economy after all only few month ago there be widespread expectation that the economy would be in recession unemployment would be rise taxis would be increase and there be very little wiggle room for the public finance to be see to improve all those thing have be turn around none of we can say with certainty that we be in full summer but the green shoot be evident and thing be change on the broad issue of what we measure to answer the question be our constituent well off today than in there be different aspect suspect the shadow minister have most clearly in mind simple calculation of whether salary net of inflation be high or low and if we take that on its own it will be challenge for many government member to demonstrate that the answer be yes for my constituent in gloucester average take home pay have rise from to but their salary have not keep up with increase in inflation that be only part of the equation though we need to take into account all the different form of taxation which include council tax it be cliché but true that council tax rise fast and be high in labour run council whereas the conservative run council in gloucester have do good job of keep it as low as possible over the last year then there be the question of take home pay as point out to the shadow minister because income tax now apply only at rather than at just over the take home pay element have increase by other than that relatively straightforward financial calculation there be many measure on which hope all of we would want to answer yes to the question be you well off today than you be in shall pick out few of these crucial indicator because they be relevant to the wide context of the bill the centre for cities report be an excellent source of datum for those who live in city so let highlight few element of what its late report say about gloucester we be one of the low city for economic inactivity in effect we have low unemployment and high employment in fact our be the third high employment rate have rise last year from to increase the regional average be so we be way ahead of the south west average that mean that many more people have purpose in their life they have occupation they can thrive in they be bread earner at home and useful role model for their child and the city as whole have strong sense of purpose it be often forget but many people remember vividly that their job be keep by the billion spend during by the pandemic the furlough scheme ensure that during the pandemic people could shelter at home confident that their job would still be there and those who have their own business know that the vast majority of those business would undoubtedly have go bankrupt during the pandemic the small businessman and woman the self employ the entrepreneur all come through that period intact whereas under different scheme that would have cost taxpayer less they would have struggle the question be you well off today than in need to encapsulate other question be your business able to survive be your job keep be you still able to be self employ during period when so many people around the world be struggle horribly we in gloucester be extraordinary in that our city have one of the very low percentage of population with no formal qualification in fact extraordinarily gloucester have few people with no formal qualification than cambridge and we be only behind oxford the skill of my constituent be different from many of those in oxford or cambridge large number of our people be highly skilled with high apprenticeship work in industry like aerospace nuclear and high level engineering those occupation apprenticeship and high apprenticeship have increase hugely over the last or year and be seriously threaten by the prospect any prospect of labour government let illustrate that statistically since there have be almost new apprenticeship start in in population of about the run rate of apprenticeship million new apprenticeship since would have be almost halve under the labour run rate between and be labour current proposal on apprenticeship spending to go through it have be suggest that apprenticeship would no long exist therefore the skill that my constituent have which be be valuably use in lead sector that be be support by the treasury and this government would be at serious risk under new government who do not value apprenticeship so highly the question be you well off today than you be in could also be rephrase what will happen to your skill your purpose your job and your future earning under the change propose by the labour party which be so sadly absent here today there be different issue that we need to consider in answer the question be you well off today education be vital for all of we and everyone in the country need to be more aware that our pisa ranking have rise from to fourth in reading and from to in mathematic might be one off on both but it be significant leap forward those skill be vital to all our young constituent get the opportunity they deserve within infrastructure there be the whole question of public transport gloucester have additional train service to bristol worcester and down to london there be wide range of service sport culture and leisure and cultural regeneration and the role of heritage be incredibly important to any city gloucester more than win from the national lottery heritage fund have bring alive our old building and rebuild pride in the city these thing be all part of answering be you well off today than you be in be where you live well place today than it be in national insurance contribution be come down sharply which will mean an average saving of around to each of my constituent and for those on salary over all of that will be appreciate but it be about the wide context in which it happen the gradual recovery and the sense of green shoot come through after difficult year that be important and then there be the wide context of what have be achieve over the last to year we must all take that into careful consideration congratulate my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham on his remark he provide lot of sensible context for this debate and will address some of his helpful point shortly it be very unusual to talk about fiscal matter or fiscal legislation to an almost empty chamber it be unheard of during my time in parliament as my hon friend will know back in after the financial crisis when we have to consider the long term economic plan to build back our economy and to restore fiscal competence there be many long heated debate and rightly so in which proper scrutiny be give not just to bills and legislation but to an exposition on the state we be in and how we need to get ourselves back on to an even keel by grow the economy through conservative policy that bring to today theme conservative policy have over the last decade help to restructure the economy rebuild our country and create job and economic growth they have make we stand tall in the world once again remember in and look at our financial rating with degree of despair thank goodness we be no long in that state which think we all welcome welcome this bill and thank the treasury and in particular my right hon friend the chancellor for bring it forward any measure that bring down the tax burden should be welcome because it represent positive and constructive step in the right direction for our constituent our constituent be taxpayer and ultimately they want to keep more of the money they earn and they want to know that the government be spend their money responsibly reduce the class primary rate from to will put money into people pocket from january the soon the well commend the government for bring forward this vital fiscal measure be disappointed that there be not more colleague here to debate it but that be just how parliament be right now the benefit to worker on the average salary will make an important difference to household my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds put it succinctly when he speak about what it mean for household at this time of year and for domestic budget and spending be particularly pleased to see the elimination of the class rate and the reduction of the class rate which will help the self employ from the start of the new financial year never tire of come to this chamber to say that represent constituency and county of entrepreneur we be self starter we be self make people we be very proud of the contribution that the people of essex make to our country they be net contributor to his majesty treasury which be all the more reason why they should get tax cut as government who believe in enterprise economic growth and let people stand on their own two foot we should do everything possible to support the self employ and sole trader it be hard work be sole trader and be self employ we know about the regulatory burden and pressure that hmrc put on sole trader and the self employ in particular but they be the backbone and the engine of our economy they be the lifeblood that create job some of my constituent be employ by small and medium sized enterprise that be percentage point high than the national average and we want they to continue to thrive and grow as be right and proper they be the embodiment of the entrepreneurial spirit that our country need to create growth sometimes feel that we do not always give they the voice they need it be easy for the big company that can lobby central government departments to get their voice and representation hear we be here for our constituent as their mp even at business question this morning members speak about three family run business that be who we should be support we have see reduction in the number of self employ people from around million just before the pandemic to just over million this year that be why believe we must back they support they and encourage their growth we should hold out that ladder of opportunity where they need help and support we should back they as government and as country always come to this house to give shameless plug for family run and self employ business in my constituency it be also important that we buy british and support local firm in our country and in our constituency it be important to remember that the self employ contribute an estimate billion to the economy and the fiscal and supply measure will make it easy for they to trade the ability to do business to trade and to set up business be so important low taxis will mean that more people want to give it go and set up business they be the one take risk so they be the people we should back and support if we want to be healthy competitive and drive growth these be the very people who innovate and invest in new technology and do thing that be edgy and somewhat different while provide vital service to so many of our constituent and be pioneer in certain sector that be why keep taxis down should be at the core of our mission in government as we have already align the class and class threshold to match the tax free threshold on income tax we all welcome that the burden of national insurance contribution have be reduce for the self employ that be why be disappointed that there be not more opposition members present my right hon friend be make brilliant speech totally agree with she on the nic pay by employee and the self employ in esher and walton the average employee will receive tax cut of year benefit people she be right that we be here to give voice to the ambition and aspiration of local people in our constituency aside from the labour benches be totally empty there be not single liberal democrat member here be it not churlish that at this particular time they be not do more to support people on low and middle income my right hon friend be right about that his observation be spot on he will recall that as say in my opening remark when we have be in this chamber to discuss important fiscal and economic measure it have more often than not be to full house it be appal that when the government be back work people and do the right thing for they by put more money in their pocket the opposition be all hide they be fail to recognise something that their constituent will benefit from the opposition should be give positive voice and support it because it mean more job and growth in every constituency across the country as parliamentarian we should all welcome that rise order the hon gentleman be quite late in and do not hear the beginning of the right hon lady speech thank you madam deputy speaker as have be mention the alignment with the tax free threshold should also help with the future plan to simplify the tax system we have bit of discussion on this last week but it be important in today debate again to raise the prospect of simplify the tax system more should be do in that area by merge income tax and national insurance together that be why be disappointed that more opposition members be not here to discuss it last week we have semi healthy discussion about it it be out of the scope of this bill to table an amendment to bring those two taxis together but urge those on the treasury bench would also be happy to work with other colleague on this to consider take that up in advance of the spring budget much more can be do here such move would simplify taxis for the entrepreneur and self employ even far as we know when we come to the end of the tax year they be constantly have to do all sort of thing to satisfy his majesty revenue and customs in ask the treasury write question on integrate those taxis and the then exchequer secretary reply by state since budget the government have engage extensively with stakeholder to develop option for operational integration of income tax and national insurance contributions as many stakeholder have recognise this be complex issue with potentially significant implication for employer payroll operation the government will provide an update on this work later in the autumn as we have already make clear this be long term reform on which the government will proceed carefully that be long time ago it be year ago although this be complex issue maintain that such move would help to simplify the tax system know that the treasury committee have look at this area and my hon friend the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin touch on it today such move would help to make payroll much easy for business and allow they to co ordinate income and revenue in much more straightforward way although this next issue may not be directly within the bill scope it do relate to nics would therefore like to take the opportunity to restate for treasury ministers the position on fiscal drag the obr forecast show that freezing of the nics threshold and the income tax threshold will relative to consumer price index inflation and after take into account the tax cut here bring in an estimate billion in the next fiscal year with this rise to nearly billion more for the exchequer in the obr be clear on that minister know my view as we go into spring next year and as the economy grow and more revenue come in urge they to look at this area all over again this bill be welcome it be positive step in the right direction along with the entire autumn statement commend my colleague for the work they have do on it the speed at which the government be act to bring forward the benefit of the ni change and get they into pay packet as early as possible be right it be commendable and should be support as hope it will be by all colleague in the house the government must continue to look at further step we want more economic growth we be pioneer when it come to innovation and small business we need to find other way to lower taxis so that people can keep more of their earning and importantly we ensure that our economy be match fit for the future so that it continue to grow call the shadow minister before start want to say that we have hear during the debate that former labour chancellor alistair darling have die at the age of be sure member will agree no matter which side of the house they sit on that he be man who care deeply about people across the country and that our thought be with he and his family today the government may want our constituent to believe that they be ease the burden on their pay packet but the reality be that household have not give the state this much of their earning since the despite the warm word that we have hear today on tax cut household be now pay more year than they do under the previous labour government this be crippling tax burden for those struggle to make end meet through the cost of living crisis despite today commitment to reduce ni as result of the tories decision on personal taxation work people be leave face an average rise of since so although labour support the measure put forward today to lighten the load that nic be place on our constituent we should see this announcement for what it be cynical attempt to draw voter attention away from the fact that under this government their living standard be go down and taxis be go up while their wage continue to stagnate as the british people already know the promise make today can not compensate for the damage that have be do the measure announce today be equivalent to hand back for every of the conservatives tax rise since the freeze in the personal allowance threshold mean that couple on an average wage will still be staggering bad off per year regardless of cut to personal taxation the wide freezing of current threshold have confirm that an additional million of the poor in society will now pay income tax by the scorecard for last week autumn statement be now in and our lead independent economist do not seem that impressed the obr have confirm follow the chancellor announcement that real household disposable income will drop by next year as my hon friend the member for ealing north james murray note the head of the institute for fiscal studies have also give damn verdict state that the nics reduction that we have be debate today pale into insignificance compare with the threshold freeze announce by the chancellor accord to the late international monetary fund forecast the uk will have the slow growth in the next year the bank of england have confirm that there will likely be zero growth in the economy until those be not figure that the government should be proud of if that economic backdrop be not bad enough our constituent be also leave worry about how to pay for their mortgage and avoid have to sell the family home due to the reckless action of this government work family will see an average increase of month in mortgage cost because of the tory mortgage bombshell and million household be also set to suffer as they desperately try to re fix their mortgage deal next year the chancellor and other conservative members may want we to believe that the economy have turn corner and that the cost of living crisis be over but million of people be still struggle to make end meet so of course we welcome the tax cut be debate today but it be drop in the ocean for work family who be still bear the brunt of this government economic decision despite the desperate smoke and mirror we have see from the chancellor it be now clear that this government do not know how to find the solution to address the fundamental challenge face this country right now all the challenge that our constituent be face day in day out after year of failure it be time that the government get out of the way and let labour deliver its plan for the economy and how to grow it again get wage rise again and get britain its future back for all the warm word that we have hear today if the conservatives sincerely believe in their policy they should ask the general public and call general election as soon as possible on behalf of the government join the hon member for hampstead and kilburn tulip siddiq and the whole house in express our deep sympathy to the family and friend of alistair darling know he have many personal friend in the house who know he very well indeed never have the pleasure of interact with he here but what an incredibly calm and dignified gentleman he be perhaps that be something we can all reflect on although the debate be somewhat one sided as most contribution come from the government benches thank all hon member for their contribution this important bill deliver tax cut and reward and incentivise work while grow the economy in sustainable way will respond to many of the point raise the hon member for strangford jim shannon rightly point out the importance of look after the low pay and have fair tax system which we be deliver on over the last year we have lift hundred of thousand of family out of poverty and we have progressive tax system where the top of taxpayer pay of all income tax my right hon friend the member for vale of glamorgan alun cairns and my hon friend the member for gloucester richard graham highlight the context in which the autumn statement be deliver and recognise the fact that we have face not one but two global crisis the pandemic and the cost of living challenge those challenge be not unique to the united kingdom and despite the myth peddle by the opposition whoever be in government would have face those challenge we do not remember the opposition argue against any of the intervention or support measure at the time it be as if they have completely forget about that not recognise the context and the global circumstance speak volume about their inability to run the economy we operate not in vacuum but in global system my hon friend the member for gloucester go on to highlight the remarkable progress make over the last year particularly in area such as tax threshold under labour the income tax threshold be whereas it be now and the nic threshold be whereas it be now that be incredible progress together with the increase in the national living wage that mean people on the national living wage work full time be well off in real term than they would have be under labour that be remarkable achievement and show despite the myth the opposition peddle that we look after the low pay in society that will always be priority of this government my hon friend show yet again his incredible insight knowledge and commitment to his constituency by set out range of area in which his constituent have benefit over the last year include by highlight the importance of skill and apprenticeship could not agree with he more the minister be talk about apprenticeship opportunity and skill and in gillingham and rainham we have see over apprenticeship do he agree that the concept of the bill and the autumn statement be that if people work hard and do the right thing they keep more of the money they earn if they work hard and then retire they get dignity through the pension triple lock know my resident from darland who be in the gallery very much appreciate that if it be leave to the labour party there would be more borrowing spending and debt we see what happen before and we do not want to go back to that could not agree with my hon friend more he have give the opportunity to leap swathe of my speech because he have put those important point incredibly well my hon friend the member for west worcestershire harriett baldwin who be my constituency neighbour and the chair of the treasury committee highlight the importance of the autumn statement as turning point as articulate by the chancellor and the all important supply side measure in it that will help spur on business create employment and generate incremental economic activity as result of the spring budget and the autumn statement the obr have say that the economy be likely to be large when we be talk about an economy of over trillion that be huge incremental value to the uk economy unfortunately the spokesperson for the snp the hon member for inverness nairn badenoch and strathspey drew hendry fail to recognise that we have address the cost of live to the tune of billion in support he also forget that in the autumn statement we have an increase not only in the living wage but in benefit align with inflation in pension and in the local housing allowance rate to the percentile that mean million family will be well off gain an average of in support it be not true to say that there be no cost of live support measure in the autumn statement my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds recognise the considerable impact of those measure and the fact that they make meaningful difference to his constituent he raise issue about visa and student which be happy to discuss with he far as always my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel articulate core conservative value incredibly well the autumn statement recognise the importance of spend every penny of taxpayer money incredibly carefully and responsibly as well as ensure that we be there to support people through the tax system wherever we can she be right to be passionate about small business and entrepreneur small business saturday take place this weekend and be sure many of we will be out support small business not only on saturday but in the run up to christmas and beyond the opposition spokespeople peddle so many myth and untruth do not know where to start interruption we address many of they in previous debate so will not hear from they the way they react speak volume order the minister do not mean to say untruth do he take back that comment madam deputy speaker there be some presume fact that require challenge as we see early in the week at one point the shadow chancellor claim that the forecast be go to be billion small the shadow people know full well because it be state by the obr that economic growth by the end of the forecast period be high than it be in the spring forecast interruption be sorry if have to explain that to opposition members if number be big than the previous one then that mean growth and not decline we could possibly forgive that mistake if it be not make by the people try to become the chancellor of the exchequer it be extraordinary incompetence billion difference be not something we can easily ignore as my hon friend the chief secretary to the treasury point out early we be pleased that the opposition be support the national insurance cut but to combine that with their commitment on spending to the tune of billion and then claim that there will not be an increase in debt be farcical it be not true we know that will happen and we be see the same old labour as margaret thatcher say the problem with socialism be that you eventually run out of other people money that be true then and it be true now thank hon member for their contribution the bill deliver tax cut for million work people and be pleased that it will be get support from across the house join the two front

transitional and consequential provision wish to ask the minister some question about how the measure in clause will operate and what their overall impact will be may put it on record that as ever be grateful to the chartered institute of taxation for share its view with we on the clause in this bill clause make it clear that the bill measure will apply from january of course we want people to benefit from these change as quickly as possible give the pressure that family across britain be face right now we recognise though that with the government have leave this policy change until late november to announce there be not much time leave for payroll software to get ready for january would be grateful if the minister could confirm whether hmrc accept that some employer payroll software will not be ready in time for january if so how many employer do he anticipate be affect in such case employer would have to pass on the benefit of any change to employee in subsequent month would be grateful if the minister could confirm how many employee he expect will be affect by this delay and how long he expect they to have to wait to receive the delayed benefit furthermore we understand that many operator in the retail sector have moratorium on release new software update in the november to january period give what busy time that be for they would be grateful if the minister could confirm whether he be aware of that if so what meeting have he already have with retailer to discuss this point and if so what have the outcome of those meeting be call the snp spokesperson before come to my point may add my own condolence and those of my party to the family and friend of the former chancellor alistair darling clearly we be on very different side of the fence particularly on independence which be heavily contest nine year ago but he be tower intellect and very important figure in scottish public life as say we pass on our condolence to his family and friend my question be also on the operation of clause hmrc have state to the treasury committee that it be unable to cope with inquiry either in writing or by phone at the moment and that it be under severe pressure too would like to know how the clause will be give effect by january and what measure the government be take to ensure that that happen thank hon member for their question can assure they that hmrc be engage with industry and provide relevant guidance to support it to deliver the change on time we expect the majority of company to be able to do so particularly in this era when many of the change can be make on various system the government be confident that the majority of software developer will be able to make change to their payroll software in time for the january deadline question put and agree to clause accordingly order to stand part of the bill clause to order to stand part of the bill new clause review of effect of act the treasury must lay before the house of commons on the day on which this act be pass report which set out forecast of the change to the amount of national insurance contribution deduct from the annual income of full time worker earn the national living wage as result of the measure in this act over the period to and comparison with the change to the amount of national insurance contribution deduct from the annual income of full time worker earn the national living wage as result of the threshold for payment of national insurance remain freeze over the period to rather than rise in line with cpi the report in subsection should also set out the cost to business and ii government of implement the change in this act and compare they to the cost of implement point increase in national insurance contribution in april and implement the reversal of the increase in in november murray this new clause would require review of the effect of the bill if enact over the period to on someone earn the national living wage compare with the effect of national insurance threshold be freeze and comparison of the expect implementation cost of this bill with those of implement and repeal the health and social care levy act bring up and read the first time beg to move that the clause be read second time thank you dame rosie for the chance to address our new clause before do so may ask whether the minister would commit to write to with detailed response to the question that raise in our debate on the previous group we do not get they in his response just now so perhaps he will commit to write to with they as soon as possible our new clause would require the government to be honest about the impact of the change make by the bill when consider not just in isolation but in the wide context subsection would require the treasury to explain how the taxpayer or someone earn the national living wage would be impact by the combined effect of the change in the bill and the freezing of national insurance threshold at their level over the period to we ask for confirmation of that because our analysis show that full time worker on the national living wage will pay an estimate more in national insurance next year even with the cut in the bill as result of the threshold be freeze what be more the full impact of the government freezing of national insurance threshold will be that by again even with the cut in the bill full time worker on the national living wage will pay more year in tax can the minister confirm whether he accept our calculation if he do not assume that he will accept our new clause and publish the datum otherwise people will rightly be leave wonder what it be the government have to hide should the government choose to accept our new clause subsection would require they to come clean on some of the implementation cost to business and the government of what the chartered institute of taxation describe last week as the national insurance roller coaster in recent year if the government be not prepared to accept our new clause perhaps the minister will again commit to write to with detail of the implementation cost of the change make by the bill of the percentage point increase in national insurance contribution in april and of the reversal of that increase in november if he will not would be grateful if he could explain why not again to prevent people from wonder what it be the government have to hide hope that can give the hon member some assurance worker on the national living wage will save next year from the national insurance cut and thank to above inflation increase in the nic start threshold since full time worker on the national living wage will pay less in national insurance contribution next year than they otherwise would have that include the historical increase to the national insurance contribution start threshold in july by this government the large ever increase to personal tax start threshold the national minimum and living wage rate be set on advice from the independent low pay commission rates for and beyond will be set in future year the cost to hmrc of implement and reverse the health and social care levy be million the cost to implement this rate reduction be not yet know as the project to deliver the change be in delivery though hmrc do not expect it to be significant in answer to the hon gentleman previous question will be delighted to write to he beg to ask leave to withdraw the motion clause by leave withdraw schedule agree to the deputy speaker resume the chair bill report without amendment third read beg to move that the bill be now read the third time this be short and relatively straightforward bill but it be an important one as it will make meaningful difference to many household by put money in the pocket of million of people in every constituency in this country thank the treasury official clerks and everyone involve in get the bill to this point so speedily sense the enthusiasm in the house to pass it and for we to get back to our constituency and spread the good news will therefore end my comment there and commend the bill to the house as the opposition have make clear throughout today proceeding and on many other occasion we believe that taxis on work people be too high we have long say that we want taxis on work people to come down when they can be cut in an economically and fiscally responsible way while we confirm our support for the bill we repeat our call for the government to be honest with the british people the conservatives should be honest about the inescapable truth face family across the uk the tax burden in britain be still on course to reach its high level since the second world war as result of the conservatives decision on personal taxation in this parliament household will be leave face an average tax rise of look across all taxis we now know that by the end of the decade they will have rise by the equivalent of an astonishing for every household in the country as we have set out today clear pattern run through the conservatives time in office whatever they do they keep make work people bad off while we support the bill it be clear that the conservatives be incapable of deliver what britain truly need plan to get the economy grow and make work people well off that be what labour be offer in last week debate on the autumn statement when discuss the general election the economic secretary to the treasury say that we should bring it on on that point we heartedly agree as we have point out the bill do not go nearly far enough to help people face bitter cost of living crisis we urge the government after introduce this tiny measure to go back and consider those people who be suffer from high food cost see their mortgage and rent increase and most tellingly as temperature plummet face winter with high energy bill than last year this be hard time for family across the nation of the uk and in scotland they deserve well they should get that through the power of independence be return to scotland question put and agree to bill accordingly read the third time and pass hm prison bedford motion make and question propose that this house do now jenkinson be pleased to have secure this adjournment debate on condition at his majesty prison bedford thank the commons library the howard league the prison officers association the resident live by the prison the prison reform trust the independent monitoring board victim support and charlie taylor for their helpful information and datum which will inform the debate hmp bedford which be also young offender institution be inspect on november and the finding by his majesty chief inspector of prison be shocking shocking but not surprising in be grant an urgent question when bedford prison be last issue with an urgent notification the same problem inexperienced staff extreme violence overcrowding drug use mouldy and filthy condition self harm and rat and cockroach infestation be cite in the last report and the recent report it be as heartbreaking as it be deeply frustrating to see the degrading and totally unacceptable condition in which prison officer staff and resident be expect to live and work hmp bedford continue to have the high level of violent assault against staff in adult male prison in england and wales self harm and drug use be excessive be sorry to say that the amount of force use by staff be also find to be high inspector see example of inappropriate and excessive force alongside unprofessional behaviour many prisoner be lock in their cell for up to hour day and even the minority who be in education or training find that it be often cancel because there be no staff to cover those service have be tell that prisoner sleep with cover over their mouth to stop cockroach crawl in while they sleep the inhumane segregation unit once describe as rat infest dungeon be suppose to be shut down year ago but endless delay to the new unit mean that it be still in use will the minister explain what he believe prison be for lock people away in those condition do not keep society safe where be the rehabilitation in the system who can leave those condition well person or less likely to reoffend overcrowded squalid and unsafe prison will never help or allow people to turn their life around and move on from life of crime and hurt other accord to the report staff and leader be do their good and the poa have tell that staff at bedford feel safe now than they do when the last urgent notification be issue however while many problem such as problem with staff retention inadequate prison capacity too few and inexperienced staff and too much staff churn at leadership level be symptomatic of wide crisis question must be ask about why hmp bedford have not learn the lesson of the past or be able to implement sustainable change as his majesty chief inspector of prison say in his report many of the issue find at bedford reflect wide problem across the estate hmp bedford be the fifth prison in year to receive an urgent notification and the third reception prison that be damn indictment of not just the prison system but the whole british justice system prisoner on remand be wait far too long for trial because of the court backlog which mean that victim be wait too long and be not get justice in an ideal world bedford prison would have be shut down year ago it be victorian jail in the middle of an urban area and totally unfit for purpose resident live by the prison have have to tolerate unacceptable disturbance for year with intruder break and enter garden to traffic drug over the wall and regular drone flight deliver contraband the noise and disturbance from prisoner in solitary confinement cell mean that nearby residential window be keep close and some constituent have report hear sexual assault and violence leave unchecked however because the prison estate be full to the brim it look as though more modern appropriate prison to detain offender be not an option even though it should be despite all that the government have not improve the condition because they can not or will not tackle the root cause of the persistent issue at hmp bedford currently male prisoner be on roll although the in use certify normal accommodation number be more than or man be await trial some report say that that figure be high so would be grateful if the minister clarify the number of man currently wait to be put before judge or magistrate and how long the average wait be for trial date it be totally unacceptable that prisoner languish on remand for month and even year in an overcrowded prison all because this government have decimate the criminal justice system the crown court backlog have hit new record high of more than case and the magistrates court backlog be also rise do the minister agree that his government target of reduce the backlog to by march be very unlikely to be meet serious question be be ask about whether bedford can remain as remand prison will the minister consider complete re role of the prison our prison be so overcrowded that judge be be ask to delay sentence convict criminal in hmp bedford man have be convict but be await sentencing how be that deliver justice for victim or perpetrator we will no doubt hear about more plan promise and initiative to turn the place around but have hear they all before we have have the prison project and the prison performance support programme just two year ago where bedford prison be supposedly go to benefit from new intensive support programme to help challenge jail to improve safety and rehabilitation all have fail will the minister explain why after year and year of action plan and intervention the problem at the prison persist what will his government do differently this time to resolve the distinctive and systemic failure at hmp bedford and across the wide prison estate what will he do to support the governor to manage an overcrowded prison to implement basic level of cleanliness and to tackle toxic culture where prisoner be lock up for too long in squalor and do not seem to bother try to keep their surrounding clean in when hmp liverpool be describe as have the bad living condition ever see by inspector the prison be successfully turn around through significant population reduction huge investment and resource be channel towards the prison bedford need that level of sustainable investment now in the context of the current capacity crisis however will the minister confirm whether such decanting measure be even possible there be absolutely no excuse for any prison not to meet basic standard of decency the quality of leadership be vital governor ali barker have not yet be there year and hope she get all the resource she require to achieve the high standard need at hmp bedford meanwhile nearly half of the prison officer work at the prison have less than two year experience be prison officer be one of the most challenging of the uniformed profession what plan do the government have to support prison officer and tackle the huge lack of experience in the profession leadership and experience be key to improve the outcome at hmp bedford but leadership in government also matter since the last urgent notification five year ago there have be change in prisons minister amid such chaos and churn there can not be serious plan for reform the penal system and deliver justice for victim the decision to privatise the estate maintenance contract have have particularly detrimental impact on old establishment such as bedford where the maintenance need be substantial those contract be poorly fund and understaffed and basic routine repair and maintenance work have suffer what plan have the minister to improve that and at the very least demand well service from those contract full use of the recently announce measure include the emergency release scheme and provision to delay the sentencing of individual on bail should be make in the government response to the urgent notification presumption to suspend short sentence would also relieve pressure on reception prison once the relevant legislation have be pass and enact those measure be not about be tough on crime but about implement justice system that work for victim because today the justice system be fail victim as bedford prison serve number of court include in bedford luton and london there be lot of intake churn because beford host prison my constituent be too often the victim of reoffende criminal in the area and many be understandably lose faith in the justice system ability to deliver justice to victim of crime include violent crime the thorny question of what sentencing be for be tackle by the criminal justice act which codify for the first time the principle and purpose of sentencing the punishment of offender the reduction of crime include reduction by deterrence the reform and rehabilitation of offender and the protection of the public apart from punish prisoner remember that many bedford inmate have not yet be convict of crime no other remedy in that list be be meet report by victim support cite study conduct for the probation service that reveal that of victim of crime say that the most important thing to they be that the offender do not commit the crime again the same study find that would prefer an offender to receive an effective sentence rather than harsh one the first recommendation of the report be effective rehabilitation have to be at the heart of the prison system the second recommendation say though victim accept that any reform have to be cost effective if individual sentencing decision be see to be motivate by concern for cost more than justice they will not inspire the support of victim or the general public victim support back the reduction in short term prison sentence but want evidence base alternative to stop reoffende put in place before they be abolish it want robustly enforce community sentencing to be apply as meaningful and effective alternative to custodial sentence it say that if alternative such as drug or alcohol treatment programme or treatment for mental health problem be order they need to be adequately fund and prove to prevent reoffende the condition at hmp bedford and indeed across the prison estate be not conducive to the rehabilitation of prisoner far from it in fact the recent urgent notification find that the preparation for release be not sufficiently good what will the minister propose in his response to his majesty chief inspector of prison that will finally turn bedford prison around so that be not stand here again next year ask the same question will he find solution that finally put victim at the heart of the criminal justice system big part of which be to ensure that prison rehabilitate offender rather than create reoffender and more victim of crime if may briefly crave your indulgence mr deputy speaker wish to put on the record my tribute to the former chancellor of the exchequer alistair darling on the news of his sad passing he be man of intellect integrity and ability and have deep commitment to public service he will be miss by all in this house we send our condolence and sympathy to his family be grateful to the hon member for bedford mohammad yasin for secure this important debate as he know be deeply concerned by the recent finding of hm inspectorate of prison at hmp bedford particularly in regard to safety and living condition and have be clear that the situation need to improve quickly this be as he set out clearly the second time that an urgent notification have be invoke at hmp bedford agree that the circumstance lead to it be not acceptable before turn to the specific that he raise about the situation at bedford hope that he will allow moment to remind the house of the context his speech rightly range more widely than bedford alone and of the step that we be take to improve prison and justice across the country as my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor set out in his statement of october on prison capacity the house will be aware that we be build six new prison as we create an additional place to deliver the big prison expansion in over century we have already deliver just shy of of these additional place and the brand new category resettlement prison hmp fosse way open its door in may this year and will house up to prisoner at the same time we be create thousand of place through the expansion of prison with additional house block and major refurbishment at exist prison and by roll out rapid deployment cell across the estate the first or so have already be deliver at six site the hon gentleman raise specific point about bedford there be no plan to re roll bedford prison at this point appreciate that he may be disappoint by that but it be important that be open with he as will seek to be throughout my speech would gently say in respect of prison capacity that we be get on with deliver that increase in modern effective rehabilitative prison place through those six new prison by regrettable contrast the plan under jack straw in the last labour government be to build place in three titan prison and to the good of my recollection they never get build at all in respect of staffing join the hon gentleman in rightly pay tribute to all those who work in our prison prison officer and all the staff in range of capacity for their work since march we have also increase the number of prison officer in public sector prison by and we make commitment in to hire up to prison officer across public and private prison by the as he allude to the increase in number mean that as we grow the workforce which be positive thing we be also bring new joiner and staff to the prison service who will by logic have few year of service under their belt it be important that we continue do what we be do to retain experienced officer alongside they as part of their mentoring and the development of their skill we have improve start salary for officer which have rise from to since the staffing picture be improve in prison across the country in the month from last september the late figure have the number of officer have increase by full time equivalent the hon gentleman be absolutely right to highlight that we be also improve the retention of staff the resignation rate among frontline prison officer be down by almost three percentage point compare with last year there be more to do but that be progress and it be important that we continue on that trajectory the hon gentleman also rightly highlight prison safety which will address in broad context before turn to his local prison we continue to take the necessary action to make our prison safe both for frontline staff and for prisoner the overall rate of assault be low than prior to the pandemic of course every assault be one too many and we continue to work to improve the security of our prison and reduce violence and the number of assault within they but highlight that degree of positive progress to he the measure that we be put in place to reduce violence in our prison estate include our million security investment to clamp down on the weapon drug and mobile phone that fuel violence and crime behind bar and the continue rollout of pava synthetic pepper spray in the adult male estate to protect staff and prisoner from incident of serious violence alongside de escalation training for officer which be also play an important part before turn specifically to bedford let address some of the broad brush point that the hon gentleman make he be right to highlight the five key purpose of sentencing highlight to he although be do so from memory so will write to he to correct myself if be incorrect that reoffende be down by so again that be work but there be always more to do he be right about the importance of substance misuse treatment programme in get people off substance that may drive their criminal behaviour their importance extend beyond prison to when people be on release my recollection be that there be reduction in reoffende if those programme be continue in the community the treatment be sustain and the nhs local authority and prison authority work together to make sure that it be in place we be see positive outcome there the hon gentleman quite rightly talk about the approach to sentencing at headline level and the challenge of short sentence they be often so short that we can not get to grip with the underlying challenge that an individual face but long enough to break fragile tie and affect relationship job and accommodation be very pleased that on this issue he appear to be follow the approach set out by the lord chancellor who suggest tough sentence for those who commit the most heinous crime and tough community sentence as an alternative to short custodial sentence though obviously discretion will rest with the sentencer also while there should be clear focus in the custodial estate on people pay their debt to society they should also be able to make positive life choice about what they intend to do when they come out of prison so that they can make positive contribution and live life on the straight and narrow turn to the issue that the hon gentleman raise about his local prison hmp bedford as he set out his majesty chief inspector of prison have highlight significant concern about the condition of cell and overcrowding at bedford reassure he that be treat that with the utmost seriousness he ask number of question about measure that we will put in place in response to the urgent notification in accordance with our usual protocol on respond to the inspectorate the lord chancellor will publish his response to the urgent notification and the action plan no later than december there be day in which to do that that will be the detailed response be grateful to the hon gentleman for the time he spar early this week for conversation in which he set out and amplify his key concern hope that can engage with he as we finalise the action plan also highlight my gratitude to the governor for give her time when we speak last week the finding be as the hon gentleman say deeply concern notwithstanding the fact that there will be formal response within day can update he and indeed you mr deputy speaker and the house on number of immediate action that we have take to drive improvement these include provide additional resource support to the prison equivalent to additional prison officer to improve the prison safety and security and to improve the regime think the hon gentleman ask for additional support

to the lord chancellor that bedford have consistently fail to provide good outcome for prisoner since the inspection in the series of concern inspection at bedford be of course deeply troubling and it may be useful if briefly set out the improvement that we have make in response to previous inspection report of course they clearly have not resolve all the underlie issue hence the hon gentleman secure this debate but it be important that we highlight what have be do in response to his majesty chief inspector of prison first urgent notification about hmp bedford in comprehensive safety strategy be implement to support violence reduction and dedicated young adult unit be introduce to provide targeted support for prisoner and upskille for staff that result in low level of violence for

performance support programme which offer tailor support for maximum period of month to prison that face numerous complex challenge the support for bedford include over million of additional funding focus on improve security and living condition follow the taking of those step the inspectorate undertake an independent review of progress in and find that although there have be some progress since progress on many of the inspectorate recommendation be insufficient inspector find that despite the pandemic improvement in living condition have be make include extensive good quality refurbishment of the communal shower room however previous concern about violence and safety persist in early the inspectorate visit bedford to undertake full inspection it note improvement at the prison include strong leadership and an improved prison culture further improvement have also be make such as investment in new window and floor and the installation of enhance gate security alongside this the capacity of the prison have be reduce by space to allow residential accommodation to be refurbish the inspection recognise that challenge remain but it acknowledge that the prison be head in positive direction and the oversight that follow the urgent notification of be remove from bedford in october last year even after the removal of urgent notification oversight bedford continue to receive support for example through an ongoing compliance project in which management checking system be build to ensure that rule and regulation be fully follow by both staff and prisoner it be therefore deeply disappointing that the late inspection conclude that standard have slip back at the prison as the hon gentleman say and second un be issue it be also worry that the content of that urgent notification which consider very carefully be to my mind similar to those of the notification as say be very grateful to the hon gentleman for discuss these matter with early this week and hope that

the local council and the police so that it can tackle such behaviour as part of that the prison check directly on weekly basis on any complaint from resident and follow up on they if they have not be raise with bedfordshire police if it be helpful to he he may wish to raise specific issue with outwith this chamber in confidence the hon gentleman touch on his concern about the inexperience of some staff at bedford notwithstanding the benefit of increase the number of staff in prison officer role we recognise the need to continue train rigorously there be now learning and capability manager in

should they need it have previously deploy standard coach team at the prison intend to redeploy they in the new year to again help drive progress the hmip finding be of course deeply concern and we be committed to improve the condition at bedford and at the other prison where un have be trigger over the past year my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor will be monitor the situation at bedford very closely in the come week and month to ensure there be sustained improvement although have have this specific brief for only about two and half to three week the hon member for bedford will have have experience of deal with in other ministerial role and hope he will recognise that just as do in those role will seek to work collaboratively with he where can we share the desire
