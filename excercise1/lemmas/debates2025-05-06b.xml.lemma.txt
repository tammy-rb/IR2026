be vital part of our shift from analogue to digital the president of the royal college of ophthalmologists have state that the widespread outsourcing of nhs cataract surgery to private for profit provider risk the integrity of hospital eye surgery department mean that there will be few service to treat patient with preventable blindness how can we reassure the public that such service will be maintain although the independent sector clearly have an important role to play in tackle waiting list and backlog we will not tolerate any overpriced or sub par care and we will not tolerate any distortion of patient choice the recently publish partnership agreement between nhs england and the independent healthcare provider network commit to end incentive that can lead to that and to support equal access and genuine choice for all patient we be work together to deliver on that nhs sussex icb be one of only five in england not to commission minor eye condition service know as mecs in

contribute to the government health and growth mission funding and delivery of gp surgery for wixams in my constituency continue to fall between the crack of developer local council and the local icb do the minister agree that to break those deadlock and build the infrastructure that our community require new mayor should have the power to direct icb make locally elect politician responsible

time drive down waiting time be one of this government top priority and my colleague at nhs england continue to keep in regular contact with icb on improve waiting time and deliver the ambition set out in our elective reform plan since july we have cut waiting list by more than across england and by for university hospitals of north midlands and have deliver million more appointment thank the minister for her answer and recognise the herculean effort the department be make to reduce waiting time particularly in stoke on trent but one cancer patient who be have treatment at the royal stoke hospital in my constituency have share her story with from the initial operation it take six week for she to be tell that she may have cancerous cell in her lymph node there be delay in get the ct scan and after the scan she be tell that it would be week before she could meet an oncologist to discuss the result will the minister say bit more about how the department while reduce wait time to access service will make sure that treatment be give in timely fashion once someone have treatment plan be sorry for the experience that my hon friend constituent have have and he highlight really important aspect of the patient journey through the system want he and the house to be assure that we be look at the entire patient journey both into hospital and between hospital we be determined to improve patient experience and quality of care and to get back the patient satisfaction that be squander by the last government hospital backlogs what step he be take to tackle hospital backlog reduce hospital backlog be key priority in this government plan for change as the week standard for elective care have not be meet for almost decade our elective reform plan set out how we will return to that standard by the end of this parliament through combination of investment and reform since july the waiting list have reduce by over and we have deliver an extra million appointment exceed our manifesto pledge and do it early than plan be grateful to the secretary of state for his answer and for the progress make but there be still more to do my constituent in newcastle under lyme have recently be recover from brain surgery at the royal stoke university hospital however she have face multiple setback due to failure in the duty of care include scald injury and severely mishandle admission process she be now receive the correct care but she have to wait many month to be admit to the correct ward and have be give limited time for rehabilitative treatment do the secretary of state agree that to tackle backlog our hospital must have the resource they need to provide the right care the first time round so that patient be give the time and support to fully and effectively recover be grateful to my hon friend for his question and horrify to hear about his constituent experience this government will never brush problem under the carpet or pretend that thing be well than they be and know that for all the progress we have make in the past month there be still so much more to do when we publish our year plan for health we must ensure that quality and safety be at the heart of every patient interaction my hon friend be right about the need for investment that be why we be invest billion in the nhs and social care and why it be so disappointing that the opposition party vote against it on recent visit to the breast unit of the royal united hospital in bath specialist tell about red flag system that could help to speed up care if someone have red flag symptom such as lump or bleed nipple the triage team can book they straight into the breast clinic rather than wait to see gp do the secretary of state support such an approach thank the hon member for her extremely constructive contribution that be exactly why at the heart of our plan for reform and modernisation we be place such an emphasis on digital and technological transformation we have such rich datum about the experience of our patient but we be not use it effectively enough if we use the information more effectively and efficiently we can spot and identify risk much more proactively and ensure that people get timely access to urgent care and treatment when they need it be grateful to the secretary of state for the work that he and his team have do to reduce nhs waiting time month on month for the last six month however the backlog that grow under the last conservative government be still impact on my constituent have listen to countless constituent who have tell about the upsetting impact of long waiting time for an adhd diagnosis for child that be have detrimental knock on impact on access to support include child and adolescent mental health service and share care agreement and there be lack of support for adopt child welcome the news that waiting list have go down but will the secretary of state set out how his work will be target at bring down waiting list for adhd diagnose in my constituency to ensure consistency in diagnosis rate across trust be so grateful to my hon friend for her question and pay tribute to my right hon friend the secretary of state

health service be well join up to meet the need of young people be work with my hon friend the member for whitehaven and workington josh macalister and draw on his experience to look at how we can improve the health and care of care experience young people and young adult hope we will have lot of progress to report on those issue one way to reduce the backlog be to reduce or put an end to health tourism in this country whereby people come to this country get their treatment and then nip back to where they come from do the secretary of state think it be good idea that people enter this country should provide evidence of health insurance or be refuse entry when any of we travel abroad we expect to take out travel insurance and pay for our healthcare need overseas and that be the standard that we expect for visitor to our country we have lot more to do to improve on that front deplore the comment make by the hon gentleman party leader who say that he do not support taxpayer fund nhs for the british people he might want that debate and the leader of the so call opposition say that she want that debate but as far as labour be concern we be clear about where we stand under labour the nhs will always be national health service publicly fund and free at the point of use nhs reliance on private healthcare providers what step he be take to reduce the reliance of the nhs on private healthcare provider this government be take hard headed approach to cut waiting time we be invest an extra billion in our nhs and where the independent sector have spare capacity we will pay to get nhs patient treat fast and free at the point of use so far our approach to investment and reform have cut waiting list by more than perhaps the hon member will tell we how it be go in scotland the secretary of state claim this morning on bbc radio today programme most excellent programme that labour be the only party that can be trust with the national health service can he confirm that no aspect of the nhs whatsoever whether it be ownership of the estate the provision of specialist service or any other form of privatisation will be include in the much promise trade deal between the uk and the united states no more excuse secretary of state just give direct answer to direct question have say it before and will say it again the nhs will be privatised over my dead body this party

freedom and flexibility to independent care board system and provider to determine how they can well spend nhs resource on service to improve patient care safety and outcome everyone will know that maternity safety be understandably priority for this government we expect the nhs to deliver on maternity safety standard and will hold it to account on that resident in theale and across my

but do not turn up what action will the secretary of state take to ensure that the system penalise people who miss appointment so that patient can get the treatment they need when they need it we be absolutely convinced that well use of digital tool will enable we to reduce the number of miss appointment significantly and factor in the likelihood of no show so that we can reduce waste and eliminate inefficiency understand the case for penalty that the hon gentleman be make but that be not route we want to go down until we have make those improvement and judge how effective they have be far too many promise make by the last government promise that care would be move out of hospital and into the community turn out to be hollow from speak to resident in dartford know that hospital and community service have struggle to keep pace with new housing development in the constituency be pleased to say that later this year in dartford we will be see an expansion of our state of the art

know we now have commitment to provide more urgent dental appointment those who do not have an nhs dentist can call and will be prioritise we be very clear that every integrate care board have target within those appointment and if they be not hit that target we will want to know why as someone with adhd it be disappointing to hear from many of my constituent about difficulty in access diagnosis

the first duty of government and it be testament to our world lead law enforcement and intelligence service that through their tireless commitment so many plot against the uk have be thwart pay tribute to they again today for the work that they have do not just this weekend but in recent week and month on these important operation the two operation that take place across multiple location this weekend be significant and complex they be some of the large counter state threat and counter terrorism action that we have see in recent time and be sure the whole house will want to join in thank the police the security service and other partner agency across the country who show their professionalism and expertise in carry out these operation to keep our country safe right hon and hon member will understand that these be complex investigation the police and the security service need time and space to be able to pursue their investigation and our first priority must be to protect the integrity of that work so that we do not cut across those investigation and operation at crucial time however these be serious matter and the house will rightly want to remain informed will therefore outline as much detail as be able and hope that right hon and hon member will understand that there be strict limit to what can say at this stage give that investigation be now ongoing will first outline the fact around the event on saturday may throughout the day counter terrorism police undertake series of arrest relate to two separate investigation in total eight man be arrest by the metropolitan police counter terrorism command five man be arrest on suspicion of preparation of terrorist act contrary to section of the terrorism act as part of proactive investigation in the area of

tackle national security threat welcome the work of the previous government to establish ctoc in and this government have continue to support it and invest in it since take office the significant point about both counter terrorism and counter state threat power be that they allow the police to intervene early to prevent and disrupt threat not just respond after event have take place this be crucial for public safety but it also make the investigation more complex and that be why the police need the time and space to pursue they now so we will not be provide run commentary on the work that they be do however what now follow be an incredibly complex set of investigation involve hundred more officer carry out forensic search collect vital evidence across different site across the country and secure witness statement back up by the continue effort of our security and intelligence agency this be careful painstaking work at this stage in the operation and investigation it would not be appropriate for to speculate on or comment far on the detail of these two case and the motivation behind any of the threat that be pose however the house will be aware that these operation come against backdrop of complex interconnect threat to the uk where state threat and counter terrorism as well as serious and organised crime be intertwine together for year the great focus of our national security work be on terrorism primarily from islamist terrorism with additional threat from northern ireland relate terrorism and other area and those threat have not go away fifteen

that all member will vote in favour when those regulation be debate shortly let be clear anyone in the uk who work for the iranian state must declare it or they will be commit serious criminal offence we will also go after the criminal network and enabler that iran use to carry out its work last month the government sanction the foxtrot network network involve in violence against jewish and israeli target in europe on behalf of the iranian regime training and guidance on state threat activity be now be offer by counter terrorism police to all territorial police force across the uk the independent reviewer of terrorism and state threat legislation jonathan hall kc be ask by the home secretary to review the part of our counter terrorism framework that could be apply to modern day

legislation to state threat jonathan hall have now complete his review and will publish it shortly and the government will not hesitate to take action in response to mr hall advice as we continue to support the police and the security service in their investigation can also tell the house that the home secretary have instigate series of security assessment that be be do or refresh in the light of

position when we be able to do so follow both these operation and investigation and the wide security assessment that be under way the government will not hesitate to act robustly to respond to these plot at the appropriate time but first we must allow the investigation to continue our police security and intelligence agency be the good in the world and stand ready at all time to take action to keep our country safe be sure they will have the support of the whole house as they continue this vital work commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for provide advance sight of his statement on this critical issue people will have read the deeply concern report suggest that an attack may have be just hour away and this will understandably be worry to people

lifetime these act of terror along with other cowardly act cause untold hurt to victim and their family as we discuss the arrest over the past weekend we must remember the importance of keep the

this place while appreciate that the government do not want to provide running commentary like many other member would be grateful if the government could be as open as possible give the seriousness of the arrest as the minister have outline there be two separate arrest of iranian national in relation to terror offence which have raise serious question about how their network be form and what their intention be can the minister provide any further information about the suspect for example while we know they be iranian national what be their immigration status be the state aware that these individual be in the uk and be there any prior indication of the risk they might pose on the broad issue of iran while understand that the minister may not be able to comment on proscription directly the home secretary do address this while in opposition in july she tell the royal united services institute that instead of try and fail to use counter terror legislation to proscribe organisation like wagner or irgc we will introduce bespoke proscribing mechanism to address state sponsor threat she also say at the dispatch box in april that labour want appropriately target proscription style restriction on the operation of state link organisation such as the report april vol however it be only in march of this year that the minister for security announce the review by jonathan hall do he share my concern that these mixed signal and the delay suggest lack of prioritisation by the government ultimately we must all work together to ensure that the uk adopt the strong possible stance on national security as cross party co operation be essential urge the government to take every possible step to prevent these cowardly act of terror thank the shadow minister for the sensible reasonable and constructive tone of his response he be absolutely right to draw the house attention to the tragic death of lee rigby the tragic bombing in manchester and of course the anniversary of the bombing

prosperity assure my hon friend that we be progress they at pace be alarmed to hear that one of the incident take place in my constituency of cheadle it be chilling to think that regime with such shocking record of international aggression could have connection into our neighbourhood it just so happen that meet the jewish community in cheadle this weekend to talk through their issue and concern at the meeting hear how fearful they be of the threat of violence and terrorism from the iranian regime so will the minister commit to provide timeline for produce the report on the irgc and

by terrorism or by state base threat the home secretary and and other ministers be in regular contact with the community security trust and range of other organisation from the jewish community and we work tirelessly to ensure that they not only be safe but feel safe in the fullness of time it will undoubtedly be reveal what the target of these terrorist plot be go to be if it turn out that one of they be again the broadcaster iran international which have to relocate to washington temporarily in will the minister undertake to speak with his foreign office colleague about the importance of

of harlow to the police and security service for the work they do keep we all safe in his statement the minister make reference to work with ally do he agree that the conversation he have with our ally both in europe and america be key to tackle this problem proactively and ensure that life be save first thank my hon friend for his point about our police force who do very difficult job they do it incredibly well and it be deeply impressive to see their work over the course of the weekend he also make an important point about international co operation the home secretary and and other ministers across government completely understand the importance of invest in these relationship with our international ally these be matter that we be not go to solve unilaterally on our own we need to co operate and collaborate with range of international partner in europe in north america and far afield and assure he that that will be the approach of this government too pay tribute to the brilliance of our security force the minister have pay tribute to the quality of advice from jonathan hall kc the independent reviewer of terrorism and say that he will indeed listen to that advice well that same jonathan hall kc last autumn advise that in serious incident involve terror such as these it would be well to put out more information soon in order to prevent misinformation in order to prevent misinformation surely the minister should tell we and the british people who want to know how long these iranian national have be in this country and what their immigration status be that be precisely why make the point to the shadow minister the hon member for stockton west matt vickers about the importance of transparency it be precisely why the government have proactively bring forward statement to the house to give member the opportunity to ask question and why give commitment early that the home secretary will update the house when we be operationally able to do so know the hon member understand the importance of not cut across live police terrorism operation hope he will acknowledge that we take these matter incredibly seriously and that we bring forward range of

threat can the minister assure and my constituent that our intelligence and legal framework be keep pace with the grow sophistication of hostile activity on british soil can assure my hon friend that our intelligence and legal framework have the necessary resource to ensure that we be well prepared to face the nature of the threat that we undoubtably face also say to he that the home secretary the prime minister and ministers across government will not hesitate to act should there be requirement to bring forward further measure that be precisely why the home secretary ask mr hall to look at the legislative framework and why we be carefully consider his recommendation but absolutely give he the assurance that should there be need to bring forward further power we will not hesitate to do so it be clear that the issue we see from iran and its proxy be share across many european country the minister raise the recent government sanction on the foxtrot network however the eu have just reject the pm bid to access the bloc crime and migration database do the minister see that as an issue that would stop we thwart future threat from iran and its proxy let respond to the hon member in this way as have say previously while there be certain measure we could put in place in this country and of course we will it be imperative that we co operate closely with our ally the nature of the relationship that we have with our ally in europe be fundamentally important in this regard can give he an assurance that foreign office ministers the foreign secretary and the minister will be look closely at what have happen over previous day talk to our ally and take every opportunity to ensure we organise collectively to ensure that those state who think they can behave in an aggressive way towards this and other country understand that there will be very severe consequence for their action do the minister agree that part of the problem with the joint comprehensive plan of action that the us withdraw from in be that it be not comprehensive enough in that it completely ignore the action of iran through proxy group and terror cell when he and his colleague be discuss the way forward with the us administration particularly in relation to the witkoff talk will he ensure that terrorism be cover as part of any agreement that be patch that be an important point that the minister and will consider far but can give the right hon member an assurance about our understanding and about the priority that we attach to the international dynamic in all this he will understand as former minister and as someone who have be around long time that international relation require we to work as collaboratively as we can with our partner we be invest heavily in ensure that our special relationship continue to deliver for our country and for other five eyes partner his point be well make we have hear they and will consider they far assure he that we take these matter very seriously and will work across government to address the issue that he raise join the minister in pay tribute to our security service and their endeavour to keep we all safe do he agree that the issue of how these suspect get into the united kingdom in the first place be crucial have he address with the irish republic government the issue of people who come here not directly but under the radar via dublin and who then go into northern ireland and to mainland gb the prime minister have say that border security be national security so the hon member make an important point that be precisely why confirm early that as consequence of recent event the home secretary be look very carefully along with other home office ministers at number of area at the early available opportunity she will come back to the house to provide an update five week ago visit iran international at its london location it tell that its journalist face daily threat from iran as do those who work for the bbc persian service give that it be just three day after world press freedom day will the minister reiterate this government determination to defend medium freedom at home as well as abroad and will he consider accept an invitation to visit iran international to reinforce that message be grateful to the right hon gentleman who be long stand champion of journalism and journalist he make some very important point know that the minister have recently meet bbc persian journalist and between we we will look carefully at the invitation that the right hon gentleman have extend let be crystal clear that the threat we have see in recent time to iran international be completely unacceptable this government like the previous government will do everything to ensure that free speech in this country be not materially affect by those outwith the country who wish to silence other we take these matter incredibly seriously in response to an early question say that the government will have more to say about transnational repression in due course and that very much include such matter as the right hon gentleman raise be go to try again because although appreciate that the security minister have to be very careful about specific aspect of this case the house and the country need to know whether the iranian national come into the uk illegally or on legal migration route the hon lady be very experienced member so hope she can understand why it would be wrong of as the security minister to cut across live police terrorism investigation minister should not get in front or in the way of ongoing proceeding hope she will acknowledge the point make about the complexity of the ongoing investigation there be still property around the country be search by police officer have come here to give statement and update the house with precisely the information that it be appropriate to provide have also give very clear commitment that at the early available opportunity when it be operationally appropriate to do so the home secretary will come to this place and give more detail the minister say in his statement that these be some of the large counter state threat and counter terrorism action that we have see in recent time if that be the case wonder why the iranian ambassador have not be summon to the foreign office the minister mention liaise with the foreign secretary the issue of immigration status be not police or counter terrorism operational matter it be visa issue be any of these iranian national dual national be they here on work or student visa and be those visa issue at post or somewhere else around the world through another embassy or consulate we have have incident in this country in which there have be vacuum of information and when the government have not be prepare to fill that vacuum with truth and fact other who want to stir up trouble in our nation have fill it instead be always grateful to the right hon gentleman for the experience that he bring on these important matter he be right to say that this be significant operation that require considerable co ordination across the weekend and as have explain it be ongoing it be very important that do not in any way prejudice the inquiry but understand why he have make his point in the way that he have there have be very close contact between the home secretary and the foreign secretary on these matter and the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs mr falconer who be sit on the front bench will meet the iranian ambassador to discuss these matter the prime minister say that border security be national security but how can there be national security if there be no border check on illegal immigrant at the international frontier between the united kingdom and the republic of ireland how do we get security if we refuse to carry out those fundamental check that be precisely why reference the prime minister comment about the importance of border security and border security be national security and why say that the home secretary and the immigration minister be look carefully at what happen over the weekend as well as at other incident we will not hesitate to act where there be requirement to do so and as have say the home secretary will update the house far on these matter thank the minister for come to the house with his statement today do not want to probe the out of bound box that he have rightly place around live investigation so have choose the word of this question carefully do he know the immigration status of the iranian national who be arrest pay tribute to the hon member for his service in our armed force before come to this house hope that in part because of that background he will understand that the one thing be not go to do be make thing more difficult for those who serve in and out of uniform and do very difficult job the home secretary and know what we need to know but we will not get into give run commentary have make very clear commitment that the home secretary will come back at the early available opportunity and respond to the question that hon member wish to put to she we be not go to cut across live police operation conservative members and those from around the house would rightly never forgive we for do so but we be commit to provide as much information as we can at point when that do not compromise ongoing operation thank the minister very much for his wise strong confident word word that think all member of the house wish to hear in relation to this investigation in all my time in this chamber which be come up to year have be supporter of the iranian diaspora in the united kingdom those people who flee iran because of threat to their life some get out by the skin of their tooth they have genuine fear and concern about what be happen and those concern have be express by member of the iranian diaspora who have be under attack in france paris be one example and in sweden during the last election the iranian diaspora kindly offer support to for my election campaign which take advantage of as other do member of that diaspora in northern ireland feel threatened just like those on the mainland offer the support and protection that they need will involve partnership with the garda síochána in the republic of ireland as the threat could come from beyond northern ireland it could potentially come from the republic of ireland will the minister give commitment on that to my constituent and those who be commit to change of regime in iran but can not return because the regime there be so decadent violent and evil be grateful to the hon gentleman as always he have long track record of stand up for those who have be persecute because of their ethnicity or religion and he raise very important point about the iranian diaspora in this country that be precisely why this government have progress an important piece of work on transnational repression we will work together closely through the defend democracy taskforce to ensure that all the necessary protection be in place for those individual or community who feel threatened my advice to anybody who feel threaten be to report that to the police recently write to all chief constable to ensure that the training available for frontline officer be take up by police force right around the country it be very important that officer on the beat have the necessary understanding of the nature of the threat that many diaspora community may face be grateful to the hon gentleman for championing not only his constituency but the iranian diaspora and give he the same commitment that have give to other right hon and hon member this government will work tirelessly to ensure that the diaspora be protect trade negotiations before call the minister to make his statement can say how disappointing it be to see detail of the india trade deal release to the medium few hour ago before the minister come to this house wish to make statement on the progress that this government have make towards uk india trade deal be delighted to inform the house that we have now conclude negotiation on comprehensive modern agreement with the fast grow economy in the hon member will no doubt be aware that india be expect to be the third large economy in the world by by the end of this decade it will be home to an estimate million middle class consumer and with trade between the united kingdom and india already stand at north of billion we know that this powerhouse economy be and will remain hugely important market for british business while past government have fail to negotiate deal with india this government have today succeed we have broker the most generous trade deal ever agree by india in its history from day one of this deal come into force it will make trade between our country cheap easy and quick uk exporter will benefit from much low tariff across whole host of sector include those

scottish whisky brand and our car plant in the west midland in all we will have secure over million in tariff reduction in the first year alone double to around million after just year crucially the deal we have negotiate will provide bespoke support for small and medium sized enterprise to enter the indian market alongside firm commitment from india to address the trade barrier that those business face since take office we have commit to hardwire the view and interest of small business into everything we do and the deal we have negotiate be evidence of that for the very first time british business will have guarantee access to india vast procurement market cover good service and construction they will be able to bid for approximately tender worth at least billion year the deal that we have just get over the line be further proof that this government be use the power of international trade and investment to raise living standard here at home indeed expert predict that it will boost our bilateral trade by some billion it be also project to increase uk wage by billion each year while add nearly billion to our gdp over the long run we have do all that while defend stoutly the uk national interest we have broker deal that protect our nhs and uphold our high food standard it ensure that our point base immigration system remain unaffected the deal demonstrate our commitment to both worker and business stay true to our labour value while contribute to our primary mission of economic growth recognise that this house will need time to scrutinise the deal before the ratification process my department will follow the process set out in the constitutional reform and governance act in share the finalise treaty text with hon member the house will of course have the opportunity to scrutinise any legislation associate with its implementation this deal send powerful message about the uk and india share commitment to free fair and open trade the uk india relationship have deep endure root exemplify by the live bridge of million people of indian heritage live in the united kingdom while do not personally lament that the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak be no long the uk prime minister it would be wholly wrong of not to acknowledge his significant achievement as the first british indian prime minister which be testament not just to his own ability but to the close bond that unite our two nation the government be proud to back open market and free trade we recognise that britain have always be an open outward look trading nation and we believe that open market and free trade be fundamental building block with which the uk can secure its opportunity and prosperity at home and abroad through our upcoming trade strategy we will set out our ambition to engage with more industrial giant like india to ramp up trade and investment over the come month and year today though as close trading partner and as friend be proud that we have secure this deal with india it be deal that afford uk business certainty and stability during time of global uncertainty and instability and deal that will give british business access to one of our big market abroad while raise wage and drive growth here at home that be what this deal deliver and commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for advance sight of his statement this deal mark landmark moment for the uk and its global trading relationship because it be the large trade deal secure by this country be therefore shocked that the minister do not acknowledge that progression of the deal be possible only thank to our brexit freedom after all the european union do not have free trade agreement with india something the minister must bear in mind as he follow the order of the prime minister on the eu reset we have not see the minutia of the detail in the agreement that the government be announce today so we will reserve our full judgment on the deal until we have have the opportunity to scrutinise it at length however will take this opportunity to highlight some question first what concession do the government make that their predecessor be not willing to make to get the deal over the line secondly be shock that very significant piece of information be leave out of the minister statement today one that we only find out from the indian government statement why do indian prime minister narendra modi make point of announce the agreement of double contribution convention between india and the uk while the minister have not even make pass reference to it today in his statement or his press release double contribution convention will come at significant cost to the british taxpayer and british business worker who enter the uk under such convention be eligible to only pay national insurance contribution in their home country in this case india again we only know from the indian government press release that the exemption for national insurance contribution for indian worker will be for three year do that mean that indian worker currently in britain will get refund from his majesty revenue and customs or do it mean that new indian worker will not pay any contribution in the first place do the exchequer effectively give away massive subsidy to get this trade deal over the line will it really be cheap for business in the uk to hire indian worker than british worker will the convention apply only to second employee of indian company or will it apply more broadly to all indian worker in the uk and if so from when how many additional work visa will be issue to indian worker under this agreement will the convention really mean that for example an indian own restaurant chain in the uk could pay no national insurance here for its chef while the british pub next door pay full national insurance for its curry chef will this deal reduce the incentive for the indian millionaire who be currently flee the uk for tax reason subset of the many millionaire who be do the same to do so can the minister outline what the cost of this agreement be to the treasury how many british national do the government anticipate will make use of the reciprocal right in india fear that when it come to british worker we have go from two tier keir to two tier taxis keir this government be literally put up taxis for british worker while cut they for indian worker be aware that india have express concern about the uk become rule taker to the eu so will the minister confirm what commitment and assurance he make on that matter during the negotiation while conservative members will never talk down the benefit of free trade agreement such as this one have to be make on fair term for both party as it stand this deal look like it be subsidise indian labour while undercut british worker will the government back our domestic market by scrap their job tax look forward to hear from the minister reply that actually answer these question if he choose as he sometimes do to bat away genuine question from the dispatch box could he follow up in writing thank the hon lady for her recognition that this be landmark deal although have to say that it be not her most generous welcome of deal that the previous government work for many month to try to secure it be right to recognise that albeit they do not manage to close the most difficult remain issue seem to remember that it be former leader of the conservative party the former member for witney who promise that his party would stop bang on about europe alas that advice do not seem to have be take in the conservatives approach to today landmark agreement with india the hon lady inquire how we get the deal do when our predecessor fail to do so respectfully would say that it be through process of patient pragmatic and painstaking work very different approach from the kind of instagram diplomacy that all too often characterise the approach of past trade secretaries and trade ministers that allow we with the political leadership show by the secretary of state to close significant chapter on good and service it allow we to then reach consider judgment that mean that with stability of political leadership and clarity of ministerial direction we could secure concession from the indians and conclude the agreement in way that elude our predecessor the hon lady ask specifically about the double contribution convention can assure she that that reciprocal agreement will benefit uk worker and their employer as the opportunity within india expand india will have one of the world large middle class in the come decade the agreement will cover only specific and limited group of indian businesspeople for period of three year it be worth recognise that the indians have other arrangement in place that extend long than that the worker will be require to pay their immigration health surcharge to the national health service so the convention do not affect nhs funding the dcc that we have agree be reciprocal and will benefit uk worker in india as well india be home to the fast growth rate in the so the opportunity here for the united kingdom be only likely to grow over time the agreement be make in the context of the wide deal which will bring billion into the uk economy can assure the hon lady that the united kingdom already have social security agreement in place with range of country and trading bloc include the european union and the united states on the broad immigration issue that the hon lady raise can assure she that the deal do not affect the point base system the point base system be not affect by the agreement that we strike today the deal only cover business mobility which be different from immigration as it be about travel for specific and temporary business purpose as result uk business will benefit from additional business mobility route support they as they expand into india student visa remain off the table hope that that give some clarity to the hon lady be grateful for her recognition that it be landmark deal it be right to recognise that the conservatives seek to secure this deal and hope that in the course of the conversation that we will have across this dispatch box today we will be able to recognise that this represent very significant win for the united kingdom in very challenging time for trade the conclusion of the negotiation on this free trade agreement be major win for scotland economy and for my livingston constituency in particular give that we bottle glenmorangie whisky and bake paterson shortbread we also have strong and grow digital service sector particularly with small and medium sized enterprise can the minister say bit more about how this deal will help those business too thank my hon friend and fellow scottish member of parliament one of the commitment that we make when we be both elect in my case re elected to the house back in july be that we would seek to ensure labour government deliver for scotland the cut that we have secure in whisky tariff for the huge and significant market in india be clear and tangible example of the difference we be make he do not need to take my word for it these be the word of mark kent the chief executive of the scotch whisky association the uk india free trade agreement be once in generation deal and landmark moment for scotch whisky export to the world large whisky market it show that the uk government be make significant progress towards achieve its growth mission and the scotch whisky industry look forward to work with the uk and indian government in the month ahead to implement the deal call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the minister for advance sight of his statement at time when donald trump be fuel global instability through protectionism international co operation be more important than ever uk india trade deal be positive step and we look forward to see the detail of the deal parliament must be able to scrutinise the detail carefully especially the propose change to national insurance contribution when labour be in opposition it agree with the liberal democrats that there should be vote on trade deal both my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey and have make the lib dem position clear there should be proper scrutiny and vote on trade deal the government own export minister the hon member for harrow west gareth thomas say that the current ratification process be not fit for purpose and he be right do the minister of state agree that deny vote not only contradict labour party policy but set dangerous precedent especially ahead of any future us deal can he explain the government massive turn since enter government finally will the government push for new uk eu custom union the fast way to boost our economy at this month political summit the hon gentleman have refer to our attempt to reset our trading relationship with europe the red line that be set out in our manifesto be very clear but within those red line we be endeavour to broaden and deepen an important trading relationship that represent about of the uk trade as for the hon gentleman broad observation that the agreement we have reach today be as it be pretty bright shin light in what be somewhat dark sky for international trade agree with he it be hopefully sign of further deal to come and of commitment to take forward deal that be mutually beneficial in this case for the indians and also for the united kingdom when it come to the wide question of how the deal will be scrutinise the hon gentleman be right to recognise that today telephone conversation with prime minister modi be just the start of the process press release have be publish along with list of the top benefit but we hope to publish paper today set out in more detail what have be agree the conclusion summary paper and there will then be process move towards signature and legal scrub of the text however as the prime minister make clear few day ago we will follow the process set out in the constitutional reform and governance act last week have the pleasure of meet representative of the federation of indian chambers of commerce and industry when they come here with my old friend piyush goyal congratulate the minister and his official as well as ficci and the india global forum under the leadership of manoj ladwa and indeed everyone who have spend so many year lay the groundwork for this agreement the minister recognise the doubling of india service and it export over the last decade and the benefit that we can gain from engagement and co operation in respect of the service and knowledge economy but think it important for he to outline far what the benefit of the double contribution convention on national insurance will be and how they will facilitate that engagement and co operation for our worker in india thank my hon friend for his generous word of congratulation know that the bilateral relationship between the united kingdom and india have be constant feature of his long service in the house and particular focus of his parliamentary work he be right to recognise in the context of both digital service and the service sector more widely the huge potential mutual benefit for the united kingdom and for india work together and he be right to recognise the broad and deep relationship between our two country as have say million people with indian heritage live in the united kingdom but as his question suggest it be also right to recognise quite how dynamic the indian economy be today it have the high growth rate in the which be expect to remain above over at least the next five year give that our be largely service base economy notwithstanding our excellence in advanced manufacturing the opportunity for uk service exporter be huge and grow welcome the indian trade deal but will the minister now switch his attention to the other side of the atlantic and ask lord mandelson to explain to the united states administration that tariff on film be unworkable and impossible to implement and would do real damage to the film industry not just in the uk but in the united states pay tribute to the right hon gentleman long stand interest in matter relate to culture medium and sport and to the creative industry more generally we be grateful for the expertise and experience that he bring to the house on these issue it would be one of the first occasion on which tell lord mandelson to do anything in many decade of our work together but will ensure that that be duly register not only in the record of this house but directly to our distinguished ambassador in washington it should also be place on record that the film sector be key part of the uk world class creative industry and we be absolutely committed to ensure that those sector continue to thrive and create good job and that the uk have strong and balanced trading relationship with the united states worth billion be grateful to the right hon gentleman for his challenge to to reach out directly to lord mandelson in respect of what we have read in the newspaper in the last couple of day and give he my word that will ensure that lord mandelson be fully aware of the issue amid much fanfare as usual the former prime minister boris johnson announce that he would have uk india trade deal sign by very cunningly he never mention which diwali so we be leave wait for year other conservative prime ministers make similarly empty promise which be why particularly commend the minister the business and trade secretary their official and the labour government for have finally conclude this free trade agreement look forward to this mutually beneficial agreement be formally sign can the minister confirm that this landmark uk india fta will increase bilateral trade by billion increase uk gdp by billion boost wage by billion

we sign the right deal for the united kingdom this be the good deal that india have ever agree to it be expect to increase bilateral trade by about billion and raise uk gdp but we have manage to secure deal more timeously than be anticipate and frankly we get well deal than many expect the indian government have say that this deal will mean that immense opportunity for talented and skilled indian youth will open up in the uk will the minister please confirm that we have not sign youth mobility scheme with india before his government have agree to one with the eu he say that we have contribution agreement with the eu and the usa but my understanding be that we have sign double contribution convention with only chile japan and south korea could he please clarify that what say be that we have social security agreement with range of country include the usa and with the eu the hon lady ask whether new point base system be be introduce and can assure she that that be not the case the deal cover only business mobility and the uk have not give away visa or create new route exist business mobility route have be expand for highly skilled and experienced professional to cover additional sector but to qualify for these route professional must demonstrate that they meet the strict criterion for professional experience and qualification do the minister agree that by secure the good deal that india have ever agree the government have put uk business in an incredible position to take advantage of the rapidly grow economy india be quite simply the fast grow economy in the and be expect to be the third large economy in the world by if we be choose country that we would wish to do deal with india would be pretty high up the list by india will be home to an estimate

british company especially sme to ensure that they be able to maximise the benefit they can derive from trade in this very important market as my statement seek to make clear there will be specific provision for sme as part of this deal because we recognise that the huge indian market can often be challenge for business that do not have the capability of large business be grateful to the right

access the opportunity bring forward by this deal be think particularly of our fantastic digital sector and our great health sector for both the digital sector and the healthcare sector the deal offer significant opportunity in huge and expand market in india it will deliver degree of certainty as well as significant tariff reduction across range of sector and it also afford we the opportunity to

congratulate he this labour government and official on negotiate the trade deal particularly give the conservative party abject failure in this regard when it come to our business community in the uk we have strong value in relation to worker right human right consumer protection and environmental sustainability so can the minister outline how this deal will respect and enhance those value can indeed say that this be modern forward look agreement and that be why there be recognition in the deal of exactly the value my hon friend mention that represent first for india in many case it reflect the fact that we be determined to secure that as part of the negotiation and it be one of the many reason we be proud of the agreement announce today today trade deal announcement will be welcome by many in scotland not least those in the whisky industry in the face of volatile us tariff this be undoubtedly good news however there have be increase pressure in the uk even from the former prime minister tony blair for the government to abandon their net zero ambition understand that carbon mechanism be crucial in these trade negotiation with india give that the snp government have today reaffirm their full commitment to net zero and sustainable industry can the minister give his reassurance that the uk government climate ambition have not be sacrifice to secure this deal can give the house that assurance think we be go to have an uncharacteristically warm endorsement from the hon gentleman until he get to the word however have to say we have be so busy negotiate trade deal with

negotiate trade deal on beneficial term be hugely significant particularly with regard to the recent trade war initiate by trump however have come to this house countless time to raise the issue of human right violation and abuse against the kashmiris by the indian government and will do so again today can the minister tell whether the persecution of kashmiri journalist and human right activist have be raise at any point during these negotiation and whether he will return to this house before he sign on the dotted line in few month with full response detail exactly how the uk government be

to the promotion of universal human right when we have concern they be raise directly with partner government include at ministerial level the horrific recent terrorist attack in jammu and kashmir be utterly devastating and my thought remain with the victim their love one and the people of india it be however for india and pakistan to find lasting solution and resolution to the kashmir dispute take into account the wish of the kashmiri people today news of free trade agreement between the united kingdom and india be wonderful some of we have argue for great free trade arrangement with commonwealth country for many year mr modi the prime minister of india should be commend for adopt free market system that have bring wealth and prosperity to india eliminate poverty and enable india to work with country like the united kingdom will the minister accept that none of this would have be possible have we not be sovereign and able to negotiate our own free trade agreement follow our departure from the european union be brexit not the right thing to do first it be right to recognise that the hon gentleman have form on argue for the importance of the commonwealth seem to recollect answer parliamentary question in recent week on exactly the opportunity for do effective economic work together that be provide by the commonwealth and the fellowship of friendship that it present we on that we be on all four and certainly agree that we should look to strengthen and broaden our trading tie where we can his point about europe be well plough field in this house and elsewhere and it seem to that we should be look forward and look for new market rather than engage in old argument warmly welcome today important announcement and in particular the benefit it will bring to the uk economy with the billion of pound of extra growth it will generate in both the food and drink and advanced manufacturing sector as well as in many other part of our economy will the minister elaborate little on the benefit to the uk tech sector and in particular to start up such as the many in my constituency and to the young entrepreneur set up their own small business give the significant

fintech or financial service there be huge opportunity as result of this deal steel tariff be reportedly major sticking point in these trade negotiation with india that be of particular concern to community across south wales especially follow tata decision to shut down its blast furnace in wales and across europe while simultaneously invest in new capacity in india can the minister assure the house that british steelworker have not be sacrifice in order to secure this deal and can he confirm what tariff rate indian steel import will face when the agreement come into effect it be this government who recently step in to save british steel in order to save thousand of job and avoid sudden collapse in our primary steelmaking capacity thank to this government swift intervention we be able to secure the raw material that keep the blast furnace at scunthorpe alight british steel have also cancel the redundancy consultation that would otherwise have put job at risk frankly uk

consumer stand to benefit in relation not just to whisky but on range of consumer good pay tribute to my hon friend constituent in southall and the extraordinary contribution that they have make as part of that live bridge over many decade here in the united kingdom the commercial opportunity in both direction be significant which be why think we be able to secure the deal today welcome this trade deal with global titan that will be in place for the decade ahead it have be make possible by brexit and by the hard work of the previous government however the minister will be aware that this country run very substantial trade deficit with india be the deal that he have negotiate likely to narrow or widen that deficit because all we know about the tariff non tariff trade barrier and trade off that be implicit in the deal be what we read about in the press or be tell about by the indian government it be for the indian government to account for this trade deal in the term that they so choose we will follow the establish constitutional process of the constitutional reform and governance act whereby not only be we share statement with the house at the early opportunity but the house will have the opportunity to scrutinise the detail of every aspect of this agreement as somebody who represent constituency with proud community of people of indian heritage with world beat firm skilled workforce and catapult centre at the manufacturing technology centre would like to ask the minister to expand on how this deal will help deliver growth economic development and innovation right across the country and opportunity for business small medium and large we have speak today of the importance of the indian market but it be also right to recognise that the indian market presently sit behind some of the world high barrier to trade notwithstanding the fact that it be the uk large trading partner the fact that we be tear down so many of those tariff level as part of this agreement will be very practical and pragmatic offering for the kind of excellence in manufacturing that he have in his constituency and that be represent across our country how can the government make trade deal for the whole of the united kingdom if they do not control the trade law for the whole of the united kingdom northern ireland be still under the control of eu trade law to give practical illustration of the problem under the uk india trade deal any import to northern ireland from india speak of import not export will be subject not to any agree uk tariff but to whatever prevail eu tariff there be on those good and the eu do not have trade deal with india be this not another illustration of how northern ireland have be leave behind by protocol that have leave we still in the eu the northern ireland trading relationship and its status within the united kingdom be not alter as consequence of the indian free trade agreement that be reach today the established position be exactly as the right hon member describe and recognise the distinctive history and significance of the good friday agreement not just in the protocol but the windsor framework huge amount of work

for the whisky industry it mean uisge beatha gu galore it be also good for food producer such as crofter in the western isles whose export of lamb product now face zero tariff and the salmon farming industry which support job in my constituency and account for million of trade it be good news overall guess the only question be whether the minister will be toast this deal with single malt hearach from the isle of harris distillery or one from uist benbecula or barra chain of new distillery that now have new export market thank to this deal think it be tip former speaker of the house of representatives who say all politic be local so if be go to be toast tonight deal it will be with the fine glenkinchie whisky from the east lothian part of scotland not alas with an islay malt or malt

it be exist business mobility route that have be expand for highly skilled and experienced professional to cover additional sector congratulate the minister on secure this vital trade deal the automotive sector in the west midland have be worry about increase tariff in the us so trade deal with india country where uk brand be highly respected be extremely welcome can the minister tell my

have make early in relation to steel as part of this agreement we have include bilateral safeguard mechanism which allow we to temporarily suspend or increase tariff if an industry be suffer or there be threat of serious injury as result of reduced duty to my hon friend question automotive company will now benefit from sell to india with tariff under quota reduce from over to we have agree quota

the regional economy boost it by some million since and job be tie to it it be essential that we outline the importance of trade deal to the region and the film sector must be part of that solution

be call up in parallel the security cabinet reportedly approve plan to deliver aid through private company this come at time when the scale of civilian suffering and humanitarian need be already intolerable more than people have now be kill in gaza israel have fully block the entry of humanitarian aid for over two month the world food programme say its food stockpile have be exhaust the announcement from the israeli government have rightly spark grave concern that this conflict which have already work so much bloodshed and suffering may enter dangerous new phase know that concern will be feel right across the house let make the government position crystal clear we strongly oppose the expansion of israel operation any attempt to annex land in gaza would be unacceptable palestinian territory must not be reduce or subject to any demographic change we want this war to end we want an immediate ceasefire the release of all hostage the urgent provision of humanitarian aid and pathway to political solution we all recognise that hamas continue to hold hostage in the cruell fashion their action show their complete disregard for the interest of the palestinian people hamas must not divert aid for their own financial gain or use civilian infrastructure for military purpose we repeat our demand for the immediate release of the hostage but an expansion of this conflict be not the route to achieve their safe return that be why it be so strongly oppose by so many hostage family negotiation offer the good hope of end the agony of those wait for love one who be hold captive alleviate the suffering of civilian and end hamas control of gaza it be evident that hamas can not be defeat through military mean alone an expansion of military operation will result in the death of more innocent civilian and put the hostage at yet great risk the fighting must stop the government have say since day one in office that the only way to ensure path towards long term peace and stability be an immediate ceasefire the release of hostage well protection of civilian and significantly more aid enter gaza diplomacy be how we ensure security for israelis and palestinians not

permanent peace we continue to use our full diplomatic weight to bring about ceasefire and end the suffering after more than two month of aid into gaza be block palestinians continue to face immense suffering essential supply of food and medicine be either no long available or quickly run out as the united nations have already say it be hard to see how if implement the new israeli plan to deliver aid through private company would be consistent with humanitarian principle and meet the scale of the need we need urgent clarity from the israeli government on their intention we must remember what be at stake these humanitarian principle matter for every conflict around the world they should be apply consistently in every war zone as we have say repeatedly humanitarian aid must never be use as political tool and israel be bind under international law to allow the unhindered passage of humanitarian aid repeat my call for israel to engage with partner to allow for rapid and unhindered resurgence in the flow of aid into gaza we reiterate our outrage at recent strike by israeli force on humanitarian worker infrastructure and healthcare facility israel must do far more to protect the civilian population and humanitarian worker and hold to account those who be responsible over year since the appalling attack on the world central kitchen in which three british national be tragically kill we continue to press for conclusion to the israeli investigation and decision as to whether criminal proceeding will be bring the un and humanitarian partner must be able to carry out their work in safety in accordance with their principle last week we welcome prime minister mustafa of the palestinian authority to the united kingdom we sign landmark memorandum of understanding and confirm

october and the capture of the hostage fifty nine innocent hostage continue to be hold in cruel captivity by hamas and those who be still alive have no access to aid or communication with their family do the minister agree that iran and hamas be to blame for event since october and that the immediate return of hostage would aid effort to secure the ceasefire what discussion have the foreign secretary have in recent day with the us and with middle eastern and other partner who have broker previous agreement on effort to secure the release of the hostage what exactly be britain contribute to these effort be the uk convening power be use effectively and what international pressure be the uk try to bring to bear on hamas to release the hostage and to ensure their removal from power the minister state that hamas can not be defeat through military mean on what basis have he reach that assertion and what be his alternative to get hamas to lay down their arm on aid he mention the israeli government fear about aid diversion if the current situation on aid access be to be unblocked the government must seriously engage with israel to address the many concern and the broad situation that have lead to the breakdown of the ceasefire how much uk fund aid be wait to enter gaza where be it be hold and what be the minister do to engage with his israeli counterpart so as to find practical solution to this issue what engagement have take place between the foreign secretary and his israeli counterpart on the decision of the israeli security cabinet to undertake this new operation in gaza include on its objective we all want to see sustainable end to the conflict the return of the hostage the alleviation of this awful crisis and eventually two state solution with the region free of hamas and of threat from iran the government talk about want to achieve these thing but clearly they need to convince we all that there be plan for achieve they let we be clear the root cause of so much bloodshed and misery in the middle east be the regime in iran and if this government be serious about achieve sustainable peace in the middle east they must have strategy to deter iran and undermine its regime and its awful approach which be to sow destruction and export repression around the world include to the uk we hear about that in statement early when will the government come out with clear strategy for deal with this malign threat to peace and stability both in the middle east and elsewhere for month we have be ask question of this government in fact ask the minister the same question just last week as we see on march the intelligence and security committee send report on iran to the prime minister how many more militant and terrorist will be bankroll by iran threaten life before the government have clear strategy in place what engagement be take place with the us to tackle iran destructive influence and ensure that it never become nuclear state while the minister be at the dispatch box can he update we on other matter in the middle east on sunday the iranian back houthis recklessly fire missile at israel which land near the main terminal of ben gurion airport and injure six people let alone the risk to aviation many more could have be injure or kill on the ground that no doubt must have be the desire outcome of the houthis do the government have plan to deal with the ongoing threat of the houthis include the threat they pose to stability and security and to our own interest on syria the government announce to the medium on april that they be lift more sanction but it take six day before they inform the house through write ministerial statement that they would be do so will the minister explain why the house be give that discourtesy and why the matter be not bring to the house early we still have no clarity about the criterion be use to lift the sanction the entity identify or the impact the government be also not apply any condition the us be impose condition on syria when it come to ease sanction include destroy chemical weapon and co operate on counter terrorism will the government explain why they have take different route from our ally when we have consistently work in concert with our international partner why be we now work in isolation and in such an unco ordinate way the last conservative government lead co ordinate approach when it come to syria and this government be now behind the curve we have to be cautious when it come to lift sanction the situation in syria be fragile particularly when we see the appalling clash between the pro government and druze community be the government press hayat tahrir al sham into action finally will the minister update the house on the situation in lebanon what be his assessment of the current situation include the adherence to the ceasefire the term of un security council resolution and the broad political stability thank the right hon lady for her important question take the opportunity to respond to her important question about the attack on ben gurion airport absolutely condemn the houthis continued missile attack include the attack on ben gurion airport over the weekend israel have extensive experience of the danger of civil aviation attack of this kind and we reiterate our support for its right to self defence in the face of houthi attack the house hear from the defence secretary last week some of the effort we be take in the collective self defence of our ally in the red sea the right hon lady raise number of other important point can update the house that we be in regular contact with those press for ceasefire in the region most obviously of course the president of the united states special envoy mr witkoff who believe be in the region now of course the foreign secretary have be in touch with his counterpart in israel as well as with many other he have be in oman and qatar recently and as the right hon lady would expect have be in regular contact with all those with an interest the right hon lady ask for an update on sanction be not aware of any discourtesy in the sequence of how we announce the syria sanction but be happy to take that point away if there be any discourtesy can assure she that it be accidental we take the step that we do in relation to sanction because we want the new syrian government to succeed britain interest indeed israel interest be in stable and secure syria the new syrian government have take welcome step as the right hon lady point out there be still area of major concern but the judgment that take alongside the foreign secretary be that we should lift sanction that clearly no long target entity control by the assad regime give that it be clearly no long in power in syria and maintain sanction where asset hold by the assad family be still relevant we take series of principled step to try to ensure that the new syria have the good possible chance of be the success that would be in britain national interest we maintain those sanction on the assad family and we do so in close co operation with our ally agree with the minister comment and condemnation of israel action in gaza the problem be that have agree with he every time he have make these condemnation of israel and the whole house generally have join he in that but the reality be that israel be take absolutely no notice of the government position its action now in gaza the starving of the population and the threat of wholesale movement of that population away be completely unacceptable will the minister consider rapid recognition of palestinian state hopefully together with france and other ally and will he seriously consider sanction against israel if it pursue the wholesale removal of palestinians from their home know the strength of feeling of my hon friend and of so many member on the benches behind and indeed across the house it be obviously source of great anguish to and all in the government that we continue this far into our government to not have the ceasefire in place that we have long call for we be work with our ally to try to persuade israel to change course as he will know will not comment on sanction from the dispatch box but we have be as clear as we can on our position in relation to the many area we have discuss in the house week after week month after month where there have be failure to see improvement whether that be the protection of civilian or aid into gaza we will of course continue to discuss all other matter in relation to this fraught and tragic situation with our close partner as he would expect call the liberal democrat spokesperson the israeli government decision to approve plan for an expand offensive summarise by official as the conquest of gaza be disgraceful it will wreak more devastation and displacement on palestinians after month of bombardment it will also narrow the path back to ceasefire while severely harm the chance of get the remain hostage in hamas captivity back to israel alive do the minister agree that if the israeli government carry out their threat to seize and hold gaza that would constitute further flagrant breach of international law in that instance what would this government response be the late aid blockade of gaza have now last for more than day the un have describe it as grow humanitarian catastrophe prime minister netanyahu late proposal to deliver aid through private company at military hub appear to contravene basic principle of international humanitarian law include the neutrality of aid and have be criticise by aid organisation as dangerous and unworkable the israeli government refusal to reopen aid route be utterly unacceptable and contravene their obligation as an occupy power we welcome the government pledge of million package of support for the occupied palestinian territories however without more action to secure the reopening of aid pathway this new package will provide limited relief for palestinians suffer in the strip can the minister provide detail on how the government be work with international partner to pressure the israeli government to allow their aid to reach gaza can he update the house on whether contingency measure be be consider to ensure that aid reach those suffering in gaza even if the israeli government continue to block the direct supply of aid into the strip the hon lady ask series of important question seek in my statement to focus very clearly on what have be announce by the israeli government include by prime minister netanyahu on sunday do not wish to be draw into speculation about the various report of how this operation may be conduct wish to stick only to the public announcement we have be clear all the way along in our commitment to ceasefire and our desire to return to the framework of the ceasefire that be negotiate with such relief we be in regular touch with special envoy witkoff we hope that through his effort he will be able to secure return to ceasefire that would be far preferable on all the axis that the hon lady describe whether that be the safe return of hostage the desperate need for humanitarian aid to return to gaza or in our view israel security she ask important question about the role of an occupy power in the provision of aid my official set out our view on the legal position on friday at the international court of justice the israeli government plan to expand their military operation in gaza and displace its population speak volume about the effect of their impunity impunity to break international law to cut off food and medical supply to starve population and to kill ten of thousand of civilian what will the minister do to end the impunity with which israel be act when will he finally sanction those israeli ministers apply full arm embargo ban all settlement good and most importantly recognise palestine thank my hon friend for her important question have set out at the dispatch box the step we have take whether it be in relation to sanction arm or good and will not rehearse they here can see that many member want to contribute as she would expect will not comment on further sanction my hon friend ask the question that know be on the lip of so many in this house about recognition what we see in gaza and the announcement over the weekend be very significant immediate and practical threat to the viability of palestinian life and we be take every practical step we can alongside our ally to try to focus on the ceasefire that must be our most immediate priority give the threat that hang over such significant civilian population as we speak in his statement the minister say that the uk government reaffirm the uk commitment to recognise palestinian state up to now the excuse have be that we have to wait until negotiation be complete there be no negotiation all we have be extremist settler try to force out palestinian people from their village in the west bank which have see with my own eye in the name of god why can we not give the palestinian people some hope why can we not give they the same right to self determination and recognise palestinian state now thank the right hon gentleman and my constituency neighbour for his commitment to these issue the problem the palestinian people face at this moment be acute immediate and practical as have set out we stand by our commitment we want to make contribution to practically improve the life of the palestinian people and we will view recognition in that light no one can deny any long that israel be commit war crime after war crime with over palestinians kill million forcibly displace the complete blockade of gaza for the last two month and now plan to annex the entirety of the gaza strip just what will it take for the government to properly act over netanyahu breaking of every single international norm and rule say to the minister that simply oppose the expansion of military operation from the dispatch box be not secure peace or help the palestinian people the government have rightly impose widespread sanction on russia why do they refuse to impose widespread sanction on israel recognise the passion in my hon friend voice and as he know it be not just at this dispatch box that we have set out our view he ask for widespread sanction of course as the house know we have impose sanction on violent settler and we have suspend arm licence accord to careful process and have look at the risk to international humanitarian law we will continue to take action across the full range of our diplomatic option and not just at this dispatch box as he would expect what dialogue be ongoing with egypt at this time there be concern about the pressure on egypt not just from the situation in gaza and its obvious interest in the rafah crossing but in the south from the conflict in sudan egypt remain an important party in get to resolution what be the government current dialogue with and support for egypt thank the right hon gentleman for his important question of course the conflict affect not just israel and the occupied palestinian territories but many of its neighbour include egypt confirm that the government have be in regular dialogue with their egyptian counterpart and have an upcoming exchange with one of my egyptian counterpart on exactly these question the people of gaza be be starve deliberately and they need full immediate unimpeded delivery of adequate aid will the uk government insist that israel ensure that aid be distribute not by private military contractor but by the un and international agency accord to the un recognise humanitarian principle of humanity neutrality independence and impartiality my hon friend rightly highlight the importance of the humanitarian principle she outline those be important principle not just in israel and the occupied palestinian territories but right across the world it be proud part of british history that we have be such forceful advocate for those principle and we will continue to be so with israel and any other who seek to undermine they the hon member will forgive but there be few thing more infuriate in this house than listen to ministers whether they be of the blue persuasion or of the red persuasion as now fail to call out collective punishment for what it be fail to call out war crime for what they be continue to justify the sale of arm to israel and find every excuse possible not to recognise the state of palestine perhaps he will be the one who surprise get to his foot and say that the plan as lay out by benjamin netanyahu be tantamount to ethnic cleansing will he do that yes or no the right hon gentleman perhaps unsurprisingly go for rhetoric and he want to opine on question of law and make determination that ministers for long time have rightly choose to treat as question for the court he ask to take action as government the labour party have take action it have take action on arm and on sanction we have record that we can defend we be not simply here for rhetoric not week go by without more worrying news come out of the middle east and my thought be with the innocent people in gaza who be worried about new offensive with the hostage family who be worried about their love one and with israel follow the houthi attack will the minister join in condemn the houthi attack and in call for negotiation to continue that will see aid get into gaza and hostage return home thank my hon friend for his question know of his long personal commitment to those so badly affect by this conflict join he in condemnation of the houthi attack the house should be under no illusion about the nature of the houthis they be no friend to the palestinians and their repeat strike against international shipping indeed against practically any flagged vessel that cross through the red sea be threat to global peace and security and to international trade their action target civilian aviation do nothing for the palestinian people after month of the diplomacy that the minister refer to it be clear that israel have not significantly comply once after watch child be shoot in the street medic and hospital consistently target british citizen and rescue worker murder and their body conceal red line such as rafah reduce to rubble and the hostage still in captivity we now learn from an israeli government minister that gaza be to be entirely destroy we be watch the livestreamed starvation of an entire people the minister talk about his anguish which know be genuine but can he not see what the majority of the house can see which be that he be face catastrophic failure of government policy for which the palestinians the israelis and the rest of we may well pay heavy price for many year to come he be an intelligent man can he not see the moral and tactical case for change in strategy that might bring about peace the right hon gentleman talk powerfully and the scene in gaza be visible to we all he ask question about tactic and strategy and the right strategy must be over the next two week for special envoy witkoff effort to see success we need to see ceasefire restore those who be advocate for that political process need our full support and that be where the effort of the government be focused israeli government minister smotrich say today that gaza be to be entirely destroy and its people be to leave in great number to third country that late threat be on top of the deliberate blockage of aid into gaza on top of the ongoing displacement of the past month and on top of death there be clearly breach of international humanitarian law the minister have be clear in his condemnation and clear that this be not the way to bring the hostage home if the israeli government be not listen to his word and surely they be not will he consider what meaningful action the government can take will he consider further sanction against israeli ministers and against good that be make in illegal settlement on steal palestinian land thank my hon friend for her important question clearly the rhetoric of some israeli government ministers have cross threshold after which we would all condemn they the foreign secretary have condemn series of statement be not familiar with that statement but it look as if it would fall very much in the same category as she would expect will not comment on further sanction as have make clear we have take action and we will keep further action under review the minister have make the government position crystal clear that the israeli plan be unacceptable how will british government policy towards israel change as that plan be implement as the right hon gentleman will know we hope to avoid have to deal with that hypothetical and we will seek to persuade the israeli government not to embark on path so damaging for all the reason have set out this afternoon be sure the right hon gentleman will be ask that question in the house should we fail yet again the unimaginable horror of what be happen in gaza have be join by yet more unacceptable behaviour from the israeli government let be clear to the house the butcher of hamas could draw this to an end today by release the hostage but that do not make right the starvation and destruction of the palestinian people in gaza dictionary definition of ethnic cleansing include the mass expulsion of people from their land ask the minister two question what do he think and how do he feel when he hear israeli ministers say we be finally go to occupy the gaza strip once we occupy we can talk about sovereignty those of we on the labour benches stand on manifesto commitment to recognise the state of palestine if not now when my hon friend have deep commitment to these issue he raise they here and elsewhere often let be clear any attempt to annex land in gaza would be unacceptable palestinian territory must not be reduce or subject to any demographic change he can read from that the strength of our view on some of the announcement make by some of those associate with the israeli government we want to see palestinian state that can function safely side by side with safe israeli state and it be regrettable that that seem like such distant prospect be sure that we will continue this discussion in the house in the week and month to come in the light of the late outrage from the netanyahu government in displace hundred of thousand of innocent palestinians which come on top of the starvation of hundred of thousand of palestinians the murdering of aid worker and the expansion of violence by settler we get from the minister strong opposition request for urgent clarity and reiteration of his outrage he say that he be take action but he can hear from all side of the house that nobody be satisfied with the level of action that the british government be take implore he to listen to the support from all side of the house recognise palestinian state impose full arm embargo on israel and sanction smotrich and ben gvir in the name of god as other have say please can we get aid into gaza so that people will stop starve the hon lady be right to press on the absolutely vital importance of aid get into gaza those be point that we make regularly and with force to the israeli government part of my anguish be about the report that read as so many in the house do of the continue failure for that to happen will address point that think she may have make which other have also make about whether there be alternative route to get aid into gaza range of alternative route other than through the land crossing have be try it be the view of the british government that no route other than land route can get the scale of aid that be now require into gaza israeli decision making be prevent those land route from be in operation the hon lady ask about the recognition of palestinian state and refer she to my previous answer thank my hon friend for his statement follow yet another appalling turn of event towards gaza by the israeli government in westminster hall debate in february say fear that if the occupation continue it will become increasingly difficult to apply international law to the situation on the ground official report february vol now fear that if we do not recognise palestinian state there will be no palestinian state that include gaza leave to recognise will the uk government take immediate step to recognise the state of palestine we be clear about the principle of international law that apply as say to the right hon member for witham priti patel on friday we appear at the international court of justice to set out our understanding of the obligation on an occupy power in this case israel we be clear about what international law in our view mean for the occupy power as we have hear the netanyahu cabinet have approve an illegal plan to expand its military offensive to capture and occupy all of gaza that will put million child at acute risk of starvation epidemic disease and death with the deliberate blockade of food and essential supply do the minister deny that that constitute genocide in real time when do he last assess the real risk that israel be commit genocide in gaza as the house know will not make determination from this dispatch box on question of law we assess risk can confirm that those assessment be ongoing and that prevention of humanitarian aid reach gaza be part of they as we approach the anniversary of the icj advisory opinion on the occupation what be delay the uk government response be it that the opinion require not just recognition that the occupation be illegal but the government to set out what step they will take to end that occupation will the minister at least say from the dispatch box whether the government believe that the movement of the palestinian population of gaza would constitute forcible displacement forcible movement of the gazan population out of gaza would be forcible displacement and that be clear concept in international law israel be an important security trade and democratic partner but that do not give it blank cheque the fact be that child have be kill and have be injure maim or wound some of they have be orphan have be in this house for year and for many year have support israel pretty much at all cost quite frankly but today say that get it wrong condemn israel for what it be do to the palestinian people in gaza and the west bank withdraw my support right now for the action of israel and what it be do right now in gaza of course the hostage should be release of course israel have right to exist and of course israeli and jewish people should have the right to live in peace but so do the palestinian people have say it before and will say it again the life of palestinian child be as precious as the life of jewish child this be particular moment in time we have have lot of statement over the past month not only be this not parliament great hour but be really concerned that this be moment in history on which people will look back and in which we have get it wrong as country will the minister stand up to our friend and ally in the united states and make strong stand for humanity for we to be on the right side of history and for have the moral courage to lead not just to follow the united states and to make difference that be why we be all elect here let we stand up for life let we stand up for all child not just jewish child that be very powerful intervention will not linger long in the answer other than to say that hear the right hon gentleman word and feel their force will of course endeavour to stand up on the international stage and here at this dispatch box equal to the strength of some of these contribution we have hear throughout the afternoon all the thing in gaza that have be commit by israel the truth of the matter be that israel be commit the cold blooded murder of medic civilian un staff and even many aid worker in the aid flotilla in international water in the west bank there be more than illegal settler and illegal violent settler use force back by the idf and the israelis have be kill and maim people do that not show that the action of israel have be all about occupy gaza and the west bank and that as israeli cabinet ministers have be say israel basically want full judea and samaria and that it will not stop at gaza or the west bank but continue order before bring in the minister may ask hon member and the minister to make their question and answer little bit shorter let restate the british government position in relation to the west bank and the gaza strip we hope that both those territory will be vital part of single palestinian state and that be the objective towards which we strive in the past year tonne of bomb have be drop on gaza which be the equivalent of five time the power of the nuclear weapon use over hiroshima and nagasaki some year ago that action in gaza have result in the death of at least people and on top of that we be now go to have the complete invasion of gaza by israel at what point will the government cease all arm supply and military co operation with israel cease the use of raf akrotiri and above all stop the export of any part for jet which have be complicit in the killing of people in gaza surely it be time for the british government to say no no more no weapon no co operation no support and to save life in gaza and the west bank now be the time to say and do that have set out the position in relation to the carve out for component to be clear to the house we have suspend the sale of part where they go directly to israel it be only when we do not know their final destination that their sale be not suspend will not rehearse the recognition point give the pressure on time let we be clear the mask murderer of hamas could end the suffering of the gazan people today if they release the hostage and agree to ceasefire but let we also be clear that this extremist israeli government in their own action in the past few day and week be endanger the state of israel as the right hon member for the wrekin mark pritchard make absolutely clear the israeli government be undermine the state of israel by their action more than any hamas extremist could dream of agree with what the minister say about practical measure and pragmatism rather than symbolism but do he not think that the most practical step that this country can take be to recognise the state of palestine in conjunction with other state as soon as possible in order to move the peace process on assure my hon friend that we want to move this process on towards political horizon and peaceful solution as quickly as we possibly can have be in the minister shoe and sympathise with he as he grapple with an extremely complicated and fraught situation but do he agree that there can not be any sustainable peace in the region or viable palestine without deal with hamas if so what would be his plan to achieve that with other beyond pious rhetoric and hand wringing the right hon gentleman be knowledgeable and experienced he be right to focus on the central importance of remove hamas from any position in gaza where they could pose threat both to the palestinian people and to israeli civilian who have suffer so terribly at their hand the answer be to remove hamas and have the palestinian authority return to their rightful place as the sole legitimate government authority for both the west bank and gaza in addition to continue its cruel aid blockade far right israeli minister deplorably tell gathering in the occupied palestinian territories that gaza be to be entirely destroy and palestinians will be force to flee in large number to third country will the minister wholeheartedly condemn that as well as the netanyahu regime proposal to expand their military operation in gaza will he confirm to the house exactly what the government be do with their international ally to stop these cruel and callous proposal as tell my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes have not see those remark but we have be clear about what we think be acceptable and we have condemn remark by other israeli ministers once have have an opportunity to review the remark that my hon friend mention be sure will be in position to provide further comment reiterate our condemnation of the cruelty of some of the measure that have be put in place particularly the block on aid into gaza an israeli human right group have now describe israel as use starvation as method of warfare which be war crime under article of the geneva convention will the minister join ireland south africa and many other country in clarify that there have be genocide and apartheid against the people of palestine it be time to speak up and out and to speak for palestine will not rehearse the point have already make about the determination of genocide and about recognition the evacuation order of the israeli force have result in the forcible transfer of palestinians in gaza into ever shrink space where they have little or no access to lifesave service and continue to be subject to attack what step will the government take to put pressure on israel to ensure it do not go ahead with its plan to move gaza population do the government agree that the plan constitute force displacement which be war crime as have say we be clear on the status of force displacement under international law my hon friend contribution be very important know many hon member be conscious of the multiple displacement of many palestinians in gaza who have be displace not once or twice but in many case more than three time the treatment of palestinian civilian who be just try to live be terrible and share the feeling of the house about that the uk government be right to state at the international court of justice last week that israel have responsibility under international law to provide food and essential humanitarian aid to the people of gaza and yet we know that israel have block all aid shipment for the past two month give the catastrophe unfold before our eye be it not worth resurrect negotiation and discussion with international ally about the possible airdrop of humanitarian aid so that at the very least we can not say that we sit idly by and watch an entire population starve we have be involve in discussion about airdrop there be role for they and we have speak with partner in the region who have be keen to see airdrop as contribution particularly give the pressure on aid and be not rule they out however give the scale of humanitarian aid that be need must be clear with the house that helicopter airdrop can only reach certain level so while that aid would be welcome it would be very partial response to the scale of need that we see the israeli government plan to expand their military offensive in gaza include hold ground and move the palestinian population to the south of the district be wholly unacceptable it be clear act of aggression and fly in the face of international law welcome the minister statement that this government strongly condemn israel action but do he accept from voice across the house that the recognition of palestine as state be imperative if we be to work towards last peace agree with my hon friend that safe and secure palestinian state alongside its neighbour safe and secure israeli state will in the end be the vital component of sustainable peace in the region madam deputy speaker gaza will be entirely destroy that be direct quote from israel minister of finance bezalel smotrich early today that be the language of ethnic cleansing and genocide from pariah government who be use starvation as weapon of war warning that the israeli government will seek to displace the entire palestinian population and flatten all of gaza have be repeatedly ignore by this government over many month yet that be now the reality that gazans face give that the uk have continue to give support to israel throughout the conflict there be report that an raf jet fly to israel with part and military personnel only last week have british intelligence service and the foreign office be blindside by israel approve plan if the hon gentleman be ask whether the foreign office be aware of the plan before it be announce the answer be that we be not aware in all of our interaction since we become the government we have be clear on the view we would take on proposal of this nature for more than year and half we have witness genocide be livestreame on our screen we have see child in gaza be blow apart by israeli bomb and infant waste away from israel impose starvation and now israel be propose full invasion and occupation of the entire strip the israeli government be make mockery of international law and we be enable it it be not enough for the uk government just to condemn the israeli government when will our government end all arm sale to israel and implement trade sanction we can not be ask in year to come what do we do to prevent genocide and for the answer to be not enough will not rehearse the point that discuss with the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn but on my hon friend point about international law this government will continue to stand for international law as we do on friday at the icj we be absolutely clear on our position on international law as it pertain to the occupy power which be what israel find itself as in gaza from the father of the house to the intake we be hear across the chamber from labour conservative green plaid and scottish national colleague consensus about what the government need to do on behalf of the british people we need our government to recognise the palestinian state we need to make sure that the hostage be return home and we need to stop the killing of innocent palestinians who be now face with starvation minister on behalf of this house of commons plead with you and the government to take action with the minister you do not plead with sorry madam deputy speaker we plead with the minister and the government to take action on behalf of all of we as hon member in this house and to do the right thing and show leadership we be capable of leadership we need to act have be at this dispatch box on many occasion discuss these issue but can confirm to the hon gentleman that have feel the force of the contribution make this afternoon thank the minister for come to the house this afternoon to give this update and for his strong opposition to the propose expansion of israel military operation constituent continue to be horrify as do we all by the consequence of the assault on gaza the blockade of aid and now the news of escalation this weekend they ask if diplomacy be fail what come next what more can the minister tell my constituent about the late negotiation join other from across the house in the call for meaningful action include recognition we be fully commit to play our full diplomatic role hear the frustration of my hon friend constituent indeed hear the same frustration from my own constituent in lincoln know that many across the country watch these scene with grow horror that they continue this long into the conflict we will be work on this issue include with our european partner particularly france and germany we have issue statement together it be source of share frustration that more progress have not be make as say in an early answer we hope to see progress towards ceasefire we be support the effort of special envoy witkoff in that regard and we will spare no effort over and over again from all part of this house we witness grandstand against mass migration and the most vulnerable in any society refugee and asylum seeker while know all too well that refugee crisis be not bear in vacuum as attest to by the situation unfold in gaza before the eye of the world refugee have no choice they be force out of their home and thrust on the world look for somewhere safe to seek asylum after last week election the prime minister order be sure that the hon gentleman be go to get to his question very quickly thank you madam deputy speaker after last week election the prime minister pledge to the british public that he would go hard on the issue of migration give what the israeli government be now say ask the minister whether his government will come down hard through action not mere condemnation to ensure that the world be not face with new and devastating refugee crisis as the hon gentleman know one of the most painful element of this crisis have be that even those palestinians in gaza who wish to leave have not be able to do so regrettably we have already discuss force displacement many time this afternoon so will not rehearse the point but can assure he that in the face of potential further escalation in the conflict we will redouble our effort to secure the ceasefire that know everybody in this house want to see restore be go to get all member in but urge short question israel be starve gaza to death be sorry minister but when israel be use starvation as weapon of war and palestinians be be ethnically cleanse before our eye mere word of regret or condemnation from the government be simply not good enough we in this house will be judge in history for fail the palestinian people so urge the minister to listen to the consensus that be be build across the house today and act we do not need word we need action for the palestinian people have hear the force of the contribution say gently to my hon friend that unlike my predecessor have take action in response to this crisis as have the foreign secretary and other however in the face of the scene come out of gaza it be clear that no one can be claim victory at the moment thank the minister for his statement as well as for his carefully choose word it be never easy to respond to all these question as he have state peace talk must be priority for the region and it be absolutely essential that food and aid can reach child have the minister be able to talk with our ally in israel about allow independent third party immediate access to gaza to distribute needed supply while also ensure very importantly that israel safety be not compromise in any way the hon gentleman talk about the importance of independence and impartiality which be exactly the principle that should be guide the humanitarian operation in gaza he be absolutely right that hamas must not be divert aid for their own financial gain or use civilian infrastructure for military purpose the good way to ensure that be to open up gaza and allow the aid agency in to operate effectively the israeli government have publicly declare their intent to occupy gaza indefinitely and be systematically deny gaza entire population access to the most basic need for sustain human survival this be war crime so do the minister agree that alongside france the uk government must urgently recognise the state of palestine at the united nations conference on the two state solution in june reassure my hon friend that we want to make our full contribution in move two state solution forward and of course we be in touch with all key regional partner in the run up to the june conference miss from so much of the debate around the awful conflict in gaza be the voice of the israeli people and the opposition they have be cry out for another hostage and ceasefire deal israel be liberal democracy with election due next year do the minister agree with opposition figure such as yair lapid benny gantz and yair golan that the threaten expansion of operation in gaza will do nothing to bring the hostage home or to remove the iranian sponsor death cult that be hamas my hon friend have deep focus on these issue and be commit to play his full role here in they he will understand why decline the opportunity to comment on israel internal politic will restate the british government view though that the fast route to safety for those hostage be ceasefire the point that he make be make with some force thank the minister for his statement appreciate that the minister can not comment directly on sanction but he know that have privately urge he to consider further sanction and further measurable action give the ongoing horror and the statement from the israeli government please will the minister consider further concrete action my hon friend guess right about my likely response will not comment on sanction from this dispatch box she have raise these issue with real force with and be sure that she will continue to do so we will continue to keep sanction under review thank the minister for his statement and very much welcome the strong word of condemnation none of we will ever forget the horror of october for the israeli people but these late announcement show an israeli government who fear be out of control and make fool of we as ally first when my hon friend commit to use the full diplomatic weight to bring about that ceasefire that we all urgently want to see what concrete next step do he envisage give that neither hamas nor netanyahu seem bother in the slight about international humanitarian law secondly the prime minister have previously describe the recognition of palestinian state as an undeniable right so when will we see that right honour thank my hon friend for his commitment to these issue will not rehearse the argument about recognition it be obviously vital part of what hope will be practical set of step forward to try to address the truly horrific scene we see emanating from gaza join he in press on those party to the conflict who be in breach of their international humanitarian law obligation to change their approach echo the minister word condemn hamas and condemn the houthi attack on ben gurion airport an aid blockade be an aid blockade annexation be annexation and war crime be war crime israel may be our formal ally but this weekend the israeli government have commit to the seizure and occupation of the gaza strip which this government have repeatedly state be violation of international law can the minister tell this house the reasoning that fcdo official have provide to he for not escalate uk sanction on israel do he agree with and the call of this house that the time have come for significant action in the face of crime that have they be commit by any other country we would have already do something about as my hon friend know official advise and ministers decide so will not labour the question about foreign office advice we will be take action in response to the event that we see as this house would expect will not comment on sanction far from the dispatch box but recognise the force of the contribution and the commitment of many of my hon friend include she on these question be grateful to my hon friend for come to the house today the long term occupation of gaza be entirely incompatible with viable two state solution and completely undermine any small prospect of last peace full scale occupation of gaza be inconsistent with international humanitarian law so can the minister please advise the house and give some reassurance that the government be consider urgently recognise the state of palestine if the israeli government move on the action that have be reference throughout this debate will the government seriously look at further sanction know the minister do not like to talk about that from the dispatch box but can he give an assurance that such review will take place should israel move forward with the action that it have outline my hon friend be right that permanent occupation of gaza would be grievous blow to two state solution clearly the gaza strip should be central part of palestinian state and can assure he that we continue to keep all these matter under close review thank the minister for his statement it be crucial that there be recognition of the palestinian state and that the palestinian people be represent as equal at the negotiating table give what have go on in the region recently do the minister agree that israel must immediately lift all restriction on aid and allow unfettered access to humanitarian assistance in gaza if israel refuse what lever can we use to save innocent life my hon friend be right about the critical nature of the aid shortage in gaza the world food programme have be clear that it be run out of all stock to sustain life and it be vital that the israelis reverse their path and allow aid back into the strip the palestinian people have right to determine the future of their country what specific action will the minister take on the propose indefinite occupation by israel of gaza it risk erode the sovereignty of the palestinian people set an extreme precedent in international law and ultimately jeopardise any path to last peace my hon friend ask important question we be raise these issue directly with the israeli government and we be talk with our ally about what step we may take next it have now be more than two month since israel block food and aid get into gaza aid agency tell we that of their work have be stop or drastically reduce because of the blockade welcome the minister comment condemn these appalling action but we be now face total collapse of the aid system in gaza be it not time now to go far than word and take action against these extremist ministers who be advocate for this starvation policy my hon friend be former aid worker he understand how these thing work and his warning about the scale of risk for the humanitarian system which be support so many palestinian life be well make will not rehearse the comment have make the government be right to strongly oppose the israeli government plan to expand military action which be unconscionable do the minister agree that what should be expand be the provision of humanitarian aid and that what should be intensify be negotiation and diplomatic pressure on all party to bring about ceasefire return of hostage and credible peace process that result in two sovereign state do agree with my hon friend well make point gaza have have aid block for two month netanyahu say that the population may be move for their own safety safety from whom can the minister explain what further diplomatic consequence israel will face if it continue down this road my hon friend be right to centre on the safety of the palestinian people diplomacy in relation to this situation continue at pace will not provide running commentary from the dispatch box but can assure he that we be in direct contact with the israeli government on these question and with our ally to discuss next step point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker during prime minister question last wednesday be sit behind the hon member for clacton nigel farage make some comment and learn the lesson that the microphone in this place be very good and pick up comment make by those sit directly behind hon member the comment that make related to the second earning of the hon member for clacton declare in his entry in the register of members financial interests reform uk social medium account digitally manipulate those comment to give the appearance that have describe the hon member use four letter expletive this be misinformation it be fake news it be trumpian tactic it be report to elon musk no response be receive if footage in this house be allow to be digitally manipulate for political end in the name of member of this house that put at risk the proceeding in this house and believe put at risk democracy have raise this point of order to put the fact on the public record so that my constituent and everyone else know what actually happen and to seek your advice madam deputy speaker on what should do be grateful to the hon member for give notice of his point of order it be not matter for the chair but as member on both side of the house will know download and share clip of proceeding in the chamber be subject to condition of use and clip should not be manipulate in such way as to be misleading may suggest that the hon member raise the matter with the director of parliamentary audio and video as matter of urgency criminal injuries compensation authority review motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to require the secretary of state to review the criminal injuries compensation authority and for connected purpose from time to time this house have ask itself the question what value do we place on support for the victim of violent crime believe that this be the right time to ask ourselves that question again victim support can take many form include non financial measure we have get well but we must get well still at recognise the lifelong impact that violent crime have on person victim would benefit from well sharing of information about support service both public and voluntary and the process for access nhs diagnostic and therapeutic support that information sharing should start with the police the ambulance service and the crown prosecution service and be pleased to hear recently from the cps west midland region about the enhanced victim support that be now in place nevertheless there will always be case in which financial loss have occur or financial remedy be necessary or otherwise appropriate mean of provide some measure of justice for those who have suffer assault think that member in all part of the house would wholeheartedly endorse the principle that whenever possible the perpetrator of violent crime should pay the cost of restitution indeed it be welcome and remarkable achievement that the amount recover to fund support service through the victim surcharge first introduce in have nearly double over the last four year however the criminal injury compensation scheme exist because some offender lack or can not be prove to possess the asset or revenue to pay those cost the so call straw man of the justice system and in still more case the perpetrator of violence be never identify crime statistic notoriously do not tell the full story but in the west midlands police force area nearly one in five violent assault be not prosecute because no suspect can be name commend the chief constable craig guildford and the police and crime commissioner simon foster for their success in increase the number and the share of identified assailant but the point stand the animate force behind the current criminal injury compensation scheme be birmingham magistrate and the first secretary of the howard league for penal reform margery fry who lead campaign in the under the clarion call of justice for victims she argue that criminal injury could not be narrowly consider to be private matter between the assailant and the victim just as we provide for each other in time of sickness through national insurance so too she argue duty be owe by the state when it fail to prevent one citizen from injure another in her word the state can not disown all responsibility for its occasional failure to protect today that same principle be set out by the criminal injuries compensation authority which say that payment be sometimes need as an acknowledgement of harm and an important gesture of public sympathy the criminal injury compensation scheme be now an integral part of the justice system even if it be as the chair of the justice committee my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter put it last week something of cinderella service nothing that say today be intend as criticism of the staff of the criminal injuries compensation authority they work hard in difficult circumstance give that staff number have fall by fifth since the current iteration of the scheme be introduce in the civil service people survey show that they take pride and find professional fulfilment in their work and as someone who once receive an award from the scheme remain grateful to they important and positive improvement have be make since six year ago the victims commissioner publish an excoriate report let say at this point how welcome it be to see the under secretary of state for justice the hon member for pontypridd alex davies jones in her place know that she care deeply about victim support as well as have specialist knowledge of this issue and be grateful to she for her thoughtful response and conversation about it however it be also clear that failing remain within the system as we hear last week when member across party contribute to debate in westminster hall draw particular attention today to the delay that too many applicant still experience lack of signposting or integration with wide support service and general lack of public awareness of the scheme itself the trauma of dog attack on postal worker and other victim by new and ban breed the victim of which be mostly ineligible for compensation follow change to the scheme in the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse supposedly year hardship fund establish year ago that be now essentially dead letter the criterion be so restrictive that no payment have be make from it in the last seven year and the tariff system itself as many serious and life change injury be not cover at all it be true that the upper cap on the scheme be generous by international standard but the low limit of have be freeze in cash term since my hon friend the member for derby north catherine atkinson refer in this place to annex of the scheme which define crime of violence as include sexual assault to which person do not in fact consent those be word and idea from another age even if the court now adopt more informed interpretation the continued presence of that definition can only cause harm and it must be strike from the scheme these problem and believe on the basis of my own casework and that of other member that they do to an extent persist impose heavy burden on the victim of crime like some other member bear the physical scar of violent crime alongside other scar of different and more subtle kind have speak previously in another debate about that experience and do not intend to repeat those word today it be enough to ask hon member to take it on trust that delay the seemingly arbitrary rule of the scheme the manner of the communication and sometimes poor decision making can add to the sum of the pain that victim feel pain that can only be partially outweigh by the release that the end of the criminal injury process bring perpetrator might evade justice but it be part of the nature of the trauma response that at slight or unexpected prompting victim may be compel to relive that crime again and again that be why the victims commissioner have call for an overarching review of the scheme to establish whether it actually fulfil its state remit to acknowledge the harm suffer by victim of violent crime who have no other access to compensation and to provide redress as part of just and compassionate response that be what the bill which beg leave to introduce would achieve the legislation would set out simple requirement for fundamental review and for ministers to report back to the house with proposal for further scrutiny and debate can not stand here and claim that easy answer exist to all these question although note that to the good of my calculation the cost of the scheme appear to be fall in real term we live in straiten financial time that be why it be well for reform of the scheme to be carry out in deliberative manner on the basis of accurate and recent evidence and with the need of victim as the primary concern to that end take heart from the minister statement although she say that the government do not plan change to the scheme at this time she go on to say the clear message to be that we need change and will be consider how government can well provide the support that victim need and deserve also take heart from the prime minister statement of personal support for the victim of violent crime when this matter be raise with he fortnight ago by my hon friend the member for warrington north charlotte nichols this issue touch the life of people in every one of our constituency no amount of money can return someone to their mental or physical state prior to an assault but well function fair and compassionate scheme can bring victim some measure of justice question put and agree to order that laurence turner charlotte nichols michael wheeler andy slaughter warinder juss antonia bance chris bloore catherine atkinson kevin mckenna mark sewards tim roca and alistair strathern present the bill laurence turner accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill victory in europe and victory over japan anniversary beg to move that

parliamentary scheme with the raf this year allow small glimpse of the professionalism and sacrifice that define our royal air force personnel to this day as we commemorate ve day and vj day let we remember those who fight and fall not only in victory but in hope and let we resolve always to be worthy of the freedom that they give we call the liberal democrat spokesperson on the eve of war liberal leader archibald sinclair warn policy which impose injustice on small and weak nation and tyranny on free man and woman can never be the foundation of last peace he be speak about the munich agreement which see european power cede czechoslovakian territory to hitler nobody in this house would describe the brave nation or the people of ukraine as small and weak but with the spectre of the dictator vladimir putin loom large on the eastern edge of europe and president trump threaten deal to carve up ukrainian territory sinclair word resonate today as they do then the wartime generation know the cost of give ground to tyrant as they celebrate year ago this week the good way to honour those who fight for peace be to redouble our effort to preserve it those people together with today serve personnel and veteran carry forward the legacy of service inherit from that extraordinary wartime generation in their memory this anniversary must be moment not just of reflection but of renew sense of responsibility this country be at its good when it work with its ally not when it shrink from the world this year be very likely the final big celebration for the veteran of world war two who be still with we there be name on cheltenham war memorial and many civilian in my town also die in bombing raid on ve day after six long year at war people in my constituency and around the country take to the street to celebrate at whaddon primary school child wave union jack flag people line up outside the municipal office in the town centre to hear winston churchill deliver his ve day speech an effigy of adolf hitler be burn the celebration reportedly run well past midnight which be rather late for genteel cotswolds spa town in the it be right that we in this house pause to remember the scale of the sacrifice and the legacy of the victory that that generation give we this anniversary be not simply about mark date in calendar but chance to say thank you to the dwindle number of survive veteran and to all those who have serve suffer and rebuild today think of lorna year old recently meet at st ives court in cheltenham and very possibly my old constituent she tell proudly about her contribution to the war effort as an intelligence analyst in whitehall think of all those who serve in the gloucestershire regiment and think of my two grandfather both of whom serve one in the navy and one in the raf this anniversary be about ensure that we continue to stand up for what they stand for we must use this moment to recommit ourselves to the international co operation and diplomacy that help to deliver year without third world war it be peace that have be threaten by putin illegal invasion of ukraine it be no coincidence that european unity be bear from the ash of the second world war it have be the great peacebuilding project in history and in the face of the threat that confront we today we must once again stand shoulder to shoulder with our european ally that mean support nato stand up to aggression and strengthen the rule of international law that do not mean as some have callously suggest that ukraine should accept deal to cede some of its territory to putin that would be betrayal of the principle for which the wartime generation fight that include those who suffer in the far east they have often receive less recognition than those who serve in europe the conflict there continue for nearly three month after ve day in punish condition and at immense human cost yet in too many commemoration their story be not hear we owe these individual our deep gratitude and it be good that we be remember they this ve day that gratitude to all those who have serve must be express not just in word but in action action to defend our democracy and action to defend the british value of liberty tolerance and respect for the rule of law respect our veteran mean look after they properly after their service be over look after their mental health their housing and their right to compensation this anniversary be not only about how we treat veteran but about how we tell the story of the war and whose voice we include the role of commonwealth force in secure victory be also often overlook some million indian troop serve in the second world war many of they in the gruelling burma campaign troop from africa the caribbean and across the empire fight valiantly under british command as liberal and an internationalist believe that we must be proud of they it be only right that today and this week we recognise the contribution of our commonwealth soldier beyond the parade and ceremony we must embed this full history into our national consciousness because remembrance without inclusion be incomplete my constituency have the large commonwealth war grave site in the north of england we regularly put on fantastic event throughout the year include the remembrance sunday service and christmas service will my hon friend join in congratulate those involve for the fantastic work they do in make sure that we do not forget absolutely the second good spa town in the country be sure celebrate ve day wonderfully well this anniversary arrive at time of renew global instability from ukraine to the middle east we be once again remind that peace be fragile that it can not be take for grant the international order build in the aftermath of be under more strain than ever the world be more dangerous than at any point since the cold war member in all part of the house be so proud that many of our parliamentary colleague have serve in the armed force and we all stand with our armed force finally wish to express my party strong support for the programme of national commemoration plan this year we can all be very proud of what be happen these event give we all meaningful opportunity to reflect on the courage resilience and unity that define the war effort on the frontline and on the home front alike let we mark this anniversary not just with solemnity but with resolve let we listen to the story of those who serve from the soldier to the evacuee from the factory worker to the codebreaker and let we make sure that every part of their legacy be carry forward let we honour they not just with word but with action as with so many town and village across the uk brave resident of my constituency include my own grandparent be involve in all aspect of the war effort our town and village answer the call for service service that take so many form early in the war coatbridge host the polish field artillery regiment for short time after the evacuation of france so warm be the hospitality offer by the local that the regiment later adopt coatbridge as the mother garrison and the town coat of arm be emblazon on their regimental standard despite their own hardship and struggle local people in my community and across the monklands area engage in whole raft of activity to support the war effort include knitwear drive charity concert and cinema gala to extend support not just for our own effort but to aid other include the russian red cross society nowhere be that deep sense of common cause more apparent than in the support offer by the woman in coatbridge to the woman of besiege leningrad think those woman would be frankly ashamed of the action take today by putin in ukraine when reflect on these year it be impossible not to think of our own family and the role that they play alongside their neighbour and friend they be ordinary people engage in extraordinary act think of how privileged be to hear their story and to reflect on those that go untold think of my maternal grandfather edwin simpson who fight with the raf and whose wing be privileged to carry with today along with his squadron photo take at raf yatesbury in wiltshire in crew that span the country and the commonwealth think of my paternal grandmother ethel mcnally who spend the war as crane driver and be more than little irk when after the war she be replace by return service personnel something she never tired of shout about the role of woman have be well discuss and will be throughout this debate at the war conclusion the provost of coatbridge town council recognise woman for their role in the war effort in munition and weapon factory which be themselves dangerous environment in the same message the provost tell of how the armed force have save the world for democracy with their courage steadfastness tenacity and grit provost pirie tribute be all the more moving as he have lose his son lieutenant sydney robertson pirie of the london scottish regiment just one month before ve day the minister mention party some of which last day in bellshill and they be well document locally no level of gratitude can be enough to thank those who serve and who die include the hundred whose name live on the memorial throughout my constituency for the peace that they secure in we honour those who die and those who live in that great generation we commend their service and their sacrifice at the outbreak of the second world war the national service armed forces act introduce conscription for all man age between and like so many of his generation my grandfather harry fry davis reed bear in plymouth in receive his call up paper on june he report for duty in exeter he join the newly form battalion of the devonshire regiment or the devon it be battalion largely make up of conscript serve for the duration of the war just one month later the nazi bombing of plymouth begin and the city he call home where he have grow up live and work come under relentless attack friend neighbour and fellow plymothians be kill street be destroy and entire community be change forever in the early year of the war my grandfather help defend the coastal area of what be now my constituency of exmouth and exeter east that knowledge speak to when walk along local beach at home often reflect on what it must have feel like to guard those shore under the threat of invasion not know what would come next only that you have to stand your ground by the battalion have be redesignate as glider bear infantry unit within the airborne division their mission be to fly into combat aboard horsa glider which be unarmoured fragile aircraft make from wood and canvas the thought of fall from the sky into enemy territory under fire in such

ukrainian defence industry have go into overdrive to engineer the kit that will help save it from russian aggression there be no deny that we live in increasingly dangerous time war be rag on our continent eighty year on from ve day the idea of last peace in europe be fading reality that be why support the government plan to raise defence spending to of gdp not because it sound tough but

so on this anniversary let we remember let we honour and above all let we ensure that the legacy of those who give everything live on not just in our word but in our action be privileged to speak in this debate today after so many powerful speech from colleague across the house be also glad to have the chance to draw particular attention to the people of cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy and the special role that my constituent and their forefather play in secure victory for the ally the fife and forfar yeomanry be present at many of the second world war most crucial turning point from the dunkirk evacuation in to the normandy landing in and the crossing of the rhine in march hundred of young man lose their life and we will remember they draw attention to the enormous contribution that woman make to the war effort have enter the workforce en masse in kirkcaldy world famous linoleum industry during the first world war the contribution to the second world war effort by kirkcaldy woman be invaluable woman work at nairn manufacture fuel tank for halifax bomber and their big contribution be to anti gas fabric for cape and gas mask such quantity could only be produce in kirkcaldy and that be decisive factor in the allied victory as the nazis could not manufacture gas proof textile in sufficient quantity and so never use gas in air raid for fear of retaliation one of the most iconic symbol of britain war effort and indeed its lack of use be therefore testament to the hard graft of fifers particularly our wartime woman add to their contribution be the thousand of poles in the independent parachute brigade station at auchtertool in my constituency who help to fortify scotland east coast and set up anti tank barrier and pillbox from burntisland all the way up to montrose accompany the fortification on the island of inchcolm in the forth the regiment later go into battle in operation market garden in the netherlands in general sikorski the leader of the polish government in exile have house in auchtertool as well and find quote from winston churchill as he update this very house on the death of general sikorski in july until the moment of his death he live in the conviction that all else must be subordinate to the need of the common struggle and in the faith that well europe will report july vol many poles make their home in my constituency after world war two and they be an important part of our community today the memory of those who fight in both world war and all other and in particular of those who do not make it home be keep alive by the fantastic work of the kirkcaldy legion its work alongside the kirkcaldy united services institute and the hill of beath ex servicemans club in my constituency support veteran in our area be also glad of the work that our labour government be put in to support our veteran and their family commemorate the contribution of my granny isa mccue who serve in munition factory and my grandad sam ward who serve in the raf during world war two civilian before the war like so many they step up to secure our freedom in the face of the challenge in our own day and age in this debate and on the anniversary of ve day on thursday we commemorate real people who work who serve and who give their life for freedom and prosperity in the face of immense challenge they be after all the reason we be here today what an excellent speech to have the privilege of follow it be always so impressive when people do their duty right up to the very end and so ask the house to salute the passing of normandy veteran cecil newton who as recently as last year come back to lepe beach in new forest east and read out the name of more than hundred of his comrade in the royal dragoon guards who be kill in the day landing and beyond he be one of troop who land on gold beach have depart from lepe beach he be in an amphibious sherman tank that make it to shore not all of they do and he survive be wound in combat too pass at the great age of we have hear from many speaker about the connection between their constituency and the military history of the second world war that be theme on which expatiate back in may in my very first speech in this house will repeat just one reference from that oration about when discover small plot of raf graf in fawley churchyard in my constituency could not help but be move by the inscription on the headstone of young airman john burrow whose parent have write the follow into the mosaic of victory we lie this priceless piece our son think that that be such wonderful thing to do in the depth of their loss to say nevertheless that this be what we be do for the victory of our country over nazi germany salute they and their memory too how do one do justice to the second world war in few minute will pick out one key factor without which everything else would have be different the existence of the english channel there can be no doubt that if we have be contiguous with the continent of europe we would have suffer the same fate as all our ally there there be no way in which we could have resist be overrun when we think about how difficult it be to reinvade and retake the continent for democracy in even with britain as the launch area for that invasion we realise how virtually impossible it would have be without the united kingdom remain outside nazi german control we can also look at the area cover by simple listing of the campaign star that be award the atlantic star the africa star the italy star the burma star the pacific star the france and germany star and much belatedly the arctic star for the brave man of the merchant navy and the royal navy who risk everything to get supply to russia let we not forget one last thing when the war end the country for which we go to war poland remain under occupation by the soviet union and it take another year of determined deterrence couple with the nuclear balance of terror to ensure the eventual emergence of democracy in that country too it be pleasure to be call to speak in this debate to honour the sacrifice our community make during the second world war and to celebrate the victory of democracy over tyranny begin the week of ve day by pay my respect at hawkinge cemetery in my constituency there be british military personnel bury there mostly airman who make the ultimate sacrifice during world war two those airman would have fly from raf hawkinge part of which be now the site of the battle of britain museum in kent house the world large collection of battle of britain memorabilia urge all member of this house to visit it if they get the chance raf hawkinge be the near royal air force station to enemy occupy france the near luftwaffe fighter in calais be just six minute fly time away as result the air force base and the village in the surround area become regular target for luftwaffe bomb with the area around dover and folkestone also be subject to long range cross channel shell from german artillery battery station along the french coast it be little wonder that the area soon become know as hellfire corner after the battle of britain raf hawkinge continue to play vital role throughout the war with british commonwealth and other allied pilot fly bomber escort reconnaissance and intruder mission from there indeed hawkinge play pivotal part as frontline fighter station in against hitler fly bomb operation diver be the code name give to the raf strategy to intercept and destroy fly bomb before they reach london raf hawkinge location and its proximity to nazi occupy france mean it be use as forward base for fighter aircraft to save countless life by intercept the fly bomb before they reach the capital despite the variety of plane that fly from raf hawkinge during the war year it be the spitfire that have particularly close connection with the aerodrome turn to another part of my constituency ashford railway work be prime target for german bomber during the war around air raid alert be sound and bomb fall regularly in the area around the railway work although there be many fatality as result of these bombing raid the most devastating take place on march on this day an air raid that last around three minute result in the death of civilian and one raf pilot on the ground further people be seriously injure although the railway work be the main target the surround area be also badly hit during the raid bomb fall on beaver road primary school thankfully the siren sound in time and the child manage to get into the playground shelter as parent dread to imagine the panic and fear this bomb cause it be little wonder therefore that long before the all clear sound parent rush to the school to find out what have happen to their child when they get there they find that thankfully they be unharmed the headteacher miss adams receive an award for her action on that day which ultimately save the life of the child be pleased to have have the opportunity to speak in this debate to recognise the sacrifice make throughout ashford hawkinge and the village and to honour the legacy of all those who live during world war two we should recognise that it be our duty today to continue to uphold the value they sacrifice so much for eighty five year ago we see the force of fascism rise up to threaten democracy and freedom in europe force of darkness that would seek to control oppress subjugate and exploit the people of these island if they prevail but they do not prevail we owe our current reality to the bravery and heroism of those who give their life in order that we may maintain the way in which we continue to live our life in scotland generation be lose and village and town be hollow out of their breeding age man who be barely man at all often in their productive prime who be send to die in foreign distant place among the deafening and unrelenting roar of mechanised warfare see their friend and neighbour die and draw their own last breath desperate for kind word mother soothe touch or an absent reassurance before short life slam shut it be far cry from the cheerful boy own adventure we be home soon nobody get home soon many do not return at all and many of those who do would never be the same again because that be how it be with war in the past there be legitimate desire to lock it away in box out of sight which be nice if they could manage it but many could not many family see the slow heartbreak of husband who be irreparably damage either physically or psychologically and the distant silent father who return never quite able to access the man they be before the war total war have long tail and it be still visible on these island year later in society and the economy indeed the war debt to the united states be fully repay only in if the war store have not be evacuate from coventry to the perthshire hill between almondbank and methven would not have get job there in and can guarantee that if have not work for the ministry of defence would not be stand here today scotland stand tall in those dark of time militarily economically industrially and culturally just like our neighbour in england wales and northern ireland and in norway denmark and the low country scotland shipbuilding coalmine locomotive manufacturing agricultural output and production of steel be all pivotal to the war effort while young man fight an army of old man and woman toil in the factory and the field equip those at home and those in peril defend their homeland scotland industry and geography make it target for the luftwaffe the first aerial combat above the united kingdom in the second world war happen in the firth of forth where the luftwaffe target royal navy ship anchor off rosyth while london horrendous blitz rag on for eight long month towards the end of that period the clydebank blitz last just two night but on those two night in march the luftwaffe kill civilian injure further civilian and destroy home in that town eighty five year ago in europe we see the force of fascism rise up to threaten our freedom then the superior force of freedom and liberty rise higher still to crush fascism down where it belong eighty year after the end of that war autocracy be still alive and well in our world today to honour those who pay for our freedom with their own life we must remain forever alert to the fragility of our freedom we owe they all so much and the absolute least that we can do to acknowledge their selfless sacrifice be to never ever forget that liberty and vigilance go hand in hand this week be privileged to be attend event across the constituency to commemorate the anniversary of ve day and the sacrifice of those who fight in the second

vital today as it be during the second world war and we renew our commitment to they and as we hear early today we must also renew our commitment to end conflict around the world from ukraine to the middle east as we mark year since the long anticipate news that the evil nazi regime which have orchestrate the great act of mass murder in human history and terrorise europe have be defeat by the ally want to concentrate on the role of my constituency of high peak in the second world war so many of our man and woman serve their country during the war but sadly far too many make the ultimate sacrifice in defeat fascism although our community be spar much of the horrendous bombing that affect large area such as london there be some notable exception it be one july evening in when the luftwaffe find themselves fly over high peak after fail to find the large propeller factory in lostock because of low cloud cover the high speed bomber wreak havoc on two high peak village one drop its bomb on torr vale and the other drop two bomb near swizzels sweet factory have those bomb land on the factory the world may never have know love hearts and many childhood would have be poor for it the good news be that swizzels be survive and thrive today skip ahead to more plane be fly over high peak but this time it be the squadron of the raf practise the low level flying need for operation chastise the squadron more commonly know as the dambusters the dambusters be vital in convince people that the ally be win the war against nazism and it be the roll hill of the high peak that help the

again on the rise and war on european soil because of tyrant invasion of neighbouring country may our generation have all the fortitude and resilience of the generation we celebrate today victory in europe day in be moment of national rejoicing it be also the moment when britain and the world start to count the cost of war the human catastrophe of totalitarianism yet it would be hard to find anyone in the country who would say that the price be too high think we hear that today in the move recitation from the right hon member for new forest east sir julian lewis and the hon member for upper bann carla lockhart that great generation fight for our country and for freedom but they also fight for british value of democracy and the rule of law it be estimate that in there be only function democracy in the world and half of those could trace their genesis back to this mother of parliaments it be no exaggeration to say that democracy be britain great gift to the world and it be our duty to defend that gift both at home and abroad it be why be pleased to see soldier from ukraine marching in the ve day parade this weekend our war leader in know that win the war be only the first step to win peace they start immediately to set up series of international organisation include the united nations the european council nato and the european coal and steel community together they have protect democracy freedom and human right for the past year the spread of democracy across the globe have be great success but we must not be complacent threat to our democracy be real and not all come from hostile nation some arise from condition in our own country our society face great challenge with yawn inequality that be great than at any time since the when similar circumstance see fascism sweep across europe this be not time for hand off government it be time for intervention just as in the aftermath of the second world war when the attlee government promise good job high

the precious gift of democracy which be win at such great cost and selflessly bequeath to we by the wartime generation think would leave my final word to churchill himself who in his address to parliament on may add coda that be not include in his original broadcast he actually say these word initially to the medium so hope he get permission from the speaker at the time before come to the house churchill say that the strength of the parliamentary institution have be show to enable it to at the same time wage war and preserve all the title deed of report may vol this week event be be

in scene when one of the officer shout come on man granddad walk across the room turn off the telly and say they be man they be boy but home from war he come he raise two son for many year as single father and do his part to build well world he would have be amazed to have grandson serve in this place the victory win in europe year ago this week be not victory for britain and france over germany but of liberal democracy over fascism and racism it be victory for the whole of europe europe be the good example of last peace and reconciliation that the world have ever see may we always see ourselves as friend and ally and never surrender to those who want to divide we across the world in ukraine gaza sudan and beyond we see conflict once again rob child of their home and family of their future here in europe russia invasion of ukraine have shatter assumption that peace in our continent be secure it be not it must be defend peace must be defend not only with arm but with unity across europe with moral clarity and with political courage to stand up for international law and human right remembrance be not nostalgia it be responsibility if we be to honour generation that fight for we we must fight in our time for the peace that they give we as be bear in my childhood be surround by people who have fight in world war two but as child it all seem so long ago my father be an raf doctor serve in the middle east and in east anglia the fatality rate of the air crew be quite appalling not least because of all those kill as the plane crash remember story my dad tell we of crawl into stricken plane to extract wound pilot like many who fight in the war he speak about it only in his great old age but now that have grandchild of my own it no long seem so long ago what trick time and memory play on all of we suffolk be on the frontline defend our country our airfield be key to the liberation of europe the brave man of the united states air force fly bombing raid from rougham deep into europe and the incredible fighter ace and double amputee wing commander douglas bader fly from raf honington vanishingly few of that generation be among we now but be delighted to send my congratulation to one of they jim grant from stowmarket on his birthday last year jim sign up to the royal marines in and serve until he be present at day fire for the troop at sword juno and gold

for the woman land army from all over the country to milk cow pull potato and drive tractor they be determined and indomitable and alongside the home guard and the arp warden they make huge contribution to our victory many in the house will find it quite unbelievable that war have return to europe as we speak rocket and drone be be fling at city and civilian hide in air raid shelter those who start war do not respect the lesson of history which as the great songwriter say be simply blow in the wind they must not be allow to win therefore welcome the government choice to increase defence spending and applaud the commitment to go be really not enough eighty year ago mr churchill address the commons from the other place this chamber have be hollow out by direct bomb strike on the same day he remind we that britons be the first to draw the sword against tyranny we can not forget that it have now fall to we to safeguard the peace that his generation win and we must put aside our political difference eighty year ago celebration break out across the country that be spontaneous joyful and often very noisy there be group of people however who be not talk loudly about the work they have do during the war some be base in leighton buzzard in place call central it be secret communication hub and at its height more than people predominantly woman be work there run the large telephone exchange in the entire world many in the constituency and far afield think that more people need to find out about this contribution lot of people know about the neighbouring secret work at

contribution to the war effort be vital to ensure victory and peace this thursday will be at leighton buzzard war memorial with local people lay wreath in memory of those who serve at central it be vital that we make sure that the people whose wartime service be carry out in the shadow be now bring into the light as reflect on ve day and the celebration of victory over fascism in europe it strike that the war effort be one of common endeavour by ordinary people such as my grandad who be translator at bletchley park and richard brock who when meet he last year be year young richard be one of the man who liberate bergen belsen concentration camp to sit with someone who have know that horror at first hand truly be privilege and it be privilege to pass on my personal thank on behalf of survivor family that be because my friend krysh have polish grandma and she survive belsen after her liberation she come to britain and settle here the rest as they say be history except it be not just history be it it be not something that we can bring out to look at on special occasion and congratulate ourselves on beat fascism before put it away until the next anniversary it do not start with the camp do it it never do no it be more insidious than that it be slow and constant poisoning of mind by people intent only on power it be setting up of different group as scapegoat it be the use of pseudoscience to back up an ideology of racism and eugenic it be the use of propaganda to turn people into caricature and the use of the press to create narrative of blame it be the turning of ordinary people on their neighbour it be take the propensity of human to group together and turn that into sinister tribalism why look to the difficult solution to complex problem when people can simply blame the group over there that they have be teach over many year to hate and fear in the and it be the jews the gypsies the gay and the disabled it be the intellectual and the trade unionist it be anyone who challenge that narrative of hate so who be it today fascism do not start with the camp and the idea underpin fascism be not artefact of history end with the plea that we do not treat fascism and tyranny as an historical artefact and that we remember that they be living possibility even now even here the overthrow of fascism be not bauble to admire once year rather it be reminder

this debate stumble across quote that perhaps capture the essence of the british spirit to fight and defend it be by an unknown american soldier and it go along these line those brits be strange old race they show affection by abuse each other and will think nothing of casually stop in the middle of firefight for make would rather have one british squaddie on side than an entire battalion of spetsnaz why because the british be the only people in this world who when the chip be down and it seem like there be no hope leave instead of get sentimental will strap on their pack charge their rifle and calmly and wryly grin well let get after it question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the anniversary of victory in europe and victory over japan petition petrol price

cause people some confusion what on earth do the protection of neon signage as creative industry mean today be an opportunity for to speak on an issue that may seem niche at first glance but that speak to broad truth about the way that we value heritage craftsmanship and the lifeblood of our creative economy rise to speak in support of the campaign to protect the heritage craft of neon sign making uniquely british tradition that be now at risk neon be discover here in the united kingdom in after its discovery sir william ramsay and morris travers demonstrate that by pass electricity through the gas they could make it glow pave the way for iconic neon sign the world over from piccadilly circus to times square my constituency of bolton south and walkden be proud to be home to neon creations small but dedicated business lead by catherine and tony spink since they have be handcraft authentic neon sign use technique that date back over century they do not mass produce or cut corner they be artisan in the true sense of the word support everything that my hon friend say commission piece of neon artwork from local artist stuart langley in teesside number of year ago do she agree that neon be as valid medium of expression as any other artistic endeavour absolutely and will go on to talk about the amount of work and experience that artist need to work with neon recently visit tony and catherine at their studio and be transport to magical world of amazing colour see the stunning artwork that they have produce and be give demonstration of how they bend the glass to create their sign which manage to do as well to watch they be truly fascinating but this proud craft be under threat not because we no long appreciate its beauty but because it be be quietly and insidiously erode by mislead marketing and unfair competition from mass produce light emit diode imitation product often deliberately and incorrectly label as neon sign let be clear if it be not make of glass and fill with gas it be not neon sign the hon lady be put forward an argument for the creative industry but what the neon sign market have create can not be ignore always do my study before

the united kingdom down from hundred in previous decade it be red list endanger craft and without action it will be lose the problem we face be not just commercial but cultural it be about the loss of craft that be as british as harris tweed or sheffield cutlery in fact like harris tweed we believe that neon sign deserve formal legal protection through certification mark define british standard or ideally the introduction of neon sign protection act this be not an anti technology argument lead signage have its place it be cheap mass produce and useful in many application but to allow business to market led sign as neon be mislead consumer harm artisan and erase our heritage let illustrate how this be affect real business neon creations have see sharp drop in demand because customer be be tell by large retailer that led sign be neon sign the product may look superficially similar but they be entirely different in construction quality and artistry when customer receive they and discover that they be not authentic they contact business like neon creations not to buy but to ask for repair on something that be not actually neon catherine and tony have face online harassment and threat of legal action and have have their comment block on social medium for merely correct the record that be what come to people when they tell truth to power let we consider the fact neon be safe despite common misconception neon sign be power by low amperage and do not get dangerously hot the gas use neon and argon be inert and naturally occur in our atmosphere neon be efficient typical neon sign for business use cost around per day to run barely more than an led and far less than people assume neon be sustainable unlike plastic heavy led product neon sign be make of glass and be fully recyclable perhaps most importantly neon sign last much long they have lifespan of at least year outpace led alternative so why be we allow this confusion to persist why be we allow mislead label the british sign and graphics association the heritage crafts association the federation of small businesses and the greater manchester chamber of commerce all support strong protection for neon craftsmanship this be not just about one constituency or one business it be about defend the principle that authenticity matter and that heritage craft should be recognise not undermine by the march of mass production we must also address the issue of consumer transparency it should not be acceptable for retailer large or small to market product as neon when it contain no glass no gas and no craftsmanship we have rightly challenge fake olive oil and falsely label meat we must apply the same standard in this case harris tweed be protect by law ensure that only fabric hand weave in the outer hebrides can bear that name we propose similar model for neon sign which could take the form of certification mark that can only be apply to genuine glass neon product formal british standard for neon sign develop with input from the british standards institution and the bsga and maybe private member bill neon sign protection act that would enshrine legal definition of the term neon these measure would not be burdensome and they would not create red tape they would simply be way of tell the truth in advertising and provide very important protection to very small but significant industry let we not forget the cultural value of neon it be signage but it be also art it evoke memory of cinema diner music venue and city skyline it be symbol of expression and identity and to lose it would be to dim the vibrant glow of britain creative past neon creations and other similar business be try to pass on their skill to the next generation but they can not because there be not enough work to justify train new glass bender as of now there be no full time neon trainee in the whole of the united kingdom if we do not act the pipeline of skill will close forever that be why be in the chamber today to advocate for that pipeline and the small business that refuse to give up on this craft have write to the secretary of state urge the government to support clear definition and protection for neon sign know that the all party parliamentary group for craft be supportive of that campaign and be look into the next step but more need to be do will we stand by and watch the light go out on one of britain most unique and visually iconic craft or will we act to ensure that when someone buy neon sign in this country they be buy the real thing this campaign be not just about glow tube of gas it be about truth heritage and the people behind the glass people such as tony and catherine spink in bolton they be people whose livelihood depend on honesty in our market and fairness in our law let we give they that protection let we light the way for the future of british neon and let we ensure that the word neon once again stand for authenticity artistry and excellence that be an absolutely fascinating speech look forward to the response from the minister be sure that you look forward to every response from government minister madam deputy speaker note that my hon friend the member for bolton south and walkden yasmin qureshi end her speech by say let we light the way for the future of british neon be grateful to she for secure this important debate and consistent with her approach be also grateful for her thoughtful and rather illuminate speech if you will forgive the pun madam deputy speaker do not actually write that pun somebody in my department to whom be enormously grateful write it sack they no be not sack they you can not call for civil servant to be sack from the chair madam deputy speaker otherwise people will call for you to be sack as the jamaican reggae artist tenor saw and bob marley have lyricise life be one big road with lot of sign this debate have shine light on not just neon signage itself but the wide question of how we protect support and promote the often overlook corner of our creative economy let we be absolutely clear as my hon friend say neon be not simply about advertising and it be not just relic of bygone era it be artistry and craftsmanship it be part of our live heritage and of the live texture of our urban and rural landscape remember for while there be neon sign on enter the rhondda that use to say two can dine for fine dining laughter think it be slightly out of date from glasgow to blackpool and from the corner pub to the west end theatre marquee there be neon behind each flicker of neon gas be maker designer glass bender and an engineer of light these be not just tradespeople but creative professional sustain skillset pass down through generation many artist in the uk and across the world have take advantage of what be as my hon friend say great british invention it be only in about that it pass to the united states of america and become part of its advertising hoarding we think about neon advert but it be an essential art form too we have only to think of many of tracey emin neon work such as fantastic to feel beautiful again which be beautiful piece or apology for this madam deputy speaker do not get overexcite kiss kiss cover my body in love which be another great work the liverpool artist chila kumari singh burman work often use neon go to an extraordinarily wonderful exhibition of hers at the imperial war museum north which have large amount of neon draw on her family tradition of run shop member may recall that few year ago she cover tate britain during the winter period with lot of different neon sign for that matter people can go online this be my advertising for the tate and buy one of her tiger or ice cream neon work for for that matter at tate modern there be martin creed work worry it be difficult not to sing do worry be it not few year ago at tate britain the welsh artist cerith wyn evans do an extraordinary piece which really remember because it be such contrast with the gallery it be in it be km of neon light that be back in the creative industry as whole as my hon friend will know contribute billion year to the uk economy and neon as niche but important part of that ecosystem have dual role in commerce and in our culture advertising be one of our key export in the uk and an important part of our creative industry too we need just think of the piccadilly circus sign god own junkyard or the glow of fish and chip shop on rainy tuesday night these be not just sign but signifier of place of character and of british eccentricity they be thing that imprint themselves in our memory as part of what we think of as our own home town hear the call today for consumer transparency and great support the point be well make whether through plan protection trademarking or cultural preservation funding under exist legislation and guidance there be provision in place to protect unique aspect of our historic environment include street furniture and signage indeed the entrance range of the walthamstow stadium with its fabulous neon sign be grade ii list anyone can recommend building site monument designate landscape battlefield or indeed sign for inclusion on the national heritage list for england so long as they meet the eligibility requirement encourage people to do that hope the house will allow apology again for this to cast light on my department work on live heritage encourage neon crafter to make submission to the inventory of live heritage in the uk when we open the call for submission later this year follow our incorporation of the convention last year that be fantastic opportunity for the neon craft community to advocate for their craft raise awareness and be part of wide conversation on live heritage let also address another point that my hon friend make which be about sustainability she be right that some people have incorrectly express concern about energy use by neon when modern neon be far more efficient than its reputation suggest when maintain it outlast led be recyclable and in some case be even repairable on consumer transparency and the use of the term neon fully understand the concern that clear definition and protection could help prevent confusion for consumer and help preserve the value of handcrafted neon signage we have only to go online for two or three minute to find lot of different supposedly neon sign be advertise relatively cheaply which be no more neon than they fly in the air they be sometimes describe as lead neon sign which be contradiction in term fully take on board the point that my hon friend have make and thank she for bring this matter to our attention as we engage with department across whitehall on their trademark policy development this be not solely matter for the department for culture media and sport as say early protect neon be not about nostalgia it be about support livelihood unlock tourism and give our public space character at time when homogenisation threaten to reduce the character and unique identity of everything from our skyline to our high street the government hear the case be make for neon signage not as gimmick or an indulgence but as an essential flicker thread in the tapestry of british creativity we hear the concern from artist from heritage body and from community who want to see colour identity and local pride preserve we be commit to work with industry local government and the wide public to explore how good to secure the future of this unique form of creative expression on this we will not let the light go out as the greek bear american neon artist chryssa once say see times square with its light and letter and realize it be as beautiful and difficult to do as japanese calligraphy we should never let go of such artistry in our british tradition illuminate question put and agree to house adjourn
