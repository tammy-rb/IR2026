oral answers to questions treasury the chancellor of the exchequer be ask cost what discussion he have have with the secretary of state for transport on the cost of the chancellor launch the efficiency and saving review in the autumn statement to focus on the government priority and identify way in which to work more efficiently and help to manage budgetary pressure from high inflation the secretary of state for transport and discuss the cost of during the review which help to inform the decision to rephase certain part of the project as part of balance the nation book the travel between north and south be the bit of transport infrastructure that work it be the travel across the north that do not work what would the cost of have to reach for the government to conclude that it no long represent value for money for the taxpayer or be the government pursue the essentially socialist policy that they will keep pay for this ridiculous white elephant irrespective of the final bill take the precaution of research my hon friend interest in this subject and note that he be issue challenge on it year ago the government remain as they be then fully commit to deliver and the integrated rail plan this be long term investment that will bring our big city close to each other it will boost productivity and will provide low carbon alternative to car and plane for many decade to come as my hon friend know we be also work through the irp on billion package to improve inter regional rail connection which obviously affect his constituent do the minister agree that this country performance on productivity have be pitiful over the last year there have be virtually no improvement in productivity and one reason for that be our lack of investment in national infrastructure slow down be bad move when it come to improve our infrastructure and it be year since we agree to third runway at heathrow do the minister agree that if we be to improve our productivity we have to invest in infrastructure can agree with the hon gentleman that the investment of billion in infrastructure in all part of the country to which the government be committed be critical to ease the productivity challenge that have face successive government and the chancellor will introduce measure in the autumn statement to address it far cost have balloon since it be first conceive under the last labour government as my right hon friend have say owe to pressure from the treasury the project have have to be rephase and train will now go from west london not central london to station not in central birmingham which negate the benefit that the scheme proponent say it would bring with cost balloon still far we just can not afford it can we be sorry but do not agree with my hon friend certainly recognise that infrastructure investment of this scale and with this level of ambition be never easy to deliver have set out the change to the profile of the investment but all the key element be still on track and we will continue to work with the department for transport to ensure that that remain the case be the minister not also concerned about cost benefit analysis have not assumption behind the pattern of business travel demand be change dramatically by the pandemic work from home and video conferencing be the minister satisfied that the department for transport have properly re evaluated to take account of such change yes be content with that recognise those change in pattern of behaviour when it come to the use of public transport but we also face cost of living challenge that be why we be work so closely with the department for transport to for example continue investment in bus over the next two year and continue to spend million on cap fare to outside london we must bear in mind however that continue investment in transport infrastructure be key to great connectivity across the united kingdom and deal with the economic growth imperative it have be report over the last couple of day that accommodate will mean few train between the north and london one station affect be wilmslow in my constituency do the minister agree that be that to happen would no long be value for money or good for the north it would certainly take long and cost my constituent more be go to happen the question be what additional investment across other part of the rail infrastructure might benefit my right hon friend constituent additionally and more directly set out with the integrated rail plan the billion package to improve rail connection and many element of that will have direct impact on her constituent in cheshire as the minister be well aware north west leicestershire have suffer under the blight of for more than decade and the whole project have recently be declare to be undeliverable it have be unaffordable for some considerable time will he urge his colleague in government to cancel the remainder of the eastern leg and reallocate just small portion of that budget so that we can reopen the ivanhoe line recognise that the hon gentleman have strong view on this and know that he have be personally affect by it in the past the project although it have be rephase will continue there be number of issue involve in ensure tight management of that budget and be work closely with the department for transport to see that that happen climate change economic impact what assessment he have make with cabinet colleague of the potential impact of climate change on the economy what assessment he have make of the potential impact of climate change on the economy the treasury net zero review note that unmitigated climate change damage have be estimate to be the equivalent of lose between and of global gdp each year the cost of global inaction significantly outweigh the cost of action and mckinsey estimate that there be global market opportunity for british business worth trillion recent report from carbon tracker find huge disconnect between what scientist expect from climate change and what our financial system be prepare for with flawed economic modelling lead pension fund and other to seriously underestimate the risk meanwhile energy uk warn that we be lag behind on green energy investment surely the minister agree that to revive our economy and avert climate catastrophe we must rapidly phase out fossil fuel and invest in green new deal to reach net zero it be important to point out that we be the fast decarbonising economy in the since we have decarbonise by while grow our economy by but the hon lady be right this will take balanced approach involve both public spending and private investment include pension fund investment the recent pension fund reform for example should unlock some new asset for green infrastructure agree with the question about the carbon tracker report it have find that policy decision be be base on literature that be year old will the chancellor review the datum and the thinking that the government be use to make sure that all strand be in line with the climate science of the century the datum that look at show that last year of our electricity be generate from renewable that be an amazing achievement but we be alive and present when it come to decarbonise our economy we have great plan and we be build on our great track record we will continue to do that now welcome our new member steve tuckwell thank you mr speaker do my hon friend agree with my uxbridge and south ruislip constituent that mayor khan ultra low emission zone expansion hit family and business without any significant environmental benefit let welcome my hon friend to his place he have waste no time whatsoever in advocate for his constituent against labour tax that be hit household and business in his constituency and throughout the south east it be massive tax bombshell at time when family just do not need it it be simply not right and we would urge the leader of the opposition to tell his mayor of london to stop it the shadow chancellor have say that she will not rule out mandate the use of pension fund money for the pet scheme that the labour party think will achieve net zero put at risk the saving of many pensioner in this country what do my hon friend think the impact of that will be on the british economy pension fund have fiduciary responsibility to deliver financial return but also to be mindful of the value of their pensioner have every confidence that pension fund will continue to invest in line with the risk that be present by climate call the shadow minister this tory government effectively ban new onshore wind which be vital for net zero energy security and get bill down we now learn this could change because one fine group of tory rebel be shout louder than another group of tory rebel there be no leadership just government lead by their back benchers can we finally get an answer from the government on whether they will dither and delay or join labour in lead the way and act on onshore wind onshore wind have an important part to play and we be already deploy gw of energy from onshore wind the cost of onshore wind have come down significantly it be one of our cheap energy source the hon lady do not have long to wait for the energy bill which we be consider later today growth plan mortgage interest rates what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of the growth plan of september on mortgage interest rate over the course of high inflation from putin illegal invasion of ukraine see interest rate increase across most western economy the path to low rate be through low inflation which be why the prime minister make halve inflation one of our five priority for this year be pleased that the late bank of england forecast show that we be on track mortgage and associate rental cost be soar in putney roehampton and southfields and the government like to claim it be all due to global shock or the war in ukraine but the late bank of england datum from july show that the cost of lend to buy home remain high in the uk than in germany italy or france will the minister finally concede that this difference be because those country do not have the devastating growth plan or mini budget last year and that it be because of this government wide economic failure that my constituent face these cost be glad that the hon lady constituent among many other will benefit both from our mortgage interest support and from there be almost double the number of mortgage product on the market now than in october repeat the comment of my colleague the exchequer secretary to the treasury if the hon lady be so worried about her constituent what well way of help they with the cost of live than to do away with the mayor ulez tax in the uk homebuyer be overwhelmingly dependent on short term fix rate mortgage of just two three or five year which mean that in time of rise interest rate as we have at the moment they be hard hit by massively increase mortgage bill in most other country homebuyer have long term fix rate mortgage of or year or of the entire length of the mortgage do my hon friend agree that the regulator should ensure level playing field between short term and long term mortgage to give homebuyer free choice of the sort of mortgage they want so they can choose to have great protection against rate rise if they want my hon friend have great knowledge of these matter it be privilege to work with he and the sector on how we can offer consumer and homebuyer more choice that choice include the opportunity of long term fix rate mortgage and my official and continue to work on how we can reduce friction and barrier to those mortgage welcome darren jones the new shadow minister it be estimate that household will face rise in their mortgage bill this month if someone in random constituency say mid bedfordshire be to remortgage their house in the next six month they could pay an average of more per month compare with before the disastrous tory mini budget this time last year what can the chancellor and his team do to reassure the country that if the conservatives be to win the next election they would not just mess up the economy all over again be sure the constituent of mid bedfordshire will be very pleased to know that more than of mortgage provider have sign up to our mortgage charter which offer the opportunity for relief to term out mortgage and to have interest free period if they face adversity at this time when interest rate be high across the world what will not help the constituent of mid bedfordshire be unfunded spending promise that we know will push up the cost of borrowing and defer the point at which inflation fall that be bit rich from the government and it be no answer whatsoever to the people of mid bedfordshire who will not be able to afford to pay their bill over the come month it be one year ago today that the former tory prime minister take huge ideological gamble and sabotage britain economy they crash the pound put pension in peril and explode tory mortgage bombshell under the home of million of work people will the minister take this opportunity to apologise to the british people on behalf of the conservative party for wreck their hope and aspiration welcome the hon gentleman to his position he have have feisty morning read his walworth road brief let offer he the opportunity to correct the record because labour have spend the past month talk down our economy but it be now large than it be when we enter covid and it have recover and grow fast than the economy of both france and germany brexit economic impact what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of withdrawal from the eu on the economy what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of withdrawal from the eu on the economy what recent assessment he have make of the potential impact of withdrawal from the eu on the economy good morning mr speaker brexit be choice make by the british people and it remain big opportunity for the economy rather than relitigate that debate this government be commit to embrace those opportunity prior to the eu referendum the bank of england warn that brexit would seriously damage the uk economy weaken the pound and cause inflation the government have now delay import check on animal and food product for the fifth time because the cost would add to inflation do that mean the chancellor finally accept that brexit be contribute to the uk cost of living crisis no but of course we be sensitive about the timing of introduce those change because of cost of living pressure be sad to have see since we last meet in the house the hon lady announce that she be step down we have much in common on patient safety on the nhs she will know that because of brexit an extra billion be be direct to public service every year include the nhs and include in scotland adam posen former member of the monetary policy committee have describe brexit as trade war by the uk on itself this unnecessary trade war have have real impact on small business in my constituency such as guild antiques restoration which have find that its order from the eu have fall off cliff edge and its cost have increase scotland do not choose brexit and we be all bad off as result what can the chancellor do to fill the economic gap his hard brexit have cause there be certain irony in the scottish national party oppose brexit at the same time as advocate far more draconian separation for scotland include new currency and border check on business in scotland as part of the uk scotland be now an independent coastal state for the first time in nearly half century the people in scotland who work in financial service be benefit from the brexit freedom in the edinburgh reform and there be extra support for scottish pub because for the first time we have low beer duty relative to supermarket it be not just brexit trade barrier have devastating impact on scotland economy because the loss of freedom of movement have hugely damage our business ability to recruit staff many business have have to reduce their offer cut their opening hour or close altogether it be estimate that over the bank holiday uk pub alone lose out on million because of staff shortage do the chancellor accept that small business such as those can not keep pick up the tab for his government disastrous brexit what be he do to solve these staff recruitment problem may gently say to the hon lady that this country have actually grow fast than france or germany since we leave the single market this be bit of smokescreen for the snp economic policy which have lead to more people out of work and few people in work in scotland than in england leave the eu give we the opportunity to modernise our regulation and adapt they to local and national domestic interest but we will seize the benefit of do that only if we deliver on regulatory reform so will my right hon friend drive that across department so that we can increase prosperity and raise living standard as result no one know more about regulatory reform than my right hon friend who write an excellent booklet on it we look at that booklet ahead of every fiscal event be it autumn statement or budget hope that she notice in the budget big reform to our medicine regulation we will continue to learn from the thing she advocate for generation britain world leadership on financial service and financial market have be key part of our economy agree that the post brexit initiative such as the edinburgh review have make excellent stride on make sure that we keep that world leadership may encourage my right hon friend to look at the report from uk finance on the tokenisation of market as be the world leader in that innovative area would reduce cost for investor enable money to flow into less liquid asset and fundamentally unlock future growth thank my right hon friend for her question thank to the excellent work of the economic secretary to the treasury we have repeal eu rule and regulation in the financial service sector and we will look very closely at the opportunity when it come to tokenisation call the shadow economic secretary to the treasury last week the government admit that their plan introduction of food import check from the eu would lead to an increase in inflation hit the pocket of ordinary people during the bad cost of live crisis in our lifetime in the labour party we believe that bespoke veterinary agreement would cut red tape from business and avoid push cost on to ordinary people be the government plan to negotiate veterinary agreement and if not why not gently say to the hon lady who have lot of time for that the last thing business want be the upheaval of huge renegotiation of our trading arrangement with the eu which be the large tariff free free trade deal by volume in the world welcome the scottish national party spokesperson to his place thank you mr speaker the chancellor claim that it be success that inflation in the uk have rise higher and remain more stubbornly so than in the eu adam posen formerly of the bank of england have underline that up to of the uk additional inflation woe can be lay at the door of brexit something the tories and labour be unite on all the while food price inflation be crush household budget so why have this government do nothing why have this government learn nothing from country such as france which have work with food supplier to keep food price cap to help those most in need welcome the hon gentleman to his position his constituency predecessor serve as minister in the treasury whatever greatness the hon gentleman go on to be sure he will not sully himself with that role when it come to inflation we have high level of import food like germany high level of import gas like italy and low unemployment like the united states these factor have come together to give we the inflation rate we have when it come to growth the hon gentleman will have note last week number which show that we have recover well from the pandemic than france italy or germany and we be do extremely well despite all the pressure we face notice that the chancellor do not say anything about food inflation hurt family well tory and labour little britain attitude do not stop at food price inaction energy cost be key driver of inflation and cost for family energy bill be too high the spanish have take bold step by cut vat and introduce social tariff to help their people this government plan to do nothing for this winter which be particularly gall for people in scotland who will continue to pay more for their energy than elsewhere in the uk will the chancellor act on our demand for energy price grant to be introduce this winter let tell the hon gentleman what we be do for his constituent and indeed all the people of scotland around of support for the average family up and down the country include in scotland pay half people energy bill on average and huge amount of support through the benefit system nearly billion of support show

the nhs none the less do recognise the challenge that post covid nhs face in term of the legacy of demand that be yet unmet we be continue to work to bring down waiting list and we have see significant progress recently particularly with two year and month list key part of improve the public health and wellbeing of my local resident in kettering be the redevelopment of kettering general hospital can the chief secretary to the treasury confirm that the million plus redevelopment of kgh remain on track for completion by and that the standardisation of the design of the new hospital will help to reduce cost and increase deliverability kettering general hospital be always at the top of my mind when come to treasury question but the big challenge as my hon friend rightly point out be how we ensure the efficiency of the expenditure of every pound of taxpayer investment in the health estate shall continue to work with the secretary of state on that plan for the hospital to make sure that we achieve that in the many discussion that the minister say he have have with the secretary of state for health and social care what figure do they discuss with he that he estimate inflation will be at in the next financial year there be range of forecast but we have to deal with the reality be try to ensure that across all of the decision that secretary of state make we reprioritise effectively and deliver frontline service but do not have number for the hon gentleman this afternoon people in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke find that mental health be huge barrier to get back into work and obviously help to produce economic growth that be something that the chancellor be report to have be consider carefully over the summer recess my friend james starkie

much enjoy my visit to south yorkshire to open that investment zone it be incredibly impressive what be happen there and it be wonderful to welcome new investment by boeing as part of that the hon

sheffield be play such key role be present on the day the chancellor come to launch the investment zone in my constituency and of course too welcome the investment into boeing there do he accept that one of the other area for future development in the investment zone be small modular reactor consortium be be develop in sheffield with sheffield forgemasters rolls royce and ge hitachi nuclear energy

discuss debanking and lawful freedom of expression and they have commit to comply with the change publish on july in parallel the financial conduct authority be conduct an urgent review of debanke practice which will report back to the chancellor in the next couple of week last week the met police chief finally seem to confirm that the job of the police should be to police and not to seek to align themselves with entity or ideology do the minister agree with that bank and the corporate world should follow that example and focus their effort on their core business rather than play the sinister cancel agenda of the woke brigade that see nigel farage have his account wrongfully close my hon friend represent the view of his constituent in this place clearly he be quite right although they be private entity bank benefit from privileged place in society and they should focus on do their core function brilliantly treat customer fairly and make sustainable return for shareholder rather than take side on politically contentious matter today it be because some people may have different political view tomorrow it could be the fact that someone have different religious viewpoint be christian and as chair of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief stand up for those with christian belief those with other belief and those with no belief because believe sincerely that they have right to have that belief if ever the day come when bank censure anybody because they have different religious belief would stand up against that do the minister agree let be clear yes the government agree with that no one should be debar from access to banking facility in our society because of lawfully express view if he and other hon member wish to make representation the financial conduct authority be currently conduct review of this matter plastic packaging tax what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the plastic packaging tax in april this year the government announce that we would conduct formal review of the plastic packaging tax through analysis of environmental and tax datum and customer research to assess the impact of the measure more information about the evaluation will be publish later this year be pleased to share that business in my eastbourne constituency have make many important change in the way it operate in order to meet its own environmental ambition but when it come to the transportation of food and pharmaceutical product industry standard link to public health regulation require such product to be transport in sterile packaging which necessitate the use of virgin plastic and bring the container that the business produce into scope for the plastic packaging tax be there new direction can share with that business or will ongoing policy review look at such case the aim of the plastic packaging tax be to provide clear incentive for business to use more recycled plastic in packaging follow extensive consultation we look at range of possible exemption and decide to limit those exemption because we want to encourage innovation in the industry put simply the more exemption the less innovation however all taxis remain of course under review proactive approach to circular economy could create hundred of thousand of job and cut our consumption emission what circular taxation measure be the treasury look at to help we achieve those outcome we be clear that we want all taxis relate to the environment to have an impact the plastic packaging tax for example will clearly have an impact on the amount of recycling that take place and on the amount put into landfill those be all thing that we assess as part of evaluation and the plastic packaging tax will be evaluate this year pension scheme uk investment incentives what step his department be take to incentivise pension scheme to invest in the uk at mansion house the government present series of pension reform that will increase return for saver and enable the financial sector to unlock capital for some of the uk most promising industry the department continue work to build on the initial package of measure and will set out further detail in the autumn thank the minister for his answer and welcome those measure have the government consider what more can be do to unlock surplus in define benefit scheme to allow employer to use that money more effectively rather than have it end up go into insurance company on buy out there be huge tax penalty on unlock surplus be there way of relieve that to encourage the money to be invest more efficiently my hon friend make an important point with the right precaution it be right that we look at that to incentivise employer to deliver the high return for pension saver the government have to date take billion from the mineworker pension scheme the then cross party business energy and industrial strategy committee conclude that the government should not be profit from mineworker pension how do the secretary of state justify their continue profiteer be not familiar with the issue that the hon lady speak about would be very happy to meet she to understand it in more detail pub tax system what step his department be take to help support pub through the tax system we be ensure that pub remain key part of our local community by provide support through the alcohol duty and business rate system that include new draught relief that provide significant duty discount on alcohol sell on draught in pub and the expand retail hospitality and leisure relief mean more than in relief for the average independent pub after busy summer knock around south ribble and speak to people have often pop in for pint include in croston famous wheatsheaf pub from housing mp surgery as many pub do to be our community living room pub be absolutely vital have speak to landlord include those at the black bull and the fabulous fleece inn in penwortham get they all in there be pub crawl there for we all they need our support so may invite the minister to south ribble will even offer to buy she pint to speak to chris the landlord at longton fabulous golden ball to hear about his business as you know mr speaker regard lancashire as my home and it would be delight to return to south ribble my hon friend have name just few of the roughly pub in england and wales perhaps if we have give she long she would have be able to name they all all those pub will benefit from the brexit pub guarantee which mean that the duty on pint sell in pub will always be low than in supermarket let we see if the minister be go to get another pint call tim farron follow the question from my dad mp confess that have be to all the pub that the hon member for south ribble katherine fletcher mention the big burden on pub in the lake and the dale be the fact that they can not find any staff or sufficient staff it be crisis that affect the entire hospitality sector of which say that the recruitment of staff be major problem for they the solution will include more affordable home for worker more intelligent visa rule and fund new training and skill initiative will the minister meet and representative of the hospitality industry to look at bespoke package to solve the workforce crisis in the lake and the dale would go far and give as an example the truly transformational programme that the chancellor set out at the spring budget to transform childcare policy in this country we know that childcare responsibility hold back many people from enter the workforce and it be through policy such as this as well as the work be lead by the secretary of state for work and pensions to help people back into the workforce that will help pub in the hon gentleman constituency and across the country topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility on friday the office for national statistics publish an update to the uk

defining image of year of conservative government classroom prop up to stop the ceiling from fall in capital budget have halve in real term since with warning ignore and repair programme slash do this conservative government take any responsibility for any of this let start by reassure the right hon lady that the vast majority of pupil in the school affect be at school normally and we be act fast to minimise the impact on the rest let answer the more general question that the right hon lady raise yes we make cut in spending in because as she know well the last labour government leave this country with an economic crisis despite that crisis the department for education budget have go up by in real term and overall capital spend order this be topical all your colleague on both side of the house want to get in topical be mean to be very short not full debate between both side say to everybody think about other think we can move on call rachel reeves will repeat capital budget have

and television life science and technology and the opportunity be great with conservative government this week school have fail to reopen due to the threat of collapse worryingly the danger do not end there because of school and public building be estimate to contain asbestos which be describe by mesothelioma uk as silent killer will the chancellor stop ignore his own department and commit to provide the necessary funding so that our child can be prevent from be teach in crumble asbestos ride deathtrap do not accept that characterisation at all do understand the impact of mesothelioma as my father die of it but this government have invest billion to keep school safe since and the chancellor have set out other figure as well some million call go unanswered at his majesty revenue and customs last year of those who do get through two third have to wait more than minute meanwhile four out of five hmrc staff be work from home what be be do to improve the appalling level of customer

important while energy price be high wholesale gas price have now come down as the minister know free access to cash be vital lifeline for many people include some of the most vulnerable in all our constituency can he confirm what step he be take to ensure that free access be protect and continue to be available across the country particularly in north warwickshire and bedworth during the summer we announce that we have give direction to the financial conduct authority in respect of access to cash it should be no more than mile in an urban area and no more than mile in my hon friend rural constituency of north warwickshire that be the first time that the statutory right of access to cash have exist in law prison officer tell that they be at break point key source of despair and anger be their pension age of which we should all agree be far too late as the treasury lead on public sector pension scheme policy will the chancellor allow the ministry of justice to restart negotiation to resolve this grossly unfair and dangerous situation have not hear that matter raise before but be very happy to take it back and correspond with the hon lady on it obviously we have take advice on the state pension age and have make clear our policy previously but be happy to look at any specific case she raise can ask my right hon friend when fiscal review of all offshore energy activity will be carry out to ensure that we be maximise investment opportunity in critical energy infrastructure such as offshore wind carbon capture and storage and hydrogen as well as while we still need it domestic oil and gas my hon friend be absolutely right to raise that issue actually have breakfast with clean energy industry representative this morning to discuss their concern there be huge amount of potential investment and he be right to say that maximise the use of our own oil and gas reserve during transition be vital part of our energy security policy will the chancellor consider introduce windfall tax on bank excess profit the profit of the big four bank for the first half of this year be up compare with yet the bank of england be forecast to pay out as much as billion in interest on reserve to bank in at the same time as the government have cut the level of surcharge on bank profit by with million of british job dependent on financial service include an estimate job in brighton and hove hope the hon lady will join in celebrate sustainably profitable financial sector it be only that that give we the ability to invest in skill and technology call the chair of the treasury committee will the economic secretary update the house on the progress he be make to enable our constituent to access personalised financial guidance if they be among the of our constituent who can not afford regulated financial advice my hon friend the chair of the treasury committee make really important point about what be call the advice gap treasury official the fca and be consult on that and will publish an update this autumn it have be reveal that integrated debt services company set up by the uk government to recover personal debt see its profit increase by staggering last year do minister think it be right that this company should be able to profit to that extent out of the misery of the cost of living crisis the hon gentleman be refer to company that work with the government crown commercial service and that work on debt across central government it have to operate within very specific framework and indeed it be regulate by the financial conduct authority very much understand the point he have raise and will be make inquiry on that point myself research and development tax credit be vital to help business grow and invest but have receive large number of complaint from business across essex say that they be face complexity and delay in processing claim with hmrc may please ask the minister to meet and some of these business to work through the delay and ensure that these business can continue to thrive and grow because they be vital to our economic growth would be delighted to meet my right hon friend and those business in fact the uk be lead world economy with our focus on life science and on tech in that little golden triangle between oxford cambridge and london we have more tech business than anywhere else on the planet other than new york and silicon valley hear the cheer opposite so keen be labour member to support british business but would be delighted to meet she and to underline the support that this government give to such important business welcome the new focus on engage pension fund with productive investment after many year when regulation have push the fund into government gilt instead but do the minister have proposal specifically to secure those investment for uk business rather than their go overseas the right hon member make significant contribution to the debate about the nation pension fund our objective to increase investment to drive increase return for pension saver but also to benefit the wide economy stop short of mandate there be philosophical difference between this side of the house and the opposition we do not believe it be right for the chancellor to tell pension fund where to invest but it be our job to knock down barrier friction and impedance to pension fund invest in brilliant british company the economic secretary tell my hon friend the member for north warwickshire craig tracey that he be go to underwrite the statutory right of access to cash but bank branch will have close by the end of the year leave only in place and atm have close in the last five year how be he go to make sure that this actually happen rather than it just be an empty promise the fca have significant sanction in respect of the closure of atm that would leave community without the right of free access to cash on the closure of bank branch we be see significant change and hope my right hon friend would respect the fact that technology be change and consumer pattern be change during the recess have the privilege of visit the excellent community banking hub in brixham which think be brilliant opportunity there should be more than on their way and that be my objective do the chancellor accept that many people see income tax rate at the moment as exceptionally punitive and do he also accept that there be need to move as quickly as possible into growth base economy and to supercharge our economy in the united kingdom as conservative want to bring taxis down as soon as we can afford to do so and be very proud that for the first time ever people can earn month without pay penny of tax or national insurance as we want to expand our financial service industry not only in this country but abroad we need to build confidence among consumer that the right thing to do be invest do my hon friend therefore agree that it be vital that regulator respond to and deal with complaint to they and actually impose sanction against those who breach the regulation yes agree with my hon friend on this matter it be one reason why we have beef up the role of the financial regulator review commissioner and we will also be require the regulator to publish regular operating metric on their performance to give consumer the trust they need back in both the treasury and the financial conduct authority know there be problem with the prepaid funeral plan market since then my constituent gary godwin of nantyglo lose over to the collapse of company call safe hands across the uk thousand more have lose million of pound altogether will the minister please meet to discuss this scandal and mr godwin case yes will be very happy to meet the hon gentleman what happen with safe hands be scandal and that be why we have enlarge the regulatory perimeter to bring those who seek to sell funeral plan within the regulatory conduct over the summer port have be bid to the government infrastructure fund to help they get ready for the delivery of the new float offshore wind industry may encourage ministers to look favourably on the bid from the celtic sea port of milford haven and port talbot because those two port be key to unlock the enormous economic benefit of this new clean energy industry be absolutely happy to do that and agree with my right hon friend about the enormous potential of those area some gp practice be at risk of be price out of city centre include in place like st albans because of outdated treasury rule that prevent integrate care board from spend the money they want to on gp practice location health ministers have confirm to that their official be happy to work with treasury official may ask for personal assurance from treasury ministers that they will encourage their official to look at this and resolve it by the end of this year at the absolute late dialogue be ongoing on this matter and can confirm that we will continue to work on this in the come week andy haldane the former bank of england chief economist recently say in sky news interview that the bank of england keep on print money for long than it need to it be clear that central bank across the world have be addict to cheap money and that this have contribute to inflation across the world do the chancellor agree that print cheap and easy money have not be without consequence and instead our monetary policy must focus on important growth factor such as productivity agree with what my hon friend say the bank of england itself have say there be problem with its inflation forecasting it be learn the lesson from that and we must support it every step of the way as it bring down inflation sorry be late today mr speaker british airways cancel my flight when the chancellor predecessor now the prime minister be chancellor there be huge fraud in the bounce back loan have he get any of that money back yet we be always ferociously determined to recover money obtain through fraud but because of those bounce back loan we have the fast recovery of any major european country have recently be contact by several self employ constituent express concern about heavy fine be impose for file tax return late even though no money be owe will the treasury meet with view perhaps to review this policy will of course be happy to meet my hon friend hope he understand that can not intervene personally in any case but will of course look at the general principle he set out and see whether there be systemic issue here nutrient neutrality levelling up and regeneration bill urgent question to ask the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities if they will make statement on the government decision to use the levelling up and regeneration bill to scrap environmental protection on nutrient neutrality the secretary of state for levelling up table write ministerial statement yesterday on the government plan but be happy to provide an update to the house in propose these amendment we be respond to call from local order may just say that it be very good of you to offer to give that update decide that it be an urgent question expect ministers to come to the house as do not think write ministerial statement be the way to inform the house be delighted to be here to answer this urgent question in propose the amendment we be respond to call from local council which want the government to take action to allow they to deliver the home their community need at present legacy eu law on nutrient neutrality be block the delivery of new home include in case where planning permission have already be grant this have affect home building of all type whether that be the redevelopment of empty space above high street shop affordable housing scheme new care home or family build their own home the block on building be hamper local economy and threaten to put small and medium sized local builder out of business nutrient enter our river be real problem but the contribution make by new home be very small compare with that of other source such as agriculture industry and our exist housing stock and the judgment be that nutrient neutrality have so far do little to improve water quality we be already take action across government to mandate water company to improve their waste water treatment work to the high technically achievable limit those provision alone will more than offset the nutrient expect from new housing development but we need to go far fast that be why as well as propose target amendment to the habitat regulation the government be commit to package of environmental measure central to that be million of funding to natural england to deliver strategic mitigation sufficient to offset the very small amount of additional nutrient discharge attributable to up to home between now and we have also announce more than million for slurry management and agricultural innovation in nutrient management and commitment to accelerate protect site strategy in the most affected catchment in our overall approach there will be no loss of environmental outcome and we be confident that our package of measure will improve the environment nutrient neutrality be only ever an interim solution with funding in place and by put these site on trajectory to recovery we feel confident in make this legislative intervention find it extraordinary that the minister can stand there and make that statement with straight face over the past eight year ministers have stand at that dispatch box and promise time and again that leave the european union would not lead to weakening of environmental standard those of we who raise our concern have repeatedly be tell that we be scaremongere as recently as june the solicitor general say in relation to the retained eu law revocation and reform bill that we will not lower environmental protection official report june vol yet here we have it proposal to unpick the habitat directive and to disapply the nutrient neutrality rule that protect our precious river and sensitive ecosystem the office for environmental protection have itself make clear that the proposal would demonstrably reduce the level of environmental protection provide for in exist environmental law they be regression underline that point to the hon member for redcar jacob young who be chuntere from his seat on the front bench the proposal go directly against the polluter pay principle by force the taxpayer rather than house builder to foot the bill for mitigate increase water pollution from house building in environmentally sensitive area what be particularly infuriate be that as the name suggest the nutrient neutrality rule be not even about improve our environment but simply about try to prevent pollution from get bad let ask the minister some important question on transparency will the government follow the oep call for they to make statement as require by section of the environment act admit that they can no long say that the levelling up and regeneration bill would not reduce environmental protection in law will the minister explain how the government will meet their objective for water quality and protect site condition when they be at the same time weaken environmental law what advice do ministers receive from natural england before the amendment be table will she explain why there have there be complete lack of consultation with environment group will she also explain what consultation there be with house builder whom member will have notice be cock hoop about the announcement and the subsequent boost to their share price will the minister admit that it be false choice to pit house building against environmental protection when there be successful project under way to address nutrient pollution will the government provide evidence for their unsubstantiated claim that home be be delay as consequence of these rule will she recognise that money which can easily be take away at later stage be not the same as legal requirement to stop pollution get into our river thank the hon lady for her long list of question be happy to respond to all of they in detail on our approach stand by what and the government have say we stand by our pledge to the environment and we do not accept that as she state we will weaken our commitment to the environment at all it be important to consider what we be talk about here which be unblock home that add very little in term of pollution to be clear our approach mean that there will be no overall loss in environmental outcome not only do the measure that we be take address the very small amount of nutrient run off from new housing but at the same time we be invest in the improvement of environmental outcome we do not agree that this be regression on environmental standard we be take direct action to continue to protect the environment and ensure that housing can be bring forward in area where people need it the hon lady ask about engagement minister across government the secretary of state and have have numerous meeting with all party involve and we have have meeting with environment group as part of government business it be worth the house note the significant enforcement step take on the water company by colleague at the department for environment food and rural affairs since the environment agency have conclude prosecution against water and sewerage company secure million in fine the regulator have recently launch the large criminal and civil investigation into water company sewage we be take action against water company to protect our river leave the environment in well state than we find it and build the affordable house that the country so desperately need include in her constituency the minister will recognise that and many other colleague on the government side of the house share the admirable objective of the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas in ensure that the water quality of our river improve year by year under the government and their successor the minister proposal to amend the levelling up and regeneration bill be not about damage the status of our river as understand it they be about deal with particular and specific interpretation of the eu habitat directive by the european court of justice in connection with case in holland prior to the time we leave the eu if that be the case she have refer to the litigation and measure she have undertake do she agree that in special area of conservation such as the river clun catchment in my constituency where no planning consent have be grant for nine year these measure will help to unlock that while preserve the quality of the river in the catchment you have take long than the person who ask the question thank my right hon friend very much he be right in his observation that this have be judgment impose on the united kingdom after we leave the european union this be not long stand convention in any shape or form he be also right to highlight the measure we be put in place to protect our river and the environment more broadly we be also put in place substantial package to help farmer to farm more sustainability manage their slurry infrastructure more effectively and be able to drive the circular economy in farming that we all want he mention specific catchment in his area we have commit to bring forward wye catchment plan shortly which hope will address the issue he be refer to call clive betts interruption be happy to go but the shadow minister oh sorry it have take so long think we must have move on to back benchers call the shadow minister thank you mr speaker as result of the government failure over many year to make decisive progress in tackle the main source of problem nutrient namely farming and waste water treatment work the requirement for nutrient neutrality in sensitive river catchment present challenge to secure planning permission for new housing development it be therefore right in labour view that the operation of the rule around nutrient neutrality be review with view to address problematic delay and increase the pace at which home can be deliver in these area however we have serious concern about the approach that the government have decide on not only do it involve disapplye the conservation of habitats and species regulations but it do not legally secure the additional funding pledge to deliver nutrient management programme and do not provide for legal mechanism to ensure that housing developer contribute towards mitigation put the following question to the minister what advice do the government receive from natural england about potential reform of the law around nutrient neutrality do it offer view on the government propose approach give the amount of mitigation currently available in the pipeline which be estimate at allow for approximately home do the government consider an approach base on the habitat regulation assessment derogation and revise credit mitigation system to front load permission and provide for future compensatory scheme if so why do they dismiss that option what assessment have the government make of the impact of their propose approach on the nascent market in mitigation credit and investor confidence in nature market more generally why on earth do minister believe developer will voluntarily contribute to mitigation under the propose approach finally the government claim their approach will see planning permission expedite between now and give that house building activity be fall sharply and the pipeline for future development be be squeeze not least as result of housing and planning policy decision make by this conservative government what assessment have the department make of the number of permission that its disruptive approach will unlock within the first month of its operation thank the hon gentleman for his question and remark take they to mean that he will support the measure when they come before the house be delighted to hear his support for our sensible practical and pragmatic approach to unblock much need housing across the country he ask about our engagement with natural england we have have detailed discussion he ask about the current legal framework we have look at and discuss number of option to make the change and we be take what we believe be the right approach to unblock planning permission more quickly than the current situation allow the hon gentleman refer to nature market he be right to highlight the groundbreaking work we be do across that piece we be continue with our commitment to those nature market which be very important part of the government plan to keep our environment protect it and leave it in well state than we find it that be what the conservative government have always be commit to and continue to be the hon gentleman be right to say that we have speak to developer who of course support our objective we have very constructive dialogue with the developer who be happy to contribute we will have those discussion with industry as be sure he have hear from developer because know he have speak to they all we be on the side of those builder it be important to say that the developer most affect by the disproportionate ruling from the european court of justice be not the big developer but the small and medium sized enterprise the small builder some of which have go bust it be right that we stand behind they warmly congratulate the government on take action on this very serious issue welcome sincerely the remark from the opposition spokesperson offer qualified support for what be be do we have an issue whereby home span council area be be block those home have planning permission already grant but can not be build because of the perverse legacy ruling more to the point could my hon friend confirm that there be no environmental impact because we be double investment in the nutrient mitigation scheme that be as well as develop protect site strategy for those catchment area affect most severely by the nutrients issue which overwhelmingly be not cause by new housing do she agree that the real challenge should be lay down to the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas on what she would say to all the hundred of thousand of young family out there who can not buy home in the place they need and want at price they can afford my right hon friend have considerable expertise in this matter he be right to focus on the mechanism we need to bring forward to enable the much need planning permission to take effect his region in particular be affect by this issue and know his constituent and people across the region will be desperate to see those home build to allow people step on the property ladder we be about build property own democracy my right hon friend be also right to say that we can do that at the same time as protect the environment which be why we have double the funding for natural england nutrient mitigation scheme we be invest million in slurry management infrastructure and we be help farmer with million sustainable package to help they invest in innovative farming technique to manage their nutrient more sustainably which can be of benefit to their farm and agricultural process we be go much far on those protect site so that we deal with the problem at source that be what we need to focus on call the chair of the levelling up housing and communities committee this be hardly new problem be it the court decision be in yet last year we have the levelling up bill which be really planning bill with bit of level up add on no mention of the issue there in december we have major consultation on change to the national planning policy framework no mention of the issue there the committee write to the minister and ask how many more consultation on planning issue there would be this year we be give nine of they no mention of the issue there if it be such serious issue why have it take the government so long to act it look like the government be make it up as they go along this be panicked response from the government to the collapse number of housing start which the minister simply want to do something anything about very much value the hon gentleman scrutiny of the government record and very much enjoy come before his committee we have discuss this issue and many other with his committee in the past it be right that we be take this action it be serious and complex issue and we need time to consider all the legal aspect of it however what come back to time and time again be that we need to unblock planning permission we need housing all over the country we be do that at the same time as protect the environment and very much hope to have further dialogue with he about this in the future it be always baffle to hear those who believe in environmental improvement say that only the eu way work do the minister agree with that outside the eu we have be able to adapt our law to what work for this country and also make improvement such as marine protect area and provide support to agriculture outside the common agricultural policy to say that leave the eu have mean degradation in our approach to the environment be simply nonsense my right hon friend speak from vast experience on this issue can do no more than agree strongly with every word leave the eu allow we to make the law that be right for our country most specifically in the area of build the home we need across his area and across the whole country the point here be also that the eu legacy judgment have not improve the quality of the water that be why we be take further step to mitigate the problem at source everybody who care about the quality of water should welcome that the uk be one of the most nature deplete country in the world the government have just set up the office for environmental protection be on the environment bill committee when we do that which say that this planning change be regression in environmental protection we should not just throw out the rule when they be bit difficult what advice do the government receive from natural england the minister say she speak with it on its approach to problem nutrient do natural england green light the proposal or be it be ignore along with the office for environmental protection natural england be government partner we work very closely with it as well as with local planning authority we rely on natural england to carry out some of the mitigation scheme the nutrient credit scheme and many other in response to the office for environmental protection we have different view the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs my right hon friend the member for suffolk coastal dr coffey set out very clearly her response to the office for environmental protection we do not agree with it fundamentally we do not agree that this be regression in environmental outcome overall it be perfectly possible to make housing development nitrate neutral in the first place bearwood development in my constituency contain over new house and be nitrate neutral through sustainable drainage and building technique so we can have new home without compromise our environment and without take good quality farm land out for mitigation will my hon friend ensure that planning law match that ambition thank my hon friend very much she be right to focus on some of the very good work that be already take place through some individual project be aware be be bring forward she be also right to highlight the role that sustainable drainage can take and we have commit to look at that more broadly to see what more can be do with that particular policy planning law be very clear it have to leave the environment in well state than it find it not only in her area but across the country of course we need more housing but in my constituency the sewer be over capacity victorian and clap out invite the minister to meet some of the household where in time of heavy rain raw sewage not only pollute the environment but float around the street the garden and even the kitchen it be simply not acceptable to imagine we can somehow wave wand to solve the housing problem finally may draw the attention of the house to an excellent website call top of the poops which state that in my constituency there be hour of sewage last year alone that be completely unacceptable defra ministers have be at this dispatch box multiple time to update colleague on the work that the government be proud to do as part of the plan for water this be the most ambitious and stringent package that have be bring forward to tackle this abhorrent issue we agree with the hon gentleman that storm overflow and sewage overflow be wrong that be why the billion of new accelerated investment will be direct into vital infrastructure we be clear that the volume of sewage discharge into our water be unacceptable and that be why we have take action in term of strong regulation more fine and tough enforcement across the board to tackle every source of river and sea pollution as the minister know the level of somerset be some of the most environmentally enhance area in the uk natural england have destroy chance for development we be about to start build the tata factory the large factory that this country have see for long time that need to be sort and would like the minister thought conversely the reality also slip south west water which be an abomination have just announce it will stop pollutant from hectare by can we please have grip on the reality of both side of this issue if we do not nothing will be develop in part that be environmentally sensitive be aware that my hon friend represent an area with acute environmental sensitivity and he be right to raise those concern on the floor of the house we work across government not only to tackle the storm overflow issue to which he refer but to find way to allow house building and other type of building that be much need to drive job and investment and to support business in his constituency without that have weakening effect on our environment wonder if could pick up on something the minister say moment ago natural england be not government partner it be government agency so far as this issue be concern it be literally the government this rule have exist since and the government guidance on it have indeed get in the way of genuinely affordable environmentally sustainable housing scheme in the lake district and be sure elsewhere the answer be not to scrap it but to change the guidance to make it more intelligent so that we protect our waterway and our landscape from pollution without prevent vital development why do the government spend four year dither before panic overreact and then act in line with their own nature by damage british nature the hon gentleman make his point in his usual way but without confront the reality of the situation that affect his constituent of course natural england be government partner and government body we work in partnership with natural england we work constructively with it to tackle these complex legal issue be sure he would be the first to jump up and complain if we take action too quickly without consider the consequence as it be what we be do be sensible proportionate measure to allow much need development in the lake district home for his constituent that have the planning permission to be build finally labour run kirklees council be sit on million of pound of unspent section developer contribution for local infrastructure much of that unspent cash be for environmental project what confidence should we in my area have that our shambolic labour run kirklees council will be able to deliver these mitigation environmental project when it be actually not deliver for our local environment as it be my hon friend be completely right to raise the record in his word the shambolic record of his local labour run council what can say to reassure he and other colleague be that have engage with local authority leader to explain to they exactly what this change mean for they what we expect they to do and what they should be do on behalf of their resident to make sure the money be spend properly to protect the river sea and lake and get house build be it not the case that the only one block the development of the house that we need include genuinely affordable social housing pitiful number be build last year think it be just over be those on the government benches it be the tory government who be the blocker of housing development to meet housing need that be the case be it not minister it might sound very nice on the hon gentleman facebook clip but if he actually look at the fact he will find it be conservative run council that have on the whole deliver more house over the last few year in respond to the need of their constituent and labour run council that be experience significant failure in deliver the house that their resident need the minister have lift blight from my constituency but as result of these measure we be all go to be swim in clean water as well be we we be and look forward to join my right hon friend in swim in some clean water very soon the minister rightly say that too many house building company be go bust but may gently suggest that that be consequence of the government crash the economy last year inflation push up the cost of material and skill shortage the government claim that their approach will see permission expedite between now and but give this context what be that assessment actually base on and have the minister consult local authority yes we have consult local authority and make no apology for stand up and take action when it be need to help small builder in particular the diversity of the sector in this country unlike that in other country be disproportionately skew towards large developer and it be therefore right for we as conservative government to back small business we understand what people go through to start business which be why we be take action to help they welcome the government balanced approach which will improve the long term quality of the river stour in my constituency while allow much need planning permission for new home to start again thousand of people very sensibly want to live in ashford and they want to see new home build not least in accordance with the local plan rather than be build opportunistically around the place which be what the delay in permission have lead to can the minister give we some indication of timescale and when council such as ashford can start grant planning permission again my right hon friend be entirely correct and thank he for his support we need to wait for the levelling up and regeneration bill to achieve royal assent it must of course undergo parliamentary scrutiny in both houses but we be work apace we have already start that engagement with local authority and partner natural england and other to ensure that they have all the operational detail that they need what we need to see be spade in the ground as soon as possible it be clear from the minister reply that her statutory adviser natural england oppose this move so will she please publish its advice instead of let developer and water company off the hook and pour even more sewage into our waterway why do she not take the advice of her right hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke and reverse the prime minister disastrous decision to scrap local housing target which have give nimby council carte blanche to do nothing what take issue with in the right hon gentleman question plural be his comment that we scrap housing target we have do no such thing we be commit to build million home during this parliament and we have the target of build home every year that be very important target that we stand by what we be do unlike the labour party be take account of local community what labour would do be build all over the green belt and can tell the house that its own mp be not in favour of that they be block development in their constituency what we have be sensible proportionate approach to build the right house in the right place what the negative social medium debate about all this have mask be the fact that significant amount of work be be do to create conserve and improve wetland around the country the all party parliamentary group for wetland which chair be support the drive by the wildfowl wetlands trust to create additional hectare of wetland in this country and we would also like to see dedicated domestic wetland team in defra to repeat its success in peat productivity will my hon friend give we more information about how expert organisation such as the wwt in slimbridge in my patch can apply for the million to continue positive progress on environmental matter and will she assist my effort to get the wetland team up and run know that my hon friend do extremely good work on behalf of slimbridge and other wetland in her area should be delighted to meet she and to read any of the report produce by her appg think it important to stress again that the package to be deliver through the work of natural england and the credit scheme must continue and we will be boost they because we know of the benefit that they have for my hon friend area and many other do the minister accept that the propose investment in the natural england nutrient mitigation scheme cover only of the total mitigation requirement to where will the additional fund require to address the shortfall come from do not accept that figure and do not know where the hon lady get it those scheme be very much in progress at the moment on an ongoing basis we be work through some of the detail should also mention that as well as the natural england scheme we have the government own scheme administer by my department which we will be able to deliver throughout the country do the minister agree that there be flaw in the way in which the office for environmental protection have reach its determination in this matter it can take into account only what be in the bill it can not take into account the other measure that the minister have mention the natural england nutrient neutrality programme and the investment in slurry management surely to form more coherent view of the environmental impact of these measure it be necessary to look at all measure in the round not just legislative measure my hon friend be of course extremely perceptive and he be absolutely correct we present an ambitious package overall and that mean we can meet head on the challenge of deliver the much need planning permission that my hon friend will no doubt welcome in his area which know need more housing and also protect and enhance our environment in its recent comment the office for environmental protection have interpret this in very narrow fashion and we do not necessarily agree with its assessment know that the minister have struggle previously with what constitute retain eu legislation but what we be talk about today be an amendment to the conservation of habitats and species regulations the challenge before the minister be that this government pledge on the record not once but seven time during the debate on the bill that become the retained eu law revocation and reform act that they would not reduce those explicit environmental protection will she say now whether that pledge to match those environmental protection directly remain or do she want to take this opportunity to correct the record and admit that the government word on the environment be not worth the paper it be write on think that what be struggle with be the fact that the hon lady clearly do not listen to my previous comment on this matter have say great many time that we do not agree that this be regression in environmental outcome and we stand by that we be the conservative government and we be commit to leave the environment in well state than the one in which we find it that be back up by strong package of action across numerous area my constituency be one of the worst affect place in the entire country with planning application hold up and thousand of people at risk of lose their job we be talk not about large construction company but about everyday job builder people with family to feed this be great step towards get the country move again and solve an intractable problem may ask the minister very simple question if build small house or put little extension on the side of my current house be really damage the watercourse to the same degree as pig farming and chicken farming be these well intend law completely miss the mark of what they be intend to do in the first place the simple answer to my hon friend question be that he be right the exist legal framework that have be hinder we have have disproportionate effect on plan permission and house building when the main source of the pollution lie elsewhere overall this package will be able to deliver house building and extension in my hon friend constituency help the small builder and of course protect our river in an industrial area such as teesside environmental standard be critical include around water quality and our riverside will the new policy framework lead to increase fund for the canal river trust which have see its budget decimate in recent year lead to huge cut in its activity and the removal of every single litter bin on its land around the river tees thank the hon gentleman for raise the concern of the canal river trust be sure that his comment will have be hear by defra ministers but will be happy to take those concern back to they and ask they to provide an answer follow the question from the hon member for stroud siobhan baillie on mitigation the government focus seem to be on wetland but if we be honest it will take long time to fully mitigate the possible additional pollution what will be do in the interim to deal with this pollution before the wetland become fully operational the hon lady be right to highlight the fact that there be focus on wetland but other project be in scope of the credit scheme however she have hit the nail on the head the key point be that some of these thing take very long time to come on stream but we need to start unblock those house now which be why we have take this proportionate approach with the amendment over the summer meet member of the bedfordshire great ouse valley environment trust they be concerned that our river be the fifth most polluted in england with forever toxin the level be shocking time that consider safe not to mention raw sewage and nitrate and phosphate contamination can the minister explain to my constituent why the government be decrease protection for our beautiful river when what be need be an urgent plan to clean up our dirty waterway can assure the hon gentleman and anyone else listen to this include his constituent that the package we be bring forward will protect the river and enable it to be in clean state that be back up by our plan for water and the further announcement we be put in place today what be more know from his correspondence that his constituent also want to see affordable housing be build and that be what this will enable my constituent whether they live in urban lancaster or in one of the rural wyre village recognise the need for housing across north lancashire but they also recognise the ripping up of environmental protection when they see it and they do not like that the minister seem to be very concerned about small house builder who be go bust so will she take this opportunity to apologise on behalf of her government who crash the economy push up inflation and make material more expensive and who have not deal with the land banking that be really hold back house building what would like to see from member on the other side of the house be an apology for talk this country down which they have do repeatedly be not sure whether the hon lady be able to tune in to treasury question recently when the chancellor set the record straight on how we now have one of the fast grow rate in the it be this conservative government who will get every industry go include the house building industry and small and large builder we be on the side of the builder not the blocker the minister refer to the doubling of investment in nutrient mitigation scheme with million put into slurry management yet of phosphate in the uk river be from household and only be from agriculture be this just another example of this government pass the buck and blame farmer for pollution in our river would be happy to sit down with the hon gentleman and explain to he what be mean by slurry management grant we be help farmer to build circular economy he will know that this be valuable resource farmer will welcome this intervention because they know that it could help they to farm more sustainably most farmer talk to want to work in harmony with nature that be what we be do do not know what the liberal democrats policy be though this tory government be fail on housing and the environment pay the price it be not an either or our welsh labour government be deliver on both in wales they have be work strategically with all stakeholder with high level nutrient management board set up to tackle precisely this issue sometimes chair by the first minister himself they be always chair by ministers as well as bring through regulation to improve agricultural water quality and get home build as well if the welsh labour government can do both why can this government the welsh labour government have shocking record on house building as they have on many issue what be more they be not tackle the issue at source which be why we be bring forward our catchment plan and our protect site strategy lot of the river that be drain from wales be impact negatively on constituency in england the only thing agree with in the hon lady rather stilte comment be that this be not an either or if she have listen to what be say she would know that we be do both we be protect the environment protect our river and bring forward housing thank the minister for answer the urgent question work capability assessment consultation with your permission madam deputy speaker will make statement on our propose change to the work capability assessment which aim to ensure that no one who can work be permanently write out of this country strong labour market story it be story that have see nearly million more people in work compare with million more disabled people in work than in and record number of people on payroll but although the overall number of people who be economically inactive have fall strongly from its pandemic peak there remain over million people who be inactive because of long term sickness and disability yet we know that one in five people on incapacity benefit who be currently not expect to prepare for work want to work in the future if the right job and support be available and the proportion of people go through work capability assessment who be be give the high level of award and deem to have no work relate requirement at all have rise from in to last year this situation be exclude significant number of people from receive employment support to help they to move close to work opportunity it be hold back the labour market and the economy but perhaps most important of all it be hold back human potential want to ensure that everybody who can do so benefit from all the opportunity that work bring not just the financial security but all the physical and mental health benefit too no one who can work should be leave behind that be why early this year we announce an extra billion worth of investment to help disabled people and those with health condition to move into work that include bring in our new universal support employment programme which will assist disabled people and those with health condition to connect with vacancy and provide support and training to help they to start and stay in role through our individual placement and support in primary care programme we be invest million to help more than people to start and stay in work we be modernise mental health service in england provide wellness and clinical app pilot cutting edge digital therapy and digitise the nhs talk therapy programme we have also publish fundamental reform to the health and disability benefit system through our health and disability white paper that will see the end of the work capability assessment and new personalised tailor approach to employment support to help everyone to reach their full potential the scale of our reform mean that it will take time to implement they but there be change we can make more quickly that will also make difference so before the white paper come in want to make sure that the work capability assessment the way we assess how someone health limit their ability to work and therefore the support they need be deliver the right outcome and support those most in need today my department be launch consultation on measure to ensure that those who can work be give the right support and opportunity to move off benefit and towards the job market as have say we know that many people who be on out of work benefit due to health condition want to work and assist by modern working practice could do so while manage their condition effectively we have see huge shift in the world of work over the last few year huge change that have accelerate since the pandemic this have open up more opportunity for disabled people and those with health condition to start stay and succeed in work the rise in flexible working and homeworking have bring new opportunity for disabled people to manage their condition in more familiar and accessible environment more widely there have be improvement in the approach many employer take to workplace accessibility and reasonable adjustment for staff and well understanding of mental health condition and neurodiversity have help employer to identify opportunity to adapt job role and the way disabled people and people with health condition work the consultation be publish be about update the work capability assessment so that it keep up with the way people work today the activity and descriptor within the work capability assessment which help to decide whether people have any work preparation requirement to improve their chance of get work have not be comprehensively review since so it be right that we look afresh at how we can update they give the huge change we have see in the world of work for instance the work capability assessment do not reflect how someone with disability or health condition might be able to work from home yet many disabled people do just that our plan include take account of the fact that people with mobility problem or who suffer anxiety within the workplace have well access to employment opportunity due to the rise in flexible working and homeworking we be consult on whether change should be make to four of the activity and descriptor that determine whether someone can work or prepare to work to reflect change in working practice and well employment support this include look at change remove or reduce the point for descriptor relate to mobilising continence social engagement and get about we be not consult on change to the remain descriptor which will remain unaltered these change will not affect people who be near the end of life or receive cancer treatment nor will they affect the majority of activity for those with severe disablement such as if person have severe learning disability or be unable to transfer from one seat to another we be also consult on change to the provision for claimant who would otherwise be capable of work preparation activity but be exclude from work preparation requirement on the basis of substantial risk most commonly on mental health ground the original intention for substantial risk be for it to be advise only in exceptional circumstance it be intend to provide safety net for the most vulnerable but the application of risk have go beyond the original intent we be therefore consult on how we might change how substantial risk apply so that people can access the support they need to move close to work and more fulfilling life we be also consider the tailored and appropriate support that will be need for this group safely help they move close to work these proposal will help people to move into or close to the labour market and fulfil their potential we be consult over the next eight week to seek the view of disabled people employer charity and other on our propose change if the proposal be take forward follow consultation the early we could implement any change would be from give the need to make change to regulation and to ensure appropriate training for health assessor these plan be part of our wide approach to ensure that we have welfare system that encourage and support people into work while provide vital safety net for those who need it most welfare system that focus on what people can do not on what they can not do and that reflect the modern change to the world of work it be time to share the opportunity of work far more fairly it be time for work to be truly available to all those who can benefit from it it be time to get britain work commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for early sight of his statement know from talk to disabled people in my constituency and across the country that work can bring dignity and self respect through the choice control and autonomy from have money in their pocket and make the contribution they want to make in life work be the reason for my political party and support work people be why labour member get up in the morning that belief be share by the british public include hundred of thousand of people who currently feel shut out of the workplace and trap on benefit when they could work if they have the right help and support on this government watch staggering million people be now out of work as result of long term sickness that be the high number ever up almost half million since the pandemic alone this be serious challenge for million of our constituent and for the economy and it deserve serious response but that be not what we have see today labour have be warn for year that benefit assessment be not fit for purpose and crucially that unless we have proper plan to support sick and disabled people who can work even more will end up trap in degrading benefit system cost they and the taxpayer far more labour have already set out plan to transform the back to work help that be available by personalise employment support and tackle the huge backlog in our nhs and social care our into work guarantee will let people try work without fear of lose their benefit our plan be back by the centre for social justice the social security advisory committee and disabled people organisation why not the secretary of state we will ensure that employment support meet specific local need through proper devolution to local area and when disabled people get job we will make sure they get the support they need to keep they there as soon as they need it rather than have to wait for month on end we will study the consultation carefully but see nothing in the statement that match labour vision or scale of ambition it do not even deal with the glare problem in the current system eighty per cent of personal independence payment decision be overturn at tribunal of which only be because new evidence have become available how will the proposal make any difference to the totally inadequate decision making that cause untold stress to disabled people and waste million of pound of taxpayer money the backlog of access to work assessment have treble to since the pandemic how will the proposal help to bring that down where be the plan to help slash waiting list for help with anxiety and depression which we know be major problem or to get the carer that family need to look after sick and disabled relative so that they themselves can work this be not serious plan it be tinker at the edge of fail system if you run your nhs into the ground for year and let waiting list for physical and mental health soar if you fail to reform social care to help people care for their love one and if your sole aim be to try to score political point rather than reform the system to get sick and disabled people who can work the help they really need you end up with the mess we have today system that be fail sick and disabled people fail taxpayer and fail our country as whole britain deserve far well than this thank the hon lady for her remark it be gratify that she agree with much of the premise set out she recognise the importance of work and that million people or thereabout be on long term sick and disability benefit we be all equally concerned that the number be grow she also argue that the work capability assessment in its current form be not fit for its require purpose which be exactly why we be come forward with these reform she refer to the pip assessment requirement which be not relevant to the work capability assessment that we be discuss and that be subject to the current consultation we clearly have plan the hon lady have be in her position for very short period and respect and understand that invite she to look closely at the announcement that be make the billion worth of support at the last fiscal statement include our white paper reform in exactly the area where she be seek progress the universal support and the workwell programme she mention work with local provider and there be huge drive on that as for mental health we be consult on occupational health across business to make sure that we get in right at the start where people may otherwise end up on long term health journey we be also work closely with the nhs on get employment adviser involve for example in talk therapy which we know be so effective in address mental health concern strongly support the initiative to help more people who be long term sick and disable into work where they wish to do that my query be why on earth be it go to take so long we need to be do this now to ease our workplace shortage and to give those people early support and hope will my right hon friend please work with his official to speed it all up share my right hon friend keenness to see these proposal whatever may or may not emerge come forward as soon as possible they will require lot of work on it system and change to system the provider will have to incorporate the change that may or not come forward as result of this consultation let reassure he that give the benefit there will be to many people who will otherwise not benefit from work be as anxious as he be to make sure that we move forward at speed call the scottish national party spokesman the big difference between the snp and the conservative and labour party be that we do not approach this from the point of view that people be somehow on the make and on the take we do not assume that when somebody come for an assessment they be somehow try to cheat the government that be why it be important that the select committee on work and pensions note in its recent report the concern that disabled people be still experience psychological distress as result of undergo these health assessment let show just how perverse some of those assessment be one of the first constituency case deal with as an mp involve someone literally be ask at an assessment whether they still have autism that give we an idea of how fundamentally flawed this whole process be have the secretary of state read the institute for public policy research report that come out today it make specific recommendation to limit conditionality to facilitate person centre support on universal credit it say people with health condition single parent and parent of young child on universal credit should be exempt from requirement or financial penalty under any circumstance have he see that will the secretary of state also agree to look again at the access to work scheme far too often the government own committee have receive evidence that show that access to work simply be not work come back to my fundamental point will the government change their philosophy this deep suspicion that somehow claimant be on the make and on the take all they actually need be support from their government respect the hon gentleman have appear before the select committee know how seriously he take the matter that he have raise however can not accept be describe as bear down on those who be on the make and on the take if he can find any example of myself or my ministers make those assertion would like to see it in the absence of that hope that he will be big enough to withdraw those comment the hon gentleman do not like the assessment but we hear nothing about alternative or what the snp plan be to replace assessment if there be inherent problem with assessment presumably the logic be that he be not go to assess anybody at all so we do not know what his plan be he refer to conditionality so let make point about that there be those whose health and disability situation be such that passionately recognise that they should not be expect to undergo any work to look for work or to carry out work itself as compassionate society we should be there to support those people and we will continue to do so but where somebody can work there be contract between the state and the individual if people be to be support and they can work it be right that they should be expect to do so in those circumstance the conditionality should apply the hon gentleman make specific reference to access to work that programme provide up to about for each individual involve to bring forward adaptation to the workplace to accommodate that individual into employment it be huge commitment on the part of this government and can inform he that the late figure have be that of those application be be process within day it be greatly welcome that we be try to get the assessment to give people the outcome they deserve but it be intriguing to make what sound like fundamental change to an assessment that we be go to try to scrap in few year time will the secretary of state set out how many of the million people he cite as be in this situation he think would not be in the same group after these change how many of they will have chance to be reassess before we scrap the assessment entirely deal in my statement with my hon friend question about why we be do this give that we will be get rid of the wca in due course say that there be no reason why we can not bring forward these benefit early even though we be go to be remove the wca altogether as for the number impact we know that about one in five people on those benefit do want to work give the right support until the consultation be conclude and we know the exact nature of the policy change that we may or may not be make at that point we will not be able to assess the number exactly this will lead to lot of fear among disabled people appreciate the tone that the secretary of state have take but the record of the past year have be one of exclude the most vulnerable disabled people from more support than they need we know that disabled people be group who be live in huge poverty we also know that some of they have die not just through suicide but because of the lack of safeguarding in the department and how it operate so urge he to ensure that the safeguard system within the department ensure that people be protect agree with the snp spokesperson about access to work we be talk about million disabled people able to work and be provide with it through access to work listen to the hon lady remark with great respect have appear before she at the select committee know how serious she be about the issue she raise and how strongly she promote her idea and concern she mention the lack of support available for the people in the situation we be describe which be precisely why want to start provide more support to they by make these reform let make an important point in an area where be in agreement with she we need to do this in the right way we need to listen carefully to those who will be affect by any change we may bring forward which be why we have full eight week consultation my ministers and will be engage closely with the various stakeholder disabled people and so on we will of course welcome her comment as part of that process when be minister whenever go on visit would ask young disabled people what they would do if they be the minister they say that they would always want to have the same career opportunity as their friend therefore welcome any move to make more personalised and tailor support available to build on our record disability employment however we lose more than people year from the workplace and the majority of long term health condition and disability develop during the work age so during this consultation urge the secretary of state to work with employer to see what more support and advice they need to make sure that people do not ever have to even enter the wca system thank my hon friend for that typically sensible and astute intervention may personally thank he for the advice and input he have give over the precede month particularly in this area he be right that we should be proud of our record of assist disabled people into million more in work since equally he be right about address the hundred of thousand of people with these kind of difficulty and challenge who be leave business and the workforce every year recognise that it be essential to get help to those people as early as possible before they progress too far along that health journey that be why we be already consult on occupational health so that we can make sure that be roll out more effectively across large and medium sized business in his statement the secretary of state mention that four descriptor would be review but there be no plan for any other change he certainly do not mention add any descriptor at yesterday westminster hall petition debate on disability assessment one of the key issue discuss be remit and relapse condition particularly fatigue will the secretary of state commit to look at fatigue and either add it as descriptor or tell we what he be go to do about it instead nothing in the consultation exclude bring forward exactly the point that the hon lady make hope she will do just that and encourage other to do so as well the secretary of state be quite right to refer to the million additional people with disability who have come into work since he will recall that the first disability confident event hold in be in gloucester his department work closely with charity and employer to ensure that more opportunity happen have meet many people who benefit from that programme so support he in the principle can he confirm that he will engage closely with charity and organisation such as seetec pluss which have lot of experience in help to bring people with disability back into the workplace thank my hon friend for all the passion and intelligence he bring to these issue can confirm that our door will be open to seetec pluss in fact will go far and make sure that our official reach out to my hon friend to ensure that that happen in key paragraph of his statement the secretary of state appear to envisage that he will either remove or reduce the descriptor give access to benefit for people who have problem with mobility or be incontinent will he explain what he mean by that will he also tackle problem on the other side of the world of work include rogue employer exploit people through low pay part time or temporary job one in nine worker be in poverty as result be it not time that he take on the employer rather than the poor in our society that sentiment of take on the employer be probably not conducive to have an economy that be generate the job that have occur under this government as to the descriptor indeed the activity that the hon gentleman refer to there be plethora of information out there about exactly what those mean if he have trouble find that would be very happy to have my department point he in the right direction the secretary of state rightly point to the tripling of the number of people receive the high award after work capability assessment do he share my concern that false assumption be grow not only that those people can not work but that they should not work which therefore write they off do we not have serious moral obligation to remove all sort of barrier that come between those individual and the workplace his approach be exactly right in try to target those obstacle that most get in the way of people enjoy the agency and autonomy that activity in the workplace bring thank my hon friend for the advice and support he have give when we have discuss these issue over the last few month know he be extremely knowledgeable in this area he be absolutely right that we do not want people to be trap to use that expression on benefit we want to help people to move into the labour market and work that be well for the economy and the labour market but most importantly it be well for the physical and mental health of the individual concern as show by all the evidence declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on myalgic encephalomyelitis the secretary of state have say that the work capability assessment be not fit for purpose and many disabled people with invisible or fluctuating condition would agree with he entirely they report not be believe their medical evidence be disregarded and leave the assessment feeling as though they have be belittle by the assessor the department of health and social care be undergo massive change in the way it deal with people with and other condition like can he provide an assurance that his department will look at how people with and other invisible disability be be consider through work capability assessment can give the hon lady exactly that assurance when it come to point she to the white paper that we publish in march in which we make clear commitment on fluctuate condition and say that we would test and trial around those condition as part of the white paper process welcome the secretary of state statement and thank he for his offer of more personal tailor support for disabled people who we must always do our good to help and support give that this be the century and there have be huge advance in medical treatment adaptation of building to help disabled people improvement in mobility device and rapid rise in digital connectivity it be staggering that the proportion of people go through wca who be deem to have no work relate requirement at all have go up from fifth to almost two third in just over decade why do the secretary of state think it be like that it be correct that we have go from to in that short space of time and recognise that that statistic be simply unacceptable we know that one in five people in that group want to work give the right support and we need to do something about that quite rightly my hon friend also raise the fundamental change in the way that work be conduct in the modern world the last time the work capability assessment be review for reform be year ago that be inadequate and it be now time to make appropriate change there be people in wales with severely limit condition new research this summer show that four in of they be have to skip or cut down on meal or have go without heating be the secretary of state confident that the propose change will remedy that it be fact that people be well off on average be in work than be on benefit pay tribute to my predecessor who introduce universal credit which make that the case bring people into work who would not otherwise be in work mean that they will on average be well off this government have increase the national living wage by over have be since april and have introduce cost of live support for million low income household million disabled people pensioner and so on in response to the hon gentleman the propose change be another step in exactly the right direction in response to my hon friend the member for kettering mr hollobone the secretary of state refer to the statistic of it strike that out of that of people number of they could work should work or want to work because that be the good thing for they build on the million people with disability who we have get back into work be it not the case that there must be people who be trap in that be it not imperative for the secretary of state and his official to get those people into the world of work as soon as possible my hon friend have use exactly the right word it be imperative that we get those people into the world of work if somebody be on benefit and we know that one in five of those people would with the right support like to get into work it be our duty as government and as society to do whatever we can to support they in this government say that they would help disabled people into employment through dedicated personalised support such as access to work in the year since the number of disabled people support by access to work have rise from to give the department failure and the wide context of cut would disabled people not be forgive for think that this be just further cut dress up as modernisation not at all madam deputy speaker have set out very clearly the principle reason why we be bring forward these measure as the hon gentleman will know when it come to more disabled people move into the workforce we set target for the year period from to see million more disabled people in employment we break that target in half that time reach million in addition after just five year the number of people who be economically inactive due to long term sickness have reach record high of million which be very concerning give the secretary of state fanfare today what level of reduction in those figure would he measure as success in support disabled people into secure and sustainable employment what specific improvement do he envisage to the sorely inadequate access to work scheme to prevent the disability employment gap widen even far have address the issue of access to work what significant programme it be and the recent improvement in the processing of those particular award on economic inactivity make two point first compare with the eu the oecd and the economic activity overall be below the average across those different group secondly it have decline by about since the peak that occur during the pandemic and that in substantial part be due to the policy of this government it be very noticeable that the secretary of state do not answer the question of the hon member for wellingborough about why he believe that there have be trebling of the number of people who be now get the maximum verdict under the work capability assessment have help many of my constituent who have have problem with their wca and not one of they have come to and say that it be the wca that be keep they out of work many of they have say that it be not nuance enough to understand the issue and welcome the fact that it be to be replace however can the secretary of state tell we what assessment he have make of how many people be likely to win their appeal after the change that he have bring in and what percentage be win they now at the moment huge number be win their appeal which make it clear that the work capability assessment be not work feel duty bind to correct the hon gentleman it be my hon friend the member for kettering mr hollobone who ask the question to which he refer of all the member in this house he be probably the one who promote his constituency the most and he should be laud for do so the bottom line be that we know that one in five or thereabout of those who be receive these benefit at the moment actually want to do some work if they be support in do so that mean that we have duty to look at the way that the wca operate and to look at reform it to make sure that in every case that somebody can do some work to the benefit of themselves and the economy we facilitate that have be support disabled student who have not be able to access universal credit because their work capability assessment be not complete before they start their study they be now at risk of drop out of university because they can not work to support themselves through their course because of their disability and they can not access social security either that mean that they can not improve their skill and ability when that might lead to an opportunity of employment in the future what resource or flexibility if any be feature in this consultation and the department plan so that my constituent can carry on with their study and other will not face the same situation in future the hon gentleman be able to feed into the consultation and encourage he and his constituent as appropriate to do so can not comment on the individual case that he raise but if he would like to get in touch with and my private office would be very happy to look at the circumstance that he have raise think all of we in this place would welcome an improvement to the work capability assessment like many other here have have number of constituent who currently receive pip payment come through my door they have contact the dwp to advise official that their situation have significantly deteriorate they now face lengthy delay of several month before their payment be take over by social security scotland and their change in circumstance be consider can the minister assure we that in the work be undertake and in the consultation there will be discussion between the dwp and the scottish government to make sure that payment recipient in scotland be not put at significant disadvantage and that the upheaval that they be currently undergo be take into account thank the hon lady for her question just to clarify there be no plan on the part of the government to make any change to the way in which pip operate and she do refer specifically to pip on the broad point which be an important point about the interaction between my department and the scottish government assure she that have write today to my scottish counterpart to open my door to whatever discussion they wish to have the minister for disabled people will also be have his regular engagement with the scottish government next week be almost tempt to say another week another consultation disabled charity come to regularly with real doubt and worry about the way disabled people be be treat visit project search in my constituency last week it be wonderful and inspiring they practically have to throw out the door it be programme that take in young people often from college with severe disability and learn issue and get they into work and then continue to support they the support that be offer once people get into work be crucial to the success of any programme the government undertake and how they treat these people be vital what be the government go to change how be they go to change these work capability assessment to benefit the recipient and how will they treat the people that they force into they believe that my hon friend the minister for disabled people will be meet the hon lady very shortly that be in the diary so those matter can be discuss in great detail then specifically she ask what support we will be provide it will be exactly the kind of support to which she have just allude there will be universal support to help train and place individual in work and it will stay with those individual for up to month to make sure that they get the support to hold down that job thank the secretary of state for his statement illegal migration update with permission madam deputy speaker wish to make statement about illegal migration tackle illegal migration be one of the government central priority because it be the british public priority people can see that illegal migration be one of the great injustice of our time it harm community in the uk it deny the most vulnerable refugee chance of resettlement and it leave behind trail of human misery indeed the perilous nature of the small boat crossing be underscore once again last month when six fatality occur in tragic incident off the french coast my thought be with all those affect and pay tribute to the first responder in both the uk and france who work in difficult circumstance to save as many life as possible that remind we all why we need to do whatever it take to stop the boat which be exactly what the government have be do throughout the summer we start by redouble our effort to smash the criminal gang upstream well before those gang be in strike distance of the united kingdom we have agree new partnership with turkey to target the supply chain of small boat which establish the uk as turkey partner of choice in tackle the share challenge of illegal migration two week ago visit my counterpart in egypt as the security minister visit iraq to deepen our law enforcement co operation with two more strategically important country in that regard in the uk we have be ratchet up our activity to break the business model of the gang unscrupulous employer and landlord who offer illegal migrant the ability to live and work in the uk be an integral part of the business model of the evil people smuggle gang we be clamp down on they we announce over the summer the big overhaul of our civil penalty regime in decade treble illegal working fine and initiate tenfold increase in right to rent fine for repeat offender as we do so more rogue employer and landlord be get knock on the door illegal working visit in the first half of this year increase by more than compare with the same period last year so far in we have more than treble the number of right to rent civil penalty issue compare with last year result in sixfold increase in the number of penalty levy follow the resumption of the immigration banking measure in april bank and building society be now close the account of more than illegal migrant as we surge our enforcement activity we be drive up the return of those with no right to remain in the united kingdom last month we announce the professional enablers taskforce which will increase enforcement action against lawyer and legal representative who help migrant to abuse the immigration system lawyer find to be coach migrant on how to remain in the country by fraudulent mean will face sentence of up to life imprisonment since our deal with albania in december last year we have return more than immigration offender on weekly flight as we have do so we have see more than reduction in the number of albanians arrive illegally so far there have be more than return this year with return in the first half of this year high than in the same period last year of course those change follow the landmark illegal migration act which couple with our partnership with rwanda will deliver the truly decisive change necessary to take away all the incentive for people to make illegal crossing from the safety of france as we adopt zero tolerance approach to illegal migration the government have extend generous offer to those most in need of settlement the late statistic publish over the summer show that between and june people be offer safe and legal route into the united kingdom last month the home office resettle the thousandth refugee through the community sponsorship scheme while this government focus be on tackle the source of the problem we have none the less work to manage the symptom of illegal migration as well as be practicable we have make significant improvement at manston since last year and it continue to operate as an effective site for security health and initial asylum check despite the pressure of the summer month we have work to ensure that when migrant depart manston they be now head to cheap and more appropriate accommodation by roll out room share and deliver our large accommodation site those site be undoubtedly in the national interest but the government continue to listen to the concern of local community and member of this house and throughout the summer further engagement have take place to ensure that those site be deliver in the most orderly way possible we have successfully end the use of afghan bridging hotel with afghan family now able to move on with the next stage of their life in settle accommodation and the hotel be now return to use by the public reduce the backlog in asylum case and establish more efficient and robust decision make system be not in and of itself strategy to stop illegal migration but it be important for taxpayer value and we have prioritise it we have transform the productivity of asylum decision making by streamline process create focused interview and instill true accountability for performance as of september we have meet our commitment to have decision maker an increase of from the same point last year as result be pleased to report to the house that we be on track to clear the legacy backlog by the end of the year and that recently publish provisional figure for july show that the overall backlog fall tackle illegal migration be not easy more people be on the move and more be mobile than ever before country around the world be struggle to control it but our point plan be one of the most comprehensive strategy to tackle this problem in europe and that be show as of today arrival be down by compare with last year and for the month of august the reduction be more than third that be against the reasonable bad case scenario of arrival that we be present with when take office last year in contrast irregular migration into the eu have significantly increase with italy alone see doubling in small boat arrival in italy increase in the uk decrease our plan be work there be of course much more to do but it be clear that we be make progress commend this statement to the house thank the minister for advance sight of his statement thin though it be and echo his sentiment in send condolence to the family of those six people who die tragically in the accident in the channel early this summer we simply must stop these dangerous crossing be absolutely bewildered that after the summer we have have yesterday the prime minister claim victory in his broken pledge to stop the boat this saturday we see the year record number of channel crossing with more than people make that dangerous journey in single day and the total number have now soar to whopping for the year the only reason the number be not break last year record be the poor weather in july and august and strategy that depend on the weather be probably not very sustainable strategy at all what have that leave we with government flail around chase headline with gimmick and stunt rather than do the hard graft of actually stop the boat clear the backlog and get people out of the hotel take their much celebrated small boat week last month which turn out to be an absolute omnishamble with taxpayer pay the price no wonder the home secretary do not want to do single interview and no wonder she be not in the chamber today do not take my word for it that well know pro labour publication the daily mail do day by day review on the monday just migrant be bring into the capacity bibby stockholm barge on the tuesday the conservative deputy chairman admit that his party have fail on immigration on the wednesday the immigration minister spark fresh tory infighting over whether britain should leave the european convention on human right on the thursday channel crossing hit their high daily number for the year then to cap it all on the friday all the asylum seeker be remove from the bibby stockholm because of the presence of legionella in the water supply you could not make it up the bibby stockholm be suppose to be symbol of the conservatives cut asylum cost but the minister have not even mention those cost today instead it stand alongside the boat and the hotel as float symbol of conservative failure and incompetence that be cost the taxpayer half million pound month on top of that new home office datum in august show we that the asylum seeker backlog have grow ninefold to an enormous under the conservatives at cost of billion year to the taxpayer incredibly eight time high than it be when labour leave office in that waste be the cost of year of conservative neglect today we debate the cost of the spiral asylum backlog drive by cut the cost of asylum decision making in yesterday the chancellor be promise to spend whatever it take to fix crumble classroom cause by the prime minister cut to the school budget as chancellor tomorrow we will no doubt be back to the economy and the financial cost of low growth and spiral mortgage everywhere we look we see the cost of conservative incompetence the minister speak now of this new deal with turkey well be glad that the government have start to listen to labour we have be call for tough action to disrupt the gang upstream for well over year but this look pitifully weak this announcement come with no new funding or staff mean that officer could be take off exist function that stand in contrast to labour fully fund plan to hire hundred of specialist specifically to work on that challenge meanwhile turkish national have become one of the large group cross the channel this year the minister boast about return of fail asylum seeker go up but they be actually down compare with when labour leave office in forty thousand be await removal and at the current rate it will take the government more than year to achieve their target two thousand few foreign national offender be be remove per year compare with when labour leave office in the minister brag about the legacy backlog figment of the prime minister imagination go down but he know full well that the only backlog that matter be that of the people and that number be still go up we know that the government be cook the book in that regard mark large number of asylum seeker as withdraw because they have miss single appointment or fail to fill in form correctly conservative back bench mp describe that as an amnesty in all but name the minister have decide to make illegal working even more illegal the problem be that there have be lack of government enforcement employer who be exploit and illegally employ migrant worker should face the full force of the law but in reality the number of penalty issue to firm have fall by two third since there be so many question that it be difficult to know where to start but let we start with these when do the minister know about legionella on bibby stockholm how much be the barge currently cost how many people be currently in hotel do he actually intend to implement the much vaunted illegal migration act the prime minister keep declare victory but the reality be that nothing be work and everything the government do just make everything bad so when will they get out of the way so that we on the labour benches can take over implement our plan and retake control of our broken asylum system that be desperately thin response we can deduce from it that the labour party have absolutely no plan to tackle this issue of course the hon gentleman have have quieter summer than but that be because the labour party be completely uninterested in tackle illegal migration the hon gentleman talk about small boat week well let we see how it go for the labour party on monday the government announce the big increase in fine for illegal working and rent for decade while labour mps call for illegal migrant to have the right to work immediately which would act as massive magnet for even more crossing on tuesday we announce our professional enablers taskforce to clamp down on lawyer who abuse the system while labour mp be awfully quiet be they they do nothing to distance themselves from the litany of councillor and adviser expose as be implicate in effort to stop the removal of criminal and fail asylum seeker on wednesday we announce partnership with turkey to smash the gang while the shadow home secretary claim that morning that what we really need be return to the dublin convention something that even the eu describe as prehistoric the truth be that the labour party have no plan to tackle this issue and do not even want to tackle it we on the conservative benches be get on with the job and we be make progress while the rest of europe see significant increase in migrant we be see significant fall our plan be the most comprehensive of any country in europe and it be start to work thank the minister for his statement of course he be more than aware of the various report over the summer regard the wethersfield site in braintree district in my area could he explain how long the government will be use that site be the five year period that have be publicly report correct what planning process will be use beyond the month permit under the class regulation be the government consider increase the per bed space give to council if the site remain open for more than year be grateful to my right hon friend for the co operation that we have have in respect of that site know that she support the use of large site such as disuse military basis for that purpose it be her policy when she be home secretary we want to use that site for the short possible period we have not put an end date on our use we have take advantage of the emergency planning power that be available in these circumstance she know that that have limited timeframe after which further action need to be take it be important that we provide the local community with the resource necessary to manage such site appropriately that be why we have provide the payment if the site be use for sustained period it be correct that we should look again at that and see whether further payment be appropriate we have also provide funding for essex police and for her local nhs service so that the pressure on her constituent and those of her neighbouring mp be as minimal as possible while we deliver this service in their area call the snp spokesperson the minister come here again with another statement but the problem be not the boat it be the backlog he come here fiddle figure with legacy backlog but the flow backlog of people come into the country continue to increase and the hidden backlog those grant asylum by the court but leave wait for his party to complete the paperwork grow and grow in reality we have backlog of people wait for decision from his department the high number since record begin and we local mp get only boilerplate reply that give no reassurance to our constituent leave in limbo by his incompetent department we all want to see an end to the small boat and to people risk and lose their life in the channel but that require safe and legal route which do not exist they certainly do not exist for iraqis iranians eritreans or sudanese people for afghans the afghan relocation and assistance policy and the afghan citizen resettlement scheme which they should be able to access be not fit for purpose either few than people have be settle through pathway this year but just shy of have come on small boat in the past two quarter because the system be break and the government be not interested in fix it have the minister meet the fire brigades union regard his expensive plague ship moor off dorset have he give any thought to how his illegal migration act will actually work many in the sector do not understand and have not have any guidance from the minister on what will happen to the people leave in immigration limbo by his department finally scotland have seek an alternative to this broken system and in the summer we launch our citizenship in an independent scotland paper the government be more interested in pull up the drawbridge and court the daily mail so will the minister devolve immigration to scotland and let we get on with the job of be welcome country and play role in the world when last call out the hon lady humanitarian nimbyism the statistic be stark in fact they have continue to be so the snp government still accommodate only of the total asylum population in the uk while scotland make up of the overall uk population in scottish local authority where the snp be the large party include in clackmannanshire dundee east ayrshire east dunbartonshire midlothian north ayrshire and falkirk could go on no asylum seeker be be accommodate in fact there be only more asylum seeker in snp control council in the two month that have pass since we last debate this issue the reason say that be that do not believe that member should come to this place and write cheque for which other people have to pay the cost of snp members fake humanitarianism be bear by everyone but themselves if they do not want illegal migrant in their own constituency then they should support our effort to stop the boat rise order this be very important statement but we have the remain stage of the energy bill later which be not protect time many people wish to speak so urge colleague to ask one short question of the minister on matter for which he have responsibility as oppose to matter for which he might not so that he be able to give quick answer lead the way will be sir edward leigh when the prime minister announce that he be imperille worth of level up investment on raf scampton he say he be go to lead by example by accept migrant into catterick camp in his constituency home office official have now inform we that that be not happen so where be the leadership in that it get bad be inform by west lindsey district council that despite be tell that the scheme be value for money and will have to be available for three year not two the value for money be infinitesimal compare with hotel it will not even save money for few day on hotel will the minister now drop this ridiculous scheme which be derisory and will do nothing for deterrence and sit down with and west lindsey district council to work out discreet location for illegal migrant in west lindsey be grateful to my right hon friend for his question and our continued co operation we believe that this policy be in the national interest it be right that those come to this country be accommodate in decent but never luxurious accommodation so that we do not create pull factor to the uk it be through deliver site such as scampton which appreciate have serious impact on his constituent that later this year hope we will begin to close hotel in earnest and return those facility to the general public for tourism business and leisure which know be support by member across the house call the chair of the home affairs committee on behalf of the home affairs committee may send our thought and prayer to all those affect by the loss of life in the channel last month the home affairs committee have long urge the government to clear the asylum backlog and be pleased that the legacy backlog be start to shrink however there be important question about the quality and quantity of decision on quality it be report in the sunday times last week that interview have be slash from seven hour to minute could the minister explain how the home office be evaluate and guarantee the quality of those decision on quantity the home office have reportedly double the rate of decision making on the legacy backlog since the end of june what resource and support will be offer to local authority when they start have to deal with the dramatic increase in the number of positive asylum claim decision on the first of those two important question the right hon lady be right to say that the work we have do to transform the decision make process be bear fruit there will be an increase in the number of decision very sharp one in the week ahead that will mean some more people be grant but also some more people be refuse who then need to be remove swiftly from the country in respect of those people be grant be work with the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities to provide the support and guidance to local authority that they will need however those people who have be grant particularly young adult male need to get on with their life get job and contribute to british society which be what think they want to do we have achieve this transformation through well management performance target work overtime and have short more focused interview do not believe that we need to have seven hour interview to identify the salient point and decide case and that have be bear out by the good work we have do in recent month think member will see as data be publish in the week and month ahead an absolute transformation in the service the minister be absolutely right to be do everything to tackle the small boat issue and illegal migration over the summer month nearly asylum seeker have arrive in destination in chelmsford and be grateful for the time he have spend speak to about it local people be really worried about extra pressure on local health service local housing list and other local service will he work with to ensure that area that take large number of asylum seeker get financial support so that this cost be share fairly across the whole country yes would be happy to continue to work with my right hon friend as we have do in recent month we have provide per bed space to local authority that house dispersal accommodation which go to meet the cost to they of look after these individual but she be right to say that the wide cost of housing asylum seeker be very high there be no escape that that be one of the reason we need to reduce the number of people come into the country in the first place over the past few year the government have allow the backlog of asylum claim to rise and rise to over for all the minister warm word progress in tackle it have be disgracefully slow what additional measure will the minister now implement to get that backlog down and reduce the need for his department to scrabble around for additional accommodation which often prove to be unsuitable and impractical such as the stradey park hotel in my constituency hope have already describe in previous answer the work that we have do can assure the hon lady that it be bear fruit and that the backlog of legacy decision will be clear by the end of the year and we will swiftly move thereafter to other decision order and efficiency have be restore to the asylum decision make process but just wave more people in and process their claim fast be not strategy to stop the boat in and of itself that be why we need the full deterrent and the comprehensive plan that we have one of the issue that be put pressure on asylum accommodation be the very poor performance in labour run wales which have take only of the total asylum population yet wales account for of the uk population in some area of wales such as the constituency of the shadow minister the hon member for aberavon stephen kinnock there be no asylum seeker whatsoever would strongly encourage the hon lady to speak with the welsh government and get they to step up and help we provide more accommodation very much agree with what my right hon friend say about the importance of effective processing but he be right about the underlie importance of have clear plan to deter people from come to this country illegally which lead we to rwanda and the upcoming supreme court judgment anticipate later this year do he recognise the very strong sentiment among many of we in the house and indeed among many of my constituent that if the supreme court rule against the government policy on this vital question we should withdraw from the european convention on human right parliament support for our rwanda plan be make clear with the passage of the illegal migration act that be statutory scheme to underpin the rwanda partnership so the will of parliament to get on and deliver the policy be clear for all to see be confident that we will secure the result that we seek in the supreme court when it hear the case in october and that be the government focus right now but like my right hon friend do not think we should take anything off the table if we be truly committed to stop the boat we will have to consider all option include with regard to the european convention on human right if the government attention be so strongly focus on crossing in the channel can the minister explain to why one of the four border force cutter spend so much time this summer tie up at pier in orkney we have history of people come in small boat to orkney but the vikings have be quiet for quite while now be that not curious use of that scarce resource be happy to look into that issue and be delighted to see the right hon gentleman damascene conversion to stop the boat can assure he that the uk have very robust and efficient operation in the channel we have be commend by international organisation include when speak to the director general of the united nations high commissioner for refugees for the work that we do to save life at sea in the channel commend the border force officer who be part of that at the end of the day though we have to put in place deterrent if we want to stop people cross the channel and that be why we need policy such as rwanda which the right hon gentleman and his party have vigorously oppose echo the comment of the chair of the home affairs committee the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson about the tragedy in the channel it be miracle that more life have not be lose the minister have commit to subsidise the french police force to the tune of million and yet as at the end of august the number of successful interception on french beach be which be down from in the previous corresponding period over the same time the belgians have manage to increase the number of successful interception by will the minister have word with his french counterpart to suggest that they have word with their belgian counterpart to see what they be do differently be we pay the wrong country first would say that the number of small boat arrival come to the uk have fall by that be very significant achievement bear in mind the context of increase in italy and correspond amount in other border state of the european union however my hon friend be right to say that despite elevate relation with france to their high level for many year and do great deal of work there be clearly more that we need the french to do for we he be particularly right to focus on belgium visit there recently and meet with the belgian interior minister and the approach that that country have take have be extremely helpful it have work very closely with the national crime agency border force and police in the uk and have be willing to intercept in the water small boat leave its shore that have prove decisive small boat from belgian water be now extremely rare so that be an approach that we encourage the french to follow the minister will be aware that the case in my constituency be be process from what have see the vast majority be be give leave to remain the minister advise that those people would then be give day notice to leave the hotel but last week send he example of case where they have be give five seven or nine day notice that be create homelessness problem in my constituency because the time be not available to set up the arrangement to house they the local christian centre worker have be house they in their own home as well which be wonderful but we can not go on like this be to meet the minister next week but that meeting have be postpone would be very happy to meet with his official hillingdon council and the local christian centre to talk through how we can resolve this problem but it be matter of urgency be not aware that our meeting have be postpone will look into that immediately after the statement in one sense the issue that the right hon gentleman have bring to the house be sign of progress it mean that the work we have do to clear the backlog and create an efficient service be now bear fruit and more decision be be grant in fact in the last week in august over decision be grant in single week which be the high for several year that will mean that there will be increase pressure on some local authority such as the right hon gentleman which house very large number of asylum seeker particularly with respect to family local authority will have duty and responsibility that will be challenge for they be very keen to work with he and other member across the house who be affect by that greatly commend the minister for the progress he have make with respect to procedure and to the disreputable lawyer who have be exploit the system and for the procedure that he have announce today but could say something on the question of the supreme court the supreme court be go to make judgment could it possibly be encourage to go more quickly it really be important the perception in the country be that nothing be be do which be not true the government have behave extremely well in relation to the act of parliament that have just be pass on the question of the echr it be not necessary to abolish the entire convention in these circumstance regard the issue of illegal immigration if the supreme court case be to go the wrong way we can tailor legislation we can use the notwithstanding formula and tailor it to the specific requirement that be need which would be limit but extremely effective will the minister please bear that in mind have always take and value the advice of my hon friend in this regard we will of course consider what action we need to take if there be negative judgment from the supreme court but that be not our expectation we be go to vigorously contest that case and expect positive outcome the supreme court be go to hear the case in the middle of october and hope that those justice will come forward with their decision expeditiously because as my hon friend have rightly say the country be wait for action and the good work we have do thus far be not enough we have to go far and at the end of the day that will only happen by put decisive intervention such as the rwanda policy in place all this just confirm that the hostile environment be still alive and well the minister talk about reduce the backlog how be case within that backlog be prioritise have constituent who be catch up in the tragedy at the park inn hotel in glasgow in city incidentally that take more of its share of asylum seeker than any other local authority area in the country he be the roommate of one of the attacker he be tell that he would have decision by october so nearly year later what be his place in the backlog queue be happy to look into the case that the hon gentleman raise but as have say in answer to numerous question we be now make very strong progress with the backlog we be make decision at rate that have not be see for several year and that be escalate rapidly but the fundamental difference of opinion between he and his party and ourselves be that we do not see clear the backlog as strategy for stop the boat it be an important thing that we need to do as country in order to operate an efficient system in the interest of british taxpayer but it be not enough we have to put in place deterrent that fundamentally break the business model of the people smuggler so that people will not want to come here in the first place welcome my right hon friend announcement regard the professional enablers taskforce and encourage he to make sure that that taskforce look at the entirety of lawyer intervention in the immigration system for one be sick and tired of have people come to my surgery who have spend year in the immigration system with application after application that have no chance of ever succeed but be make lot of money for the solicitor advise they my hon friend be absolutely right speak as former solicitor so mean no harm to the profession but the abuse that have see in my role over the past nine month be truly shocking and have to end be pleased that the solicitors regulation authority have take swift action against the lawyer and legal representative who be identify by the daily mail over the summer but that be the tip of the iceberg there be much more work to be do by the profession and hope this taskforce will root out that abuse as quickly as possible envy the minister apparently limitless capacity for self congratulation but it do not bear much relationship to what people be experience on the ground go to visit migrant in hotel in chesterfield there be people there not single one of whom have have their case hear the minister be apparently congratulate himself on the most basic improvement that any competent home office should have be make over the past month how do he explain the fact that under this government more migrant be arrive yet few be be return than in can tell the house what would happen if the labour party be in charge of return interruption no this be an important point to make the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer during his campaign to be leader of the labour party campaign to close detention centre dozen of labour mp have campaign against immigration removal centre and numerous labour mp have side with dangerous foreign criminal versus the british public oppose their removal from this country the labour party include the hon member for chesterfield mr perkins oppose our reform to modern slavery legislation reform that be essential in order to remove people from this country expeditiously while we be get return up as say in my statement they have already rise substantially worry what would happen under the labour party because it have absolutely no strategy to tackle that issue order re emphasise the importance of answer on responsibility that the minister have thank my right hon friend for the very helpful telephone call have have during the summer concern the bibby stockholm barge which be in portland port in my constituency something that the majority of we oppose as he know we do not have any migrant on board due to the legionella problem and understand that the government be face various legal action not least from the fire brigades union could he kindly update and my constituent on the situation concern that barge and when and if the migrant will return be grateful to my hon friend for the co operation that we have have over the summer appreciate his position with respect to the barge although we believe it be important that we move away from expensive hotel to more rudimentary form of accommodation such as barge it be very unfortunate that migrant have to be move off the barge over the summer we deeply regret that we do take very precautionary approach test have subsequently be carry out and the definitive answer to those test will be receive very shortly assume that they show no sign of legionella or indeed any other bacteria or cause of concern we will move people back on to the boat as soon as possible and think we can expect that within week far to the point make by my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash the european convention on human right be negotiate some year ago long before international criminal gang engage in traffic people across europe and indeed more widely do not my right hon friend agree that now be the time for the government to make an approach to the council of europe with view to renegotiate the term of the european convention because clearly it be not protect our border or those of many other country across europe my right hon friend be correct to say that the framework of international treaty many of which be forge in the year after the second world war now appear out of date give the challenge that we face today and that be sentiment share by other european country we have be work closely with we have seek to put illegal migration and reform of the international framework on the table for all of the international fora that the prime minister the home secretary or be represent at and we will seek to make the uk lead force in reform on that issue other country be look intently at the work we be do particularly the rwanda partnership and once we be able to establish it think it be very likely that other country will follow suit it be nearly year now since the home office first requisition two hotel on bostock lane in my constituency and despite numerous commitment from the dispatch box hundred of migrant be still house at that location appreciate my right hon friend good intention and the hard work he have put in but my constituent really want to know when the site will be close and when the hotel will be return to their originally intend purpose three thing have change decisively over the summer first it be increasingly clear that the number come over be low than last year as result of the plan that the government have put in place particularly the deal we strike with albania that have be so successful secondly the backlog clearance work that we have do be bear fruit as we have already hear today thirdly we have double the number of asylum seeker live in each room whether that be in hotel or in dispersal accommodation save the taxpayer hundred of million of pound those three thing lead to the ability to exit hotel in the near future and we be work very closely on plan to do so know how strongly my hon friend feel so when we be able to do so her hotel should rightly because of some of the issue that have be experience by her community be top of the list my right hon friend will be aware of an unwritten deal but deal base on trust that east kent would not be face any accommodation because of the pressure that dover be obviously face and the pressure we have in manston as primary dispersal centre so he can imagine my displeasure that hotel in cliftonville the glenwood hotel small facility of just room be be readie to be set up on september be unhappy about this because of as say the deal base on trust because of the pressure that east kent be bear would certainly hope my right hon friend will intervene to make sure that this pretty insignificantly sized facility will be withdraw order just quick reminder that we must have succinct question because we have lot to get through later would be very happy to take look at that and completely understand and appreciate the unique pressure that kent face in my last communication with doncaster council there be people on the housing waiting list and we have hotel that be full too so will my right hon friend continue his great work and make sure that we stop these illegal boat and reduce immigration to sizeable level strongly support the view of my hon friend he be right to say that illegal migration place immense pressure on public service housing supply and community cohesion that be what we on this side of the house understand and that be why we be take the action that we be to stop the boat when will the old palace lodge in dunstable be available for the people of dunstable again give its particular role in provide social community for mark life event for the whole town have have numerous conversation with my hon friend about that hotel hope that we will be in position to exit hotel shortly as result of the work we have do to restore order to the asylum decision make system and the reduced number of illegal migrant cross the channel be pleased to see the reduction by in the year to date and of course the work that have be happen with albania but resident in stoke on trent north kidsgrove and talke be concerned about the increase number come from turkey and india what assurance from the prime minister have my right hon friend and the home secretary have about return agreement be include in any free trade deal that we sign with india my hon friend be right to point out that there have be significant number of illegal migrant from both those country visit turkey early in the summer and one of my objective be to create an enhance arrangement for return with turkey with which we be work very closely in that regard for india the prime minister the home secretary and have be meet indian counterpart regularly to increase the return of illegal migrant there that be absolutely essential because the number be very substantial very much agree with the minister that we must increase deterrence if we be to reduce the number of people come here illegally key part of that be increase deportation so what be the minister do to ensure that we increase the number of deportation facility and increase the speed of those deportation we have one of the large detain estate of any major european country and we be increase it we be invest in two new one that will come on line next year and we be look for further opportunity as well that be quite right because under the illegal migration act individual who come to this country illegally will be detain and then swiftly removed welcome the progress in processing application will my right hon friend commit that the extra resource will be maintain and the focus on productivity improve to deal with the legacy event and then other case while do the important work of stop the flow yes be very pleased that we meet our pledge to increase the number of decision maker to from september that be couple with management change so that there be financial incentive and proper accountability for the civil servant involve we be see now the fruit of that labour with much more productive service than we have see for many year the one year anniversary of the novotel in ipswich be take over by the home office be about to be meet my right hon friend know how strongly feel about this anger in ipswich have not abate look at that hotel blaze of light and know that those people who break our immigration rule be get three meal day during cost of live squeeze have cause immense anger will my right hon friend outline timescale to get the novotel back to its proper use which would be good for the economy it would also be good for fairness and sense of fairness be vitally important hope that have give my hon friend some reassurance that we be now at point where we can move forward with exiting hotel we will come back to the house in due course to set out those arrangement but he be right that this be fundamental question of fairness it be not appropriate for people who have break our law and come into our country illegally to be access luxurious accommodation that be way beyond the mean of million of our fellow citizen the royal hotel in kettering and the rothwell house hotel in rothwell be unsuitable as asylum hotel location not least because of their heart of town centre site the minister already know the strength of local feeling about those two hotel local people want they back as normal hotel believe they be on month contract will he ensure that those contract be not renew when they come to an end my hon friend have make very strong representation on behalf of his community and he and meet early in the year to discuss that far when we be in position to close hotel it will be one like his small hotel in market town that take away very important community asset that will be top of the list reduce the asylum backlog be important but we absolutely must not fall into the trap of have de facto amnesty to try to achieve that in the past year we approve the claim of of applicant include many from undisputed safe country while france approve just why be we approve nearly three time the proportion of claim approve by france give that this be clearly one of the pull factor that draw people across the channel that be very important question we have not do an amnesty that be what the last labour government do when they have backlog of asylum decision we have choose to do good old fashioned management reform to make this service more productive and deliver for the taxpayer we have also take on this issue in respect both of country with high grant rate such as afghanistan and of those with low grant rate such as albania and we have rapidly get through those case there be number of nationality egypt turkey india where grant rate should be very low indeed because there be very few circumstance in which somebody should be successfully claim asylum in this country we want to ensure that our asylum grant rate be no high than those of comparable european country welcome the near end to illegal albanian immigration the crackdown on immigration lawyer abuse and uk visas and immigration caseworker help mps however as more asylum seeker become refugee have my right hon friend consider create home for refugee programme build on the successful homes for ukraine scheme it be worth remember that those individual

who offer contrary opinion that be deem to be legal and in compliance with our obligation under the refugee convention that be huge step forward there be narrow point to resolve and we hope we will be successful in that regard in the supreme court in october but my hon friend know of our determination to tackle this issue one way or another point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker know that raise this take up time in itself but be concerned that we now have just about three hour include for the ten minute rule motion for the final stage of bill that run to page plus page of amendment which include new clause and at least amendment this house have not be overrun with business lately we have many day before the recess when we be go home early and it seem to that it be not respectful to this house to try to shoehorn such large piece of legislation into such short period of time thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order and for give notice of it know that he as former leader of the house will be very aware of the procedure for organise business in the house he also know that it be not matter for would remind he that say on three occasion during the previous statement that there be lot of business to get through that it do not have protect time and that therefore short question and answer be require have try my good to reflect the fact that there be pressure on business because he be quite right that many colleague want to contribute to the next debate the leader of the house be present and may wish to respond so will allow she to do so far to that point of order madam deputy speaker would like to place on the record that we be always keen to ensure that this house have time to debate matter contrary to what some might be say this be not zombie parliament and we be put through lot of legislation as well as private bills also remind the house that the programme motion for the energy bill be agree on may be about to say that the programme motion be agree to by the house thank the leader of the house for her response and be sure the right hon gentleman previous leader of the house will remember that sometimes it be not possible to please everybody electronic cigarettes branding promotion and advertising motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision about the branding promotion and advertising of electronic cigarette for the purpose of prevent electronic cigarette from be market in way which appeal to child and for connected purpose we be see rapid and very concern increase in underage vaping recent study by action on smoking and health find that in the past three year the number of child take part in experimental vaping have increase by one in five to year old in england use vape in figure that be likely to be significantly high now alongside this have come significant growth in the awareness of cigarette promotion with of child now conscious of cigarette marketing either in shop or online we can see how this have happen in every single one of the constituency we represent on high street and in town centre up and down the country there be vape shop where the shelf and window display be fill with brightly coloured packaging and product the packaging mimic popular brand with flavour of sweet like gummy bear skittles and tutti frutti or soft drink like cherry cola or emblazon with image of cartoon character the problem be just as widespread online with vape be openly promote to child on social medium site draw they into experimental vaping so that they become addicted to nicotine the marketing strategy be clear to see the product be design to be attractive to child to draw they in when they be very young so that they will become addicted to vape and then become long term customer vaping have shift from smoking cessation tool to recreational activity in its own right it be drive by the rapacious desire of tobacco company which fund many of the large cigarette supplier to keep make profit from the highly addictive substance of nicotine there be evidence that the approach be work for the company profit from vape with new datum from the office for national statistics this week show that the increase in child and young people vaping be already feed through into dramatic increase in young adult vape with particularly sharp increase in the number of young woman use vape the important role of vaping in smoking cessation have lead to widespread perception that it be harmless activity rather than less harmful activity than smoking it be not harmless last year child be admit to hospital for suspect vaping relate disorder young people use cigarette be twice as likely to suffer from chronic cough than non user there be report that nicotine dependency contribute to cognitive and attention deficit condition and worsens mood disorder concern about vaping be be widely raise by teacher and parent in way that be not the case just couple of year ago school be instal heat sensor in addition to smoke detector in school toilet take step to stop child constantly leave the classroom to vape and manage the impact of addiction to nicotine on the mood and concentration level of their student the sale of cigarette to be already illegal but the dramatic increase in the number of young people vape show that the current legislation be completely ineffective so we must learn from the substantive evidence on what work in reduce smoking rate among child in when smoke rate among child first start be monitor in england one in five child be current smoker the same as the proportion of to year old now vape eighteen year later despite substantial advertising campaign to educate young people on the danger of smoking the proportion be exactly the same that be not because child be not educate about the danger but because some adolescent be more susceptible to take risk between and smoke rate among child fall from to just because of well education or enforcement of the exist prohibition on the sale of cigarette to child but because the regulatory framework during that time ratchet up year by year under the last labour government all point of sale advertising and display of tobacco be prohibit comprehensive anti smuggling strategy be implement by hmrc and uk border force which reduce sale of illicit tobacco and cigarette be put in standardised packaging with all the brightly coloured glamourise imagery remove what be true for the strategy to tackle smoking be true for the challenge of vaping without much tough regulation we will not succeed in drive down vaping among child and young people regulation on packaging advertising and labelling be essential it be disappointing that the government refuse to support the amendment to the health and care bill table by my hon friend the member for city of durham mary kelly foy in november which would have prohibit brand that appeal to child on packaging the cross party health and social care committee write to the secretary of state in july state decisive action be need from both government and industry to protect child from the harmful effect of vaping an opposition day debate in july also serve to demonstrate the high level of cross party consensus on this issue yet the government have still not announce any action to address it series of important and complex issue relate to cigarette in addition to their impact on child also require government attention they include the harmful impact of disposable vape as source of plastic pollution and the fire hazard cause by the presence of battery within the vape casing there be also the alarming rise in the number of to year old who have never be smoker use cigarette as recreational activity in their own right that also require urgent attention hope the government will come forward with wide strategy to address these issue and that we will be able to scrutinise they in this house but there can be no disagreement that urgent action be need right now to stop the sale of vape to child and to halt the number of child who be become addict to nicotine no one want to undermine the vital role of cigarette in smoking cessation smoking remain far more harmful than vape and major threat to health but brightly colour branding advertising name and imagery specifically design to make vaping product attractive to child be not remotely necessary for vape to be readily available to those who can benefit from vaping as smoking cessation tool my bill be design to deliver rapid action on an issue on which there be broad consensus and that be present itself with increase urgency in family school and community right across the country my bill would ban cigarette from be advertise brand and package to appeal directly to child include online we know this will work because the same approach be so effective in reduce smoking in child we can act now to stop the harm of nicotine addiction to the physical and mental health of child and young people hope that the government will choose to support this bill and take the action need to protect child health commend it to the house question put and agree to order that helen hayes andrew gwynne rachael maskell alex cunningham mary kelly foy mrs paulette hamilton kirsten oswald

to rise today to bring before the house our landmark energy bill for its consideration this world lead historic bill conservative bill will deliver for this country clean cheap and more secure energy it will level up this country while contribute to level down bill for the british people it will unleash new technology liberate private investment in clean technology modernise and future proof our energy network and deliver for this country and for future generation the united kingdom already have great story to tell on reduce our carbon emission we have reduce our emission fast than any other nation we be the first european nation to legislate for net zero we have the first oil and gas basin dedicate to go net zero and the first second third and fourth large offshore wind farm in the world operate and generate power off the coast of great britain right now we have eliminate our reliance on coal we have grow to more than of energy be generate by renewable we have announce further investment in carbon capture usage and storage and we be press ahead with great british nuclear which launch two month ago with an exciting programme for small modular reactor we be on track to deliver gw of nuclear power on the grid by report september vol can the minister confirm that at the weekend agreement be make that have remove northern ireland from benefit from the renewable liquid fuel agreement be that the case and if so why if the hon gentleman will have patience will come to the renewable liquid heating fuel amendment later in my speech where be happy to direct any question to which he be seek answer we have do all the thing have mention while grow our economy we have cut our emission by while grow our economy by it be an inherently conservative value value close to the heart of all on the government benches to pass on what we inherit in well state to the next generation that include the state of our environment and our climate there be also no more conservative value than to ensure the security of our nation and its people and that include our energy supply on that very point security what provision be be make for day when there be no wind give that we will see the closure of most of our nuclear power station this decade and will have little else to rely on other than fossil fuel how be we go to get through my right hon friend know that be great champion of support our oil and gas industry which continue to supply large amount of our energy baseload and will do for significant amount of time to come as he also know we be invest lot of time and money into ensure that we deliver the next generation of nuclear power plant include small modular reactor so that we have the energy baseload that this country need so that as he rightly suggest when the wind do not blow and the sun do not shine people can still be assure that the light will come on the conservative principle that have speak about be at the very heart of the bill which be pleased to bring before the house today it be true that some time have pass since the bill be introduce in july last year the opposition spokesperson the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead be but boy

especially the shadow ministerial team the former scottish national party energy spokesman the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown and all on the government side for their constructive engagement in ensure that we get the bill to these final stage in state that hope will be broadly welcome by most if not all members will the minister give way would be delighted the minister refer to base energy load which be crucial in respect of nuclear energy but be also relevant to marine energy which as he know we have huge potential for around our coast particularly in scotland will he confirm that that will play an important part in the next contract for difference round and in his thinking be delighted to confirm that that will play an important part indeed we have ringfence million to support marine energy in the country we believe it have huge role to play in deliver our energy baseload indeed the innovation be make in that technology be incredibly exciting and will play huge part in our energy baseload move forward rise it be always delight to give way to the hon gentleman the minister be incredibly well mannered the irony be that we generate an enormous amount of power from onshore wind in the highland yet we face the high level of fuel poverty new clause table in my name talk about increase the community benefit in some way and widen the number of community who could benefit be aware that the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns have table similar amendment and would like to voice my support and that of the liberal democrats for it thank the hon gentleman for his constructive intervention the government recently launch consultation on community benefit because we do understand that those community be ask to host piece of critical national infrastructure should be recompense for that and that the community benefit that the individual community and group in those area receive should be enough to recompense they for what they be do in the national interest on infrastructure of national scale in order to keep people on side be it not also vital that such project be in the right place unlike the sunnica development near my constituency so that those of we who care about the agenda can support it wholeheartedly and ensure that the conservative value that the minister talk about be rightly behind the green energy revolution absolutely it be incumbent on all involved from the transmission operator to the developer national grid the electricity system operator and indeed the department and those across government to ensure that where such piece of critical national infrastructure be be build develop and plan plan be proceed with and lay in way that be conducive to local sentiment and local support and will provide for that local community for many year to come will the minister give way yes would be delighted to give way be grateful to the very polite minister as be say by the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone be sure the minister be aware that heat pump will produce about time the energy of the electricity put into they or four time for ground source heat pump they be multiplier of the power put into they the government have plan for to be instal by will we see those how many will we see next year do he have intervene target for that at the moment they be at only of where the target would have they secondly point ask in my constituency be about the new million community energy fund which relate only to england despite energy be reserve will he enlighten euan scott my constituent please order there be so much pressure on time so it be really important that intervention be short on the hon member first point absolutely we remain committed to deliver develop and roll out heat pump across the country and we remain committed to the target we have set out on the community energy fund there be already an equivalent scottish community energy fund up and run and deliver for community across scotland that be competency of the scottish government at holyrood would be delighted to direct any question that he or his constituent have on that to the scottish government in edinburgh interruption he make the case from sedentary position that energy be reserve yes but the scottish government have their own community energy fund we will base lot of what we be do on that fund as it be roll out in scotland with your leave madam deputy speaker will take some time to explain the not insubstantial number of government amendment to the house turn first to government amendment and the subsequent consequential amendment think it be fair to say that considerable concern be raise about the initial proposal for hydrogen levy the government have carefully consider those concern particularly thank my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay for his amendment on the issue and indeed the right hon member for doncaster north edward miliband for his amendment relate to those clause it be right that we take these consideration seriously and where appropriate seek to make change will the minister give way would be delighted may take the opportunity to thank my hon friend for reflect on what say in committee and for the commitment give to by the government to bring about an amendment to the bill thank he for listen to back benchers concern in committee be very pleased to take that intervention thank my right hon friend for it if he be patient will explain to the rest of the house think committee member be aware what we seek to do with the hydrogen levy as it stand the government amendment will remove provision that enable the levy to be impose on energy supplier in great britain ensure that within great britain the levy can be place only on gas shipper in the case of northern ireland the amendment seek to ensure that only gas supply licence holder who engage with gas shipping can be subject to that levy that reflect the different approach to the licensing of gas shipping across great britain and northern ireland the revise provision will provide fairer approach to funding hydrogen place the charge higher up the supply chain with the potential for cost to be spread to the sector expect to benefit most from early hydrogen development not the wide british public remind the house that the bill will also enable the option of fund hydrogen through the exchequer by provide two robust and reliable option for hydrogen funding we will help bolster industry confidence in the viability of the uk hydrogen economy and boost private investment with the potential to unlock significant energy security and economic benefit the hydrogen sector could support over job and generate up to billion in private investment by must be clear and the house should understand that the bill will not actually introduce levy on gas shipper instead it will enable the government to introduce the levy through secondary legislation it be very welcome that the levy will not be apply on household as direct cost they will see in their bill but it be something of sleight of hand just to push it far up the supply chain because it will be an energy relate cost somewhere in the supply chain that will feed down to every business and household in another way through an additional charge they will face much like vat welcome it as far as can but would rather see it remove in its entirety thank my hon friend for his contribution as we have speak about before understand his position on the levy it be our belief that in ensure that the levy be place higher up the chain the sector that will benefit most from the early development of hydrogen will bear the brunt of the cost not the wide british public that be the aim and intention of what we seek to achieve as be say the bill will not introduce the levy on to shipper instead it will enable the government to introduce the levy through secondary legislation be sure we will continue to have this debate in the month and year ahead turn to government new clause amendment and new clause and on renewable liquid heating fuel thank my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice for his work and amendment relate to renewable liquid fuel for low carbon heating his constructive work with the government have be incredibly helpful and positive also pay tribute to my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill who have be champion the use of renewable liquid fuel for low carbon heating for many year as the recent biomass strategy make clear such fuel will have critical role to play in decarbonise our economy we recognise that they have the potential to play an important role in decarbonise heat especially as not all off grid property will be suitable for electrification we will explore the potential of these fuel for heat by issue consultation within month we want to take the power now to support the use of these fuel in heat in the future should they be need that be why we table government new clause take power to impose obligation on heating fuel supplier to increase the supply of renewable liquid heating fuel in my constituency we have particular issue with commercial and domestic use because resident be often in the same building as commercial property it would be helpful for the minister to look at the definition of heat network system so that ofgem can understand what system qualify as heat network in domestic property which be real issue in my constituency the measure in the bill will provide the government with power to implement heat network zone in england those include power to develop nationwide methodology for identify and designate area as heat network zone and to establish new zone co ordinator role which we generally expect will be fill by local government though my hon friend be free to apply with responsibility for designate area as heat network zone and enforce requirement in they they also include power require heat network develop in zone to meet low carbon requirement and to ensure that certain building and heat source connect to heat network in zone within specific timeframe the relevant minister in the department and will be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss how that will be relevant to her urban constituency as we move forward and seek to implement these proposal join the minister in thank my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice for lead on the measure include in new clause on the renewable liquid heating fuel obligation the minister say that he would do consultation within the next month many of my constituent who be off grid also want secondary legislation to come through in the next month can he assure the house that that be his intention can confirm that we will move to consultation in the next few month indeed we will use the power to support the use of those fuel in heat in future should they be need again as we move through the consultation period other ministers in the department and would be delighted to meet my hon friend and all member concerned understand that this issue affect many constituency across the country and rightly interest many right hon and hon member as we move forward with the consultation and towards implement the power we will be delighted to meet member welcome government new clause and which be of particular value to those live in certain part of the country such as north east scotland as the minister be very much aware will he join in reinforce and emphasise the benefit of development in sustainable aviation fuel and renewable liquid heating fuel respectively particularly in aberdeenshire yes be very pleased to welcome development in renewable liquid heating fuel the consultation which will be uk wide will benefit those live in rural constituency such as banff and buchan and those across north east scotland and rural britain welcome the support for the sustainable aviation fuel amendment to which will refer shortly to back up the point make by the hon member for banff and buchan david duguid standard consultation and the legislation be in place in month do not show the necessary urgency that be the point that unite many people the minister with his thompson gun approach to spit thing out get that one out very quickly but we need it do an awful lot more quickly than start within month this government will probably be go in month be determined to work very hard to ensure that this government will not be go in month however we be take the power now to ensure support for the use of these fuel in heat in future if need should make clear that we be start the consultation within the next month not in month it will be within the next year there be vast rural housing network in northern ireland of so many household and there be overreliance on heating oil what be the arrangement for use renewable liquid fuel in northern ireland once again thank the hon gentleman for his question be just about to answer his original question can confirm that official from the department for energy security and net zero in london have be in discussion with northern ireland official who be broadly content with the government approach on this issue however conversation will continue with northern ireland official on what we can do to support renewable liquid heating fuel in northern ireland once again as on the other issue have specify would be delighted to meet the hon gentleman and colleague from across northern ireland to discuss how this government can ensure that the support deliver in great britain can be replicate in northern ireland turn back to my comment on renewable liquid heating fuel with regard to amendment the power in clause relate only to the planned clean heat market mechanism for which the government focus be on support the development of the market for electric heat pump we do not believe that expand the power set out here be necessary to allow for boiler burn renewable liquid fuel to be instal or use in the light of those step hope my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth be reassure by the government action and will feel able not to press the amendment turn to government new clause and and new clause on sustainable aviation fuel thank my right hon friend the member for epsom and ewell chris grayling for his constructive engagement with and colleague at the department for transport this government be commit to ensure that the uk sustainable aviation fuel programme be one of the most comprehensive in the world that be why in the bill we be commit to publish consultation on the option for design and implement revenue certainty scheme within six month of it be pass we will also update parliament within month on the development of sustainable aviation fuel revenue certainty scheme as the secretary of state for transport my right hon friend the member for forest of dean mr harper set out in write ministerial statement yesterday that build on our commitment to deliver revenue certainty scheme for domestic sustainable aviation fuel production by the end of the intention be that the scheme will be industry fund alongside that we have publish plan for deliver the scheme which contain timeline of key milestone such as public consultation on option an associated government response design phase and delivery and legislative step thank my hon friend for his constructive approach on this issue could seek one more assurance when the consultation be finish will the government review the likelihood of secure the investment we want if there be still doubt will he ensure that discussion take place about whether the government should play part in that potentially at future fiscal event can give my right hon friend that assurance and go far that commitment alongside our million advanced fuel fund and the world lead saf mandate will help to provide strong market signal and incentive to drive the demand and supply of saf from sustainable source future funding decision on saf will be consider as part of the next spending review would like to turn briefly to community energy thank my hon friend the member for wantage david johnston for his continued engagement on the bill particularly his championing of community energy alongside many other in this house the government recognise that community energy project can have real benefit for the community in which they be base and be keen to ensure that they deliver value for money for consumer that be why we have launch new million community energy fund which expand on the success of the previous rural community energy fund to enable both rural and urban community across england to access grant funding to develop local renewable energy project for investment it be fantastic that the government have announce the new fund to help community energy scheme get off the ground that be very welcome step could my hon friend outline what step he will take to remove the barrier that prevent community energy scheme from access local market can indeed be delighted to tell my hon friend that alongside our propose fund we be commit to publish an annual report to parliament and to consult on the barrier the sector face when develop project be also very pleased to announce that his majesty government have reach an agreement with the scottish government to amend the bill to secure their support for legislative consent motion in the scottish parliament the comprehensive set of amendment agree with the administration in edinburgh will strengthen the bill consultation provision and require the secretary of state to seek the consent of devolve ministers before exercise power under clause and would also like to take this opportunity to confirm to the house and to the scottish government that by virtue of clause the regulatory cost the gema can recover from gas and electricity licence holder from across great britain include any cost it occur perform the scottish licensing function the government be disappoint that the welsh government have decide not to support the legislative consent motion for the bill in the senedd however as sign of good faith the government will extend the amendment agree with the scottish government to apply in wales and northern ireland where appropriate number of government amendment for consideration on report relate to commencement they ensure that clause such as those relate to the smart meter roll out and low carbon heat scheme will come into force as soon as the bill gain royal assent the remain government amendment be technical in nature and as such do not propose to discuss any of they in great detail be sure madam deputy speaker be delighted thank the minister for give way but notice that can not see any mention in the amendment of stand charge know that be very difficult thing but in my constituency there be great deal of concern about the fact that there be no uniformity in the united kingdom on stand charge my constituent can pay around year more than people elsewhere in the country do the government have any intention to address that issue along with issue such as domestic insulation thank the hon lady very much for her intervention and her question be engage with ofgem on that very issue and be look to convene meeting in edinburgh with all the significant player involve in energy transmission and production in scotland at the early available opportunity so we can discuss the issue regard stand charge and other issue that affect scottish bill payer would be very delighted to engage with she as we move towards that meeting take place the minister may have hear on the world at one on radio last week the head of ovo energy talk about the movement for the cost of transmission from the unit price to the stand charge price which have ramp up standing charge and be very concern to many people because that disproportionately impact poor bill payer will he look at that issue and discuss it with ofgem at his meeting yes can confirm that will raise that issue with ofgem at my next meeting and at the next available opportunity have to meet the chairman of the energy security and net zero committee will certainly have an answer for he on that question in the then coalition government cut all the energy efficiency programme plunge million of people into debt what plan do he have to ensure there be an insulation programme to provide desperately need energy efficiency right across home and household this be the big piece of energy legislation ever pass by the british parliament we be drive forward with scheme to help insulate house drive down bill and deliver clean and more secure energy and all we can get from the opposition be criticism we have ramp up our renewable energy production to over we have eliminate coal we be develop new nuclear which the opposition fail to do over year in government rather than carp from the sideline it would be useful if opposition back benchers get on board support the bill and support our great british company develop the technology to take this country forward create the new job ensure security of supply and drive towards net zero which mean we will leave this country and the planet in well place for the next generation instead of try to score political point at the expense of this government who be seek to deliver for the british people as such be immensely proud of the bill it be strong before and it be even strong now it be as have just say the single big piece of energy legislation ever to be bring before the house rise be afraid will not give way the bill be revolution in community energy restart our nuclear sector regulate for fusion develop carbon capture usage and storage support the technology of the future liberate private finance develop our own oil and gas reserve build an energy network of the future to secure our energy supply secure our energy base so we be power britain from britain grow our economy invest to ensure low bill and drive towards clean future that be what the bill achieve it be bring here and deliver today by the conservative government move the country forward into bright more secure and clean future therefore mr deputy speaker with great pleasure commend the new clause and amendment to the house rise order as member can see there be great interest in this debate be therefore ponder exactly what the time limit will be member will be inform just before dave doogan speak believe interruption it will not apply to the labour front bencher the hon gentleman can be relieve the minister be quite right the bill have be with we for rather long time be personally delighted that it be before we this afternoon but we need to remember that second reading be over year ago in july in another place the bill have survive four secretary of state and two departments in its passage through the house so it certainly should be an improved bill by now be concern however that the long passage of the bill to the statute book have have real effect on investor and various other people seek to invest in the low carbon economy we should not forget that what be this bill about as the minister have say it be essentially about the decarbonisation of the energy system and make that system fit for net zero it be overwhelmingly bill that enable that decarbonisation to take place and it have be describe in number of instance as green plumbing bill which think be not bad description it provide the necessary mechanism and the detail of how we will reach our target in variety of area as the minister say on hydrogen on carbon capture and storage on licensing on the introduction of an independent system operator which be very important to good construction on low carbon heat scheme on district heating on energy save appliance and on fusion power it also make number of regulation change in relation to civil nuclear decommissioning and oil and gas management it be moreover bill that the opposition have welcome both for its extent and for its green plumbing activity we be supportive of its measure in committee while also table amendment that we think would strengthen its approach indeed the government have insert some of they in the bill with very slight change and we welcome that as well however in my view the bill be incomplete and unsatisfactory give its ambition as green decarbonisation bill in that it fail to complete the three test or task that be necessary to provide the clarity and consistency that would ensure that the policy will deliver what be claim those test be these first what be the target for policy and how firm be they secondly what be the technical mean whereby the propose target can be action thirdly what be the plan both financially and procedurally to make the target real and not just hot air aspiration it be essential to the process of energy decarbonisation for all three of those test to be in the bill as we proceed against very tight timescale and immense challenge of implementation in some instance the bill have succeed in that regard the government target be set out in number of document on clean energy such as the energy security strategy and the energy white paper indeed in number of instance the target contain in those document have be substantially add to in the bill for example the target of gw of low carbon hydrogen production by have be underpin by the clause relate to such matter as hydrogen levy management procedure applaud the government change of heart on the hydrogen levy although number of committee member knowingly vote the wrong way with the honourable exception of the right hon member for elmet and rothwell alec shelbrooke the government have put that right now we would have like to see they go little far with clear statement that the money would come from the consolidated fund but we will live with the change that they have undertake to make think we can count that as both win for our pressure on the bill and win for the bill itself agree that those three test for decarbonisation make lot of sense but do the hon gentleman agree that as well as target for some of the good stuff we need to see the government stop do the bad stuff in this case the bad stuff be more and more new licence for oil and gas in the north sea would labour support my amendment which would see an end to the mer rule on maximise the economic recovery of petroleum and replace it with just transition to green economy as long as we have statutory duty to maximise the economic recovery of oil and gas it do not matter how many target we have on renewable because we will not meet the target that we need to meet do not think it would be appropriate for to indicate exactly which amendment from various member we might or might not support and it would take great deal of time for to do so but the hon member will recall that we table an amendment on maximum economic recovery in committee think she can take from that that broadly speak we support the principle of stop do the bad thing and start do the good thing whether the detail of her new clause fit exactly with that picture be another matter but hope she can take some encouragement from that do the hon gentleman accept that while the government may have set out the high level ambition and target they have fail to highlight the cost of this bill to ordinary constituent think for example of the cost of bring property up to certain energy efficiency level the size of the hydrogen levy and who will pay it when it be introduce the cost of sustainable aviation fuel to the aviation industry and the cost of fly could go on that have not be spell out because there be dishonesty here and the burden will fall on ordinary people it be not for to defend how the government have manage their arrangement as far as the cost of these measure be concern but would say more generally that we have to cast this bill in term of how much it would cost we as consumer and other if we do not do these thing over the next period we need to consider the cost to people bill people life and people welfare if we simply stand aside and ignore do the thing that be necessary for decarbonisation can honestly say that in the long term the overall cost of do these thing would be far more on the save side for customer and the general public than the issue that be before we at the moment the government have do number of thing in this bill mention the measure on hydrogen which welcome in term of meet hon member concern we be also pleased to see that the government have table amendment on other issue of concern to member such as sustainable aviation fuel and new clause on liquid fuel be keen to see process start now that lead to our secure the investment we need to ensure that sustainable aviation fuel be available for our industry and give the timeframe be keen to see both party make commitment to that in their manifesto can the hon gentleman give an assurance that the opposition also support this move towards develop sustainable aviation fuel industry in this country understand the right hon gentleman concern about what the shortly to appear labour government will be do on these matter although hope that he will not go about spread defeatism on his own side as future labour government we be very concerned about the need to develop sustainable aviation fuel in cost effective and timely manner we understand that this be substantial element of the transition that will be undertake in aviation but we have to be careful that we do not procure all the resource that might go to other thing for use in make sustainable aviation fuel because there be many other thing that can be do with those fuel we need balance between the various possible candidate for what would go into sustainable aviation fuel for the future be pleased that the government have also make concession on liquid fuel heating obligation in other area despite have ample opportunity and time to put additional material in the bill indeed the government have put substantial amount of additional material in the bill with our support they have not take the opportunity to place in legislation the three test that mention which be why our amendment concentrate on those emission member have be very enthusiastic in table amendment to strengthen the bill on report and many of the issue raise be similar or identical to the issue we raise in committee be particularly impress by the amendment table by the right hon member for kingswood chris skidmore as well as new clause on onshore wind table by the right hon member for reading west sir alok sharma there be amendment on coal fracke flaring and venting amendment on number of issue would strengthen the bill include new clause table by the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns which would address china solar panel and the uyghur population the hon gentleman mention boiler and number of organisation include green alliance action for warm homes power for people and energy uk have produce brief that point to how infrequently such bills come around there be great change in energy technology and in world event but they be not mirror in parliament both side of the house should commit to not cram everything into one energy bill every decade give how thing be change in this sphere parliament should address it far more frequently than every decade if the hon gentleman contain himself he will see that we have table an amendment on low carbon energy in home agree that we can not put everything in bill but because of the urgency of the commitment we be make with this bill it be important that we get as much clarity as possible on what we be do in the bill now so we know where we be go and the way we be do so have discuss those other amendment will now draw attention to labour amendment hope the house will understand why we have draft they in this way and how that relate to the test mention on our new clause the government say they support community and local energy indeed as the minister say the government have put modest amount of funding into support community energy but as the hon member for hastings and rye sally ann hart who be not in her place now say we still do not have an understanding of how community energy can actually work we think community energy will be an important part of the decarbonisation process it be not one of the large shiny thing upon which money will be lavish in large amount but in aggregate it will have huge impact on decarbonise energy in this country the government still have not introduce arrangement that will enable local power producer to trade locally and get the proper value of their trade which be vital to the success and certainty of these project labour want to support local energy project practically particularly through the valley of death period where the pocket of community energy be usually shallow than need for all the planning permission to run their course with support from great british energy and local authority we propose that million year will eventually support the important role of community and local energy in decarbonise power if this electrical revolution be to take off many more people will need to buy electric car and heat pump do the hon gentleman have any advice for the government on how those item can be make more popular and more affordable the government and have be in considerable discussion about precisely that point we need to make sure we change the model of ownership of those device we perhaps need to have long debate about that on another occasion my hon friend be make an important point about new clause which stand in his name and those of his front bench colleague be not it the case at the moment that the grid the national grid and the local distribution network do not have duty to positively engage with small scale and community electricity supplier to encourage they on to the grid and instead just put they at the bottom of list that be first come first serve the new clause will start to change that approach which be supportive and nurture in its essence my hon friend be absolutely right the campaign that he may be refer to be sign up to by the minister when he be not minister he may have some other view on that these day but the new clause be not too far from the original document that he sign while ago be go to have to make some rapid progress so be sorry to say that will not be able to take any further intervention however will try to get through the measure we be propose as quickly as possible in order to allow other member who be burst to get into the debate the time to do that our new clause deal with delinke renewable and gas price mechanism should be in place to ensure that the dividend from renewable power cost and price can come through to customer however as we have see in the recent power crisis that be not the case at the moment gas price surge to nine time the price of renewable power at some stage during the energy crisis and be still substantially more expensive than those of renewable but they rule the roost as far as energy price for the retail market be concern through marginal cost pricing we think that need to change through delinke the process and we wish to put an amendment in that would ensure that that happen so that the benefit of renewable power can come to customer in the way that the whole house would intend to happen new clause deal with onshore wind three minute before the bill come to the floor of the house write statement on onshore wind be make by the minister have have chance to read it quickly and it seem to as though it still treat onshore wind as special case and not as an ordinary case of local infrastructure project which should receive no well and no bad consideration than any other such project onshore wind be essential to the decarbonisation of our energy system but we have just let it collapse over considerable period by in effect ban it the government be take grandmother footstep back from the ban but this be still not good enough be one of the architect of what the hon gentleman describe as ban he will understand that when onshore wind be no long permit across the uk this catalyse the offshore industry and we become world leader in offshore wind precisely because developer then choose to go offshore offshore wind have many advantage not least its scale the size of the turbine and the single point of connection to the grid onshore wind have none of those virtue that be remarkably like say be encourage you to use your second car because shoot the tyre out of your first car the right hon member make quite ridiculous statement first onshore wind be the cheap form of power available secondly it can be available for community and local energy in the way describe early thirdly through cfds it can systemically provide cheap power environment for the population as whole it be disgrace that only two turbine have be commission in this country since february it be golden opportunity for decarbonisation that we be miss completely on that point will my hon friend give way say would not but will my hon friend be be very generous do he agree that the failure to roll out onshore wind be cost family year because of lack of investment lack of investment do indeed have direct impact if we go back and look at what could have be the case and look at what be the case now there be direct link between energy price now and the lack of development of onshore wind our amendment which we hope to push to vote would make the way that onshore wind be treat simple and straightforward it should be treat no differently from any other local infrastructure project there should be the same protection safeguard and concern for people who have that local infrastructure come their way it should not be special case over and above other project which think will produce an explosion of investment in onshore wind in future on that point will the hon gentleman give way no have to make progress new clause national warmer homes and businesses action plan no address another area in which the government have set out their aspiration the minister have say that the government be make progress on their aspiration to retrofit home as set out in their national energy plan and the white paper power our net zero future those aspiration include have all home at an epc band standard by and all private rent property at band by however nowhere be there any plan about how we be actually go to do that or how home that be among the bad insulate in europe can be lift to the level need by the government be stick with aspiration but no plan our new clause put plan in place it put those aspiration into legislation and require government plan to bring they about which would be another enormous win for decarbonisation people energy bill will fall fuel poverty will be tackle and gas supply in retrofit property will reduce by perhaps it would be win all round the government have no plan labour have substantial plan which have already be put forward include year programme to uprate and retrofit million home cost billion per annum by the second part of the next labour government with local authority and community base get it do that will transform the present pretty paltry progress that have be make admittedly there have be good progress in some area include the energy company obligation the local authority delivery scheme the home upgrade grant and other scheme but who can forget the spectacular failure of the government green home grant little while ago our new clause will transform the way that work and we want it to be add to the bill new clause be closely associate with new clause but address the private rent sector new clause be very important we want to see the decarbonisation of our energy power and electricity system by the government ambition at the moment be mostly to decarbonise the power system by but again they have no plan as to how that will actually happen they have give no indication as to what step they will take to achieve this and they be certainly begin to fail in the implementation of carbon budget bring forward the decarbonisation of the power system would greatly enhance that and allow we to meet our target labour want to see the complete decarbonisation of the system by that do involve massive uplift in the rate of progress for example in offshore wind by five in solar by three and in onshore by two and indeed the development of other renewable in that regard recommend that hon member have look at new clause will the hon gentleman give way no will not give way again my hon friend the member for birkenhead mick whitley have particularly interesting new clause on tidal range with the right effort and the right investment huge acceleration of build out can be achieve indeed we have set out our plan on how to do that over the next period what we need be for that ambition and those plan to be in legislation and in the bill now the minister do not give any indication in his contribution of whether the government will move towards any of these amendment but we hope to press some of they to vote this afternoon however have to say that we do so within the general setting that we be supportive of the bill we want it to succeed but we want it to succeed with our bit add on not least because this be the bill that we will inherit when we be in government shortly we will then have to do all the work that the government have set out in the bill finally let say to those hon member who be think of vote against our amendment that they contain the government own ambition what we be try to do be to put the government own ambition into legislation and provide way by which it can be achieve if hon member decide to vote against these change this afternoon they will at least in some measure be vote against their own government hope that they will have sufficient sense to make sure that they do not do so as far as this bill be concern order as member can see there be many people who wish to take part in this debate know that alok sharma will show self restraint but we will be impose time limit to ensure that we get in as many people as we can the debate be very time limit the multiple vote will come at so ask people to show restraint even on the time limit that impose thank you mr deputy speaker do support the overall aim of the bill but in the interest of brevity will limit my comment to new clause on onshore wind thank all colleague who have co sign this new clause which of course build on the excellent work that my right hon friend the member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke lead last year when try to put in place more permissive planning regime for onshore wind onshore wind be one of the cheap source of energy available it be also one of the quick to deploy get more home grow clean energy deploy be about enhance our energy security our climate security and our national security all of which be totally interlinked it be also ultimately about bring down bill that be why onshore wind need to be meaningful part of diversified energy mix we currently have gw of instal onshore wind capacity across the uk with the ability to power around million home however as we all know due to planning rule change since we have have de facto ban on onshore wind just one objection be able to defeat planning application frankly that be not sensible way for planning process to operate as result in england planning permission have be grant for just wind turbine over the past five year it be also worth point out that have onshore wind annual build out rate stay at the average pre ban level an extra gw would have be add by last winter that be the equivalent of power million home for the entire winter and it would have avoid between and of the uk annual net gas import be burn in our power station do my right hon friend accept on the cost argument that we also need to build new gas turbine station as back up for when the wind do not blow we do need diversified energy system and think the minister set out all the work that be go on on nuclear for example however as we drive forward for great energy security we need to change the planning rule to allow more onshore wind the objective of new clause be to ensure more permissive planning regime the new clause seek to lift the current planning restriction that in effect mean that single objection can block development it also seek to ensure that local community willing to take onshore wind development will receive direct community benefit the government have today respond to new clause by bring forward write ministerial statement on onshore wind thank the government for the constructive dialogue we have have over the past day on this issue acknowledge that that write ministerial statement and indeed the accompany change to the national planning policy framework move thing forward and will help to deliver more permissive planning regime for onshore wind the de facto ban be lift the statement clarify that the policy intent be not to allow very limited objection or even single objection to ban planning application and it be explicit that local community willing to host onshore wind farm should directly benefit include potentially through energy discount that be positive but we do need to see the government formal response to their consultation on this issue to understand the detail of the precise mechanism by which the benefit regime will work also welcome the fact that local plan will not be the only route to deliver more onshore wind with more agile and target route available of course it be now requirement for local planning authority to support community lead initiative for renewable and low carbon energy vitally those policy change be effective today the right hon gentleman talk about bill payer but for the previous wind that be build under renewable obligation certificate there be big profit because the price be denominate in gas under the cfds money be not go to the bill payer but to the government it be cream off the top the mechanism have to change applaud what he be try to say and do but there be missing link on how the bill payer will see benefit as they should the hon gentleman will know that onshore wind have be back as part of the cfd process in the last couple of year be very happy at future date to have detailed discussion on that but in the interest of time will move on understand that some people would like the planning regime for onshore wind to be even more permissive and for onshore wind to be treat like any other infrastructure get that but we also have to recognise that it have be contentious issue in the past and it be important that we take community with we on this journey that be why the community benefit mechanism will be so vital frankly people respond well to carrot than to stick my right hon friend talk about the importance of take people with we more wind power will need more energy storage so that we can smooth out for the time when the wind be not blow do he agree that the sort of lithium ion battery storage plant that be proliferate in our country be in need of proper permitting my new clause which have be discuss with my hon friend the minister will help to bring in that sort of permit and ensure that lithium ion battery storage facility be sit in the right place certainly agree with my right hon friend that we need more battery storage that be be roll out and be pleased that she have have discussion with the minister in conclusion welcome the write ministerial statement because it move we forward it be for that reason that we will not seek to press new clause to division start by pay tribute to my predecessor in this role my hon friend the member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown whose work on energy particularly on access to clean and affordable energy be exceptional base my ambition in this role on his record also note the minister kind remark about my hon friend and thank he for they want to highlight the abject abandonment of community own energy project in this bill it be patently obvious that any just transition to net zero be simply not possible if local community can not sell the energy they produce to local customer local energy trading provide manifold improvement include low price protection against price shock enhance energy security network redundancy and return on investment back to community the uk government kicking this can down the road be hammer blow to effort to achieve just transition and they be do so without even try to disguise the fact worse still they have instead provide paltry million over two year the minister leave out the over two year bit to fund feasibility study in england that be not seedcorn funding it be chicken feed serve up with extra disdain for scotland and wales as the uk government have steadfastly refuse to apply barnett consequential to this admittedly pitiful sum fundamentally this sop to tory back benchers do not as one of the minister back benchers say remove the barrier prevent community energy scheme from sell their power locally the local electricity bill would have do that as would amendment make to the energy bill have they not be remove by ministers in committee in july why be this tory government so loth to put power in the hand of the people turn to nuclear english mps maintain an endure obsession with nuclear their total failure to concede or even rationally acknowledge the catastrophic decommissioning and clean up cost of that energy source be by any measure incredible as they drag scotland and wales along with they for the ride it be almost as if those english mp and indeed the government can foresee time in the not too distant future when they will need to buy scotland energy rather than just take it as they have get use to do over recent decade nuclear be their insurance policy against scotland independent future new nuclear be millstone around the neck of our net zero future consume disproportionate cost per megawatt hour if we contrast nuclear with offshore wind we see that although construction cost for nuclear continue to spiral out of control and smr nuclear continue not to get off the ground the cost of offshore wind have fall by in decade new offshore wind project come online within the next two year will be pay about per mwh which be half the wholesale power price of per mwh forecast until at least the end of the decade and less than the per mwh of electricity from hinkley nuclear power plant tory and labour members alike will cry this be all about baseload for when the wind do not am surprised they have not do so already of course that be correct we do need baseload but it do not have to be nuclear if successive westminster governments have invest nearly as much rhetoric and taxpayer money create renewable energy mix as they have do for nuclear we would be in very different place it would be place where tidal flow and barrage scheme complement widespread impoundment pump storage and run of river hydro scheme together with green hydrogen production battery storage solar on every appropriate elevation of domestic or commercial property and timely delivery of carbon capture usage and storage the hon gentleman make point that must be recognise and understand for the future before hinkley point be commission the question be of provide gw of nuclear baseload rather than just gw of baseload and of see whether there could be mix of green energy as he argue or if it would have to be nuclear energy by prescribe the way the government have in the past while stick to index link cfd price nuclear be way to make and print money very quickly my hon friend be correct over and above the self evident environmental consequence of nuclear the way in which this and successive westminster government have fiscally mismanage the pursuit of nuclear leave nothing to the imagination to continue my remark we do not live in that place we live here in broke break britain the bill fail the people on energy once again because it be bereft of strategy and completely lose control of cost if we want to evidence such calamitous incompetence we need look no far than auction round or more specifically the strike price therein that price threaten to kill off construction ready project from that auction round at the very good it will mean even less of the additional supply chain value land in domestic company and local worker bank account far deepen the cost of living crisis penny wise pound foolish contrast that with the strategic ambition of the scottish government who be invest in community by maximise the economic supply chain and employment opportunity of onshore and offshore wind with up to billion of developer supply chain commitment on average across scotland have see the extraordinary investment and opportunity at montrose port in my angus constituency with seagreen but we need sustained investment to win those crucial multipli effect and make the just transition systemic reality for our community welcome the hon member to his new role and pay tribute to his predecessor the hon member for kilmarnock and loudoun alan brown the hon member give whole list of reason why there would be an absence of baseload in scotland but think may have miss the point where he suggest how that baseload would be supplement in the absence of nuclear could he clarify that do it include new gas fire power station in peterhead with carbon capture usage and storage the hon gentleman be entirely correct he do miss highlight what would replace that baseload and refer he to hansard after today debate the challenge of inflation and interest rate have alter the parameter to such an extent that this government pretence that it be business as usual be breathtaking have they not see what happen in the recent auction round in spain or conversely what happen in ireland when the irish government intervene to protect investment in renewable and reap the benefit and reward for their economy if project do slip from allocation round as result of an unrealistic strike price where do minister think the supply chain capacity the skilled worker and the specialist vessel will go they will not wait around here wait for the department to get its sum right they will be off to the us and the eu to access commercially cogent incentive package such as those find in the inflation reduction act or the eu net zero industry act the stake could not be high for both net zero commitment and uk energy price be proud that the snp have work to protect people from the bad effect of the westminster cost of live crisis with our amendment to the bill with step that would protect the next phase of contract for difference project within properly provide for comprehensive and complementary mix of energy storage solution advance local supply right and work towards support our most vulnerable with the development of social tariff especially for those with high energy use cause by medical condition be pleased that the snp new clause will be put to vote this evening and urge all member to support that provision which while modest in scope would have profoundly positive effect on many in our rural constituency who live off the grid and have to heat their home through liquid fuel rise order before the hon gentleman make his intervention inform the house that there will be four minute time limit on back benchers introduce from the start the hon gentleman mention small issue that make big difference the energy bill support scheme which be very harsh end far too soon and have cause an awful lot of problem this have be cover by radio and people have write letter about it have letter here from stourport in the constituency of the hon member for wyre forest mark garnier who be member of my energy security and net zero committee people the length and breadth of the uk be feel the harshness of the government penny pinch and tight deadline and those who live in caravan park or on boat be be especially hammer by this this government should listen and make difference one of the big thing affect people watch this debate today be that they be not get that for the last year agree entirely and echo the call from my scottish national party westminster leader my hon friend the member for aberdeen south stephen flynn who want to see the support package reintroduce the idea that the pressure on household budget from energy price have somehow go away be for the bird energy security be not some abstract area of government policy nor be the purchase of energy discretionary one for home and business in our constituency fail to legislate and plan strategically in this area as westminster have do in perpetuity be the very reason people be face the choice between heating and eat it be the same reason that businesse across these island have close their door due to energy cost the exorbitant cost of energy in the uk be function of supply side constraint and this government have compound that through incompetence inaction lack of ambition penny wise pound foolish misadventure and their obsession with nuclear just imagine how much more perilous the situation for energy consumer in england would be if they never have scotland energy powerhouse to shore up this government incompetence and spaffe money on nuclear left right and centre this bill be an opportunity to make up lose ground and catch up with function union the united states and the european union but as usual the dysfunctional united kingdom get it wrong again and it be ordinary taxpayer and bill payer who will pick up the piece and pay the cost there be one reason why household in energy rich scotland be face fuel poverty and haemorrhage household budget on energy cost and it be sit in this chamber the uk government remind member of the four minute limit core pillar of this bill be the delivery of safe secure and resilient uk energy system but no energy system can be safe and secure when it risk undermine our food security and contravene our value by use force labour throughout its supply chain we live in contested world and there be no doubt that energy security be one of the great challenge of our time but we can have no security when our energy system be riddle with force labour from hostile state the use of force labour specifically uyghur force labour in supply chain not only contradict our ethical and moral value but undermine our fight for human right across the globe we can not go green on uyghur blood red labour beyond the moral there be serious commercial and security risk british and international manufacturer that do not use slave labour that abide by our modern slavery law be be price out and undercut by chinese supplier that do not care that contravene all notion of fair market competition and punish those who play by the rule support only the communist people republic of china state back enterprise we be unnecessarily undermine our security when we do not tackle this problem turn to the two new clause that table will not move new clause but will make the point that it be about move to rooftop first strategy we must make sure that we stop target the good and most versatile land at my last count solar plant be currently propose in lincolnshire and border county total acre of good arable land that be wrong but as say will not move the new clause my hon friend be entirely right in her argument but this be not just about the overall number of site individual project take up over acre in my constituency industrialise piece of beautiful english countryside and destroy the life of five village in fact if anything my hon friend clause do not go far enough thank my right hon friend who as always make very valid point in my own constituency one village will be encircle by solar that will be foot high in one of the area that produce the great food in our country these solar farm make absolutely no sense to people when we be in food security crisis but also tenant farmer be be oust the landowner often live mile and mile away and could not give two hoot about the land they be sell off and it do not work we need really strong steer from government which we be promise in our prime ministerial leadership campaign last year my hon friend be absolutely right farmer want to conserve and to grow the food of this nation they do not want to turn to solar which landowner be often do far to the intervention make by my hon friend the member for stroud siobhan baillie meanwhile solar on building be absent one drive around the country and see huge warehouse commercial building and office block with not solar panel to be see those panel be go on to land that should be grow food to produce the food security that this country need food security and energy security combine mean national resilience absolutely agree that be why still urge the government to bring forward strategy on rooftop solar they can do so turn to new clause the uk have tough modern slavery law it be evident that we want to do something about that issue but we can not outsource the protection of human right there be developer who utilise force labour in their supply chain who not only violate our ethical and moral value but as say pose commercial risk we can not be reliant on uyghur slave labour alan crawford and laura murphy recently release landmark report into the use of uyghur force labour in solar supply chain they have make very clear that across the uk there be just too much some of all solar that be build in the uk be affect and of all polysilicon and solar panel around the world come from xinjiang they be make with slave labour it be shocking to see that five page of the recent report from sheffield hallam be dedicate to just one supplier canadian solar which be plan to build in this country and be serial applicant these same company be tariff dodge repeatedly and try to hide the reality of what they be do my new clause be very straightforward it seek to increase transparency when minister make decision on proposal of this magnitude they should have full sight of whether there be force slave labour within the application currently minister make decision on nationally significant infrastructure project have no idea if the vast majority of the product to be put on british soil will be make with slave labour hope this will deter these company and force they to finally choose to produce polysilicon without slave labour there be no onus on the government there be no cost implication for they and be not force their be ask for transparency not least give that the us and the eu have both bring forward enormous bills that deal with force uyghur labour in their country or their area of influence we have do nothing and the reality be that we never walk the walk but just talk the talk when it come to the uyghur can not think of one piece of legislation that this government have bring forward since my election that deal with uyghur slave labour yet we go to beijing and then claim that we have raise it base on no reality unfortunately have hear absolutely nothing today to reassure that we genuinely want to deal with this and that we recognise that it be not just in solar but across the energy footprint and be not just in china but in other place where component be make with slave labour therefore at the moment be minded to press the new clause to make sure that we finally deal with the reality of what we be face and get some transparency within the system for our ministers the hon member will have our full support if she do press the new clause we should add another argument which be that the country that use force labour especially china have commercial advantage and we be go to find ourselves dependent upon they for energy source in the future could not agree more with the right hon gentleman that be the exactly the point would make the new clause speak for itself this be about transparency and finally deal with the forced labour be impose on our countryside the path we choose today will define not just define our value but the legacy that we leave for future generation and for our child hope the house will make the right choice rise to speak in support of new clause table in my name concern tidal range power in the world first ever tidal power station become operational on the rance river in brittany more than year later the station be less than halfway through its predict lifespan of year and be continue to generate an annual output of approximately gwh of clean energy since then the station have be surpass in scale and generating capacity by the sihwa lake tidal power station in south korea the proven success of these scheme over many decade demonstrate the enormous potential of tidal range generation as renewable indigenous source of net zero energy when confront by the existential challenge of climate collapse and the necessity of decarbonise our energy system as well as the need to guarantee our energy security in an increasingly volatile global energy market believe we now need to be look with new urgency at the role that tidal range generation have to play in the united kingdom future energy mix the uk more than any other country in the world be uniquely position to harness the power of our tide we have the second high tidal range in the world and half of all of europe tidal energy capacity be find in britain already well develop plan for tidal range project across the west coast promise to mobilise and deliver gw of net zero energy with the potential for gw of additional capacity in merseyside alone the much anticipated mersey tidal power project could generate enough energy to power million home yet we have consistently fail to harness the awesome power of our tide while there have be some welcome progress in the development of small tidal stream technology in recent year lead to tidal stream inclusion in the fourth allocation of the contract for difference scheme the possibility of large scale tidal range generation have be largely ignore by the government since the decision in by the then business secretary to deny funding for the swansea tidal lagoon there be only pass mention of tidal in last year energy security strategy and tidal range be not cover by this bill it have be exclude entirely from the national policy statement on energy infrastructure project be assure that this situation will be rectify when the revise nps for energy be publish later this year the aim of my amendment be simple it seek to establish funding for an independent and evidence lead study into the opportunity and risk of tidal range generation as the vital first step towards establish investor and government confidence in this technology this study be central task of the british hydropower association which represent the interest of the uk hydropow community the study would consider the role of tidal range generation in the uk future energy mix and the role that tidal range as predictable and reliable energy source have to play in meet our energy need at time when seasonal factor and weather system interrupt supply from solar and wind the study would also consider how tidal range project in close proximity to major population centre include merseyside and bristol can help we overcome the transmission and supply issue that continue to plague our energy grid which constitute in the view of many expert the big stumbling block to the decarbonisation of our energy system it would also take whole system approach to consider how we should well fund new tidal range project the most often cite barrier to the development of tidal range installation be the cost of their construction but with operation lifespan of century or more their cost be more comparable to that of new nuclear and even offshore wind it be vital that we look seriously at how other form of financing include the regulated asset base model recently apply to new nuclear can help we in kick start tidal range generation support government new clause and welcome their bring it forward have table amendment and new clause and each of which in different way seek to give the government the power they need to extend the exist renewable transport fuel obligation so that it might cover domestic heating fuel for off grid property government new clause achieve that create the same power by replicate section of the energy act and therefore will not press my amendment or new clause to division thank the minister for the work he have put in on this we have discuss it many time and know he have work hard to get cross government consensus also welcome the minister commitment to consultation some member have question the timing of it but we all have to be realistic about how long these thing can take and the fact that consultation need to be do properly and we should therefore accept in good faith the undertaking he have give at the dispatch box today so support that want to address point raise early by the hon member for north antrim ian paisley and reassure he that do not hang he out to dry be very conscious of the fact that northern ireland have home that be off the gas grid and when discuss the government new clause proposal last week highlight the fact that northern ireland be special case the minister have give an undertaking that conversation be continue with official in northern ireland and hope we can find resolution to that issue my final point be not really matter for today bill the associated issue of the propose ban on replacement boiler for off grid home currently propose for know that the government will be look at that it be consequential consideration follow an amendment they have put forward today and look forward to hear what ministers will have to say about it in due course rise to speak in support of new clause my amendment be about fund for decarbonise home and hope members across the house will agree that it be badly need our home be among the least energy efficient in europe and heat they account for of all uk carbon emission if we do not retrofit around million exist home in the uk we will not be able to reach net zero by this be mammoth task so we must act now however decarbonise housing be not just about tackle the climate crisis million of people be live in freeze home that be expensive to heat leave at the mercy of the volatile gas market poor quality housing be cost people their health and even their life retrofit home would reduce bill make home safe and improve people quality of life it would also create new job in every part of the country help build the green economy we so desperately need the climate change committee have find that people accept the need to make change to their home but they need well design policy to help they to act the big barrier for many will be the up front cost the government have funding to retrofit the home of people on low income and that be available through the social housing decarbonisation fund and the sustainable warmth fund but the amount on offer just be not enough particularly give the rise labour and material cost in fact last year the number of government fund energy efficiency measure instal in uk home drop by half year on year it be now shocking below level if the government have not cut energy efficiency support in just imagine how many more people might have spend last winter in comfortable home and how many few family would have have to choose between heating and eat short sighted tory cut have cost we decade in fight we can not afford to lose we need long term consistent funding and clear road map of how the decarbonisation of housing will be achieve local authority be uniquely place to understand the need of their area and to target scheme where they can provide the most benefit in nottingham against the odd more than home have be retrofit by the city council in the past decade just imagine what more could be achieve by council across the country with long term predictable funding for decarbonise home the amendment be call for the government to undertake an assessment of the benefit of provide this funding to local authority hope the house will invest in our future by support new clause suppose that the volume of my amendment probably speak for itself but have great interest in this bill be aware of the limitation of time this afternoon so will keep my observation to the two area that think be fundamentally important absolutely despise this bill have be in this house for eight year and have rarely see bill of such nature it be page and it have attract page of amendment that mean it have lot of interest but want to discuss two of the amendment that have table first amendment relate to clause and the hydrogen grid conversion trial the clause seek to amend the gas act and be particularly concern by subsection which increase the right and power available to unknown new inspector it include the power to enter premise in the trial location for the purpose of inspect anything on the premise or carry out any test on the premise in preparation for or otherwise in connection with the trial my amendment which table with other would interpose at least magistrate justice of the peace in that proposal before we start enter people premise we accept that in other energy matter for example to have meter change it have to go through magistrate court know that well as use to sit as one clause cause the most gross concern it be the reason that hope an amendment can be accept although know it be not select by mr speaker the clause be title sanctions and suppose it do what it say on the tin subsection state energy performance be unknown and may be put into place in this house in the future by statutory instrument may provide for the imposition of civil penalty by enforcement authority for penalty of up to for not comply with those regulation be that not bad enough all in this house should sit up and take notice of subsection know it be big bill it state that energy performance regulation which be as yet unknown but be available to be put on the statute book in the future by statutory instrument may provide for the creation of criminal offence in relation to various case with imprisonment for term of up to month do not know about other member in the house but rather like the shawshank redemption it be great film can imagine the old lag in the future have chat about why they be in prison one might say ve do benefit worth and get six month another might say have dangerous driving cause an month the businessman talk to they will say have very good business with people work for in factory they have all be put out of work my business have close and my family be on the street the other will say what on earth do you do sir and he will say infringe an energy performance certificate and get month do the hon member agree that that could be for something as simple as rent out premise without have show the epc for they it be ridiculous situation my right hon friend have it exactly right hence feel that when we in this place be create criminal penalty that could put our fellow citizen in prison for month for an unknown offence of the future relate to net zero we have duty to discuss they properly this must be the first time we be potentially criminalise people in this country for not adhere to the new code of net zero we should not be do it lightly we should be do it carefully and with consideration it should not be do by statutory instrument thank my hon friend for highlight this issue to all in the house hope that the government will take urgent action to get rid of it because it be completely unacceptable it also show how little time we have to discuss fundamental issue my right hon friend have put his finger exactly on the pulse this be substantial bill say to the minister that hope the government will strip out criminal penalty for not adhere to unknown net zero certification epc and all the rest of it in the future for something as simple as not comply with some of these net zero regulation this be really serious hope that when the bill return to the other end of the palace consideration can be give to strip out such proposal could have go on at huge length this afternoon table many amendment because these be overweene power try to push and nudge we and to ban thing all can imagine be that the chinese embassy will be look at the bill with great enthusiasm as it will drive even more of our high energy business offshore china will be pleased that it will be able to sell we more solar panel and wind turbine base on its steel produce on the back of very cheap coal power that be what we be do here drive our high energy business offshore this be not recipe for energy security this be recipe for energy disaster could talk at length about what be wrong with the net zero proposal ban car ban oil boiler ban this and ban that that be not what we do as conservative we actually allow freedom we allow the market to decide the bill go in the wrong direction there be some element of the bill to commend not least the net zero duty on ofgem but overall it fail to deliver the scale of ambition we need or to set out vision of an energy system free not just from putin influence but from expensive and pollute oil and gas in their entirety my amendment would address that fail new clause would prohibit the approval of new oil and gas field development and the issuing of new oil and gas exploration and production licence be sure that the minister will seek to paint the new clause as somehow incredibly radical and the policy of just stop oil pretend that it would recklessly turn off the tap tomorrow he will no doubt trot out the same tired line about quarter of the uk energy continue to come from oil and gas in in reality the new clause be far from radical it would simply do what the science tell we be necessary if we be to secure liveable future for ourselves and our child and rule out any new oil and gas licence in do so it would follow the advice of expert include the climate change committee which in its late report be clear expansion of fossil fuel production be not in line with net zero it acknowledge that while the uk will continue to need some oil and gas until the target be meet this do not in itself justify the development of north sea field yet rather than heed that warning just one month later we have the former secretary of state vow to max out the north sea remain oil and gas reserve the government re announce new licence and it be not rule out the prospect of rosebank however hard they try to obfuscate and evade ministers can not deny the fact that without additional abatement the project emission from exist fossil fuel infrastructure would already exceed the remain carbon budget for safe climate any oil and gas extract from the north sea belong not to we but to multinational company which will sell it to the high bidder on the global market the majority of fossil fuel project in the pipeline be for oil not gas and will do nothing to boost energy security give we currently export of the oil that we extract new clause which tackle head on the frankly obscene duty to maximise the economic recovery of petroleum from the north sea be an amendment that would like to press to vote it be legal requirement for company to pump every last drop of oil and gas while the world around they burn in the time of climate emergency that duty have no place on our statute book the clause would define new principal objective under the petroleum act that respond to the escalate climate crisis but which also support new positive vision for the north sea although it would require the phasing down of petroleum in line with the uk climate target it would also facilitate just transition for oil and gas worker and community and crucially would require they to be consult in the process turn to renewable new clause would require the installation of solar panel on the roof of all new home and crucially require all new housing development to be plan to maximise solar gain thereby unleash rooftop revolution to put power into the hand of household in the remain time let quickly underline new clause which would require the secretary of state to publish an energy demand reduction delivery plan the bill before we focus almost exclusively on supply yet demand reduction be essential for our energy security and the transition beyond fossil fuel the more energy we use the hard and more expensive it become to decarbonise our supply that be why be very happy to support the amendment table by the hon member for nottingham east nadia whittome who make strong and impassioned speech in favour of energy efficiency and make sure that we can keep people warm in their home also support the scottish national party statement on nuclear power with which wholeheartedly agree draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests the rest of the world have wake up to the reality that the energy transition be here to stay investment in fossil fuel be reduce at such rate that while year ago capital investment in oil be six time that of solar power this year for the first time solar receive more investment than oil last year uk renewable power generate more electricity than fossil fuel the cost of those technology fall fast than ever predict with electricity production from renewable nine time cheap than from gas market and investor across the world recognise that net zero be the future today we can only help or hinder that future but we can not stop it the energy transition be an economic reality that as legislator we can either speed up ensure that the uk benefit from the economic opportunity and investment that can be ours if we so choose or we can slow it down to do so to delay and hinder the transition would merely cause the uk catastrophic economic self harm investment will go elsewhere company will locate elsewhere job will be create not here but elsewhere as legislator this be the choice we face net zero and our economic future or not zero with increase cost and loss of growth that will never come this way again for that reason support the bill which seek to maintain progress in the energy transition however we can and should go far yes we must expand our use of renewable and clean energy but the reality be that the uk should commit to phase out fossil fuel we do not need new oil and gas field which will only become strand asset far soon than we think we do not need new oil and gas exploration licence for fossil fuel that be not ours to keep as the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas make clear but be sell on international market and be rapidly lose market share and demand the truth be that if we be truly serious about tackle climate change and deliver green industrial revolution in the uk focus our finite investment workforce and time on the energy transition there be no place for new oil and gas field or new coalmine none of my amendment can be consider radical legislate to prevent the opening of new company simply maintain commitment that the uk seek to make to the rest of the world at legislation to remove coal fire electricity production from the grid simply put into law commitment that the government have make to the ending of coal fire generation by the end of legislate to leave the energy charter treaty which penalise nation for not maintain investment in fossil fuel simply ensure the uk follow the rest of europe in do so legislate to ban gas flaring and venting by which be responsible for methane emission that be time more powerful than carbon dioxide simply bring forward commitment from and be something that norway have have in place since and legislate to establish an independent body to advise on when to end new oil and gas licensing in the uk seek to depoliticise an issue on which we need to find responsible consensus that can be support cross party for it be too important to seek to divide and play politic with tonight in that spirit of cross party collaboration and know that this be too important to get wrong or to fall short too be willing to back any amendment that believe will deliver the energy transition more effectively hope all member across this house will consider do the same would like to speak briefly to new clause table in my name new clause ask no implore this house to consider national energy guarantee which be also know as rise block tariff combine with social tariff it be system of energy pricing that show that social and environmental goal can be advanced together it really do embody green new deal in action there be some in this house who claim that tackle the cost of live crisis and the climate crisis be zero sum game that we can only do one or the other the amendment blow hole right through that falsehood the reality of the current system in use by the government be that too many people million of they and grow be fall into fuel poverty it be system that simply be not fit for purpose let we be clear high energy price be not blip they be here to stay research from cornwall insight show that energy price will remain significantly above the five year historic average until at least the end of the decade even though ofgem price cap will come down in october the average bill will still be nearly double what it be in before price soar million of household will pay more this winter give the government energy assistance scheme have end for most up and down the uk energy debt be soar citizens advice report that nearly million people borrow to pay their bill in the first six month of this year quarter of people say that their energy bill be the cost they be most worried about in my own city of norwich the rate of report fuel debt have increase by staggering yet by subsidise the unit price the government energy price guarantee disproportionately benefit well off household and do nothing to incentivise energy demand reduction and decarbonisation the national energy guarantee will ensure that everyone can afford the essential energy they need while cut carbon here be how it work everyone get free energy allowance that cover of essential need household with high need such as those with child or disabled resident would get large allowance the next of energy use be charge at reduce rate match to price beyond that carbon bust premium tariff kick in the result be that around of we will have low bill while wealthy high energy user will pay more but can reduce their bill by instal energy save measure such as insulation in one fell swoop we will have protect essential energy need reduce bill and incentivise ramping up of decarbonisation of our housing sector crucial if we be to meet our net zero commitment urge and implore the house to support new clause in the interest of time will limit my remark to carbon capture and storage and the impact of offshore wind on other commercial activity at sea specifically fish if have time at the end will talk about hydrogen and maybe even the future of oil and gas welcome the announcement on july by the prime minister in my constituency confirm the acorn ccs and hydrogen project that will mean that four ccus cluster will be operational by the end of the decade the scottish cluster be particularly crucial for my constituency of banff and buchan as well as the whole of scotland not just for the estimate job the project be predict to support but to enable the construction of new ccs power station at peterhead that power station will replace the exist one which be currently the only dispatchable thermal power station north of leeds it will be critical be provide stable baseload in support of intermittent renewable source of energy and will do so in way that be emission free again in the interest of time be not go to speak about every single amendment that table but hope the minister will bear with and perhaps respond to the follow question in respect of clause which deal with licensable activity and their prohibition can he clarify whether or why an economic licence would be require specifically over and above the geological storage licence that would be grant under the exist regulatory regime namely the storage of carbon dioxide licensing etc regulation will private operator be able to develop merchant model in competitive transport storage market in the long term as the minister will know the uk have about third of europe entire offshore carbon dioxide storage potential undersea roughly equal to that of all the other eu state combine only norway have slightly more than the uk in the north sea this enormous potential to offer storage service to european and other country present an opportunity for the uk to become global leader in ccus and accelerate the global effort to prevent emission how will cross border transport and geological storage of carbon dioxide be enable to develop in time without have to rely on the granting of exemption to allow private network to develop can the minister also confirm that it will be possible to facilitate transportation by ship and any other mean of transport other than pipeline through regulation and that that be cover adequately by clause see he nod finally may raise the subject of offshore wind the fishing industry understand that energy security matter and that offshore wind have an important part to play in the overall energy mix but food security matter too the minister will be aware of study which have show that up to half our sea could be lose to fishing owe to other activity include offshore wind academic study carry out by heriot watt university among other have show the impact that electromagnetic field from subsea cable have have on the migration growth and development include abnormality of crab and lobster the energy bill already make provision for the principle of levy to address the environmental impact of these new wind farm which be absolutely right and proper so what consideration include engagement with devolved administration as require have be give or could be give to the business industry and coastal community that will inevitably be impact by offshore wind operation last month the think tank onward publish compelling paper argue for statutory payment from developer to be make to community where if and when onshore wind be develop if that principle be fair payment for actual loss of earning to other marine business from offshore development be even more compelling as principle be aware of the various voluntary code and guidance that be available but they have so far prove to be insufficient if the minister be unable to respond to that last question today will he agree to meet and representative from the fishing industry to discuss how good to embed fair and equitable principle in government action that would come at no cost to his majesty treasury the uk have responsibility to deliver an effective net zero strategy this energy bill provide chance to ensure that the government own climate commitment could be meet some part of the bill be welcome but as it stand it present we with many miss opportunity the liberal democrats fully support the establishment of the independent system operator and be pleased that the government have finally listen and give ofgem net zero duty however be disappointed that the government remove sensible amendment in committee such as the amendment to ban new coalmine and strongly support new clause let now focus on the liberal democrats new clause and the aim of new clause be to ban fracke permanently fracked fuel be fossil fuel it harden our reliance on expensive gas and it fly in the face of our net zero commitment the government own expert have say that the seismic activity cause by hydraulic fracking be not safe it be incomprehensible that the government ever consider lift the ban and it cause huge anxiety among community across the country that must never happen again last year shell forcibly instal prepayment meter in more than home while make billion in profit those on prepayment meter typically spend about year more than direct debit customer why be so many vulnerable people force into this the government must support my new clause to prohibit the installation of new prepayment meter unless consumer explicitly request they solar be one of the cheap form of energy and again it be incomprehensible that this government do not give it the support that it deserve the climate change committee say that uk solar power deployment be significantly behind the government target of gw by the smart export guarantee should incentivise household to invest in solar panel by allow they to sell the excess electricity produce back to the grid however under the current system it will take householder decade to break even and this will not incentivise solar investment our liberal democrat new clause aim to enhance the reward under the smart export guarantee renewable energy production must benefit the community where it be base community energy project have the potential to power million home and save million tonne of every year however the barrier to become licensed supplier mean that community energy project currently can not sell directly to local customer the amendment to establish local energy supply agree in the other place would have rectify this why do the government remove that important amendment on my last amendment we need to reduce more than just carbon emission to fight global warming methane have time the warm effect of and account for of global greenhouse gas emission the uk sign the global pledge to cut methane level by but the government have show little interest in meet this flare happen during oil and gas extraction when methane and other hydrocarbon be burn venting be the release of uncombusted methane and other hydrocarbon the international energy agency say that uk oil and gas operator could reduce methane emission by through tackle flaring venting and leak new clause would prohibit the flaring and venting of methane by oil and gas installation it would require monthly leak detection and repair inspection to reduce fugitive methane emission measurement reporting and verification process to quantify methane emission and all equipment to be update to alternative zero or low emission and low maintenance version my new clause have cross party support thank all member who have support it and the clean air task force for help to develop it and urge all member of the house to support it in the short time have may introduce slight note of caution be impress by the almost tiggerish performance by the minister he be very persuasive on this bill but what concern be what be guide government policy and dare say it the policy of many in this house the climate change act and the further legislation in when our government increase the cut in carbon emission to by introduce target that in my humble opinion be not really think through the practical consequence have not be think through and they be become more and more evident today as we discuss these difficult issue do not let mislead people in the house like everyone here want to break away from fossil fuel and have clean air the green revolution be come as my right hon friend the member for kingswood chris skidmore say but we have to be careful not to bring it in so quickly that it be not available it be not affordable and when the sun do not shine and the wind do not blow it do not work strategically we be an island nation and we have to keep the light on our duty as mps be to say to our constituent can guarantee that when you go to your light switch or to make cup of tea or cook meal the power will be there to do all that and to drive your car from to at the moment there be great drive for electric car but they be expensive and the plug in point and investment be nowhere near ready for that revolution there be also many question about where the battery and the resource for they will come from we have already hear from my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns about the slave labour that apply to many part of the battery industry we be now on our fourth carbon budget do not know whether people know that run from to and the government be be guide by that the climate change committee advise on the carbon budget and the government can be legally challenge once it be in place the budget be set for five year so the question now be what about our democracy in my humble opinion we be debate these crucial issue for probably the first time it be push through in and and we be now face the consequence of those decision if we have to fall back on the court to decide on the policy we make in this place we can recall the anxiety and grief that that cause on the brexit issue in my view that be completely unacceptable there be three consequence in month time no new house will be fit with gas boiler in seven year time petrol car will be illegal and in year time people will not be able to replace their boiler like for like be it not the case that after car battery expire most of they end up in landfill this be another significant problem we need to take stock of when these issue be consider it be have read many article not least by mr bean who as we know be car expert he write very good article in the guardian about why we be not quite ready for battery car if my wife or daughter be travel from to want she to get there safely as she can in petrol or diesel car without have to wait in petrol section for some minute to recharge her car which then take half an hour or so our action have consequence and urge the government to think this through very carefully we can not impoverish our country to meet what would call in some case an almost cultish policy to turn this country into something we can not afford when we can afford it and when it work that be when we should adopt all these policy urge caution as the government go forward declare an interest as my husband be the company secretary of sheffield renewables community benefit society that fund develop own and operate renewable energy system in sheffield rise to speak in support of number of amendment that would be vital addition to the bill it be pleasure to sit on the public bill committee to debate at great length many of the issue that have be raise today still feel the bill be miss its intended purpose as the government put it to deliver clean more affordable and more secure energy system for the long term we be in climate and nature emergency and we be now see its effect we be also face the bad cost of living crisis in decade although be pleased the minister have listen to member on both side of the house on the hydrogen levy there be still lot more to do the bill could have be our opportunity to tackle these issue head on transition away from climate wreck fossil fuel while make energy affordable for everyone sadly in its current form it fail on those front first and foremost the bill will fail to make energy more affordable for my constituent national energy action have warn that million household could be trap in fuel poverty this winter and by some household will face spend up to quarter of their income on energy bill we need to overhaul our broken energy pricing system not have more tinker around the edge be proud to support new clause table by my hon friend the member for norwich south clive lewis which would introduce national energy guarantee this idea need to be consider as we need to make sure that the burden of the transition do not fall on those who be least able to meet it secondly and shockingly the bill fail to deliver any energy efficiency measure there be nothing about how we will achieve the target that have be set the late ccc report be clear that the government need to rapidly scale up and accelerate energy efficiency to stand any hope of meet legally bind decarbonisation target obviously the green energy be energy that be not use and the more we can do to reduce the need for energy in poor quality housing the well new clause and aim to correct the current position by make it legal requirement for the government to produce an energy demand reduction plan and provide local authority with funding for the decarbonisation of home thank the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas and my hon friend the member for nottingham east nadia whittome for table those new clause and urge the government to support they finally the bill fail to decarbonise at speed and scale again the late ccc report could not be clear expansion of fossil fuel production be not in line with net zero new clause and would prohibit coalmine and new oil and gas respectively new clause would phase down uk petroleum and new clause would decarbonise electricity supply by they could and should have be central pillar of the bill they be about how we can transform our energy system and meet labour ambitious plan to be green energy superpower by however the government have remove many new clause that be win in the lords for example the one on ban new coalmine and ministers be refuse to support any such measure today instead they wait until mp go home over the summer to give the green light to hundred of new north sea oil and gas licence without proper scrutiny in damn indictment of this government record on climate action those be not the only amendment that would help to raise the ambition in this bill that the government have remove finally wish to mention the importance of new clause the treaty that have be outline be hold we back and we need to be on the front foot with this hope that ministers will reconsider whether or not we should be part of this treaty in the future this be great bill and congratulate the government as it take we huge step forward back in when believe the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead be the shadow energy minister be energy minister and we announce we be take coal off the system by recall that at that time the whole world be up in arm say oh no the light will go out this will never happen yet by coal be almost off the system and today there be hardly ever any use of coal that demonstrate what can happen when government set direction of travel put the funding behind it and let business and investor get on with it it be huge accolade for conservative government who then stand aside and let private investment come in it be time that we commit ourselves to build new nuclear baseload as that be vital we can be proud of our achievement on offshore wind and the commitment now to carbon capture usage and storage that have be too long in come but be pleased to see it time be tight but wish to refer to my new clause which call for specific problem to be tackle in specific way we all have major concern in our constituency where community do not wish to see huge electricity pylon great big wind turbine and great big industrial site relate to energy in their area yet we know that we need new onshore wind lot of solar and lot of electricity pylon my new clause propose to make it much easy to build the km of new electricity cabling and pylon that we need by to meet our power decarbonisation target alongside major road and rail route as thing stand community understandably object to these huge piece of kit go through their area and then these thing get delay and delay in the past eight or so year we have build only about km of new pylon but we need about km by we need to get our skate on the government can help by make it much easy for planning completely agree with the point the right hon lady be make do she agree that government across the uk transmission infrastructure be matter where the welsh government have competence should be look at cable ploughing technology as way forward it enable undergrounding at far cheap cost and in far more environmental way than traditional undergrounding have lot of sympathy with what the hon gentleman say but he will know that over their lifetime it cost over five time as much to put cable underground as overground while agree that bury they be well in sensitive area that will not offer the fast and cheap solution that overground cable alongside major road and rail track would offer finally we have an opportunity now to lean in to provide the decarbonisation that people want and need to see and to keep the light on while keep bill down if we think smartly go with the grain of what community want include what be set out in the excellent new clause table by my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns which propose that we stop build huge solar farm on agricultural land and put they on brownfield and less sensitive site instead put power infrastructure in less environmentally sensitive area and help community to earn some money from onshore wind farm that they support in their area then we will be truly keep the light on keep bill down and vitally decarbonise as we have commit to do we all want to cut emission and tackle climate change but people continue to suffer from the cost of living crisis it be important that the cost of transition to low carbon alternative be not leave to individual to shoulder on their own the government propose phase out the use of high carbon fossil fuel heating from the gas grid by ban the installation of new gas fuel boiler from and they advocate the alternative of heat pump while heat pump have an important role to play in the decarbonisation of home heating heat pump only approach risk unfairly burden off grid rural homeowner with expensive installation cost my constituent be rightly concerned at the prospect of be make to install very costly alternative heating system that be not fit for purpose some million people live in rural area across the uk with in off grid home the cost of instal low carbon heat pump be around four time more expensive than replacement boiler what be more while heat pump can technically be instal in all home across the uk and it should be in new build housing in certain property type such as those in rural and coastal community like gower they will not run efficiently and risk increase energy bill to unnecessarily high level for homeowner above those they currently pay in some case that could increase the overall cost of installation to accord to the government own calculator welcome the fact that the government be consult on increase the grant available for heat pump in certain home as announce last week however for some those increase grant will not go far enough in make the cost of heat pump installation workable my constituent in gower many of whom be off grid homeowner want to play their part in reduce emission in fact the majority of people who come to my summer surgery while concerned about the cost want to do their bit to reduce carbon emission as have be say in the chamber today renewable liquid fuel such as renewable diesel make from hydrotreated vegetable oil offer cheap alternative they can reduce net carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emission from source to end user by up to at small cost exist off grid boiler can be modify to run renewable liquid fuel such as hvo save the homeowner the extortionate cost of heat pump replacement however renewable liquid fuel be more expensive than their high carbon competitor kerosene in order to aid swift uptake the energy bill must enable the use of renewable liquid fuel as well as introduce measure to explore reduce their cost and make they more accessible such as renewable liquid heating fuel obligation mirror what already exist in transport and aviation that would help my constituent transition to low carbon alternative and incentivise fast and wide transition more broadly among off grid household there be some consensus across the house on those measure an effective transition to clean energy must ensure that rural off grid community such as mine in gower be not leave with an expensive cost burden as we transition to net zero to conclude in light of the consultation on renewable liquid fuel the government must review their oil boiler ban the minister must ensure that the consultation be expedite so that all our off grid constituent can benefit before he leave government the wish to carry through great electrical revolution will require lot of good will from the british people my worry about this legislation be that it may antagonise they by be unduly restrictive particularly with the threat of civil and even criminal penalty on some of their conduct we need to persuade people that the green product will be cheap well more acceptable and make more general contribution and not try to bamboozle they hope that there will be an opportunity to vote on the amendment table by my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay to get rid of the threat of criminal and civil penalty over the issue of proper transition for thing to take off the product the heat pump and the electric car will have to be much more popular more people will have to believe in their specification and adequacy and they will have to be more affordable for example would be very happy to have heat pump to heat my rather small london flat but be tell that there be not one available because be not allow to adorn the outside of the block of flat with any of the thing that person would need to make heat pump system work there must be practical solution to these problem we can not force the pace by legislation the market and the investment have to catch up my second worry about this legislation be that energy policy have to achieve three thing at the same time yes we have to take considerable environmental issue into account but we also need affordable energy and we need available energy in recent year all main party have put so much emphasis in their policy making on the environmental that we be miss the obvious which be that we be no long guarantee security of supply we can not guarantee security of supply if we be mainly rely on wind farm we can not rely on solar on dark winter evening when people want to cook their meal and turn the heating up because there be no solar we have to look at the relative cost the unit cost of energy generate by wind farm that be already build be very cheap on one cost system but if we have gas turbine system that be non operational for most of the time only kick in occasionally when the wind do not blow that be part of the cost of the delivery of the wind power and it be far more expensive way of run gas turbine than if we use they all the time my right hon friend be make an excellent point about the extra energy provision that we need to make renewable work have he consider the true environmental cost of the battery the digging up of cobalt by child in the democratic republic of congo the smelting and all the rest of it that be the real cost of rely on renewable and we hear very little about the real cost of the battery be greatly in favour of do proper whole life carbon accounting take into account all the generate by make the green product its lifetime use on which it may be well and its disposal on which it may be bad it be certainly the case that if we acquire an electric vehicle that have generate lot of in its production and then we do not drive it very much we will have not gain but loss so there must be realistic carbon accounting we also should not fall nationally for the fallacy that be build into the international system for example we could say that we have bring our down because we be import thing but that actually generate lot more than have we do it for ourselves this be the essence of the argument about our own gas if we get more of our own gas down pipe it produce fraction of the for the total process than if we import liquefy natural gas have have to use lot of energy compress and liquefy the gas lot of energy switch it back and lot of energy on long distance sea transport therefore we must be realistic in the accounting finally do not think that the bill be give we much guidance for example if the electrical revolution do take off because the really popular product arrive and people find they affordable how will they get the power deliver to their home we be already tell that many wind farm can not be start or can not be connect to the grid any time soon there need to be massive expansion of green capacity and big digging up of road and re cabling of britain if my constituent be all to adopt an electric car and heat pump we need massive expansion both of electricity generation and of grid capacity do not see that happen at the moment there need to be market reaction and proper investment plan and this legislation be not help fear that this bill add to the cost it add target that could turn out to be unrealistic and that could be self defeat because quite often the action take to abate end up generate more at the world level and mean that we have export an awful lot of crucial business that we would be well off do here we be go to three minute limit immediately the wind up will start at pm and then there will be multiple vote from pm onwards be afraid some people may not get in thank you for call in this debate mr deputy speaker it have not be all jolly hockey stick despite the fact that this bill have take up quite considerable amount of the house time over the last number of year and sessions northern ireland have more than maybe approach of its house heat by solid fuel as representative of constituency with vast rural section that rely on coal and heating oil can not put my name to something that will say to my constituent do know what this be go to cost you but this decision will actually inflict high cost on you when there be suitable and available product there that you can use to heat your home or to drive your car that press heavily on and it have press heavily notice on some other member across the house because there be significant cost implication in go down the propose route northern ireland be not behind in make change it be actually front and centre in the hydrogen revolution it have be make hydrogen product and will be part of the hydrogen hub and the most significant hydrogen manufacturer in the entire island of ireland listen carefully to the point make from the government front bench about the hydro levy and it will be interesting to see how that follow through be delighted by the comment make by the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice know he be not try to hang anyone out to dry today but it be important that we get from the minister clear indication of what be happen not just in northern ireland with regard to liquid renewable it be important that the government must support variety of heating technology to give the uk the good chance of hit the carbon reduction target if that be what they wish to do they must reflect the diverse type of house that people live in across the entirety of the united kingdom and do something that be fundamentally fair to people we can not inflict this massive cost on people when we have an overreliance on solid fuel especially in country such as mine we hear some comment from the right hon member for wokingham john redwood on the issue of battery disposal it concern considerably that whenever battery car have finish its life cycle the battery largely end up in landfill what benefit be that when there be other technology out there be explore utilise and develop that could give we much well and more user friendly experience ban on new replacement fossil fuel appliance in home from will put substantial cost on people also agree thoroughly with the point make about the disruption to many people and about heat pump this bill need to have even more thought give to it in my point of order early say that this be page bill that be what it be when it come from the house of lords it be now page bill which we be expect to debate in detail in three hour on day when we have two relatively lightweight statement that really seem to not the proper way to have scrutiny in this house it do not allow this house to do its proper job of look at the detail of legislation it be as if we have abdicate it entirely to their lordship have support my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay in number of amendment every single one of which have basically the same aim to ameliorate the burden this bill will place on all our constituent throughout the bill we be create cost regulation penalty and obligation new clause be there to say that the low possible cost should be at the forefront of the mind of the government in everything that they do irrespective of how the energy be generate if that mean fossil fuel let it be fossil fuel as my right hon friend the member for wokingham john redwood say we need to keep people with we and we risk lose they if we put undue burden on they what other burden do we seek to take away well the hydrogen levy of course be all in favour of hydrogen think it could be the fuel of the future remember that when be child coal be advertise as the fuel of the future hydrogen may have well opportunity but that can not be do by levy and impost and hope that what the government have do will not be power that they use to create levy and an impost on enter people home without warrant warrant be not the protection that one would like it to be we see the scandal of warrant just be agree by the court willy nilly to insist on the installation of prepayment meter but at least warrant be some protection let we protect our voter smart appliance regulation be the eu approach to regulate rather than the market approach surely we on the conservative benches believe in market force determine how thing should happen our amendment deal with henry viii clause to try to stop legislation be change by fiat most importantly on amendment can it possibly be right to criminalise people and potentially put they in jail for year for muddle their energy efficiency certificate no it can not and we should not do it the issue of flare and venting emission highlight in new clause be an extremely important one any unplanned hydrocarbon release must be do safely know the tremendous concern of the trade union include the national union of rail maritime and transport workers and of the offshore worker about the bill failure to address safety critical maintenance work on oil and gas installation very much agree with the sentiment in the new clause and welcome the fact that flare and venting emission have be reduce but accord to industry body offshore energies uk the average safety critical maintenance backlog on uk offshore oil and gas installation increase by during the pandemic hope that the minister will reflect on that and perhaps meet the union turn to new clause see tremendous merit in and need for timely and cost effective connection to the grid and for an acceleration of the development of an offshore wind energy grid both of which be critical for teesside and the teesworks site give the promise of many more job in the industry connectivity to the electricity grid for the teesworks site could not be more important would be oblige if the minister update on power supply which understand do not currently exist for the site and on how he will use the new legislation to ensure that teesside get the power it need the government say that the purpose of new clause be to give great certainty to producer of sustainable aviation fuel that be undoubtedly necessary but take issue with the long lead time the new clause specify that the secretary of state must open the consultation within the period of month and report to parliament on progress within the period of month the industry need certainty now know from talk that have have with industrialist that the government dilly dally be already impact on investment decision and not in positive way new clause call for price stability mechanism to support the development of uk sustainable aviation fuel industry that be what those in the industry want and they want it now alfanar be develop billion waste to sustainable aviation fuel facility on teesside the large in the world and the most advanced in europe it also plan two more saf plant in the uk but and this be big but it need certainty from the uk government that they be serious about the industry and will take the brake off and get on with create business environment that will instil confidence very much welcome new clause it beggar belief that the exist linking of renewable and gas price in the retail market have deliver billion worth of extra cash to energy company while our hard press constituent pick up the bill hope that ministers will accept that that be unfair on consumer and that the new clause will help they to correct that would have love to have talk at length about carbon capture and storage but suffice it to say that the government should take on board the amendment table by other have push my new clause to point where the government have respond in sensible way and start what hope and believe will be process it be not for no reason that around member of parliament sign that new clause it be because of recognition that this transition be go to happen in one of our most important industry and it be go to happen around the world the migration to sustainable aviation fuel be vital as the world decarbonise not only because it be an essential first step towards decarbonisation but in the long term not for short haul flight which think will be power by hydrogen by the we will start to see short haul hydrogen plane in operation however there be no technological approach yet that will take we to australia or north america use anything other than sustainable aviation fuel so it be vital industry for the future of this country there be investor out there wait to invest in develop plant here but they need the confidence to know that there be government commit to create framework that will enable that investment to take place and be sustain one of the reason intervene on the opposition spokesman the hon member for southampton test dr whitehead be that over the next month as we prepare for general election investor be look for confidence on both side of the house it be not about lack of confidence in our ability to win the next general election it be about deliver confidence to investor right now that be why it be important that both the government and the labour party be commit to the development of sustainable aviation fuel in the united kingdom we want investor to be take decision about the deployment of their capital in this country now prepare to invest and prepare for the end of the process that the government have start through their new clause so that by they be ready to build plant develop sustainable aviation fuel and provide an important part of the future of the aviation industry in this country be grateful to the minister for what he have do and the assurance he have give today but say to he and his colleague in government that and other will be hold their foot to the fire in the next month to ensure that the consultation start as quickly as possible and that the response to it come as quickly as possible by the time we get to the general election want there to be clear route map forward for the development of saf in this country that have give investor confidence so that they know as we go into the election campaign that both side will take this forward and that we have an industry that will be vital to the future of aviation in britain which be crucial industry for all of we it have be pleasure to speak on the bill on second reading and in committee but agree with my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg that it be great pity we can not have long debate on report or third reading to expand on issue far one of the issue that want to expand on be about some of the alternative we keep talk about electric vehicle move down but hydrogen combustion vehicle offer real opportunity to move forward we also talk about net zero but this have now move to zero emission vehicle that rule out hydrogen combustion so again we be go down rabbit hole of just have electric vehicle but an electric vehicle be not zero emission vehicle if it be the underground would have the clean air in london and it do not because there be lot of particulate around it my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns make it clear through new clause that we have to look at the source and new clause relate to where battery go we keep talk about the rare earth metal that be need indeed the hon member for angus dave doogan talk about be able to maintain baseload by use various aspect of energy storage we keep come back to the need for rare earth metal and material to enable that and they come from area of the world that we do not have an influence over in the past month there have be huge debate about the fact that we can not be reliant on russian energy and yet few member in today debate have recognise the fact that we be wholeheartedly move towards become reliant on china to supply our energy need this be huge bill it be fundamental bill that we have bring forward as we look to the future but it be far too big with far too many aspect to it it have become bit of hodgepodge say we want electric vehicle we want electric heating in home we want to have arc blast furnace rather than coal furnace so we will ban new coalmine promise this house that if we move to just arc furnace we will destroy steel manufacturing in this country because we do not have the ability now to produce the electricity that be need we be not go to switch off the light in people home before we switch off an arc furnace and once it have be switch off we can not switch it back on that be the big mismatch in the bill which be why regret that we will not have third reading debate to discuss these issue on slightly wide basis the rush to renewable be happen quick than the timeline for make sure we have enough turbine as my right hon friend the member for wokingham john redwood point out my hon friend the member for south dorset richard drax make very important point as well although the aim be there and think we all want to follow those aim not be reliant on foreign energy be highly important at the moment there do not appear to be connection between these thing as they come online as such although the aim of the bill be good we have to make sure that we implement they over consistent timeframe so that we take the public with we the beautiful food produce farmland in my constituency be particular target for industrial scale solar farm often back by prospector who have no personal connection to our area this raise huge concern among my constituent about the scale of the project and the lack of thorough consultation with the imperative of food security on our mind we must explore alternative to cover vast expanse of our productive land with solar panel many people do not appreciate the scale of the issue so to illustrate the magnitude of this challenge will highlight one proposal for solar farm in my constituency it aim to engulf staggering hectare of land just under half of which be grade to grade farmland the very good and most versatile agricultural land the good land for food production in fact almost acre of my constituency be currently open to plan for solar farm those farm will dwarf village such as witham st hughs thorpe on the hill bassingham and holdingham and will almost encircle village such as scopwick digby and ashby de la launde do not stand against solar panel in principle have previously speak about the unexplored potential of utilise industrial roof space for they however do not believe that cover our farmland in solar panel be the right thing to do and vehemently object to the lack of food security it could produce therefore support new clause table by my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns which seek to solve this injustice and put an end to these large scale project furthermore appreciate that that clause also encourage future development on brownfield site which be far well suit to such endeavour let we work together to protect our precious farmland maintain our food security heed the concern of our constituent and chart more sustainable path for our energy future be also shock to hear that more than of solar panel may be make by or have element that come from slave labour as we discuss the slavery of the past let we do all we can to prevent the slavery of the here and now therefore also support new clause which should be push to division later lincolnshire as whole produce vast amount of this country food yet of its land area be currently open to application for solar panel as such ask the minister to answer two question in his sum up first what will we eat when our good and most versatile farmland be cover by solar panel secondly what be his assessment of the impact on the environment of grow energy from solar panel instead of food then import food from elsewhere the bill have an important role to play in ensure that we meet our net zero target enhance our energy security and create new job particularly in coastal community such as the constituency represent in drive forward the measure in the bill urge the government to have in mind the follow parameter first we need to pursue strategic approach to the provision of infrastructure while maximise the leveraging in of the enormous amount of much need private sector investment that will be require secondly the bill framework need to be sufficiently flexible to allow all region of the uk to play their full role in the transition it have be estimate that by east anglia renewable and low carbon energy supply portfolio could power the equivalent of of the uk home in our area we need recognition of the role we will play finally the government need to rural proof their policy as articulate by my right hon friend the member for camborne and redruth george eustice and the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi community energy have an important contribution to make in boost clean energy generation and in offer people the opportunity to benefit from agree to host new energy infrastructure therefore the announcement of the new million community energy fund be to be welcome however it be important that the government monitor very closely the fund impact and whether it be successful in unblock more community own project if it be not they need to bring forward further measure such as the amendment that be propose in the other place also take note of the amendment that have be table highlight the need to support vulnerable household and promote social tariff although this bill may not be the right place for promote these policy that do not mean that the concern raise be not valid and very real the cost of living crisis be still with we we be not out of the wood and urge ministers to liaise with their counterpart in the treasury and the department for work and pensions to ensure that appropriate support measure be in place it be not before time that we be consider this bill we need to get on with it get it on the statute book as quickly as possible and then get on with the task of delivery rise to support the principle of the government lift the ban on new onshore wind farm have every sympathy with new clause but want to bring some context as to why and mention the fact that public support on this topic have completely and utterly change in the last or year in which feel like long time ago now be first elect as local councillor and in the very village grow up in one of the most controversial and contentious planning application have ever see be put in front of we it be for metre you guess it wind turbine it be not very big one but it be to be build on the cromer glacial ridge in north norfolk the backlash against that proposal be enormous with objection genuine protest and councillor elect on the back of the stop the turbine campaign the applicant go through three planning appeal two high court hearing and an application to the court of appeal finally the planning inspector grant permission in february after over decade of fighting that turbine go up just few month ago be tell hon member this because the mack family that go through that process for over decade must have spend ten and ten of thousand of pound but now it have be build public perception have change and the complaint against it have be absolutely negligible what that say above all be that people have now change the general consensus on onshore wind it have totally change and as parliamentarian we should reflect public opinion when the mood change we should change with it sometimes people get it now people get that that one turbine will power home in the local area of course new application must be design to be sympathetic to the surround landscape but people recognise that we need our own energy security sustainable clean and green form of energy to decarbonise and an energy mix that will give we security as well thing have clearly change and think this be very sensible pragmatic and low cost way of the government move to give we more clean and green energy that one single application mention show how public sentiment have change which be why support the bill today rise order this will have to be the final two minute from the back benches call jerome mayhew thank you mr deputy speaker be just go to talk about one new clause new clause which oppose it seek to prevent further licence of north sea oil and gas the reason oppose it be that we have plan for the decarbonisation of our economy and it be police if can put it that way by the committee on climate change in the path to net zero by we recognise that we have continue need for oil and gas at least until when more than of our energy need will still come from fossil fuel and actually up to include because it be net zero not absolute zero we have to have oil and gas so let get it from the most efficient and environmentally friendly source the most environmentally friendly source be norway but that be not an unlimited resource the equivalent per barrel of oil there be about kg the additional oil and gas we use come not from norway but from qatar it be liquid natural gas and the equivalent per barrel there be kg whereas the figure for the north sea be kg quarter the level of environmental damage per kilogram of equivalent the consequence of close down the north sea prematurely would be to increase emission and make our carbon footprint bad it would be the triumph of virtue signal over the practicality of decarbonisation will the hon gentleman give way will not be sorry but only have one and half minute it be logical on environmental ground therefore to support new licence in oil and gas but there be other argument there be the balance of payment we use to talk about the balance of payment in our trade in good deficit be billion would rather have our import of oil and gas come from the uk and not be import at all support our balance of payment there be the tax income the office for budget responsibility say that in we be go to get billion of tax revenue from north sea oil that pay for lot of public good we should be support that and we should be support business profitability and job because that support our community it also give time for the phasing of what be describe as the just transition to renewable job there be an irony in that the proponent of new clause lead by the hon member for brighton pavilion caroline lucas talk about just transition but it be this long process away from north sea oil and gas manage decline that provide the space for truly just transition to new renewable employment in this country do not support new clause as result rise apologise to those member who have not be call note will be make and count take call the minister andrew bowie be delighted to rise must apologise in advance of my closing remark give the time available will not be able to address every single point question statement and amendment raise today interruption that be the first time have ever be tell to speed up my speak style however will commit to write to every member who have raise question and certainly question that be pertinent to how we implement some of the regulation that we be present here today and which will be subject to discussion in the lords next week on new clause present by my hon friend the member for rutland and melton alicia kearns we keep all sanction under review and she know that we can not comment on any potential future designation we have global right sanction regime which allow we to take action when the necessary legislative criterion be meet and we assess sanction be appropriate can confirm to she that we take an interest in the concern she set out and will continue to act we have introduce new guidance on the risk of do business in xinjiang enhance export control and announce the introduction of financial penalty under the modern slavery act know the minister have historically be very strong on this point be interested in the fact that the government have raise that point about sanction and the possibility of sanction because we have not hear that before both the us and eu have sanction those who use slave labour within their supply chain if the government hope they be say this today know they can not comment on sanction designation be say that they will bring forward sanction against company that be completely complicit in slave labour we have the evidence both from the us and our own work that will be incredibly positive because it would send strong deterrent message across the industry that we will not accept slave labour in our supply chain thank my hon friend for her comment and constructive engagement over the past couple of day and month as say commit to work with she and other interested party on this matter as we continue to do what we can to combat the existence of slave labour in that market the energy efficiency amendment be raise number of time want to be absolutely clear we be simply seek to replace the power to amend the energy performance of premise regime which be lose as we depart the eu brexit give we the power to do that can categorically guarantee before the house that we be not create new offence in any case any new offence on anything as be always the case would have to be subject to debate scrutiny and vote in this place which brexit have allow we to do my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay raise the issue of warrant for exercise power of entry with his amendment assure he that clause modify the gas act by build on exist provision concern the power of entry as such the exist rule on power of entry will continue to apply whereby gas transporter must obtain warrant from the magistrate court before use hope that satisfy my hon friend thank my right hon friend the member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom for her amendment today pay tribute to she for her outstanding work her support for this bill during her time as secretary of state in the department for business energy and industrial strategy and her continued work when she be chair of the departmental back bench committee be delighted to be able to confirm that we will continue to work towards what her amendment seek to do and be happy to continue to work with she in pursuance of that alongside the industry and the department it would be remiss of not to mention and thank my right hon friend the members for read west sir alok sharma and for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke for their close work with the government over recent week onshore wind be an important part of our energy mix and the government have always maintain that it should be build where there be local support ensure that the voice of local community be hear in december last year the government consult on change to national planning policy for onshore wind in england through that consultation the government have hear the strength of feeling and the range of view on this topic we continue to believe that decision on onshore wind be well make by local representative who know their area nevertheless the feedback be clear that we need to strike the right balance and that be why the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities publish write ministerial statement as be describe early and we look forward to work with colleague to implement that as we move forward would also be remiss not to mention my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller and her comment today and constructive engagement over the past few month lithium ion battery storage system be concern for many in this house the government acknowledge the concern surround the potential safety and environmental impact of battery energy storage at grid scale it be priority for this government to ensure the existence of an appropriate robust and future proof regulatory framework that protect people and the environment that be why be pleased to confirm today that we have seek to provide further clarity through both the planning system and environmental permitting regulation the government have recently update planning practice guidance which encourage battery storage developer to engage with local fire and rescue and local planning authority to refer to the guidance publish by the national fire chiefs council the government intend to consult on include battery storage system in the environmental permitting regulation at the early opportunity the main mechanism for control emission to air land and water from industrial installation be through comply with an industrial installation permit these permit set out mandatory condition that operator must comply with to protect the health of local community and the local environment installation be then inspect at frequency accord to their level of risk and regulator have enforcement power available to they if operator be not comply with their permit condition hope that my right hon friend and other hon and right hon member for whom this be an issue of great concern be reassure by those commitment today thank all hon and right hon member for their engagement in this debate especially my hon friend the member for banff and buchan david duguid who be real champion of the uk thrive ccus industry thank he for his comment today the licence issue by different authority be design to serve different purpose the new requirement for an economic licence recognise the monopolistic nature of carbon dioxide pipeline and storage and be design to protect user of the network from anti competitive behaviour include monopolistic pricing this be complementary rather than duplicative of the exist carbon storage licensing framework can reassure my hon friend that the provision in clause be sufficiently broad to cover all method of transportation finally my hon friend speak about offshore wind as part of the development consent process applicant be require to consult with stakeholder include devolve administration where relevant and consider the impact of their development on other sea user however be also happy to confirm that will meet he at any time as well as representative of the fishing industry for whom this be big issue thank member across the house for their

house do now stephenson for be the party of the bank and the banker the tories have shocking record of keep bank on our local high street it speak to pattern of this government prioritise profit over people this be my first adjournment debate be proud to hold it on topic important to my constituent give the state of local bank branch closure in east dunbartonshire but be frustrate and disappoint that this issue be on all our mind despite the severity of the topic be very much look forward to an intervention from the hon member for strangford jim shannon the highlight of every adjournment debate as you will be only too familiar with mr deputy speaker first of all commend the hon lady for bring this subject forward the scottish national party have be at the fore in headline the issue of bank closure and wish to add my support it be an increase problem back home northern ireland have lose of bank branch in the last three year accord to statistic from the consumer council one of those be barclays bank branch in newtownards where have my office for rural constituent it mean they have to drive up to minute to the near barclays in the neighbouring constituency or take taxi or bus do the hon lady agree that bank branch be crucial to the economy especially the rural economy and that the frequent closure of local branch be do more harm than good for customer the hon lady be to be congratulate on bring this issue forward could not agree more welcome the hon member intervention kick he into gear do it be much appreciated local bank branch be close right across scotland and at high rate than in the rest of the uk while avoid the hon lady rhetoric in the opening of her speech agree that the closing of bank in locality particularly in dewsbury mirfield and ossett in the area represent be big issue the banking sector be bring forward number of initiative one of which be banking hub which bring bank together in town centre building have she consider that as an option and would she be in favour of it will answer the hon member question in second but it be certainly not rhetoric to say that the tory government have not step up anywhere near enough to support our community and people who be struggle through the cost of living crisis we need local bank branch hubs be an alternative though they be not good enough but welcome his point of view we would be lucky to have as many bank branch open in our constituency as have close in the recent year at least local branch be set to close this year alone and parliamentary constituency be down to one or no local bank the uk have lose over half its bank network since which speak volume after year of tory rule how many more bank do we have to lose before the minister kick into gear on the point about have lose over half the bank in the uk since would like to go over the figure do the hon lady recognise that over branch have close since or be set to close leave only at time when bank be pull in record profit what be most despicable about this situation be that bank have record profit but be not invest they in our community our constituent particularly those who be vulnerable need bank to maintain their presence on our local high street it be incumbent on government to act and to incentivise bank to have high street presence thank my hon friend for secure this debate the support she be get from across the house be quite tell rural scotland have be batter by bank and post office closure in recent year the bank of scotland plan to close its dunoon branch on december we have see how this work the bank close branch they advise we to use the post office and all too often the post office close have make my feeling very clear about that particular closure but will my hon friend join in congratulate the people of dunoon particularly dinah mcdonald who from her shop bookpoint be lead the community fightback by gather local signature to petition lloyds to reverse this ill thought out and ill conceive idea and decision welcome my hon friend intervention and throw my full weight behind the campaign of the people of dunoon we know good folk come from argyll and bute so be very happy to support that campaign my constituent in east dunbartonshire have suffer from this trend watch bank after bank close its door seven local bank have close since most recently barclays in kirkintilloch and the bank of scotland in bearsden similar to my hon friend experience fortunately bank of scotland branch remain in milngavie but for how long will continue to set out the need for action and government intervention as progress my case for the continued need for high street bank but will start with couple of question for the minister would appreciate some comment from he on they when he give his response what be the government do to incentivise bank to maintain high street presence do the government recognise why that be important and necessary and if they do why the hesitance to intervene that hesitancy be to the detriment of our constituent particularly those who be vulnerable be grateful to my hon friend for give way it be about eight week since introduce my ten minute rule bill the banking and postal services rural areas bill to parliament and the government have do nothing they talk about banking hub as some kind of solution but there be handful of they only and delivery be absolutely glacial the point my hon friend be make in her excellent speech be that these facility for local people will be close down especially in rural area before there be any substitute for they to provide the service that people need do she not agree completely agree with my hon friend and welcome that intervention it be to the detriment of our constituent because the bank and the government be not step up quickly enough or at all to support those who need these vital service many constituent have be in touch with in the run up to this debate flag up the particular impact local bank branch closure have on those who be vulnerable elderly people and those with physical or mental disability may struggle with online banking and will be particularly affect by have to travel great distance to access in person banking service be very grateful to my hon friend for give way when she be make such an excellent speech on vulnerable people and their access to cash do she believe that government inaction be in part to blame for the hiatus that happen when the last bank close like the bank of scotland do in brechin last year the entire community then have to wait not to see when but if they will get banking hub thank my hon friend for that intervention it be the hesitancy and uncertainty that have such detrimental impact on community such as brechin for vulnerable people the internet often feel like an unfamiliar and unsafe place to handle their money for they the advice and reassurance they can only get from an in person bank teller be vital for they the extra mile to the next near bank branch might be too far to travel on the question of the additional distance to travel may flag up the experience of my constituent in buckhaven when tsb close branch there few year ago it very kindly produce wee map show the location of the near tsb bank in high street methil the only problem be that it be not in high street methil it be in high street leven not only different town but different constituency the address it give in high street methil be part of the old high street that be demolish year ago to make way for housing do my hon friend agree that it be just an insult to constituent and to community when bank that have take the decision to close service be so ignorant that it can not even be bother to send somebody to walk the distance to make sure the bank it be direct people to actually exist thank my hon friend for that that be frustration we share the map send out by many bank branch be complicated and sometimes not relevant to the community that they be be send to so completely agree just last night it be flag to that an elderly constituent of mine live in kirkintilloch with brain injury have be struggle to access banking service since the closure of barclays in the town centre the shift to centralised bank hub like barclays in glasgow bring with it litany of issue such as the confusion and accessibility issue my constituent be experience with every local bank branch closure be assure of two thing upon meeting with the bank in question there will be no forced redundancy and all vulnerable customer have be contact and bank staff will work with they to have seamless transition to their next close bank but my constituency casework be proof that for far too many people that be just not enough my hon friend be make an excellent speech and be be extremely generous with her time the closure of local bank branch have an impact on member in all part of the house as we have hear this evening and as say when speak about the subject in my first adjournment debate last year on that day hsbc have announce that it be close branch across the four nation since then the government have introduce what be now the financial services and markets act but it have fail to address the issue of bank branch closure receive numerous complaint from my constituent about the fact there be no bank leave and about the limited access to free to use atm in fact just this afternoon receive an email about that from constituent do my hon friend agree that more action must be take to ensure that our high street do not become banking ghost town completely agree with my hon friend there be cash desert across scotland now and the government should reflect on that and take new action as my hon friend will know the bank of scotland want to close its branch in glasgow govan ward which mean that people will be without bank but there be another problem when bank close its atm close as well and in my experience when bank close its atm the other atms that be free start charge that be another attack on vulnerable customer be it not it be as if my hon friend have read my mind that be exactly what be about to mention people on low income often use cash to budget and more and more of our constituent will be do so as the cost of live crisis worsen evidence from which indicate that there be of those cash desert in scotland place where there be no access to either branch or an atm within reasonable distance thank the hon lady for allow to intervene and for initiate this important debate it be clear that online banking be not for everyone and that we must have physical banking service in town be delighted that stapleford in my constituency be to have new banking hub which be on track for delivery in january but there be concern about town in broxtowe such as beeston lose these vital service do the hon lady agree that we must continue to ensure that community have access to physical cash and banking service agree that it be vital for community to have access to cash and localise banking service it be hardly surprising that tory mp have banking hub come to his constituency but thank the hon gentleman for flag that up because it be part of the problem that we be experience in scotland deprive people many of whom may already be near the end of their financial tether of access to cash heap one more thoroughly unwelcome stress on their life it be entirely unreasonable to expect the entire population to bank online there be also an argument to be make about fundraise charity and organisation which often rely heavily on cash donation and payment the lack of local bank for cash deposit place an additional security risk on volunteer cause extra pressure for both charity and individual give the finding of citizens advice that of the population use bank branch at some point and use local bank branch at least once month keep bank on high street should not be in question with each closure come the expect platitude and reassurance from the bank concern we as constituency member engage in good faith and fight for our constituent to have access to local banking facility but the fact be that there be no incentive for bank to maintain high street presence and without that incentive bank be gradually shift to far less localise business model return to my early point that in the absence of government incentive the number of local bank branch will continue to erode give that bank and local bank branch in particular provide an invaluable service for our community it be incumbent on the government to act and ensure that bank do not entirely withdraw from our high street have even hear from constituent across east dunbartonshire who have switch bank so they can continue to have local bank branch only to find that their new bank have close its door month later the point that and other make with each of these bank branch closure be that the bank suggestion of post office and banking hub replace local bank branch do not stand up to scrutiny as my hon friend the member for argyll and bute brendan say in his intervention local post office be under considerable pressure and be also exit high street and town centre at an increase pace include the closure of our local post office in milngavie precinct post office be not bank nor be they suitable alternative to bank it be time the government recognise that our constituent be go to great length to access local banking facility so why be the government not help they another issue relate to the closure of local bank be the notable decline in the provision of free to use atm there be more than few than there be five year ago steep decline of again particularly impact those who be vulnerable we all know the argument that bank make for the closure they say that cash use be down by since and that that decline make their cash access network include local branch and atm less profitable but think we all understand that bank be not charity they be extremely profitable corporation whose profit have increase by or billion since with that massive windfall they can easily afford to maintain basic cash access network service that our vulnerable constituent can not afford to lose but that be exactly what we be see and the government be do nothing to stop it this be yet another in long list of example of how this union be fail scotland we on these benches look forward to scotland regain her member hear hear thank member for their support independence when we will no long have an unkind uncare westminster government who we have not vote for erode our living standard and our high street scotland street and scotland bank be safe in scotland hand the time have come for scotland people to take back our self government and build bright future thank the contributor on both side of the house include my hon friend the members for dewsbury mark eastwood and for broxtowe darren henry and of course the hon member for east dunbartonshire amy callaghan for secure this debate which have rightly give her constituent voice on something that they feel very strongly about know there be real strength of feeling across the house about this subject but it fall to to be clear that the nature of banking be change as in so many other area of the modern world the long term trend whether we like it or not be towards great use of digital or telephone service accord to uk finance last year only third of uk adult have carry out any banking activity face to face in branch the hon lady talk about kirkintilloch but of those who use that branch also use the app mobile or telephone service the bank assert whether this be right or not do not know that few than people be regularly use the branch in the same period of time last year nine out of uk adult bank online or through mobile app more than nine in of we be now use contactless payment method include throughout this house and only of people be now solely use cash that be not limit to any particular demographic of adult age between and use online and mobile banking as well and less than third of that age group regularly use branch give that the minister and most of his ministerial colleague be so fond of online service everywhere else can he explain why in these first two day back in parliament members have spend about three hour do nothing while troop through the lobbies to vote when we could have on vote online in about two minute flat why be do thing in person the right thing to do here but the wrong thing to do everywhere else in the interest of time will stick to the topic but be delighted that the hon member be here in person as indeed be you mr deputy speaker change be not comfortable but it do happen let we consider payphone it would not surprise if hansard have record of similar debate about the decline of payphone at one point at their peak in the there be almost payphone in this country today there be just fraction of that number technology have move on and nearly everybody have access to either landline or mobile phone by the same token it would make little sense to force business to keep physical branch open when development in the market mean that eyeball and footfall have move elsewhere nor would our high street be particularly well serve by bank branch gather dust and lie essentially unused we need to find new us for they perhaps the aspiration of the hon member for east dunbartonshire for independence will produce new us for these bank branch in the same way that so many of our community and village today have blacksmith arms public house what responsibility if any do the minister think the government have for these closure this idea that we can all be digital by default might work well in london glasgow edinburgh or wherever but digital by default do not work in rural community there need to be solution for those who can not access these system as he would have we all do this government take responsibility and be just about to explain how for the first time we have take the statutory right to protect the use of cash that have be on the statute book for number of week after the house pass the financial services and markets act it be also why we support the very rigorous guidance give by the financial conduct authority in case where bank branch be close will the minister give way will take an intervention we be on the adjournment and should be mindful of time rural community be probably the large part of my constituency and have lose or rural bank every one of they be focal point for customer which hit on the important point make by the hon member for argyll and bute brendan at the same time every one of those bank have make extra profit and extra fee which just do not add up why not keep they open and share some of that dividend with all the customer who need the bank the hon gentleman be work his way towards one of the potential answer colleague have mention the banking hub when bank seek to close branch the fca process normally include consultation with the local member of parliament the financial sector now have consumer duty to think about put customer need first which be one of their weighty duty as we deal with this significant change number of alternative be in place one be the local post office and believe there be still nine post office in east dunbartonshire as the bank business traffic coalesce they can help to support the economic of post office in particular area that be one opportunity some of personal banking customer can transact in their local post office and there be over post office across the united kingdom few moment ago the minister mention the government move to protect the right to use cash what be the point of that right if people can not access cash in their community do not know whether the hon gentleman be deliberately fail to understand but the protection of access to cash and the ability to deposit cash that be important if we want business to continue to use and accept cash have requirement that people will have easy convenient access to free atm within mile in rural area and within mile in urban area that be the guidance we issue matter of week ago will the minister give way will take one final intervention but hon member would learn more if they allow to make some progress thank the minister for be most generous as he know have be try to intervene for while there be an important issue about free atm and those that charge be he monitor that when branch close there be clear behaviour whereby the atm around and about start charge would be interested to see evidence of that the pay for atm simply do not count in any way towards the provision of free access to cash in the constituency of the hon member for east dunbartonshire there be free to use atm only those not the one that charge for withdrawal will count towards that condition of make sure our community have decent and continue access to cash understand that access to cash be just one thing and that an atm do not provide the full range of banking service the post office do but we have start to talk about banking hub and more than have be announce to date know that relatively few have be deliver but they be relatively novel feature if hon member who be to have banking hub would like to see that delivery they should work with their local planning authority as the big single impediment to open these new banking hub be get through the planning process know that my right hon friend the member for pendle andrew stephenson be look forward to banking hub in his constituency make it priority early this year to visit london first banking hub in acton and recently visit the brixham hub the hon member for ealing central and acton dr huq be certainly not conservative but will be happy to work with colleague to put in place these state of the art hub which allow people not just to withdraw and deposit cash but to carry out much wide range of community banking service that be very important be get frustrate with the minister response will carry on then laughter if the minister want to grow the frustration that be fine it feel as though that be become common pattern it feel as though the government and the minister be try to place this into the hand of everyone else to deal with and that there be lack of government intervention to try to solve this problem nothing could be far from the truth this government have for the first time in history legislate for citizen of this country include our good friend in scotland to have legal statutory right to access to cash moreover we have bring forward the practical sustainable alternative of banking hub to protect the ability of community to access wide range of banking service we have conduct agreement for almost every bank in the country and in scotland to be able to conduct their business through the post office network thereby help and save the post office in the community too think have be clear understand that change be happen and people be not always comfortable with change we be in the middle of big technological shift we all agree that people should have access to good quality banking service contend that the government be take the appropriate action and take this matter extremely seriously question put and agree to house adjourn
