northern ireland assembly reform the first minister effectively collapse the institution and power sharing by resign on february behind these question be desire for the return of power sharing and the northern ireland executive desire that very much share hence my most recent discussion with the leader of most of the political party that take place in hillsborough on monday when we discuss the very many matter relate to this goal negotiation with the democratic unionist party have be ongoing for quite some time and they have not yet result in the restoration of the executive what do the secretary of state think the dup be look for can not answer for the dup and would never seek to do so but behind all this be the concern that it have about the northern ireland protocol as we leave the european union and how as consequence good be gradually be remove from northern ireland supermarket shelf visible sign that northern ireland be be pull away from the united kingdom sphere of influence and into the european sphere believe the windsor framework set that straight very much welcome the secretary of state commitment to billion financial package however we be seemingly at an impasse he will be aware that there be groundswell of opinion that believe element of the package should be release to address the ongoing crisis in our public service and in particular public sector pay pressure will he consider release some of that money to address public sector pay thank the hon gentleman for his question and indeed for the way in which he and his party have conduct themselves in the talk to try to restore the executive the uk government put an extremely fair and generous package for restore executive worth billion on the table before christmas the money that northern ireland civil servant and have available be from the budget pass in this place in the last year be recently in county kildare with the minister of state and the british irish parliamentary assembly work to build understanding between the two country we hear from irish ministers and the ambassador about the impact of the lack of function northern ireland assembly bear that in mind and the struggle that we know people be have in northern ireland with their bill potential strike action and all kind of issue can the secretary of state say bit more about what he be do and about the meeting and conversation he be have to work at pace to try to get solution thank the hon lady both for her interest and for the sentiment behind her question huge amount be happen include meeting galore with all the political party in northern ireland and especially the democratic unionist party because it be the dup that need to get on board so that the executive can be restore the hon lady say at pace and we will happily work at whatever pace we can but it be slightly determine by our interlocutor the current industrial action be due to hard press public servant feel that they be at the end of their tether would it not be well if the assembly be function normally so that this could be resolve as soon as possible yes the hon lady be exactly right there be fair and generous billion package on the table for restore executive to use for this purpose and many other as everyone involve in northern ireland politic understand there be need to transform public service in northern ireland and this package would help to do that too call the chair of the select committee commend my right hon friend for his effort to try to restore the assembly and the executive with big offer be it not right that be direct rule to be contemplate we would now need primary legislation follow the st andrews agreement the political reality be that it would mean huge political pressure on all of we here not only from within our united kingdom but from outside do he agree that the good way to preserve our great united kingdom be for everyone to get back around the table and to govern northern ireland from stormont thank my right hon and learn friend for his question and welcome his election as chair of the northern ireland affairs committee probably more than some other member will look to certain member on the benches opposite he be absolutely right in what he say there be no way this government want to go down the route of direct rule which would need primary legislation we do not want to go down the route of joint authority either and we will not do so we need to find an appropriate form to allow the executive to reform which be what we be work unbelievably hard on with our colleague in northern ireland do my right hon friend agree that it be deeply regrettable that the taoiseach leo varadkar be pander to his domestic audience rather than think of the great good of northern ireland and the victim of the trouble my right hon friend make very fair point because in the midst of everything we be try to do to get the executive back up and run the republic of ireland decision to take an inter state case out against the uk government on our northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act which be design to bring justice and information recovery to victim of the trouble be unhelpful and unfortunate we have make our representation very plain on that matter call the shadow secretary of state now that the talk have conclude with the house have vote overwhelmingly to support the windsor framework back in march labour members stand by our commitment to implement it if we be to be in government and we support the effort the government be make to restore the institution furthermore it be worth point out that there would be no prospect of negotiate with the european union further arrangement of benefit to northern ireland if the uk be to renege again on an international agreement it have sign will the secretary of state confirm that if the executive be not restore by tomorrow evening he will need to bring forward legislation to postpone the election thank the right hon gentleman for his question and for his affirmation of the work do on the windsor framework obviously will be do everything can to ensure that it be not labour government who come in to do any of this in the future however he be right to say that as of midnight on thursday tomorrow night will need to bring in primary legislation because duty fall on to call an election for the northern ireland assembly have number of week believe it be in which to do that and intend to bring in legislation on these matter next week be grateful for that clarification the absence of the executive and the failure to sort out the urgent question of public sector pay be go to result in the big strike in northern ireland for many year tomorrow some worker have not have pay rise for almost three year that be not sustainable as we await the restoration of the institution the party leader and indeed the head of the civil service in northern ireland have all call on the secretary of state to release the money for pay which he have say be available will he now do so so that public sector worker in northern ireland can get the pay increase they deserve be acutely aware of the industrial action schedule for tomorrow and the detrimental impact it will have on public service hear the call from the right hon gentleman and other to step in but let put this into slightly different context public sector pay be devolve to northern ireland and he will know that as mention early this parliament set the budget for northern ireland this year with primary legislation he will also know that decision on matter such as this be obviously one that locally elect ministers should take as they involve big and fundamental choice every penny spend on pay be penny not spend on service choice on this be therefore eminently political indeed they be as close as we would get to the choice make in the period of direct rule direct rule be absolutely not the way forward these decision be for the executive and restore executive have generous financial package available to they to do exactly as the right hon gentleman wish the secretary of state will know that northern ireland can benefit from power sharing arrangement only when those institution enjoy the support and confidence of both the nationalist and unionist community think have previously hear he accept that the northern ireland protocol do not enjoy the support of any unionist in northern ireland despite reference to talk have conclude in december the secretary of state helpfully indicate on monday this week that further progress have be make do he accept that the restoration of institution will be secure only when that confidence within the unionist community be put where it need to be thank the hon gentleman for his question and for the many many hour of work that he personally have put into the talk we have be have they be detailed talk and it be complex situation have say before because it be absolutely obvious that the unionists in northern ireland be deeply unhappy with the exist northern ireland protocol believe we have make excellent progress hope that in the come day and week we can get to point where his party can come to conclusion on those talk that lead we to reform the executive because know that he be democrat and want it reform appreciate the secretary of state remark he will have hear the concern around the general strike which will be call tomorrow he will know that his government dismiss our call when we say that there simply be not sufficient money he know we have to battle for sufficient money and that in the run up to christmas he personally secure the availability of that money the release of the fund be call for by the dup every political party in northern ireland the head of the northern ireland civil service and this morning chief executive of public sector agency across northern ireland do not believe there be lack of will on the secretary of state part but this be choice political choice that the government can make will the secretary of state use today to encourage his government colleague the treasury and anyone else who believe that use public sector worker as blackmail or political pawn be beneficial in any way thank the hon gentleman for his question and the way that he put it as mention early public sector pay be devolve and be properly matter for locally elect politician who be well place to take decision in that space flooding fund what progress he have make on allocate funding to help tackle the impact of flooding in northern ireland in the absence of the executive this government have make up to million of support available for business and non domestic property through the reallocation of exist funding it be for the northern ireland civil service and local council to consider how to utilise the remain fund to provide further support to business and non domestic property build resilience for the future be vital if this government be to address the challenge around climate change york resilience measure cost over million to protect my city this winter but the estimate cost to business in newry alone be million as result of the winter weather when will the minister bring forward proper amount of money not just million which may be deposit to ensure that northern ireland can build its resilience for the future will answer in couple of way first only just over million of that million have be draw down which be sign that the amount be sufficient secondly the northern ireland civil service have recently announce that up to million have be make available to assist small and medium sized business with up to available per business the experience of her constituent have the figure in front of show that this government be commit to our infrastructure be ready for the future that be partly why we be so keen to see the executive back with large package to help support the stabilisation and transformation of public service so we can get the kind of investment she refer to cost of live what recent discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the effect of increase in the cost of live on people in northern ireland what recent discussion he have have with the administration in northern ireland on the effect of increase in the cost of live on people in

decisive action to help tackle increase in the cost of living include support for the most vulnerable household in northern ireland we be target support this winter through range of measure include cost of live payment of it remain vital that there be function executive in place that can deliver for the people of northern ireland who deserve that stable government take the relevant decision want to return to the subject of public sector pay public sector worker in northern ireland have see their real pay fall by more than over the past year do that not demonstrate that the uk government response to the cost of living crisis be leave northern ireland behind encourage the minister to join the cross party call to ensure that public sector worker in northern ireland be fairly pay for their important work be grateful that the hon gentleman raise this matter again he will have hear what my right hon friend the secretary of state say wish to emphasise that the money that have be make available in what be large package for stabilisation and transformation in northern ireland include sum of money to enable public sector pay to be settle but that be matter to be decide in northern ireland that be why we continue to press the dup and other party with as much force as we can muster to restore the assembly and the executive to deal with that give that the uk be experience the big drop in living standard on record with household bear the brunt of high energy cost and temperature drop dramatically this week across northern ireland and indeed scotland why have the uk government leave household out in the cold this winter do not accept that we have leave household in the cold further cost of live support through the winter period for northern ireland household be announce in the autumn statement in with additional payment to household across the uk those on mean test benefit be get those on disability benefit and pensioner household we be resolve to promote prosperity in northern ireland and we be seize of the reality that disposable income in northern ireland be particularly squeeze that be why we have put in range of measure to promote prosperity which hope to return to in later answer we have just hear the minister say that income in northern ireland be particularly squeeze in november the typical monthly pay in northern ireland see month on month fall of by contrast typical wage in the uk show month on month increase that mean that earning in northern ireland sit below uk earning the big difference on record what step be be take now in the absence of function stormont to offer some kind of sustainable pay deal in northern ireland for public sector worker mr speaker could give lengthy answer to the hon lady question which would try your patience so will just return to her final question on what be be do for public sector worker we be absolutely seize as we have say previously of the need to ensure that public sector worker have pay rise that be why very substantial sum be in the package on the table for the party none the less we be absolutely clear that on this issue as across wide field of other about which be sure we will hear in the course of these question northern ireland need devolve government to take the relevant decision in northern ireland and on that there be consensus across the house the government package to support people with the cost of living amount to about billion over two year it be one of the most comprehensive in europe can my right hon friend assure the house that people in northern ireland as an integral part of our united kingdom have have full access to those cost of live support measure my right hon friend be absolutely right the extent of government support for northern ireland household be unprecedented it include the energy price guarantee on electricity and gas bill in payment comprise for energy bill support scheme payment plus to recognise the widespread use of home heating oil and target support for the most vulnerable household some of which have already touch on she be right that we be determined to ensure that northern ireland feel the benefit of be in the union of this united kingdom call the shadow minister recently meet the melted parents campaign group in belfast it speak for so many parent across northern ireland where the cost of living crisis be far hard for family because there be no funding for free childcare scheme or the or hour of pre school just eye watering and unaffordable bill but there be cross party childcare strategy proposal will the minister

payment scheme be devolved matter deliver by the victims payments board meet judge mcalinden the president of the board last week to discuss those matter accord to recent evidence present to the northern ireland affairs committee this be actually very serious it be not joke so maybe member would like to listen it could take more than year to process the application for the trouble victim

await payment what his government be do to deliver that compensation scheme as say have meet judge mcalinden be conduct review of the operation of the scheme which will report before august this year the review be under way and very much hope that it will address all those matter so that those who qualify for the payment get they in much more expedited way call snp spokesperson give the length of time it take in many case to gather the support evidence to make claim under the scheme the pressure on the payment board itself and the strong likelihood that many of those who be potentially eligible be yet to apply it be clear that there be risk that many who could be eligible for payment might miss out as thing stand one way the secretary of state could mitigate that be by extend the period allow for claim to be make and process as part of the review will he consider extend that deadline yes that be actually part of the review and one of the question we be look at the union what step he be take with cabinet colleague to strengthen northern ireland place in the union thank my hon friend for his question wish to reassure he that the uk government be fully commit to protect and uphold northern ireland place in the union regularly discuss matter of the union and the importance of northern ireland within it with cabinet colleague and frequently meet the secretaries of state for wales and for scotland would my right hon friend agree that the union be now strong than ever particularly with the decline of the snp and that its vital importance can be see not only in northern ireland but in border constituency such as mine clwyd south particularly in share service across the border with neighbour north shropshire such as the gobowen to wrexham line the and the chirk st martin gp partnership as we can see all politic be local and congratulate my hon friend on the success of shared cross border service in his constituency he be absolutely right know he be great champion of connectivity across the united kingdom and be sure that his constituent appreciate his effort on those matter every devious deceitful and dishonest tactic be be use to try to bribe bully and beat unionists into accept the windsor framework and the northern ireland protocol despite the impact it have on our citizenship and on the union it seem that the late recruit be the chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland who only this week tell the bbc that unionist should get back to stormont because constitutional issue be the responsibility of the eu and the irish government in any settlement would have say in the future of northern ireland can the secretary of state confirm that this conservative and unionist government have not hand constitutional control of northern ireland to the eu and that the chairman of the northern ireland affairs committee have either become an over zealous advocate of the scare tactic or be talk through his hat see you be as brief as ever mr base on that cheer the select committee chair have lot of work to do to increase his popularity in this house as ever the right hon gentleman ask question in his characteristic shrink violet way completely disagree with what he say about my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland we need to get deal do now the people of northern ireland want to get deal do it be time for deal to be do let we get the executive back up and run before we come to prime minister question be pleased to inform the house that since last week we have be provide british sign language coverage on all question and statement as matter of course this be available directly on and it be also available to broadcaster and medium outlet who may be interested in take up the live feed be delighted that the house service have be able to deliver this significant improvement in the accessibility of our proceeding prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday january this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house shall have further such meeting later today accord to the alzheimer society nearly people be currently live with dementia in my colne valley constituency of whom have have formal diagnosis that figure go up by one this week with my dad diagnosis my dad be my constituent will my right hon friend pledge to make dementia priority by drive up diagnosis rate bolster dementia research invest in social care and improve access to the most innovative diagnostic method and to new life change treatment send my warm wish to my hon friend and his father and family recognise that dementia diagnosis can bring worry both for the person who be diagnose and for their wide family he be absolutely right about the timely diagnosis of dementia it be vital to ensure that those affect can access the care and support they need nhs england be carry out pilot to ensure that we can improve dementia diagnosis in care home and our major condition strategy include focus on dementia crucially as he say we be now double the funding for dementia research so that we can help everyone include his father we now come to the leader of the opposition send my good wish to the hon member for colne valley jason mccartney and his father and to all those suffering in that way can not let today pass without say how saddened be by the tragic death of bronson battersby age just two who die in heartbreaking circumstance in skegness know that the house will join in send our deep sympathy to his family the government have be force to admit that they have lose contact with of the people earmark for removal to rwanda have the prime minister find they yet what can tell the right hon and learn gentleman be that in spite of he seek to block every single attempt that we have make we have now manage because of our action to reduce the number of people come here by over third last year to remove more than people from this country back to their home country to carry out more illegal immigration enforcement raid to arrest hundred of people to close down thousand of bank account and to process more than case the big number in more than year that be because on the conservative side of the house we want to stop the boat we have plan and it be work with he we would just go back to square one my first thought be how do you actually lose people then remember that this be the government who scrap high speed but the cost be still rise by billion this be the government who spend million of taxpayer money on rwanda scheme yet can not deport single person and this be the government who wag week long war on the greek prime minister for reason know only to themselves and suddenly remember that of course this farce of government could lose the people they be plan to remove the prime minister do not answer the question so will ask he again where be the people the government have lose where be they as say we have actually identify and remove over people from this country back to where they belong the right hon and learn gentleman ask these question about the rwanda scheme but it be important that we get it up and run because it be important as the national crime agency say that we have work deterrent in order to resolve this issue that be how australia solve the problem and that be how albania have work for we he ask these question about the detail of those thing but we all know that he do not actually care about solve the problem we know that because the bbc quiz he ask if the number cross the channel on small boat decline so it work would you still reverse it the labour leader say yes it be crystal clear that he do not have plan and it will be back to square one spend million on not get anybody to rwanda while lose people be not plan it be farce only this government could waste hundred of million of pound on removal policy that do not remove anyone only this government could claim that they will get flight off the ground only to discover that they can not find plane only this government could sign removal deal with rwanda only to end up take people from rwanda to here the prime minister still have not answer the question so will try again what progress have he make in locate the people his government have apparently lose he have dodge it three time where be they it be the same thing again and again here we be talk about what we be do and be happy to go over it what be we do we have increase the number of illegal immigration enforcement raid by lead to thousand of arrest use power that the right hon and learn gentleman seek to block in this house we have close down thousand of bank account of illegal worker again use power that he seek to order mr ashworth do you want that early cup of tea or will you be silent as say we have work through record number of case and return record number of people back to where they come from all that be plan that be work and we can see that it be work because the number of people come to this country be down by over third again it be bit rich to hear the right hon and learn gentleman pretend here that he care about how we actually stop the boat when he have be crystal clear in say that even if the plan to reduce the number be work he would still scrap it that be because he have no value no conviction and no plan it be back to square one more order no the prime minister do not have clue where they be have he can tell you one place they be not and that be rwanda the only people he have send to rwanda be cabinet ministers for all the word the ridiculous thing be that we know the prime minister himself do not even believe in this rwanda gimmick he have to be talk out of scrap the whole thing he do not want to fund it he do not think it would work when he see his party tear itself apart hundred of bald man scrap over single broken comb do he not wish that he have have the courage to stick to his gun have absolute conviction that the plan we have put in place will work because believe it be important that we grip this problem the right hon and learn gentleman spend lot of his time in this house talk about his time as lawyer and would urge he to listen to lawyer because lord wolfson have say that our bill severely limit the ground for removal four eminent king counsel have say that it be undoubtedly the most robust piece of immigration legislation this parliament have see order want to hear what the prime minister have to say because it matter to my constituent those who feel that it do not matter to theirs should please leave as say mr speaker four eminent kc have say that this be undoubtedly the most robust legislation this parliament have see and former supreme court justice have be clear that the bill would work but know that the right hon and learn gentleman have always be more interested in what leftie lawyer have to say even have in my hand the textbook that he author for they it be call european human rights law by keir starmer prime minister when stand up please sit down can just say that we do not use prop in this house if you need reminding will certainly ensure that do so it be such utterly pathetic nonsense the prime minister have be brutally expose by his own mps yet again he have one party chair who say that she hop the lords will rip his rwanda deal to piece and two more who have to quit because they do not think it will work all of they appoint by he all now in open revolt against his policy each other and reality be it any wonder that they all think this gimmick be doom to failure when the prime minister himself do not believe in it it be rich to hear from the right hon and learn gentleman about belief in something it will be news to he that it be actually the case that you can believe in something and stick to that position on this side of the house interruption can just say to member on the government side that this be very important it be an important day people want to know what be go on so want my constituent just like yours to hear what the prime minister have to say just this week we have another example of the right hon and learn gentleman do one thing and say another this week he back the home secretary in ban the terrorist group hizb ut tahrir despite he personally use the european court of human rights to try to stop they be ban you do not have to take my word for it the extremist own press release say and quote the hizb ut tahrir legal team lead by keir starmer know that he do not like talk about they because they have be client but when see group chant jihad on our street ban they he invoice they interruption there be eight question that think some member might want to hear answer tell you what some who want question have already go off the list if the prime minister stick to his position he would be vote with we his former home secretary say that the plan will not work his current home secretary call it batshit his former immigration minister do not back his plan and even the prime minister himself do not believe in it last week another of his mp say that the tories should admit that thing have get bad since they come to office that after year they have leave britain less united and that the country be sad place if the prime minister can not even persuade his own mps that it be worth support he and if he himself do not even believe in his own policy why on earth should anyone else think differently another week when it be crystal clear that the right hon and learn gentleman do not believe in anything and he do not have plan while he talk the country down let update he on what have actually be happen in the past week inflation more than halve from to and real wage rise for the fifth month in row last week rate start fall and million of people benefit from tax cut worth so while he take we back to square one with billion tax grab let we stick with the plan that be deliver bright future for britain it be against the law to silence victim of crime but that be exactly what the post office do through the use of non disclosure agreement and this be just the most recent case of nda cover up mismanagement misconduct and even crime at work will my right hon friend the prime minister consider ban their use in all severance agreement once and for all my right hon friend be right to raise an important point the ability to speak out about thing be key to unlock justice while nda can have place and my right hon friend be right to say that they should not be use to stop victim of crime in particular get the justice they deserve can tell she that the ministry of justice be carefully consider how good to address this issue include the use of legislation and know that my right hon and learn friend the justice secretary will keep the house update on further progress call the snp leader when people wake up today in home that they can not afford to heat with mortgage that they be struggle to pay to news that inflation be once again on the rise they will have look to westminster for answer and instead they find uk government who be tear themselves apart over how quickly they can send vulnerable people on plane to rwanda surely the prime minister must understand that the anger that some of his own back benchers have towards he be no comparison to the anger that the public have towards his party if the hon gentleman do care about support work family to pay their bill and to pay their mortgage why on earth be the snp make scotland the highest tax part of the united kingdom where the average not the wealthy but the average worker in scotland be now pay more tax than they do in england of course when it come to the rwanda bill the reality be that if you want to stop the smuggler gang you should introduce safe and legal route but instead the prime minister be seek to weaponise some of the most vulnerable people in society it be straight out of the cruel and callous right wing extremist playbook his time in office be fast approach its conclusion do he seriously want this to be his legacy as say it be important that we stop the boat because illegal migration be simply not fair it be not right that some people jump the queue and take away our resource from those who need our help most and by the way they be exploit by gang and many of they lose their life make these dangerous crossing so completely disagree with the hon gentleman the fair and compassionate thing to do be to break these criminal gang and that be why we be go to stop the boat unexpectedly five month ago have heart attack thank to the swift action of the nhs emergency service it be catch early so one stent operation later be on swift path to rehabilitation and recovery and be sit here today fight fit and bit light too so along with encourage everyone to visit the british heart foundation website to understand the early warning sign and get fantastic resource to help they would the prime minister also join in personally thank everyone who help to save my life and help recover include the east of england ambulance service the team at watford general hospital and harefield hospital the cardiac rehabilitation team and everyone who support especially my family and my team some of whom be in the gallery today who help to ensure that continue to deliver for the great people of watford thank my hon friend for share his story and know the whole house will be delighted to hear that he have make swift recovery we all wish he good health for the future as he resume his excellent campaigning on behalf of his constituent in watford also join he in thank our fantastic nhs staff for the life save work that they do up and down the country we be back they with record resource from our doctor to our ambulance service and we be all in this house truly grateful for what they do mr speaker until the uk government call for an immediate ceasefire it be complicit in the horror in gaza those be not my word but those of the head of oxfam who like every single agency try to operate on the ground be clear that aid can not be effectively deliver while fighting continue more uk aid be of course welcome but even when it do get through it can result in what one palestinian aid worker call bomb we on full stomach some people have already be kill so what will it take for the prime minister to back permanent bilateral ceasefire of course we want to see peaceful resolution to this conflict as soon as possible sustainable permanent ceasefire with an end to the destruction fighting and loss of life the release of hostage and no resumption of hostility would of course be the good way forward but in order to achieve that number of thing need to happen hamas would have to agree to release all the hostage hamas would have to no long be in charge of gaza the threat of more rocket attack from hamas into israel would have to end and the palestinian authority boost with assistance would need to return to gaza in order to provide governance and aid that be sustainable ceasefire that we will work very hard to bring about today be unsure whether to raise national issue such as the desperate need for minister for man or local issue such as doncaster need for new hospital or edlington for new leisure centre but think the good thing could do be ask the prime minister to come and have tour of doncaster and while be show he around my home town can press the need for minister for man can show he the site for new hospital and can introduce he to the people of edlington so that he can discuss their new leisure centre will the prime minister accept my invitation thank to my hon friend fantastic campaigning on behalf of his constituent city of doncaster council have receive more than million in levelling up funding to support its regeneration project and most recently doncaster have be award million in our long term plan for town over the next year which know he be work very hard to make sure be prioritise for local people will be delighted to discuss both project and his other idea when come and visit he as soon as my diary allow some of request for funding from the community ownership fund aim at save library pub and village hall have be reject since it pit community against each other and do nothing to address the underlie cause that have lead to the loss of these much love asset when will the government offer more than simple sticking plaster for our town high street and community set up the community ownership fund when be chancellor and it be do fantastic work fund hundred of project across the country include believe one in the hon lady constituency the back on the map scheme it be there to support local community take over asset whether pub village hall or other community asset and be do fantastic job it be right that there be competitive process because we want to make sure the money be deploy in the area where it can make the most difference over crowding on chiltern railways have become daily misery for commuter from station include haddenham and thame parkway and princes risborough in my constituency the root cause of which be an age fleet constantly break down and short train have to be run there be proposal on the table for both short term additional capacity and long term fleet renewal will my right hon friend instruct the department for transport to fast track those proposal so we can end overcrowding on chiltern agree with my hon friend that the performance on chiltern have not be good enough in recent time know that chiltern have recently begin engagement with the rolling stock leasing market which will help reduce overcrowding but also together with dft it be look at provide additional capacity at peak time know that the rail minister my hon friend the member for bexhill and battle huw merriman will ensure that these plan continue to progress and keep my hon friend the member for buckingham greg smith update what exactly be it about the prospect of deportation to rwanda that make the government think it will be such deterrent to asylum seeker do they think that life in rwanda be somehow less comfortable secure and safe than here in the united kingdom what do the government think be wrong with rwanda that mean asylum seeker will not want to live

tragedy in family be not responsible for the prime minister answer and have be give no notice that statement be forthcoming what know however be that can rest assure that the right hon lady will not

farron present bill to require that every child be offer at least one outdoor education experience during primary school year and at least one such experience during secondary school year and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill clean air human rights motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to establish the right to breathe clean air to require the secretary of state to achieve and maintain clean air in england to involve the uk health security agency in set and review pollutant and their limit to enhance the power duty and function of various agency and authority in relation to air pollution to establish the citizens commission for clean air with power to institute or intervene in legal proceeding to require the secretary of state and the relevant national authority to apply environmental principle in carry out their duty under this act and the clean air enactment and for connected purpose in the life of nine year old ella roberta adoo kissi debrah be tragically cut short when she suffer fatal asthma attack ella live close to the heavily congested south circular in lewisham and follow an inquest in become the first person to have air pollution list on her death certificate with the coroner philip barlow conclude that ella die of asthma contribute to by exposure to excessive air pollution next week would have be ella birthday and know that all our thought will be with her family at this time want to pay tribute to ella mum rosamund who be in the public gallery today for her incredible campaigning on air pollution and to express my personal thank to she for allow this bill to be call ella law in memory of her daughter it be an honour to be able to present it to the house today this bill be need because to put it simply the state of our filthy air be public health emergency air pollution be associate with condition such as asthma heart disease and cancer and have be show to have an impact on our mental health too lead to an increase risk of schizophrenia depression and anxiety its impact be not equally feel however with those on low income and from black and ethnic minority background far more likely to live in polluted area it be child health that be affect most of all study publish just last week by the university of dundee reveal an increase in the number of admit to hospital for respiratory problem follow period of high air pollution while study conduct by king college london show that live within metre of busy road could stunt child lung growth by up to let put that in context it be estimate that in london third of the population about million people live near busy road it be therefore profoundly shocking but perhaps not entirely surprising that the uk have one of the high rate of asthmatic child across europe with one in young people live with asthma it have be calculate that clean air could prevent up to avoidable death in the uk each year and it could save the public purse billion as well estimate of the public cost of air pollution total as much as billion each year include the cost of the impact on social care and on our crumble nhs it could not be more urgent for the government to take action to clean up our air and protect life both now and in the future could not be more urgent but although their current approach be vastly insufficient ministers remain bullish in defend their effort indeed last year the prime minister himself tell we be confident that the measure we be put in place be not only legally binding but world lead in tackle air quality he go on to say that the environment act provide the capability accountability and ambition need to make all the effective intervention to drive down air pollution official report february vol the reality be however that the environment act do very little to help deliver clean air and it be certainly not world lead the environmental target that do get make under it to reduce level of to microgram per cubic metre fall short of the new world health organisation guideline of microgram per cubic metre and could certainly be achieve far early than the government target date of indeed when professor frank kelly of imperial college london an adviser to the world health organisation on health and pollution recently give evidence to the environmental audit committee he state very clearly our study show that of the uk could achieve figure of microgram per metre cub by and the that could not be certain hotspot in london which again if you take extra measure on you could probably eliminate those as well professor sir stephen holgate from the university of southampton special adviser on air quality to the royal college of physicians subsequently write to the committee to confirm that such change would result in about few infant death each few life lose and family save from unimaginable heartache give that the mayor of london have already commit himself to deliver on this more ambitious target and give such significant benefit it be incumbent on ministers to explain why the current legal limit remain so unambitious they must also set out as matter of urgency how they will meet the new who guideline which have halve the limit for to microgram per cubic metre in response to the marked increase in evidence show how air pollution affect different aspect of our health in the word of the chief medical officer professor chris whitty we can and should go far and it be technically possible to do so the clean air human rights bill or ella law would set out an entirely new approach to deliver clean air in england it would enshrine the human right to clean air precisely and explicitly in english law thereby transform decision making by public authority by require they to consider clean air alongside other right under the human rights act it would be step towards incorporate the resolution adopt by the un general assembly which recognise the human right to clean healthy and sustainable environment it follow one air approach that encompass the health and environmental impact of air pollution and greenhouse gas and it would set standard base on advice from the climate change committee and on the who new air quality guideline and require the secretary of state to achieve clean air within five year with the possibility of postponement for up to further five year per pollutant subject to strict condition the environment agency and the climate change committee would be require to review the pollutant and the limit annually and advise the secretary of state if they need tighten the bill also cover air pollution both outdoors and indoor in public space and where health and safety standard apply the tragic death of two year old awaab ishak bring on by extensive mould in his family flat shine spotlight on the significance of indoor air pollution while welcome the prompt action take by the secretary of state for levelling up in bring forward awaab law law that should now frankly also be apply to the private rent sector through the renters reform bill it be clear that legislation to address indoor air pollution must extend beyond the home too especially since on average we spend around of our life indoor whether for work study or leisure finally in order to ensure independent scrutiny and continuous improvement the bill would establish citizen commission for clean air which would review annually the secretary of state compliance with the provision of the bill and advise the secretary of state where improvement be need this bill have already undergo significant scrutiny in the other place after my noble friend and green party peer baroness jones of moulsecoomb top the private member bill ballot in the previous parliamentary session it have already be extensively debate amend and improve and it receive cross party support include from lord randall of uxbridge former environment adviser to the right hon member for maidenhead mrs may when she be prime minister he say we have wait too long for proper clean air legislation urge the minister to take this back and say that it be golden opportunity to do something really wonderful the government could take pride in be part of world beat report house of lords november vol he be absolutely right by take up ella law the government have real opportunity to genuinely lead the world in tackle this press public health emergency and urge they to take it

want to speak to two amendment but one in particular and that be the one with respect to rule let say at the outset of this debate that do not believe that our membership of the european convention on human right be sustainable think that that will become clear and clear to the british public in the month and year ahead but that be not the purpose of my amendment today and it be not the subject of this debate that be discussion for another day what we be discuss here be whether we believe it be appropriate for foreign judge in an international court to impose late night judgment often without the united kingdom be able to give its own argument or to hear the reason for that judgment whether we think that that really accord with the rule of law particularly in relation to this policy and whether we be willing to see the same thing happen again that happen in the summer of when judge do just that ground the flight and prevent the policy lead to month indeed year of legal action and ten of thousand of illegal migrant break into our country cost our taxpayer billion of pound imperille life in the channel and perpetuate this challenge for year to come be happy to support my right hon friend tonight on this amendment as do last night be on the council of europe so take quite lot of interest in this there be an established legal principle that in fact the judge be act ultra vis in and that it be not in his power to do that there be also an established legal opinion that our government could actually have ignore it how do this relate to my right hon friend amendment will come on to the exact point that my right hon friend be make they be fair and important one as night follow day if we do not make change in this respect we will find ourselves in few month time in exactly the same position that my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel be in as home secretary in the summer of wherein the strasbourg court could issue one or potentially many rule interim measure the decision about what to do will fall to minister perhaps my hon and learn friend the minister for counter illegal migration and other colleague within government the court will be involve and we will find ourselves in very difficult indeed intractable situation as have say before set this scheme in train without know what we would do when that happen be bit like pull the pin out of grenade but not be prepared to throw it this be entirely foreseeable let we find way through this challenge to answer the question from my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and to address the legitimate challenge that be make to those like who make this argument we have to go back to the foundation of the court many of my colleague say well it be great conservative and british jurist who be the author of the european convention on human right why would you want to alter what they create with respect that be misunderstanding of what be do when the convention be found and the treaty sign no one sign up to the court be able to make binding injunction in fact quite the opposite it be consider at the time and reject the uk like all other signatory to the european convention expressly decline to give the court the power to make bind interim measure this be create by activist judge in in response to the mamatkulov and askarov turkey case whereby the court confer upon itself power that be not give in the treaty it be mistake that the united kingdom have for many year by convention go along with the approach the court have take to itself do not take my word for it take the word of many eminent jurist and lawyer when this very point be consider in the other place during the passage of the illegal migration act not dissimilar point will not put word into their lordship mouth be make by the noble lord sandhurst the noble lord faulks and the noble lord woolf in foreword to an important piece relate to this debate the noble and learn lord sumption make similar and very important point in fact the professor of international law at the university of oxford professor richard ekins whom many of we respect highly have say that to change the current approach be not to breach the rule of law but to defend the rule of law because we as signatory to the european convention expressly object to the approach which have be confer by activist judge outside the rule of law we should not be follow through with this at least the right hon gentleman have the strength to be vocal about what he actually believe which be more than can be say for many other conservative members he have make it clear that he could not care less about what the european convention on human right say will he go far and openly say that this vile dangerous and inhumane bill have one purpose which be to flout international law and that his party could not care less about the human right of the most vulnerable individual it be pity but can not say be surprised that the hon gentleman sink to those depth and do not present proper legal argument have he be listen to he would have hear that do not say anything of the sort the case that be advance be far from an undermining of the european convention on human right although there be many who might wish to leave it we be defend the original intent of the european convention on human right and the rule of law because it be not sustainable for activist judge in strasbourg to bend and change the original intent of the signatory to that convention in way that they would never have accept by invent new power want we to defend the rule of law and in this case it be well defend by say that the court interim measure be not bind on the uk either on the domestic plane or on ministers it be well that we simply return to the position before in fact think most of this happen under labour government be this british exceptionalism be the right hon gentleman make the case that the echr should no long apply only to the uk or be he say that it be not fit for purpose across the board and should be scrap entirely it seem as if we be have dialogue of the deaf because that be not what say at all say that the debate about the european convention be for another day but the hon gentleman be say that the decision of the strasbourg court in to confer upon itself without seek the consent of any of the signatory to the convention the ability to impose bind interim injunction on other country be the right way forward and indeed that those injunction should be able to be make at the eleventh hour in the middle of the night without give reason without ask for our argument and without even name the judge behind the ruling that pose very serious rule of law question and be reason why convention such as the echr be increasingly out of step my right hon friend be of course right that it contradict the long establish custom and practice that be the accepted basis for the rule of law in this country he cite lord sumption and lord woolf but he might also have cite the constitutionalist dicey who long ago support by lord denning and many other after establish that the relationship between the rule of law and this place be that polity can make and change law because it have the legitimacy to do so confer on it by the people frankly that mean this house be supreme that in no way underestimate the significance of international agreement and treaty but it affirm the significance and sovereignty of this house entirely agree with my right hon friend as somebody who have serve on the council of europe and be proud to do so because of the united kingdom history of set it up to protect citizen from overbear government think it be worth look at the datum on interim measure in request be make to the strasbourg court for interim measure against this government and zero be grant in request be make and two be grant and in request be make against this government and five be grant that be just seven out of be the right hon gentleman really suggest that this government get thing right all the time so there should be no capacity to challenge they legally even when irrevocable harm be on the agenda that be not the point be make once again the hon lady be not listen the point be make be not about the virtue or otherwise of our membership of the european convention on human right which have say be matter for another day the discussion on the amendment be simply about whether we believe it be right that the strasbourg court should confer upon itself without our consent the ability to impose bind injunction there be separate question not unrelated as to how those injunction be make would like to believe that most of we agree that do they late at night with an unnamed judge without give reason raise serious rule of law question perhaps the hon lady disagree with that but the purpose of the amendment be to enable we to return to previous position interruption she now have her clip for social medium so the rest of the debate be largely irrelevant want to address the point of law in respect of the strasbourg court the difficulty with the right hon gentleman argument be that under the scheme of the convention the court be the body that determine the meaning of the convention not just in the case but consistently thereafter the court have hold that fail to comply with interim measure amount to breach of article of the convention that be the legal difficulty with his argument be it not no there may be good faith disagreement between the hon and learn lady and but do not believe that international body and court should be able to grow organically as result of the decision of activist judge this be matter of the rule of law and of parliamentary sovereignty we in the united kingdom choose to be signatory to the european convention on human right and do not think it be correct that the court give itself this power in return to how this matter relate to the policy first let we cast our mind back to the summer of rule interim measure be impose by the court to ground flight and to prevent we from proceed with the policy do we think that anything have change in the month and year that have pass my conjecture be no we will be in exactly the same position in few month time unless we take action we include provision in the illegal migration act that merely restate the orthodox constitutional and legal position that in theory it be at minister discretion whether to comply with rule interim measure underlie that be the government legal advice which believe to be erroneous for the reason have just describe that they would be in breach of international law not to do so as far as be aware the attorney general and the government legal service therefore continue to advise ministers and civil servant that decision not to support rule interim measure would be illegal and in breach of the ministerial code my good recollection be that no minister should give any indication that they would ignore rule interim measure the attorney general position as understand it be that there be very small number of case in which it be conceivable that one could do so but that be vanishingly slim number of case and situation as night follow day if that position be to continue we would find ourselves in exactly the same situation as we be in during the summer of do not want to be in that position it would be huge breach of trust with the british public if we know that something be likely if we watch this train not speed down the track but move slowly towards we and have ample opportunity to resolve the issue but choose to do absolutely nothing we have kick the can down the road and now there be no more road at the end of the road there be precipice we be move forward with scheme but we do not know how to implement it we be pull the pin out of the grenade but we have not get the gut to throw it we need to resolve this and the way to do that be simple the government could accept the amendment that stand in my name and those of many other to do so be not to say that we be leave the european convention on human right there be respectable international law argument behind the amendment and would wager that the government would have no difficulty in find senior king counsel and former judge in the other place who would support my position and the government position should they choose to adopt it the government could change some of the accompany minor documentation such as the civil service code and the ministerial code would not place too much emphasis on those at the end of the day this be not about civil servant it be about ministers and the law good captain do not blame his sailor it be on we we have the power to fix this and we have the responsibility so let we use the opportunity we have today with the amendment to resolve this situation if we do not we will be here in two month time the strasbourg court will impose rule measure and the government will be scramble around try to resolve the situation and they will have no one else to blame be here to help the government to ensure that this policy work because like everyone at least on this side of the committee believe passionately that we have to make this policy work and to stop the boat so strongly encourage my hon and learn friend the minister and indeed the prime minister to support the amendment and encourage everyone else on both side of the committee who share my determination to fix this problem to do exactly the same call the shadow minister it be pleasure to serve under your chairship again dame rosie here we go again it be day two in committee for the third asylum bill in less than two year and day of the rwanda psychodrama that the conservative party continue to inflict on our weary and baffled nation let we not forget that the rwanda saga start off as operation save big dog that desperate and thankfully doom attempt to save the skin of boris johnson but then for some bizarre reason know only to conservative members it do not fade away once mr johnson exit stage right quite the opposite it take on life of its own evolve into an article of faith for the conservative party purity test that have come to define whether or not someone be true believer so vast quantity of political capital and untold amount of government time resource and energy have be squander on policy that at most might one day enable the transfer of few hundred asylum seeker to rwanda it truly be an absolutely extraordinary state of affair meanwhile out there in the real world food bill be spiral and mortgage be go through the roof million people be on nhs waiting list raw sewage be be pump into our river and at least people risk life and limb to cross the channel on small boat nothing in this bill will address any of those challenge not even the last one as say yesterday the rwanda plan be extortionately expensive with million on its way or commit to the government of rwanda without single asylum seeker ever have be send there in addition to that vast sum it will cost at least to send each individual asylum seeker to rwanda the figure will probably be far high but the government be refuse to come clean on that point the plan be also unworkable because there be no evidence that send just few hundred asylum seeker will deter the ten of thousand who be cross the channel each year desperate people who have risk life and limb crossing continent to escape violence and persecution be not go to be deter by less than chance of be send to rwanda of course we know that in addition to be unaffordable and unworkable the scheme be unlawful as have be find by the supreme court owe to rwanda not be as it stand safe country yet here we be again be force to indulge the fantasy fixation and psychodrama of conservative members we have hear that before but let we address the narrow legal point do the hon gentleman think that it be right for strasbourg judge to impose an injunction in the night on his own without give the british government the chance to make their case what we be see be complete shambolic incompetence in the asylum system and if case be not make clearly and be open to legal appeal legal appeal will come and in some case will succeed on the broad point the uk be party to number of international agreement and convention that reality be extremely important to our national interest in many case it strengthen our sovereignty not weaken it so labour members be clear that politic be about choice and when we look at the big picture of our country place in the world it be absolutely clear that our sovereignty and national interest be strengthen not weaken by be party to these international agreement and convention it be deeply troubling that every day seem to bring new example of the tail wag the dog we now hear that the prime minister be assemble judge and staff to fast track rwanda case through our court sorry what do he not know that under his leadership and on his watch the crown court backlog in this country be at record high of victim of serious crime regularly wait more than two year for their day in court so that they can seek justice against the perpetrator the system be completely break because of year of tory incompetence and indifference yet the prime minster click his finger and glibly be apparently able to magic up judge and staff where on earth have those judge be hide all this time be they go to be new recruit or be they currently work if it be the latter be they go to be tell to drop everything and transfer to deal with asylum case trust the minister will be able to answer those question today but be not hold my breath regardless of the operational issue imagine the impact the prime minister glib announcement yesterday would have on you if you be rape victim who have be languish for year in our broken judicial system imagine the anger and disgust you would feel at the spectacle of conservative prime minister sacrifice your fight for justice on the altar of his desperate attempt to cling to power by appease his back benchers what an utterly shameful and shabby way for the prime minister of our country to behave on the point the shadow minister make about political choice he be valiantly oppose the bill and he vote against it on second reading just as do but do he recognise that give that this be the last session of this parliament the parliament act can not be engage and plenty will take place in the other place so the only way the bill will become law be if labour make the political choice to say that fighting and frustrate it any long be not in its interest thank the hon gentleman for his comment but we have make it absolutely clear that the bill be unaffordable unworkable and unlawful the opposition will never support any piece of legislation that be guilty of those three sin that be as clear as crystal to we with pride we vote against the bill on second reading with pride we vote against the amendment that would only make it even bad and with pride we will vote against it on third reading my hon friend be right about the purpose of the bill which be one of the most flagrant attempt to directly flout international human right law that we have see do he agree that that be the only purpose of the bill before we today thank my hon friend for his powerful intervention it be difficult to determine the true purpose of the bill these day because it have become embroil in various tory internal war fight between faction and certain people leadership ambition but we know it will not stop the tory small boat chaos it be that chaos that have to be stop the people smuggler gang be trade in human misery and must be stop but we need practical sensible pragmatic measure rather than the headline chase gimmick we have see from this government over the last year and month the irony of the announcement yesterday about the judge be that by definition it be an admission of failure because it recognise that the bill will fail to prevent the legal challenge and appeal that the judge will be work on the prime minister announcement yesterday be further evidence of the profoundly troubling way in which the government be prepared to disregard and disrespect our judiciary urge member on all benches to take careful note of what sue carr the lady chief justice tell the justice committee yesterday afraid that this headline draw matter of judicial responsibility into the political arena matter of deployment of judge the allocation of work for judge and the use of courtroom be exclusively matter for the judiciary and more specifically matter for myself and the senior president of the tribunal it really important that people understand that clear division there speak true democrat the shadow minister know that our view on the government benches be that the problem can not be comprehensively tackle without deterrent can not think of any example around the world where it have be tackle without deterrent the shadow minister have speak before about safe and legal route and have ask he question about whether the number use those route should be cap or uncap so have he think about what the cap level would be what would be the number it be clear that in order to stop the tory small boat chaos we have to smash the criminal smuggler gang that will be do through enhance co operation with european partner and ally the shadow home secretary and the leader of the opposition visit europol recently it be hugely important that we get well datum sharing and co operation with european authority such as europol and frontex in order to be able to smash the criminal gang upstream as will go on to say in my remark the more we jeopardise co operation with our european partner and ally by threaten to leave the european convention the more difficult we make it to have that european co operation and the more we undermine our own ability to deter the criminal smuggler gang if someone be look for definition of counterproductive legislation and policy this would be the one they would go for rise the shadow minister make good point about co operation he be right that the only way to tackle the problem be through suite of measure under an umbrella policy but as my hon friend the member for ipswich tom hunt just describe an important part of that be deterrence the brand and the marketing message of the criminal gang be that people will get to britain and never leave sadly that have too often be the case have it not as say yesterday there be pragmatic sensible thing the government have be do that we support for example the opposition fully support the albania deal the fact that removal to albania be facilitate by that deal have act as deterrent and lead to clear decrease in the number of albanians try to come over why do the government not do more of that they should do the pragmatic sensible stuff rather than be suck into endless bun fight about the rwanda deal which be unaffordable unworkable and unlawful say to the right hon gentleman that it be question of priority the government have limit time resource and energy so they should focus it on the stuff that work rather than on the headline chase gimmick the mantra have be clear for many month from the opposition benches include from the shadow minister himself about the need for safe and legal route can we have some indication of what level of immigration through safe and legal route would be need to address the problem put it to he that as soon as that cap be reach the rest will come by boat unless there be deterrent on safe and legal route as priority would look at thing like the afghan scheme which be completely and utterly break the afghan relocation and assistance policy have collapse and the afghan citizen resettlement scheme never really work which nationality be always in the top three or four nationality cross the channel the afghans we need to get the scheme that be currently in place work properly and then we need to look at international co operation work with our european partner and ally to create dynamic whereby the united kingdom do its bit as part of ensure that those try to cross the channel in small boat do not do so to draw the shadow minister back to the amendment and the interim measure of the strasbourg court and to build on the question ask by my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh be right in understanding that the labour party position be that it do not want to see reform of rule interim measure find that surprising give that the uk be work in concert with many perhaps all signatory of the european convention on human right to do just that most of our friend and ally in europe consider there to be serious rule of law issue arise from the so call pyjama injunction and like they we want to see they reform would the labour party abandon that piece of work when we enter government as hope we will everything we do will be base on test be it affordable be it workable and be it legal the legal piece have to be base on compliance with our international legal obligation however if one cherish something one also have to be open to change and improve it it be clear that global conversation and european conversation be require about the immigration position in which we find ourselves if we in concert with our international partner and ally can find way to improve the system of course labour would look to do that unfortunately we can not negotiate that deal from opposition but we will certainly prioritise that as and when we come into government rise if the hon gentleman do not mind will make little more progress and then come back to he order it be the convention that any member wish to intervene should have be in the chamber from the start of the speech know that the hon gentleman come into the chamber little after the start of stephen kinnock speech thank you dame rosie it be against the backdrop of chaos confusion and party before country that we consider the amendment before we today wish to start by comment on the amendment in the name of the former immigration minister the right hon member for newark robert jenrick this bill be riddle with shamefully anti democratic clause that undermine the rule of law and seek to undermine the convention and value that we on the labour benches hold dear perhaps the most egregious example of this be the admission in the bill that its provision may not comply with the united kingdom obligation under international law indeed clause explicitly disapplie international agreement include the refugee convention and the convention against torture the leader of the more moderate conservative caucus the one nation group describe this approach as authoritarian and betrayal of who we be as nation he be absolutely right on both point our liberal democratic nation be found on the rule of law and our respect for the judicial function our international standing be found on our commitment to human right and international law and our proud history be found on the delivery of those principle include indeed winston churchill himself help to establish britain as founder of the convention make the point yesterday will make it again now that it be not for politician to interfere with court judgment and it be not for the government to respond in knee jerk manner to court ruling that they dislike that be the behaviour of an autocracy not democracy how on earth can our country be the international standard bearer for the rule of law in the face of for example putin barbarism or an increasingly belligerent china if we be break our own international obligation indeed how can we even hold rwanda to account on its commitment within this new treaty if we be not practise what we preach then there be the real and present danger that this bill represent to the international agreement that britain be party to all of which be central to our national interest those who be worried about social medium may also find it useful to use their phone in the chamber to double check those international obligation and indeed the original text of the european convention on human right which state explicitly the high contracting parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the court in any case to which they be party from the start it be intend that there be listen to the right hon member for newark robert jenrick hope that he will accord the same respect and courtesy to do my hon friend agree that from the start it be envisage that it be an important check and balance to involve the court in decision making my hon friend make very good point as we have also see in the letter that nathalie loiseau send to she about the potential risk that there be to the trade and co operation agreement and to range of other commitment it be absolutely clear that it be in our national interest to pool our sovereignty with other nation through these convention in order to strengthen our own national sovereignty agree absolutely with she on that point let we look at some of these agreement first the european convention on human right be weave integrally into many different part of the good friday agreement the political settlement in northern ireland should not be take for grant so disapplye the echr in british legislation would be play with fire in that regard the prime minister very own windsor framework which seek to resolve the issue around trade and northern ireland post brexit be agree on the basis of the uk full commitment to the good friday agreement be sure that the prime minister would not want to accidentally set fire to his own carefully craft negotiation the eu uk trade and co operation agreement include clause on important mutual security co operation which be reliant on britain commitment to the european convention on human right under article and of the tca uk withdrawal from the echr entitle the eu to immediately suspend or terminate the entirety of section of the tca therefore introduce notwith stand clause into the bill mean that the government would also be dice with the risk of jeopardise security co operation with our european partner and ally the irony here be that this very security co operation and data sharing be of pivotal importance when it come to smash the criminal gang that be behind the small boat crossing this bill which be design to deal with the issue of the small boat crossing and the criminal gang could undermine the very co operation that be suppose to be smash those gang you literally could not make it up do not believe that such legislative belligerence be in the interest or the tradition of the conservative party and certainly do not believe that it be in the interest or tradition of our own proud nation the amendment that have be table by the former immigration minister would be afraid simply increase all the risk that have describe so we on the labour benches will be oppose they let turn now to labour amendment again stress that we reject the bill in its entirety and that our amendment be design to limit the damage of this unaffordable unworkable and unlawful piece of legislation major concern of ours be the way the government be handle the entire rwanda saga from the point of view of transparency everything from cost and the processing capacity of the rwandan government to ministers try to hide the fact that criminal will be send from rwanda back to the uk and the fact that the uk may have to take some refugee from rwanda our amendment and new clause and be all part of an attempt to force the government to shed more light on the less clear aspect of the scheme and to introduce more accountability amendment would require the government to publish full impact assessment set out the cost per person for the removal scheme and the confidential financial memorandum already agree between the two country we believe that the cost per person be far high than the already acknowledge by the government and we want ministers to come clean on that point new clause would require the secretary of state to report to parliament on regular basis every day as with the monitor committee on the operation of the scheme include datum on the number of people relocate to rwanda and the cost incur by the uk government similarly new clause would require regular reporting on the number of asylum seeker declare inadmissible under the illegal migration act from the point of its entry into force whenever that may be and the number of such asylum seeker who be subsequently remove to rwanda new clause would impose further reporting requirement on the government include on the number of individual involve in criminal activity who have be transfer from rwanda to the uk in the event of any such transfer the government would be require to table debateable motion in parliament so that mps could consider whether in the light of the transfer the operation of the treaty should be suspend it be important that the british public understand just how many foreign criminal the conservative government will be import back into our country as part of this rwanda deal further amendment relate to the monitor committee central part of the new treaty which both side be require to set up in order to oversee the operation of the removal scheme and to provide mechanism for individual asylum seeker to lodge confidential complaint directly with the committee the supreme court raise initial concern about the capacity of the committee to review complaint in its judgment our amendment would make the establishment of this committee necessary precondition for the commencement of this act new clause would place the committee on statutory footing the monitoring committee would be require to report to parliament every day confirm that all the relevant obligation set out in the treaty be be fully comply with in the event that the monitoring committee either fail to meet the day requirement or report to parliament that rwanda be not in full compliance with any provision of the treaty this act would effectively be suspend from be in force until any issue with timing or compliance have be resolve link to this new clause stipulate that the operation of this act should be suspend at any time when the monitoring committee be not in operation finally new clause state that it be for minister of the crown and that minister only to decide whether to comply with any interim measure issue by the echr for the purpose of block person removal to rwanda amendment stipulate that in make such decision the minister in question must consult the attorney general the conservative psychodrama of the past hour only go to serve the old political adage if prime minister be incapable of manage his own party he must be utterly incapable of run the country the resignation of not one but two deputy chair last night follow by strong rebellion illustrate the level of utter incompetence at the heart of his administration we know what they say to lose one deputy chair could be down to misfortune to lose two in one night look like sheer carelessness at least we might see bit more of they on their gb news show discuss day of yore while spoon feed each other cold bake bean which be my personal television highlight of it also explain quite lot about the amount of hot air emanating from the government benches certainly hope to see and hear more from they in this election year in all seriousness what on earth be go on the country be look on baffle that the prime minister could pay the rwandan government million for nothing yet place such little focus on strengthen our security co operation with europe to stop the boat in the first place and he have spend little time improve our break public service or help our struggle household during the cost of living crisis they be perplexed that the conservatives be spend so many hour on piece of legislation that be not really mean to stop the boat it be about the prime minister get single plane in the air with handful of asylum seeker on it so that he can say look do it deliver the rwanda plan and remove few refugee he think the british people will deliver something to he on that basis we be perplexed because this be not the behaviour and politic we can afford to expect from british prime minister these be not the serious policy that will fix our asylum system and make our country well place all the headline chase gimmick over hard graft and get grip that be not what the british public vote for indeed nobody not even his own party vote for he at all this plan be con this bill be sham urge all hon member to get behind labour amendment to limit the damage and to vote against the bill on third reading it be unworkable unaffordable and unlawful if we be to stop the tories small boat chaos and end expensive asylum hotel use which cost million day this conservative psychodrama need to end we need labour five point plan to end this chaos start with go after the criminal gang upstream in new security partnership with europol we need government that put country before party and we need general election this spring it may be helpful if clarify few thing first if colleague wish to intervene it be important that they be present from the start of the relevant speech it be also important that they remain to the end of the speech secondly intend to give priority to those who have amendment down on the selection list will then come to other in addition to the fact that we be discuss amendment should explain that because we be also discuss clause stand part the debate can range slightly more widely than would be normal but it be not third reading debate there will be third reading debate an hour have be put aside for that just in case colleague prefer to speak at that stage know that sir jeremy wright have an amendment so call he to speak thank you dame rosie in fact have two amendment amendment and on which wish to focus my remark we all understand that the purpose of the bill be to allow this parliament to designate rwanda as safe country so that people can be remove to it lawfully in order to achieve that of course we require definition of what safe country be the bill do that in clause which describe safe country as country to which person may be remove from the united kingdom so far so good it seem to that that be an essential part of the bill inherent purpose the part of that subsection that concern and on which my amendment be focus be where it say that that be in compliance with all of the united kingdom obligation under international law that be relevant to the treatment in that country of person who be remove there in other word the bill seem to say that the united kingdom by say that rwanda be safe country can also deem itself to be in compliance with set of its international law responsibility do not think that can be correct few in this house be as familiar as be with the vagary and complexity of international law if international law mean anything surely it must mean that it do not lie in the hand of any individual nation state even this one to determine its own compliance with it be it otherwise international law would not really be international and it would certainly serve no purpose in contain bad behaviour as we sometimes ask it to do work closely with my right hon and learn friend in number of way as he know and be well aware that he be former attorney general if he be right that it be not for the government or this house to determine whether measure be compliant why on earth would they seek and get the attorney general advice on just that my right hon friend know that the attorney general be consult on variety of different legal question both domestic and international he would not expect to disclose any of the advice have previously give but can tell he that the attorney general do give advice on whether the government action may or may not be in compliance with international law but neither the attorney general nor think the government expect to be the ultimate arbiter of that question the advice be give as to whether it be likely that that action would be in compliance with the law will come in moment to what think the bill and the government can properly do in relation to international law responsibility but it seem to that what they can not properly do be set themselves up as judge in their own cause on question of international law this house would be wrong to pass bill that suggest that they could that be really where my amendment be focused as say there be good practical reason why we should be nervous about this because we do sometimes rely on international law to discharge our own policy intent and purpose not more than hour ago in this place we be do exactly that we be say that it be important to criticise the action of the houthis in the red sea because they contravene principle of international law we be say too that we justify our own response to that because it be in accordance with the principle of international law and quite right too we would not have accept the houthis unilateral declaration that they be in compliance with international law when they do what they do nor should we have and we would not of course accept russian legislative act to say that the invasion of ukraine by russia be in compliance with russia international law responsibility let make it clear that be not of course suggest that what the government have in mind here be in any way comparable to those two example but it seem that the point here be that to arrogate to oneself the right to declare one own compliance with international law run the risk of first other state find comfort in our example and secondly undermine our own message in other situation that make this not just bad law but bad foreign policy be pleased to hear what the right hon and learn gentleman have to say on the question of international law do he share my concern and fully accept that be not as legally qualified as he that the government own legal advice say that by state that the bill be incompatible it make it compatible be that not worthy of the mad march hare when it come to consistency in stand up for the rule of law suspect that what the hon lady be refer to be the statement of incompatibility with the convention on human right and the human rights act at the beginning of the bill of course that provision be there for reason to allow the government if they so choose to act in defiance of those responsibility that be perfectly proper and will come on to explain why think that be something the government can properly do be concern about something little different instead of say we do think this be in compliance with international law but we go to do it anyway the bill be say we think this be in compliance with international law it be down to we to decide that and we have so decide that feel to like something that we could not and should not do it would be concern enough in my judgment if this bill only try to deem the uk compliance with international law but it also seem to say that we can deem rwanda compliance with international law that be set out in clause which go on to say that for the purpose of this act safe country include in particular country from which person remove to that country will not be remove or send to another country so far so good that be essential to to do what the bill seek to achieve however it go on to say in contravention of any international law again it can not lie in the hand of this parliament to decide whether or not person may be remove to another country in contravention of any international law it go on in sub paragraph to say that country would be safe country in which any person who be seek asylum or who have have an asylum determination will both have their claim determine and be treat in accordance with that country obligation under international law it seem to that the bill be seek to say that if we deem it so not only be the uk in compliance with its international law responsibility but rwanda be go to be as well that feel to not valid and somewhat over ambitious do my right hon and learn friend who have great experience as former attorney general agree that the deeming provision under the european union withdrawal act create rather similar situation because we deem eu law to be uk law therefore on the analogy he have just give imagine he would argue though think he might even have be attorney general at that time that that do exactly the same sort of thing although be listen with great interest to the more precise point he be make about the relationship with international obligation on which will speak later be grateful to my hon friend for his intervention know dame rosie you would not want to abuse the privilege you have give we to range slightly more widely in this debate to range quite that widely so will not he be right that be make fairly precise point about what this language appear to to say stress that do not think it be necessary to include this language in order to achieve the objective that the government have set in this legislation with which have some sympathy although their method make nervous and make no bone about that bad than unnecessary it present some danger that do not think we need to present in order to achieve the government objective suspect my hon and learn friend the minister will tell in few moment or hour time that do not need to worry about any of this he may give two reason for that first he may say that the bill do not mean what think it mean you will forgive for say this dame rosie but be increasingly troubled that in this place we answer point such as mine by say yes well it do really mean that and we do really mean that by it we should be concern as legislator with what the language we be pass into law actually say not what we mean to say be concerned that what this language say be not in accordance with what be sure the minister want to do or what the government want to do but it might none the less have that effect or be take by other to mean the thing that be concerned about when the bill say what safe country be it be potentially confuse two different thing one be deem our own compliance with international law which do not think any country should be able to do and the other be say that parliament resolve to do something even if it contravene the uk international law obligation which go back to the previous intervention by the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy do think the british parliament can do we as legislature can resolve to do that if we so choose we have to decide whether that be wise and sensible thing to do with all the ramification it might bring but as matter of law it seem to that the uk parliament can if it wish pass law to say despite or irrespective of our international responsibility this be none the less what we want to do that be not the same as deem our own compliance with international law which worry this language almost certainly seem to do the point make about the uk parliament be able to do thing even when they contravene its international responsibility be already in the bill and reflect in the language of clause which point out that the validity of an act be unaffected by international law quite right we can if we so choose deem country safe country for the purpose of domestic decision make if we want to what do not think we can or should do be legislate to say that we comply with our international law responsibility when we do not and when crucially to achieve the objective of this bill we do not need to the second reason the minister may give for why do not need to worry myself about all this be that he may say that domestic and international law exist on different plane and that this legislation be only target in any event at domestic authority so the bill could not even if it choose to try deem our compliance with international law in actual fact would agree with that it be perfectly true that domestic law and international law operate on different plane and it be not likely that this bill could determine any question of international law before any international tribunal if that be so though why include the language if it do not have any meaning or legal effect it do not serve any purpose but fear it may send damaging political signal to other state the language be concern about which amendment and would remove be either offensive or otiose and in either respect the bill would be well without it it be pleasure to follow the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright find myself in agreement with much of what he say and he make his point very forcefully rise to speak to amendment and and new clause in my name and amendment and in the name of my hon friend the member for glasgow north patrick grady and to support the amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for glasgow central alison thewliss also want to comment on clause and clause stand part and the amendment that have be put forward particularly by the right hon member for newark robert jenrick in my capacity as chair of the joint committee on human rights turn first to my amendment which relate to the impact of this bill in scotland and in which respect be speak in personal capacity my amendment and those of my hon friend the member for glasgow north deal with the extent of the bill its extension to scotland and the date of its commencement in scotland we both seek to prevent this bill extend to scotland and in the event that we be not successful in do that my amendment seek to ensure that the bill will not extend to scotland without the legislative consent of the scottish parliament and that nothing in it will interfere with the supervisory jurisdiction of the court of session or its nobile officium will explain what that mean later we must not forget that the regime this bill seek to impose together with the illegal migration act be impose on asylum seeker across the united kingdom not just those who arrive in small boat on the kent coast the uk government have not forget that and that be why they want this bill with its far reach and unprecedented ouster clause to extend to scotland accordingly asylum seeker in scotland look to our court for protection will find that the court in scotland have be emasculate in the same way as this bill emasculate the court of england and wales as well as have their jurisdiction oust on certain matter of fact as be debate yesterday the scottish court will find themselves unable to apply the human rights act or to respect the united kingdom obligation under the european convention on human right and other international treaty believe that that constitute serious and unprecedented intrusion on the jurisdiction of the scottish court and serious interference with the separation of power between legislature executive and judiciary do not think that this parliament should be rubber stamp the bill at all but particularly not in relation to scotland what the bill seek to do in emasculate the jurisdiction of the scottish court in relation to asylum seeker be anathema to the scottish constitutional tradition people in scotland do not want it they do not vote for it in fact nobody in the uk vote for this because the policy be not in the government manifesto in contrast to england and wales no opinion poll carry out in scotland support the bill as the great scottish judge lord president cooper note in the famous case of maccormick lord advocate in the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of parliament be distinctively english principle which have no counterpart in scottish constitutional law in scotland it be the people who be sovereign that make difference to our view of how constitutionalism work and on the separation of power it be the essence of the scottish constitutional tradition that executive power should not be unchecked that go back in our history as far as the declaration of arbroath in when scottish noble assert the sovereignty of the people of scotland in letter to the pope tell his holiness that if the king of scotland should ever seek to make scot subject to the king of england again they would kick he out and seek another king to defend he in scotland the sovereignty of the people be our guide principle not the sovereignty of the monarch neither our parliament nor this parliament be sovereign it be the people who be sovereign let turn to the jurisdiction of the scottish court this parliament this union parliament exist because of the treaty of union scotland have always have separate legal system article xix of the treaty of union between scotland and england protect that separate legal system include its inherent supervisory jurisdiction and the nobile officium of the court of session which be power that the court of session have to give remedy where otherwise there would be none since the modern advent of devolution by virtue of the scotland act the civil jurisdiction of the scottish court include judicial review have be devolved matter and therefore properly one for scotland parliament so believe that the bill be grave intrusion of the civil jurisdiction of the scottish court and that be the reason for my amendment the scottish government be consider legislative consent motion my amendment would ensure that the bill can not come into force in scotland without legislative consent motion my new clause would ensure that notwithstanding anything in the bill like nice notwithstanding clause and hope that conservative members who have be so excited about notwithstanding clause will support my scottish one the supervisory jurisdiction and the nobile officium of the court of session would be preserve in that way hope to ensure that asylum seeker in scotland will still have the protection of the court in accordance with our constitutional tradition just to explain the nobile officium of the court of session be noble office or duty of scotland high court sort of extraordinary equitable jurisdiction by virtue of which the court may within limit mitigate the strictness of the law and provide legal remedy to people where otherwise none would exist without prejudice to the content of what the hon and learn lady be say otherwise may simply say in relation to she notwithstanding clause that be extremely glad that the scottish eagle have land certainly will not be support the other notwithstanding clause in the bill but feel that it be perhaps time that we have one that benefit scotland for change my amendment be design to protect scotland court and constitutional tradition they be there to ensure that asylum seeker in scotland might still enjoy the protection of the court from the infringement of their fundamental right that be what people in scotland want and it have be express repeatedly through the scottish parliament be of course scottish mp and member of the scottish bar and be here to do what can to protect scotland and its legal system from the extraordinary attack on human right and the rule of law that this bill constitute however be not scottish exceptionalist recognise that as reflect in the house of commons library excellent legal briefing on the bill and indeed in the speech that precede mine by the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam concern about the impact of the bill on the rule of law and the constitution be share by many in england include many lawyer for every lawyer cite by conservative members in favour of the bill and the draconian amendment to it they will find two lawyer who disagree the library briefing which be an excellent summary of the different legal view on the bill conclude tension between the sovereignty of parliament to legislate and the role of the court in enforce the rule of law principle that executive body must exercise their power within their statutory limit may be temper by restraint on both side if either the court or parliament cease to exercise such restraint significant constitutional uncertainty could result believe that if we pass the bill this parliament will have cease to exercise the restraint refer to there it would be major departure from such restraint predict that if the bill pass we will see what might be an unprecedented constitutional challenge to an act of the british parliament the hon and learn lady be make good point about the check and balance that prevent arbitrary power and she be right that that be central to our constitutional settlement but this be not the exercise of arbitrary power because the bill and the amendment to it be quite specific about their provision for example in the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick our separation from the international obligation that know she hold so dear be very specific to this particular legislation that be not arbitrary it be anything but the bill seek to carve out group of people come to our country or who be in our country from the protection that the rest of we enjoy history show we that that sort of legislation can put state on pretty slippery slope that bring to my argument in relation to clause and stand part the joint committee on human rights have not yet have the chance to complete legislative scrutiny of the bill give the speed with which it have pass through the house so we have not as committee reach conclude view on the bill however before christmas and before second reading chair briefing paper refer to the legal advice that the committee have receive be publish and it be extensively refer to in the excellent legal commentary publish by the house of commons library the briefing say inter alia that the disapplication of the human rights act in clause be very significant as indicate moment ago in my answer to the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes human right be mean to offer fundamental level of protection for every person on the basis of their humanity alone as our committee have note in previous report if those protection be disapplied when they cause problem for policy goal they lose their fundamental and universal character arguably that be especially the case when they be disapplied in respect of particular group in this case fundamental human right be be disapplie in respect of migrant who come to the united kingdom without prior permission bill that disapply part of the human rights act be not unprecedented under this government be sad to say both the illegal migration act and the victims and prisoners bill have seek to disapply section of the human rights act in respect of certain legislation however this bill seek to disapply section of that act the obligation on public authority to act compatibly with human right which have never before be attempt even by this government and represent significant inroad into human right protection if we pass the bill with clause in it it will effectively mean that this parliament be authorise public authority to breach human right that be an awful long way from what this parliament intend when it pass the human rights act and what the united kingdom intend when it sign up to the convention as we hear at some length yesterday as result of parliamentary sovereignty if we pass the bill breach human right would be in accordance with our domestic law however it would still violate the uk obligation under the convention because we can not unilaterally change what the convention say also as the bingham centre for the rule of law have note in its briefing on the bill if we disapply the human rights act in the manner propose we be also breach article of the convention which entitle people to an effective remedy be afraid to say that the amendment to clause table by the right hon member for newark who be no long in his place would make the situation even bad his amendment and appear to extend the disapplication of the human rights act to anything do under the illegal migration act that relate to the removal of person to rwanda that could potentially mean that the detention of people await removal to rwanda and their treatment prior to their removal would not be protect under the human rights act be that what this parliament really want to legislate for additionally the right hon member for newark want to extend clause to disapply section of the human rights act as it stand that clause do not disapply section if the clause remain as it be when the bill become law it would be open to court in future to declare that it be not compatible with the convention that would be through declaration only it would not affect the ongoing function of the bill or allow removal to rwanda to be prevent or delay but this parliament and the government would have to decide whether any change to the law should be make if we amend the bill to disapply section of the human rights act again that would be something that have never be do before and would far restrict the jurisdiction of our court in say to the government and the public what their view be on the law compatibility with human right finally also believe that clause should not stand part of the bill we have hear lot today about conservative members concern about interim measure issue by the european court of human rights the reality be that no matter what this legislation end up say it can only affect domestic law in respect of the echr in particular the uk will remain bind by the convention as matter of international law indeed even if this government god forbid be to exercise the nuclear option of withdraw we from the convention thereby put we in bed with russia and belarus we would remain bound for further six month after withdrawal take place hope they will bear that in mind at the moment clause say that only minister can decide whether to comply with interim measure and that the domestic court should ignore they it remain to be see what minister would do but we all know that the prime minister have say repeatedly that he would not let foreign court to use his word prevent flight take off which indicate that interim measure may be ignore as say early in my intervention on the right hon member for newark interim measure be make under rule of the court rule of procedure they do not form part of the text of the convention ratify by the uk but when we ratify that convention we sign up to the idea that the european court of human rights be the body that determine its meaning and since the case that the right hon member mention it have hold consistently that fail to comply with interim measure amount to breach of article interim measure be fundamental to any court they be issue to protect the position of an individual while their legal right be determined all this fuss about people in their pyjama in the middle of the night be very silly judge in the united kingdom both in the english jurisdiction and in the scottish jurisdiction be regularly get out of their bed in the middle of the night to issue interim injunction in england and interim interdict in scotland it be standard part of any legal system and many of the concern that conservative members have express about those interim measure have now be address by the court in the reform it be propose any decision of minister not to comply with an interim measure would be inconsistent with our obligation under the echr that mean that if we let clause stand part of the bill we will expressly authorise british government ministers to act in breach of international law that be the reality and note that accord to the times that be the advice that have reportedly be give to the government by the attorney general and by the minister the hon and learn member for mid dorset and north poole michael tomlinson when he be solicitor general that do not surprise at all it should not surprise anyone because any legal undergraduate would be able to tell they that as such in so far as amendment to state that interim measure be not bind that be inaccurate as matter of law and we must understand that they would put the uk directly in conflict with our international legal obligation madam chair realise that have take up little bit more time than have intend but hope the amendment and new clause that have speak to would go some way towards ameliorate the bill however even if they be to be pass would certainly vote against it call the chair of the select committee on justice it be pleasure to follow the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry and my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright although will not be support the hon and learn lady amendment have great respect for the intellectual rigour that she bring on scots law and its application in this case say the same about the point make by my right hon and learn friend in relation to his amendment and hope the minister will think seriously about how we deal with that issue be sure he will because serious point have be raise in nutshell agree with the proposition that while parliament can of course legislate to do whatever it like in domestic law the simple fact be that one can not legislate away international law obligation or treaty obligation and it would be misleading to pretend otherwise now turn to the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick be sorry that he be not in his place because have to say that with every respect profoundly differ from his characterisation of pyjama injunction by foreign court respectfully would argue that that characterisation be both inaccurate and rather unworthy as be observe by the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west it be perfectly normal for interim injunction to be issue at difficult hour when the test for they be meet so we should not say that that be unusual argument can be legitimately make about the way in which the rule procedure in the strasbourg court work but let we make they on the basis of an accurate construction of what the court be about rather than otherwise have great respect for the argument that my hon friend be make and defer to his experience and knowledge on this issue be genuinely interested in his view he have describe judge in the uk issue an injunction late at night in the event of what in normal circumstance would be an individual situation do he really think it be comparable to describe in the same term the act of court that be genuinely in another country and judge who be anonymous and do not publish the rationale for their opinion which call halt with the support of the government it must be say to the policy of the british government enact law pass in parliament surely there be difference both of degree and of nature between the two case think my hon friend need to bear in mind that the application that be make to strasbourg be also about the circumstance of an individual case so that be no different there be legitimate criticism one that have voice in the past about the procedure adopt in strasbourg for these application in two area first the anonymity of the judge and secondly the failure to state reason from our point of view that would not be acceptable but the answer be not to throw out the whole of the judicial and treaty baby with the bathwater thank to the brighton declaration that be sign by my noble and learn friend lord clarke of nottingham it be possible to make reform follow dialogue between member state the council of ministers and the judiciary of the court be pleased to say that after pressure from the united kingdom perfectly properly the court itself have indicate that it will to consult on reform to its procedure which can only be good thing that be what think the balanced position be on that issue in fact far than that there be already propose reform to the interim procedure which will come into place this year and crucially will remove the anonymity provision and allow contracting party such as the uk to make the argument as believe apply in this case that there be not an imminent risk of irreparable damage we can fly people back from rwanda and that be the argument we need to keep make my right hon and learn friend be entirely correct and he and would probably have very happily argue the uk case in strasbourg on those ground so let we be realistic about what we be fight against with respect bit of an aunt sally have be set up because step be already be take to deal with the objectionable matter relate to rule but the principle of they be not itself objectionable secondly with respect the characterisation of foreign court be not helpful in these circumstance because it imply something alien which it be not the case for international law as concept or for the court itself the fact that it happen to meet in different place from the uk be inevitable because it have to meet somewhere we should bear in mind that not only be the uk one of the drive power behind the creation of the convention in the first place behind the court itself and behind much of the jurisprudence of the court but the uk do actually have share ownership of the court along with all the other member state that be demonstrate not just in the treaty but in practical way for example the british member of the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe member of this house and the other place have role in the appointment of the judge of the court my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and serve at one time on the sub committee of the assembly that deal with that process and like to think that we do so diligently so there be involvement in that process british judge always sit on the court and be member of the court judge tim eicke the current judge be very distinguished international lawyer and we be very lucky to have he two of the recent registrar of the court who run its administration have be british lawyer and british lawyer appear regularly in case before the court this be not an alien body it be court of which we have joint ownership it be our court along with that of all the other member state of the convention and it be wrong to mischaracterise it as something alien certainly in all international matter as my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam say it operate on different plane but the tone of comment about its alienness be with respect both inaccurate and somewhat offensive it be also unnecessary for the purpose of this bill anyway and that be the point want to come on to in relation to rule the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark be otiose they be unnecessary and frankly would make difficult situation bad as matter of law an interim measure under rule be an indication make to the government of the member state it be not make to the court of the member state it be convey to the government of the member state concern therefore it be for the member of the government of the member state the ministers to decide what to do about it personally take the view that we should be very loth indeed to ignore the finding of the court on an interim matter as the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west rightly say it run the risk of put we in breach of our international law obligation in that regard however the truth be that it be political decision that the ministers can take so what the bill in its current formulation state be actually no more than statement of the law as it stand and we probably do not need clause in the bill be not go to die in ditch over that because it be simply state what the law be already but equally there be absolutely no need for the amendment from my right hon friend the member for newark to put bell and whistle on otioseness if can put it that way be loth to interrupt my hon friend as he be describe not so much the separation of power as the desiccation of power however on the specific point he make about his reticence or reluctance not to abide by the advice of the court he say ministers could do that but he would not would he on that basis not have do what the noble lord cameron do as prime minister when he resist the overture from the court to give prisoner vote would make two point about that in fact support the noble lord cameron in that regard because it be political decision it be also worth look at the practical politic although we be for period of time at variance with the court no harm be do to the polity of the united kingdom in that regard no harm be do to the interest of the united kingdom and no terrible international consequence for we flow from it think the court get it wrong on that occasion and one of the problem be that there be no appeal system in the strasbourg court so we have to wait until some future decision go different way think many of we take the view that in reality the court as currently constitute in strasbourg it be perhaps less activist if may say so than its predecessor might well have find differently in the prisoner voting case however the fact be that uk ministers take the decision and they do what be right in the uk which be support by those in all part of the house and no harm be do so the idea that some terrible consequence will flow for the uk because of the ability to seek rule interim measure be just misplace would my hon friend reflect on this fact about prisoner voting discuss the matter with the noble lord cameron when he be prime minister at the time but it be regard by the noble lord clarke of nottingham as particular political think those be the word he use how would my hon friend describe the issue of illegal migration would he not regard that as particular but very important political policy that be why as it happen will not vote against this bill because although have some misgiving there be legitimate concern that need to be deal with in relation to illegal boat however the simple fact be that that be not reason for the blanket derogation or the blanket removal of echr protection that be propose in series of amendment that be the difference my hon friend and be at one but sometimes mixture of politic and law arise in these matter the point be make be that frankly if any government want to take the political risk of ignore an interim measure they can do so under our law as it stand it happen that they effectively do so on prisoner voting so they could do that now if they want to be not go to advise on that because one have to be very wary not to come to view that may very often not be fact specific when individual decision be make do not want to prolong the discussion about prisoner voting but like my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash remember have conversation about it inside government think it would be fair to describe the situation as one in which the uk do not at any point refuse to comply with the judgment would it not we have perhaps adopt more augustinian approach to compliance we just have not quite get around to it yet think that be right as recall the uk government put motion before this house which the house reject so we have perfectly legitimate legal argument that we have take step to comply and parliament as it be entitle to decide otherwise that be why the whole of my argument with the amendment from my right hon friend the member for newark be that they be an aunt sally complete red herring compare with the real issue we be concern with and urge hon member on both side of the committee to reject they finally have misgiving about this bill and speak about that on second reading say that it stay acceptable just and maintain that position my right hon friend quote the noble lord sandhurst very distinguished lawyer in the other place should say that he be personal friend of mine the noble lord sandhurst be chair of the research committee of the society of conservative lawyers and happen to chair the executive committee of the society lord sandhurst and harry gillow fellow member of the society publish very useful pamphlet about the impact of this bill and they have update it in the light of these amendment their conclusion with respect be that the bill go as far as reasonably possible without risk collapse of the rwanda scheme as whole they go on to say in their pamphlet that the bill as draft represent the good chance of success for the migration and economic development partnership with rwanda so they be on the same side of the argument as and say that the amendment propose by my right hon friend the member for newark take it over the line in term of be able to deliver the partnership scheme and risk collapse the whole scheme it be ironic that my right hon friend talk about blow up the bill because the truth be that his amendment will blow up the deal with rwanda because the rwandans have make it abundantly clear that anything that breach international law will be unacceptable to they and they would withdraw from the agreement not only be the propose amendment legally unsound and otiose then but they be ridiculously bad politic as well because they would defeat the objective of those who want to see people be move to rwanda in order to deter the boat so on both legal and political ground urge the committee to reject the amendment and leave thing as they stand it be pleasure to follow the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill chair of the justice committee he say that at time we will see collision between or an interface with politic and the law and hope that what arise from my contribution be that there be third element which be principle throughout the passage of this bill and indeed some of the precursor to it we have advance number of principled position one of which challenge the basis of the legal aspiration contain in the bill while another rightly make the challenge that it do not matter how hard some might suggest that this be the most robust piece of legislation if it do not do what it be intend to do and be not go to work and that it be an unprincipled place to be with the british electorate to suggest that all these step be in earnest and have some virtue while know that they be inconsistent and will not work make those point during the passage of the nationality and borders act and ministers on the front bench at the time tell that be entirely wrong that there be no need to strengthen the provision and that that bill would do what they say it would yet now hear throughout discussion on this bill and in this committee the very same people who then occupy the front bench adopt the same argument that we deploy for the nationality and borders bill still find it thoroughly inconsistent in the context of this bill that our government have reach the position where they have an agreement with rwanda that also involve our country accept refugee from rwanda which be therefore country deem capable of produce refugee it be incongruous to that country deem safe by this parliament should be capable of produce refugee from that very same country have not hear robust argument as to how that be not an inconsistent position be grateful to the hon gentleman for give way and give chance to put he right offer the example of the transit mechanism that be in place whereby rwanda be already host refugee from libya rwanda in its generosity and safety be host hundred of thousand of refugee that be how if the minister be prepared to say that the only refugee who can come to the united kingdom from rwanda be those who have be produce as refugee from other country that be an absolutely fair point but do not think that be the point he be make be very happy to let he intervene again but genuinely do not think that be the point he be make the point be make be that it be entirely inconsistent to say on the one hand that we will accept refugee from country and on the other hand to deem that country as safe accept our right to do it however and do not quibble with the government aspiration that rwanda be safe country do not quibble with that just say that there be complete juxtaposition between on the one hand say it be safe and on the other accept refugee from that very same country recognise the nature of committee stage but make the point again to the shadow minister that this be not about his valiant opposition in committee or on third reading or what pass on second reading it be about the labour party opposition on this bill which have no doubt will fold in the other place the political choice will be the labour party to make there be no second session or additional session of this parliament there will be no parliament act available to pass the bill and it be go to be torture in the other place the bill will be torture in the other place and the only way it will emerge or emanate from this parliament be if political calculation be make by the labour party that there be too much political cost in opposition to the bill and they draw stump and allow it to pass reiterate that point be say it very clearly now and suspect that in number of month time the point that be be ignore today will become quite acute in our political discourse apologise if do not fully understand the hon gentleman point in his question to when be make my remark it be specifically about the other place what would say to he be that labour members of the other place will give this bill the scrutiny that it deserve and will hold the government to account the illegal migration act end up go through and get royal assent in spite of very severe and serious reservation but of course we recognise not only that in the other place we have the duty to scrutinise but that we be responsible for ensure the proper functioning of parliament across the board say to the hon gentleman that do not think this bill will be treat in any way differently from any other piece of legislation that would go to the other place at least from the point of view of my colleague there be glad to accept that intervention and the shadow minister have make his point and have make my point suspect we will find as much safety in the point that have just be make as in that of those who stand bullishly and say that this be the strong most robust piece of legislation ever irrespective of whether it work just put that on the record as member will be aware from second reading we have concern about the operability of the bill in the light of the uk withdrawal from the european union and the legislative framework that surround that relationship that be why our new clause be notwithstanding clause know that we have have some humour around notwithstanding clause from the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry but that notwithstanding clause be there because we have concern in contradiction to the government position that the claim that have be make in this house and the position that the government have deploy be not sustainable legally our amendment state the provision of this act shall have effect in northern ireland notwithstanding section of the european union withdrawal act amend in that be important from principle perspective as unionist and from practical perspective as member of this parliament who believe that our immigration policy apply equally across the united kingdom it always have apply equally across the united kingdom the worry be that the government be blindly ignore our concern and allow situation to develop that will cause fracture in the immigration policy which until this point have apply equally across the united kingdom have engage with the minister on this issue and be grateful to he for both make the time available and the courtesy with which he always approach these issue colleague will recall that we raise this issue on second reading and the minister give commitment which fundamentally come in two part that the government have never accept that the right chapter of the belfast agreement engage immigration policy and furthermore that the government have in the past robustly defend the position that the right chapter of the belfast agreement do not engage immigration policy and have win they have advance that argument in court and have win the argument that the government be put forward be predicate on article of the withdrawal agreement that there be no diminution of right for the people of northern ireland whenever the united kingdom leave the european union as consequence and give that they say the right chapter do not apply to immigration they say there be no diminution of right so this situation be not capture by article we engage with the government rise will not take an intervention at this stage because there be few element that want to get out clearly and cleanly will then be happy to give way the minister put forward his point and we exchange position on second read about the potential of an update legal note have to say in all candour that the minister and the government have be forthcoming in more formally address this point in term of article of the european union withdrawal agreement alone and not article let we be clear we as national parliament be consider on national basis our national immigration policy and our amendment be intend to elicit response from the government eye wide open they could choose to ignore we at this point to dismiss the concern that have be raise and ultimately leave it to the court to decide and the judiciary to determine whether there be cause for concern or they could take the simple step on immigration ground alone to disapply section of the european union withdrawal act that be the choice yesterday share with the minister share it with the committee today the detail of high court case in belfast it be an application for judicial review by aman angesom and it be interesting reading paragraph of that judgment state clearly the combined effect of section of the european union withdrawal act and article of the protocol limit the effect of section and of the euwa and schedule para of the same act which restrict the use to which the charter of fundamental rights and eu general principles may be rely on after the uk exit thus the charter of fundamental rights remain enforceable in northern ireland and fall within the ambit of article of the protocol contain within the charter of fundamental right be article the right to asylum everything we have see from the government have engage the discussion around the right chapter of the belfast agreement it have not engage the consideration that be resolve and share in paragraph of that belfast high court judgment which have completely separate legal construction for the government ambition for how this rwanda bill will not apply to northern ireland the minister have say clearly on the floor of the house that the bill will apply in full in northern ireland in the same way as it do in the rest of the united kingdom new clause be our attempt first to get the government to rule out the concern that have be raise by agree it then if they should not do so they should at least articulate their intention their position what they believe to be the case why they believe that interpretation and why the judgment from belfast be wrong raise those issue on number of level as parliamentary spokesperson on home affair and somebody who have engage on immigration issue for while as someone who have vote against previous attempt because do not believe they be the right approach and as someone who vote against the bill on second reading because still do not believe it be the right approach also raise those thing as representative for belfast believe it or not say this with no alarm and no theatric but as matter of record house of commons library figure from september point out that across the entire united kingdom belfast have the second high number of asylum seeker house within our city we have asylum seeker for every of the city population be not be alarmist about that and will not over egg it be just make the point that these be important issue and the unity of our immigration system be important the protection of our border be an important issue in immigration term heaven know we have have enough difficulty around the creation of trade border in the irish sea that we be have to deal with we can not casually or mistakenly or through misplaced hope walk ourselves into the creation of an immigration sea border in the irish sea because the government fail to accept the strength of feeling on this issue the cause for concern surround it and the legal and judicial opinion that have be give that leans into it this be our opportunity to put it right and we should take it be about to finish but in fairness do indicate to the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy that would give way and mean no discourtesy so will appreciate the case the hon gentleman be make my concern be that the angesom judgment look it up after he and talk about it state the applicant and respondent both agree that the right safeguard and equality of opportunity enshrine in strand three of the gfa do not exclude asylum seeker the home office which bring the case accept that the good friday agreement extend to refugee in northern ireland yet with this piece of legislation the government be seek to exempt they from those right and therefore undermine the good friday agreement just want to clarify my reading of the ruling he mention the hon lady be entirely right in the quote that she share it be fair to say that the government win that case we therefore do not see the government indeed they do not have any rationale to do so take forward an appeal to defend some of the point that they may well have choose to defend but she highlight frailty in the position if the home office be not accept position that it have defend in other case by say that the right chapter be not engaged that be frailty of the government position and that be why in fairness the hon lady have table her own amendment it be not as fatal as our new clause in term of the notwithstanding provision but it be at least ask the government not to proceed with the bill until they be in the firm position to publish position this house have agree that that be the basis upon which we should proceed have be in this place for almost nine year there be many occasion when this house have agree to proceed in the face of what believe to be well ground politically support and principled decision it be not an amendment take comfort from but very much look forward to hear what the minister have to say give the day that this be and the potential for third reading this evening speak yesterday to the amendment that stand in my name and be potentially subject to division later so will not trouble the committee on that my amendment would amend clause to preserve small element of clause namely the definition of safe country listen carefully to the reasoned argument of my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright whose position be similar to mine except that he take exception to part of clause that want to retain would rather get rid of the rest of clause because it be bad lawmaking but will come back to that in moment might have an answer to my right hon and learn friend sensible question of why the definition of safe country in clause contain reference to the other country obligation under international law it be simple that have to flow because unlike many people understanding of this scheme it be not about the offshoring of uk processing but the wholesale handing to another country of the determination of application that be why the measure be in the bill hope that give he some satisfaction it be why in consider my amendment decide to retain the entirety of subparagraph ii by move it to the interpretive clause towards the back end of the bill it be the only part of clause that could see have any function whatsoever understand the argument that my right hon and learn friend be make and will not be dogmatic about the approach that set out early be there not danger if we retain the language that he be refer to that we open up another channel of legal challenge which be exactly what the government be seek to avoid if the question become be rwanda in compliance with its international law responsibility that be something else that someone may choose to argue if they wish to resist their transfer to rwanda my right hon and learn friend be absolutely right think have say outside the chamber that when it come to the passage of statute the principle of less be more be not only fundamentally conservative but fundamental to good lawmaking although the bill do not weigh in at heavy number of clause it have mere we as parliamentarian have continue duty to demonstrate economy any clause in this case clause that be title introduction should give we all pause for thought if not break out into cold sweat it seem to that the language in clause to would belong well in white paper or an accompany policy document we know what the purpose of the bill be we have read the treaty and most of we will have read the policy document that accompany the bill publication that be where such language belong not in bill that be not just because have tidy and ordered mind well try but because of the very point make by my right hon and learn friend the more word we put into legislation the more opportunity we give for their litigation and justiciability and the argument that will then go before the court about fundamental issue at high level that in my view really should not be the province of litigation it be for the contracting party to treaty to agree its term and sign the document and then either directly as in the case of rwanda or in our dualist system via the constitutional reform and governance act the crag procedure that be ongoing the treaty will come into force so to use one of my favourite wartime adage must ask my hon and learn friend the minister for whom have great esteem why be our journey really necessary in my view clause need to go save for the retention of clause although we will have stand part vote anyway table amendment just to emphasise my extreme distaste for clause it be distaste base on the fear that this somehow become the norm and we start to see legislation of this nature proliferate let we start with clause because that be what the bill be all about the safety of the republic of rwanda that be where it should begin what clause say be clear and speak to it yesterday turn now to clause which throw up series of interesting question be not particular fan of section of the human rights act because never like the read down provision which draw the justice the court of appeal and the supreme court in particular into province where they be act almost as constitutional court we have see it happen the read down provision where judge in effect pass and reinterpret the will of parliament it be sticky and dangerous place for the court to go and do not like it if have have the opportunity and we have do what we say we would do in the manifesto which help to write we would have update the human rights act by now we could have get rid of section so we would not have need to refer to it in this ad hoc way in the bill it be horrible echo of that bill of rights which happily never see the light of day it do not even have second reading thank goodness and perhaps some of what be say in the context of these amendment and the stand part debate be an echo of my deep distaste for aspect of that fail legislation why have we get clause in the bill can see what the government want to do they want to avoid argument relate to the human rights act but be afraid that they can not get out of jail as people have an individual right to petition to strasbourg anyway entirely agree with my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill that we help to set up that court and have direct ownership of it we be in effect send the argument to that so call foreign court of course the danger in allow petition to go to strasbourg without any airing of the argument in domestic court be that we do not really get that margin of appreciation evidence that be so crucial for the strasbourg court do get frustrate by inelegant inaccurate comparison between the luxembourg court the court of justice of the european union and the strasbourg court which be very different place we have much wide margin of appreciation much big discretion and much more room in which to make argument of interpretation and context indeed political context as well about the way in which we do thing in this country perhaps it be no coincidence that the number of time the united kingdom be find to be in breach of the convention be vanishingly small we have hear about prisoner right more case anybody we might remember the abu qatada case which be on all four with what we be deal with here we solve the problem by make sure that jordan have fair trial system if be right think abu qatada be try and acquit in jordan but the point be make that be the point on all four with this bill if we be to rely on the process of another country get they right in order to be compliant seem to be the good way forward that be why the government treaty approach be to be commend so no do not see the need for clause get rid of it we will end up with these argument whether we like it or not turn to clause which be another clause that in the word of my hon friend be just unnecessary do not see how interim measure equate in any way to the bind nature of final judgment which article of the convention draw we to or indeed anything different from the approach that we take to interim injunction in domestic case that high court judge county court judge judge of all shape and size will be enjoin to create or refuse on ex parte or inter parte application in the context of the debate about interim measure it be important to pray in aid the work do in the plenary session of the european court of human rights last year the rule will be change with that come into effect in may ask my hon and learn friend the minister to work with colleague in the attorney general office his former department and indeed the lord chancellor to ensure that the council of europe and the plenary session of the court get on with implement these change the change to interim measure be really important first the limiting of the granting of interim measure to exceptional word do not currently exist in the definition of rule will change the ball game at stroke secondly there be the end to anonymity for judge which be proposal that will be enact finally and importantly there be the opportunity for party to the proceeding to request the court to reconsider its decision so the united kingdom will have an opportunity to say no there be no imminent risk of irreparable damage here we can fly people back from rwanda if there be problem in any event because of the measure that we be take in the bill we will not be send people who be vulnerable or at risk those who might be terminally ill pregnant or have some serious condition whatever it might be to rwanda in the first place we have get the argument to deal with rule and we should have the self confidence and the ability to make our case think that the reform to rule will be significant be delighted to have follow the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson who make thoughtful contribution he and have have some difference of opinion about thing in recent day but he always couch his argument in respectful way and for that thank he first do my right hon and learn friend understand that there be those who argue that the rule indication be be use by the strasbourg court in way that be not bind have he hear that argument and do he agree with it secondly with regard to how people react to the manner in which the propose reform be be do can he speak with authority not that he do not have his own authority by quote to we any specific document that demonstrate that the whole thing be now more or less sew up have source that be look at to research this speech will send my hon friend the link that have to the european court web page that deal with several meeting hold in the summer and november last year where the proposal be agree now the question be implementation in the court have not be specific about precisely when these reform will be bring in therefore now be our opportunity not just as parliament but as government together with other member state to say look these be welcome can you please bring they in hopefully it will bring they in way that dovetail with the eventual come into force of these provision my hon friend make an important point and will send that information to he on the bind nature make the point that these be not final judgment so they be not bind in the sense that article bite and therefore we have prisoner vote scenario however procedurally they have to be abide by since as matter of procedure in our own domestic court if an injunction be pass it will be potentially contempt of that court for any party to those proceeding to do something that would defeat the injunction my hon friend will know that for example if there be an injunction to prevent the removal of particular asset from the jurisdiction remove it would frustrate the whole purpose of litigation and would be contempt of court my hon friend get the point that be why it be not necessary to add clause we all know the argument if we do add it we get the unfortunate consequence of have to consider the ministerial code and the civil service code agree with my hon friend take the view at the time of the united kingdom internal markets act that the drafting of part which never become law be not breach of the ministerial code or the civil service code it be entirely in order and we be able to do that that be when part company with my good friend sir jonathan jones the former treasury solicitor do not agree with he about that know my hon friend would approve of that there be other part of part of the act that we need to bring forward in legislation to help our colleague such as the hon member for belfast east who nod sagely from sedentary position we need to do that we bring forward that legislation and the northern ireland protocol bill as way of leverage the negotiation and we be successful we manage to sort that out through the joint committee between my right hon friend the member for surrey heath michael gove and maroš šefčovič which come to conclusion on the protocol from the protocol bill we have the windsor framework we have different view about that but that bill be not necessary that be why say in all candour to my hon and learn friend the minister that we be use the bill not as way to leverage negotiation but as direct enactment of policy that be why we have to be very careful about it now come to the point make by the hon member for belfast east and the intervention from the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy we can not ignore the northern ireland dimension we have see two very good nuanced argument first about the interaction between the eu charter of fundamental right and northern ireland law and secondly about the position of the european convention itself and its centrality to the belfast good friday agreement which think we all agree be fact whatever our view to come back to the point about the eu dimension the supreme court be clear in its judgment about the rwandan application relate to case before it that there be no role for retain eu law what the court say be very clear the european union withdrawal act be clear that retain eu law no long apply to the procedure directive which be the particular directive that we be talk about however the hon member for belfast east be right to sound the alarm bell to make sure that we do not inadvertently end up in position where our immigration law be divide or complicate by the eu law factor which be undeniably an issue in northern ireland law be grateful to the right hon and learn member for his contribution he would accept that the argument around the particularity of northern ireland should an application come from northern ireland be not consider by the supreme court in detail be not say that be right but for as long as we have an undetermined position of the government on one hand juxtapose with some advocate in northern ireland on the other we need to get it settle we need to be sure about the position that be my point the hon gentleman make powerful point hope that be take up in the other place as well as chair of the northern ireland affairs committee want to discuss that far with he and with ministers in the home office or the northern ireland office directly with the home office would probably be the good way forward that open up the point make by the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry about the interaction of scots law with all this she be not wrong to remind we that scot law look at parliamentary sovereignty differently from the law of england and wales we can not get around that however would qualify her remark by say that that be overcome by have united kingdom supreme court which have at the moment two very distinguished scots lawyer in the form of the president and vice president who understand these principle deeply at any time the composition of that court will include senior scot lawyer and it also have senior judge from northern ireland lord stephens the whole function of the supreme court be to bring together the slightly differ concept of constitutional law that undoubtedly exist in our jurisdiction and strike the right balance base on restraint we come back to that word again will not labour the point make yesterday but my hon and learn friend the minister know that he be walk tightrope to get this legislation right anything that smack of lack of restraint such as the amendment table by hon friend say oblige thing yesterday and will repeat they today do not follow that sense of restraint and balance it be about the risk of an imbalance not just between the court of england and wales and this parliament but between the differ jurisdiction of the united kingdom that should give we all pause for thought particularly those of we deeply committed to our union and who believe in this united kingdom be not say that my hon friend be deliberately try to undermine that but be sound word of warning about tread too heavily down this path of exceptionalism and go too far in normalise what be the exceptional circumstance of withdrawal from the eu should know about that because sit on that front bench make the case for many of the provision in the european union withdrawal act that be cite by my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash and other those be exceptional time know that this be an exceptional global challenge but before conclude my remark will simply say that we need to tread carefully if we do not do so in try to deal with an external problem we will create internal constitutional and legal problem of our own do not think that any self respect conservative government would want to do that and no self respect parliament would want to follow that for those reason urge right hon and hon member to reject many of the amendment that complicate the bill and to follow the maxim that less be more it be pleasure to follow the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland and many of the colleague sit next to he who have bring an immense level of legal expertise to their concern about the bill let try to offer something different as somebody who be not legally qualified lay person view or perspective on what the bill be do in particular why table and will speak to amendment and why support the amendment in the name of my front bench colleague this be not about the of refugee or even the of rwanda it be about the of right the right we enjoy that protect those freedom and liberty that so many of we fight for be passionate about and believe be intrinsic to good life the government state that the bill be clear statement of parliament view that rwanda be safe notwithstanding all specify domestic legislation and the common law and any alternative interpretation of international law include customary international law for those of we who be not qualified the word notwithstanding be do an awful lot of work to justify the diminution of right for people in our country and the concept that somehow international law do not protect we so much of the anger we have hear about the idea of foreign court have come from it be about the european court of human rights that it be an affront to our democracy that that organisation be part of protect those right liberty and freedom on which we depend how dare winston churchill sign we up to such thing how dare he believe that work with other country be the way to protect those right as he say in the centre of our movement stand the idea of charter of human rights guard by freedom and sustain by law the scoundrel what sort of right be he try to protect what sort of abuse by the state do he dare to think we might need court to uphold for we the right to family life travesty surely the right to privacy mean goodness what terrible thing to be concern about the right to freedom from torture or the right to liberty or even the right to freedom of thought well no wonder we need to look at all this again how terrible those thing must sound to those of we who be not legally qualified and who can not see the rub there let to try think through real world example of why those right might be uphold by third party one could think of somebody perhaps member of this house who do not have the respect and courtesy for other people speak in this debate to even stay and listen to they shortly after he have speak somebody who think that the rule do not apply to he that the treatment of other be not something that matter and who perhaps be far too busy worry about his social medium account the chair would want to hold he to account and rightly so goodness many of we would think he might need legal representation for what could happen next he would want his day in court he might not want to be in the chamber when we be talk about those very issue he might be concern about the idea of judge and jury exist in the same person the very principle that lead to set up the european court of human rights be one that we all feel every single day because it do not just defend those basic thing like right to family life or the right to privacy it also defend process by which those right be uphold even if the chair want to take somebody to task for not follow the rule in this place they might at least be entitle to fair hearing or fair trial for what they have do yet what the bill do be remove that concept of fair hearing from those people in our country who be often some of the most vulnerable people flee torture and persecution they want to uphold government ministers as judge and jury and it do not even align with their own datum on how many people they be grant asylum to when their case be hear nevertheless the point about the echr be the point that be understand by churchill and believe by many of we in the chamber we withdraw at our peril the opportunity for that freedom to be hear that freedom for fair trial and for somebody else to hear your case against an overbearing state article of the european court of human rights convention set out the right to an effective remedy it dare to impose on state party on country that sign up to the court that everyone whose right and freedom as set forth in this convention be violate shall have an effective remedy before national authority notwithstanding that word again that the violation have be commit by person act in an official capacity in lay person term when you think the government have do you wrong who do you turn to to protect you rightly you might want to turn to our court but if the government be set the law it make sense to many of we who value freedom and liberty that there be third party that you can adhere to frankly it be sign that be get old that look at the conservative party now and wonder where those libertarian be those people who recognise rightly the concern that government might be overbearing and repressive interruption freedom love indeed but not enough for their own freedom it seem from how this bill start the inevitable process of remove that right to remedy we all know that right wing government might start with refugee but they never end with their right when it come to remove they the bill removal of the right to an article remedy would not just have consequence for refugee many of we have debate the concept that each person should be able to have their day in court concept that lie person across the world understand for it be write not just into the european court of human rights and our human rights act but the united states convention it be not some terrible communist socialist marxist idea that people might have remedy and the idea of due process it be part of be state that play by the rule and treat people fairly if we start to unpick that in this legislation it have consequence not just for our immigration system but far beyond the remit that anybody have think about for so long it have be byword for british liberty and freedom that we have be prepare to stand up for the rule of law play by the rule and yes be part of make they through be part of the council of europe declare an interest as somebody who take part in one of those election to vote for one of those terrible pyjama wear judge who then have to uphold the legislation that we have help to create where do it have an impact the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson talk about the good friday agreement and the right hon and learn member for south swindon recognise that too let we sound the alarm here if the government will not deal with it now it must be deal with in the other place peace be precious and the peace in northern ireland be build on the bedrock of the good friday agreement and the good friday agreement be build on the bedrock of the european court of human rights it be bake into the northern ireland peace process the good friday agreement place direct duty on the uk government and all of we in this place to incorporate the european court of human rights and its work into northern irish law so that people in northern ireland could challenge an injustice in the court if their right be breach that be not my interpretation the good friday agreement explicitly state full incorporation in northern ireland law of the echr and state explicitly that the party we and the irish government affirm their commitment to the mutual respect the civil right and the religious liberty of everyone in the community when we start remove those right which be what the bill do by deny the right of refugee to go to court under article we start undermine the good friday agreement because it do affect people in northern ireland it be principle establish in uk law through section of the withdrawal agreement the government acknowledge that when we debate it on december the home secretary himself acknowledge that the bill make differential treatment in different part of the united kingdom and that somehow the bill will address the practical implication official report december vol but we have not see any practical addressing of the implication and the potential consequence for our commitment to uphold the good friday agreement an agreement that think we would all concur year on still matter and therefore be worth fight for it matter because refugee be people too do not know why we have to state that in this place but it seem increasingly that we must the hon member for belfast east be right to talk about the angesom ruling but the ruling show that the government recognise that just few month ago the government say in the court that it apply to refugee section explain explicitly that the applicant and respondent both agree that the right and safeguard in equality underpin by the good friday agreement be not exclude from asylum seeker and that the concept of who everyone in that community be write into the good friday agreement include those outside the background of communal conflict we could be in position where there be fry pan and fire if the government proceed with this measure we will undermine the good friday agreement but if they exempt northern ireland so that those right be uphold they will create loophole in the bill as be sure member on the other side of the benches opposite be not sure which part of the mafia contingent that refer to these day will recognise it reflect the further chaos and confusion that the government rwanda legislation cause table amendment to address this issue head on it ask the government to do something very simple to set out how the bill uphold the good friday agreement surely that be not controversial question to ask but it seem very controversial for we to be give an answer mess around with article unpick not just the good friday agreement but part of our trade and co operation agreement when deal with international treaty evidence that we play by the rule and be therefore good to do business with be part of the reason other country want to work with we and that matter post brexit because our reputation be everything time and again the government have seek to undermine it by suggest that somehow the rule should not apply to we and that therefore people should not expect the united kingdom to stand up for those value abide by they and uphold they article of the trade and co operation agreement state the cooperation provide for in this part be base on the parties and member states longstanding respect for democracy the rule of law and the protection of fundamental right and freedom of individual include as set out in the universal declaration of human rights and in the european convention on human rights and on the importance of give effect to the right and freedom in that convention domestically give effect be the crucial phrase it make simple sense to as lay person there be no point in have right if you can not actually use they if there be no court and no possibility of be able to seek remedy but that be exactly what the bill start to unpick it be not surprise to therefore that nathalie loiseau the chair of the committee in the european parliament that be charge with oversee the trade and co operation agreement recognise this legislation unamended for what it be namely direct threat to that the worry that many of we have be not about brussels tell the uk what to do it be about the fact that we be head into the month and year before the tca be to be renegotiate next time constituent come to member with all the paperwork that the tory hard brexit have create and the tca underpin and ask what be you go to do to deal with it or ask about the border tax that will be introduce at the end of january and all the paperwork they be go to have to pay for at the end of april that member should bear in mind that the opportunity to reduce and remove all that and to bring back the trade that we desperately need will depend on those negotiation walk into they with the message you can not trust word that we say as country because we might say that we will follow the echr but if we think it do not suit we we will not and what be you go to do about it be not the way to get good deal for british business there be consequence from the way in which this legislation have be draft that we have not even begin to unpick in the house but today be our last day to do anything about it we must not look like country that other do not want to do business with or that be hypocritical but that be exactly what we be to those of we who have fight for and defend the right of people with whom we disagree that hypocrisy stink strongly from the home office the home office that want to use the european court of human rights to deny the implementation of the buffer zone for which this parliament vote on the basis that there would be an article contention under the echr be the same home office that be seek to rip up the right of refugee to use the echr when it feel like it what be sauce for the goose be sauce for the gander in layman term everyone can see what be go on here pick and choose to suit your own end and the consequence for people be damn the bill be contrary to the rule of law because it amount to legislative usurpation of the judicial function it be an assault on our constitution it be not stand up for liberty and freedom it be deny those by remove those basic right and the government be do that in their own legal assessment raise this point early with conservative member again be not legally qualified but think that the assessment read like something out of alice in wonderland it state article echr be engage but will not be infringe that sound bit like present but not involve as way of think about legislation it seem to be say that because we can say that rwanda be safe and will always be safe no concern can ever be raise about safety that be tautology it do not make any sense not least give the evidence that there be safety concern about rwanda and the possibility that thing might change in future even if we do not accept the evidence of extrajudicial killing death in custody enforce disappearance torture and the persecution of those in the community the assessment then begin to sound bit more like the mad march hare the government consider that declaration of incompatibility be sufficient to provide an article effective remedy for challenge to decision under the presumption of safety in clause to treat rwanda as safe to those of we who be not legally qualified that seem to be say that something be incompatible to make it compatible basically it be say that someone can bring court case so the bill be lawyer charter the government keep tell we that they do not like lawyer but they seem to want to encourage they to make lot of money out of badly draw piece of legislation that will encourage court case that be exactly what the government own legal ruling do this house can and should do well amendment be about resolve these challenge and show that we have think about they if nothing else it would give succour to the court that we have as we do with prisoner voting consider the matter which be often what the court be ask we to do not to leave people right lock away and inaccessible but to look at how they be be use churchill say at the hague we welcome any country where the people own the government and not the government the people think that be very noble proposition be sorry that conservative members be increasingly advocate our removal from the european court of human rights because they can not live up to those terrible ideal of protection of the right to family life or protection of privacy or goodness know protection of freedom of thought will the hon lady give way oh go on then the hon lady be constantly and sarcastically evoke winston churchill obviously he do sign up to the echr and he send lawyer to deal with the drafting process but will the hon lady acknowledge that he do not initially think that the united kingdom would join it and when he do sign we up to it there be no right of individual claim to the european court it be properly on the plane of international law between state which be the appropriate place for this sort of law nor would churchill accept surely and nor should any of we what the echr have become under the jurisdiction of the strasbourg court and be afraid our own lawyer all the article that the hon lady have mention include the right to human life have be so extended and expand by the court ever since that it have become entirely inappropriate for we to belong to the court in this way really do not think that winston churchill would have support what strasbourg have become and neither surely do the hon lady be sorry that the hon gentleman be not here early to be part of the conversation be sure that he would want his own right of remedy to explain why he could not be bother to be here at the start he would have hear the debate that we have about the original intention of the court let quote back to he the original document which state the high contracting parties undertake to abide by the final judgment of the court in any case to which they be party from the start churchill himself advocate for the court as backstop against overbear government that could speak for people and prosecute people in way that be be talk about after the second world war without any challenge do not quote churchill sarcastically recognise what he see at the time the danger of authoritarianism the hon gentleman would do well to reflect on that and perhaps reread some of those argument as well as the rule about take part in parliamentary debate when churchill talk about welcome any country in which the people own the government he be talk about democracy and our court be an integral part of our democracy because they keep government honest even if they be strain with this current administration just two country have leave the european court of human rights be there when we expel russia because of its aggression and when we try to prevent it from come back greece leave in when it be under military regime and rejoin once democracy be restore we should be proud and confident in our capacity to speak up for human right and to recognise that right to an effective remedy be an integral part of that there be no point have right if we can not exercise it and that mean have separate body to oversee the process and ensure that it be fair to all party more pragmatically we should be worried about mess up our trade deal and undermine peace in northern ireland as this bill do say to the hon member for devizes danny kruger that it be not wake to be libertarian to not trust government or to think that we need to protect ourselves it be wack to think that because your government be in charge it be okay because they will not abuse their power all government try to do that at some point and it be right that all government face process of challenge this legislation will not stop the boat what the government really want to do be stop the vote but they can not do that there will be an election but not before we have do potentially irreparable damage the irish government have yet to say what they think about this bill but the uk government be clear in the ruling in october that they feel that refugee be cover by the good friday agreement so in table this legislation this government be undermine their own logic about their obligation under the good friday agreement even if conservative member do not care about the trade and co operation agreement let we at least care about the peace process let we ensure that these issue about compatibility be not something out of alice in wonderland but speak to the good of this place and to those obligation because promise that we will all regret it if we do not speak up for freedom and liberty in this way rise to speak in support of amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick which command the support of of my colleague note the comment make by the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy and would like to respond to some of they in the course of my speech we be here to fix problem it be the problem that we be all seize by which be stop the boat this be our third attempt to fix this problem we pass the nationality and borders act we pass the illegal migration act and we be here again in the third time round with the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill the british people be feed up they have run out of patience and they have run out of time and this be our last chance to get it right amendment seek to remedy fatal flaw in the bill which be that as currently draft it will lead we directly to rerun of the scenario that we see on june when the home office and the then administration have identify cohort of illegal migrant and fill plane ready to take off to rwanda but at the hour pursuant to an opaque process decision be make by still unidentified judge in foreign court that have the effect of block the do the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady have something to say be not sure why we have to be frightened of foreign court what exactly be wrong with foreign court will tell the hon gentleman where we have problem with foreign court in that scenario when english court have refuse injunction by the migrant to get off the flight the foreign court overrode english judge overrode the will of the government and overrode the will of the british people to control our border and stop the boat that be the problem with foreign court and that be the problem that we be try to fix when that flight be ground in june it be because of rule interim injunction those order be not contain in the european convention on human right and they be not product or content of the original convention they be creation of the strasbourg court and the strasbourg judge and they have evolve over time pursuant to the live instrument doctrine that be espouse by the strasbourg court and that have inflate and expand its remit over decade beyond anything conceive by the original drafter or any intention set out in the original version of the european convention believe that no one here disagree with the aspiration and the content of the european convention on human right do not disagree with anything set out in that document which contain noble vital and fundamental human right that we be all proud to defend fervently and fiercely against oppressive regime against authoritarianism against genocide against mass killing and against some of the bad atrocity history have see that be the context of the european convention genesis to respond to the hon member for walthamstow the problem we be deal with be the court it be the court that have become politicised it be the court that have become interventionist it be the court that do not follow the traditional common law rule of precedent to which the english court subscribe the strasbourg court and its judge have distort the original european convention on human right into something that bear no reflection to its original intention that have be exacerbate by labour human rights act in recent decade we have see right culture and litigiousness around immigration asylum and many other area public sector decision making have be stymie thwart and undermine by heavily resource activist legal industry that be undermine government decision making stymie policy making and undermine law enforcement and public safety have few example take the case of oo nigerian national who be sentence in to four year in prison for offence include possession of crack cocaine and heroin with intent to supply he plead guilty to battery and assault in those be serious offence in the first tier tribunal allow his appeal against deportation on the ground that he have very significant obstacle to integration in nigeria that outweigh the public interest in his deportation despite the seriousness of his offending and despite the risk he pose to the public his article right interpret in vastly elastic way distorted illogical way operate to stop he be deport article be invoke in the case of uk we can all agree with article which prohibit torture and inhumane or degrading treatment but in this case of non uk national who be convict of deal drug the strasbourg court hold that the effect of discontinue his medical treatment available in the uk but not in his destination country amount to inhumane or degrading treatment under article why should convict drug dealer be entitle to public service here and not be deport surely on that basis almost any deportation could be block for few country in the world can match the standard of our nhs and once that precedent have be set every person will claim that they require treatment for the most minor of ailment be afraid that my right hon friend be absolutely right to highlight that point article and stretch interpretation of it originate in the jurisprudence of the strasbourg court by politicised judge pursue political agenda have lead to perception that here in the uk we have an international health service not national health service lastly let we consider the case of am zimbabwe in thank to which it have now become law that state that want to remove someone have to prove that medical facility available to the deportee in their home country would remove any real risk that their lifespan would be shorten by their removal from nhs facility that be exactly the point that my right hon friend have make the uk government now have duty to establish that foreign health service be sufficient before we deport people who may well pose risk to public safety and in some case national security in this country those be the overall problem with the court not the convention but the court rule be another symptom of the problem that we have with the court and the judge which be why the amendment be vital it will make it clear that rule order be not bind and that it will be for the uk government to make the decision on deportation not foreign court an unidentified judge somewhere far away who do not have the same ambition or aspiration as this uk government to stop the boat that be why will support the amendment enthusiastically today let conclude by say that this be our last chance to fix this problem we have stretch the patience of the british people this come down to simple but profound question who govern britain be it we the democratically elect representative who have be directly send here on behalf of the british people on clear mandate and with clear instruction of what to do and whose law be pass by clear and transparent majority to which we can all be hold to account at the ballot box or be it an opaque forum many mile away in different country that be distant outsourced foreign and do not share our value rise will not give way be it forum that do not share our value that have make decision time and time again that be odd with what the british people have indicate they want and that have operate to undermine our public safety national security and good governance it be the operation of the strasbourg court we can call it the strasbourg court or foreign court and we can argue about semantic the european court of human rights that we be concern with here that court be currently control this country ability to stop the boat that court and its jurisprudence be prevent this government from deliver for the british people we make vow to the british people that we would stop the boat that be solemn vow that take incredibly seriously it be what people vote for in in the brexit referendum by majority know that most opposition member do not want to believe in the majority still live in denial and do not want to accept the fact it be what people vote for by huge majority in to control our border and to stop the boat we make promise know the right hon and learn lady feel this passionately but will she clarify her concern about foreign court what do she think nato be nato be not court be slightly embarrassed that have to make that clear to the hon lady as that be really elementary politic we be be govern by foreign court and judge who do not have our interest at heart the decision come from that court be stop we control our border the amendment will prevent that foreign court from stop we so we need to support the amendment because it will fix the bill the bill need to work it be our last chance if we get it wrong the british people will not forgive we and they will be right not to do so order now have to announce the result of today defer divisions on the draft immigration act residential accommodation maximum penalty order the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it on the draft immigration employment of adults subject to immigration control maximum penalty amendment order the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate what privilege it be to follow the former home secretary the debate have really light up there be comparison early between the debate and the next episode in box set but think we have just see the first act of the next conservative leadership contest no doubt the sketch writer and everyone else pay attention have suddenly wake up she make some incredibly interesting comment she speak about vow that be make to british people after referendum and election remember vow be make in about how the scottish parliament be go to become the great most powerful leader of all parliaments in the entire world and look how that turn out the former home secretary be right that the government will be hold to account and that parliament will exercise its opportunity to have say on these issue that be why the amendment propose by she and her hon friend be vote down last night and be confident will be vote down again this evening come the election majority of members of parliament include majority of mps in scotland who represent the scottish national party will be return to the house and will vote to repeal the bill assume the bill ever make it on to the statute book in the first place what be play out be debate not specifically about this legislation but about the future of the conservative party and some of its past as well in some way it have be real privilege to debate against the maastricht rebel of old and to have the opportunity to debate people who be on the television when be study for my modern study standard grade year ago they still can not get that determination to rebel against the government out of their system it do not really matter what the government be propose the hon member for stone sir william cash the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and for wokingham john redwood and the rest will be against it because they love that sweet taste of rebellion but the rest of we have well thing to do with our time and we need to get on and demonstrate what our constituent think about the bill we hear at great length yesterday from the hon member for stone about the wonderful concept of parliamentary sovereignty even though we be debate the clause that explicitly recognise parliamentary sovereignty today my amendment would remove subsection in that clause because the assertion of parliamentary sovereignty in such bill be an innovation would be interested to hear the minister response to that point because the idea of include in bill that language about parliament be sovereign be an innovation with the help of the house of commons library the only other instance have be able to find be in the european union withdrawal agreement act there be other example of legislation that imply parliamentary sovereignty and that imply the ability of this house to override court and make its own decision some of that be in the found legislation that take we into the european union in the first place and also in the act that establish the devolution settlement but the line assert that parliament be sovereign be something of legislative innovation give how lyrical the hon member for stone wax yesterday about the wonder of an unwritten constitution it strike that this be form of codify the concept of parliamentary sovereignty write down aspect of the uk constitution this seem to be random piece of migration legislation which may or may not ever actually make it on to the statute book none the less it seem very interesting way to go about codify the uk constitution the other reason for my amendment be the one cite by both the hon member for kirkcaldy and cowdenbeath neale hanvey yesterday when he introduce his ten minute rule bill and by my hon and learn friend the member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry early when she raise the constitutional tradition express by lord cooper in the case of maccormick the lord advocate in the principle of the unlimited sovereignty of parliament be distinctively english principle which have no counterpart in scottish constitutional law my hon and learn friend speak with far great experience than can about the significance of that ruling and indeed about the wide significance of scotland historically independent legal system to this debate and to this legislation that perhaps explain my amendment and which would remove scotland from the extent clause because despite what the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman seem to think about the opinion of the british public voter in glasgow north want no part of this know that because speak to they on very regular basis significant number of they be asylum seeker who regularly come to my surgery hear the horror story not just of what they have experience in their country of origin but of their experience of try to deal with the home office frankly if more asylum seeker know that that be what they would be on the receive end of perhaps it would have the kind of deterrent effect that the home office be so desperately try to achieve in reality scotland have always be country that welcome refugee asylum seeker and those who want to make their home there and contribute something to our society just as so many country around the world do for the scot when they be clear off the land to make way for sheep or when their crop fall victim to blight or in the modern world when people want to study around the world or practise their profession overseas that be why also support the amendment from my hon and learn friend the member for edinburgh south west that say the scottish parliament should be ask to give its consent to the bill before it take effect north of the border in reality the scottish parliament will not give its consent because it be not what the people in scotland want to see or how they think humane system of asylum should work the bill talk about the safety of rwanda ask the prime minister about that today also put the same question to the minister who respond to yesterday debate say that if rwanda be safe country and comfortable place in which people can live out their life have be grant asylum why would the potential of be deport there be deterrent it do not seem to make an awful lot of sense to both the prime minister and the minister say well because rwanda be not the uk so not be the uk be itself deterrent by the same logic if the government come to an agreement with disneyland and threaten to deport asylum seeker to disneyland if they arrive here by irregular mean that too would be deterrent because it be not the united kingdom sadly there be not yet disneyland in the united kingdom although suspect that sometimes people look at this place and wonder exactly where the fantasy in all this be by the government own logic then the bill fail under the weight of its contradiction that be the point of the definition of the safety of rwanda in clause the bill fail under the weight of its own contradiction and we see that in the contradictory amendment propose by the two five or however many oppose faction there be in the conservative party the former home secretary the right hon and learn member for fareham be right that the public will have their say on the bill after the next election be confident that members from the scottish national party will be prepare to support any legislation that the government who be return introduce to repeal the bill assume as say that it make it on to the statute book in the first place will now announce the result of the ballot hold today for the election of the chair of the defence committee there be vote cast four of which be invalid sir jeremy quin be elect chair with vote he will take up his post immediately and congratulate he on his election the result of the count under the alternative vote system will be make available as soon as possible in the vote office and publish on the internet will be slightly unfashionable and talk to the amendment rather than regurgitate some of the second reading speech we have have do so with some trepidation because sit to my right be trio former lord chancellor former attorney general and the justice committee chair who speak with much great legal gravita and much more expensively perhaps the only upside be that my advice and my talk to the amendment come for free in contribute to the debate be largely speak to the government side of the committee in all the speech we have yesterday when the opposition could not fill the full allotted time for the debate have complain about the lack of scrutiny and guess they may not be able to fill the full time give to they today we hear speech after speech emulate their front bench team that tell we what they do not like what they be not support and what they be not vote for at absolutely no point do they come up with practical solution for the very real everyday problem we aim to deal with here although we have disagreement on our side as to the method what we want to achieve be in common that goal be something that need to be tackle and we be have an honest debate about it the official opposition be play absolutely no part in that debate my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick who have leave his place start the debate by talk to amendment in particular he describe the problem as like pull the pin out of grenade but then not throw it do not think that be helpful language and he then quit the chamber have throw the grenade behind his own line we need cool calm consensus to come up with practical workable acceptable and legal solution the rwanda scheme be not perfect all of we will agree with that but frankly it be the only real show in town at the moment to answer this essential question that raise last week in the opposition debate which again they struggle to fill with their own speaker that question be how do we deal with the people who have come to this country mostly by small boat have pay criminal gang with no credible prospect of be able to lodge an acceptable asylum claim but who come from country to which it be virtually if not completely impossible to return they so they know that once they have make it across the midway of the channel and be in british territorial water they be effectively in the united kingdom for the foreseeable future that be absolutely the question at the heart of this bill and the debate today and yesterday have hear the hon gentleman make that point before about people who come and can not be send back to whatever country because of the situation there that have occur within my own casework and at the moment it appear that the home office grant people temporary leave for perhaps year at time which give no certainty to the person affect but do suppose give the home office discretion to reconsider rather than give they permanent status that already happen so would say it be not something he should really be so concerned about know it happen already that be what have be say and the hon lady at least credit with be consistent we have three problem with the immigration system in this country the first problem be how we can prevent people from leave those mostly french beach in the first place to make that most inappropriate and most dangerous journey we can have different argument about the safe and legal route which she know support and whether that would reduce the number try to do it or whether we could come to some accord with the french so that they would intercept those boat and return the passenger to french water the second problem be that we need to speed up the whole processing as the government have to give they credit of those people who be in limbo those who come before the illegal migration act who be still able to have their asylum application in this country we need to get through that backlog as swiftly as possible we then have problem with those in limbo post the illegal migration act who have effectively commit crime under the term of that act the third problem in solve the migration process be then remove those people who have not be able to make credible claim to stay in the united kingdom that be why the alternative of their face lottery on whether they will end up in hotel in kent or plane to rwanda and have their claim instead assess there be an important part of the deterrent factor it be one part not an overriding part as some people have try to caricature it but an important part of deal specifically with that group of people whom it be really difficult to remove in time we need more return agreement and we have successfully do that with number of country albania have be cite many time however there be country of which iran will be one with which return agreement be frankly impossible and we should not delude ourselves otherwise it be wrong to suggest that we can solve this problem just by have further agreement with the french and pay they more money we have pay the french gendarmerie and police force million already yet the proportion of successful intercept have fall in the past month we already have joint operation with they we already have unit within the national crime agency deal with this issue the opposition claim that this problem can be solve by get well at crack down on the people smuggler and co operate with the french but all that be happen already we need to speed up the application as have just say but that still do not deal with the problem of what we do with people who we can not then return that be why agree with the spirit of what my right hon friend the member for newark and other hon friend be try to do with amendment but do not agree with the method and that be why will oppose the amendment let we just remind ourselves that the reason this bill have become necessary be in response to the supreme court judgment that find the rwanda scheme to have various specific shortcoming the refoulement threat and the fact it be one way street which have now be resolve that be why number of measure have be bring in with the rwanda treaty and within this bill this bill be about allay fear about not fulfil our obligation under international law and the implication that may have for the northern ireland agreement as have already be mention and for negotiate trade treaty and other international agreement in the future however the rwanda agreement as it currently stand before the reform to it fall foul of our own court it be not just the echr or the refugee convention it be our own court that rule against the government the rwanda scheme need to be see to be lawful not just by rwanda but potentially both by other country who have signify an interest in operate rwanda type scheme as host and by other european country who be interested in get part of the action if we be able to get the rwanda scheme into operation ultimately my aim be to see co operation of european and other nation in joint rwanda type scheme although not one limit just to rwanda that could act as an effective deterrent so that far few people come across the channel and we can clamp down on those who still use that route because they have little credible claim to have asylum in this country for that we need safe and legal route operate properly as well as have say many time before there be problem specifically with rule indication or pyjama injunction be not lawyer but on the basis of the threshold for which other thing can go to court that be very opaque process we have hear about the anonymous judge they do not issue full judgment and the government can not make case at all where else be there legal system whereby the person who be effectively be prosecute can not make their own case in front of judge nor be there any appeal facility in this whole operation those rule indication be never part of the european convention that be never include in the constitution there be attempt to include it in the constitution but they be never support those power as my hon friend have say just seem to have be absorb into the strasbourg court by its own fiat to whom be that court accountable why be the european council not do more governance of how those power have be surreptitiously extend last year the strasbourg court itself admit that it need to change its way and that the operation of rule indication be not satisfactory it say that in future they would be use only in extremis although we do not know how it define that they would be operate by name judge the government in this case would have an opportunity to present their evidence and be listen to and judgment would be more transparent so the court itself know that there be problem with the rule indication we be not the only country that be concerned about the way that the indication have be operate too often it seem we be pillory as if the united kingdom government be serial offender against echr judgment and european convention diktat but other country seem routinely to get around rule indication and we have one of the good record in comply with echr judgment over the past year or so no few than echr ruling have not be enforce or comply with include of those against spain of those against italy and of those against germany the united kingdom be one of the good complier with echr judgment the sort of thing that we have not comply with include vote for prisoner about which we have hear we have vote about that in this house largely to indulge the liberal democrats as part of the coalition government seem to recall and forcefully and robustly vote against it decide not to go forward with it think that that be absolutely the right judgment and it stay in limbo we need to reform the echr in the past year there have be only four judgment against the uk on convention matter yet again the uk have fall foul of abide by rule that too many other ignore so support the case for not be bind by rule ruling as say we need urgently to work with our partner through the council of europe and other to reform those ruling it be very opaque governance system do not believe though that not be bind by these confected rule direction undermine our overall compliance with international law or with international responsibility and undertaking however the bill already say that in reasonable and balanced way the minister have discretion to make the decision not to comply with those rule indication so we have give the minister and the government the power to say actually we do not think that be right and therefore for good reason we be not go to allow that rule indication to apply to this case that be sensible way of proceed it be not mainstream routine blanket disregard which could fall foul of our own court and have international implication for the integrity of british legislation and governance as such support the spirit of what hon member be try to achieve with amendment but do not support the method we all know that get this rwanda legislation through parliament be very difficult complex and sensitive issue we have to strike very fine balance between not trample on international law and enable our government to get on with the measure that they be elect to implement and think the government have get the balance right in this bill which be not an easy task that be why want the bill to go through unamended we all have something to gain from that happening will certainly be vote for the full bill on third reading if that happen this evening but my hon friend need to stop and consider before they pull the pin out of another grenade if this bill do not go through there be no plan for deal with those people who we can not transport back to the country from which they come there will be no rwanda bill no rwanda scheme no deterrent policy and no obvious end to the small boat hope that my right hon friend the member for newark who make very strong case but think with the wrong ultimate conclusion on the method will consider the implication of pursue that conclusion all the way to vote in the wrong lobby on third reading hope he will withdraw his amendment and let the government get on with the job of see whether we can get this rwanda scheme to work get the plane off the ground offer real deterrent and get this problem sort out once and for all it be pleasure to serve under your guidance this afternoon sir roger and to take part in debate that have be broadly thoughtful despite very clear difference of opinion it be also pleasure to have sit through and enjoy the speech of the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman who be the very definition of an activist lawyer so we be grateful to have she with we speak in solidarity with the minority of other member in the chamber today who be not legally train who be not lawyer it be right that our voice be hear as well rise in particular to speak in favour of amendment and which stand in the name of my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael who be indeed lawyer first want to say something that ought not to be even remotely controversial the evil trade of ship people across the english channel in rickety boat need to be stop and those people who be carry across the channel via those mean be take huge risk we have see significant loss of life over the year include in recent time however the two amendment be speak to seek to challenge the fundamental of the bill believe this bill will not do what it say it will not stop the boat it will not tackle the issue of deterrence and so on and even if it do the rwanda provision would tackle only roughly of the number of people who seek asylum in this country as well as lead to poor policy there be number of error at the heart of the bill because it be base on series of false premise there be three basic false premise the first be the belief that while this be global problem and european problem the uk position be especially awful have hear incendiary language in this place and outside it relate to our be overrun or swamp with people swarm across the channel and that kind of thing the reality be that of those who declare themselves to be refugee remain in the region to which they have flee normally the next country so very small minority end up in this continent germany take four time more asylum seeker than the uk france two and half time more and spain two time more perish the thought but if we be to place britain back into the european union just for second for league table snapshot we would see that the uk be in the league table of country among the other in the number of asylum seeker we take per capita the idea that the uk be overwhelm by this particular problem be not true and it do not take account of the reality across the continent and across the world it be also worth bear in mind that the voter base issue the government be really deal with or think they be deal with be excessive immigration in general yet only of the migrant in this country be asylum seeker the real issue and where there be an issue of our be overwhelm be that the last time check asylum seeker be wait in the backlog on past experience of those people will be count as refugee and give approval by this government so we know that the people come here be broadly genuine refugee and different not entirely coterminous they be wait more than six month when member get letter in their postbag and email from people outraged about this issue it be usually less about the boat cross the channel than the fact that local hotel be full of asylum seeker not be use for its primary purpose and there be reason for that those asylum seeker do not want to be in such hotel instead they want to have their case treat quickly when be in barrow in the constituency of my neighbour the hon member for barrow and furness simon fell few month ago talk to asylum seeker who would rather be tell to leave the country and be give negative decision than wait the year or more that they have wait so far one guy tell he have be an afghan interpreter for the british army in afghanistan but we have leave he behind and the only way he could find to get to this country be to come via an irregular route these be the people we be talk about and the reason we be in the situation we be in be the government failure to tackle the backlog the first false premise this bill be base on be that the uk problem be somehow different and great than any of our neighbour or indeed somehow separate from the problem that affect the whole of planet earth the second false premise be that the only way to control migration or of it because asylum account for only of uk migration be to duck international law and become pariah the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright point out more eloquently and in more detail than be go to the importance of the united kingdom be credible internationally we listen to the prime minister early this week and we be aware of what the uk government be do and what the uk military be do alongside the us in the red sea and the justification for that which hear understand and accept be that this be about uphold the rule of law if we want to walk on the world stage and be leader to be people with influence then we need to be not among those who habitually break the rule of law and think these thing do not apply to they mention this question of global leadership in my speech yesterday for very good reason it be to do with reputation but it be also to do with change all over the european union face with compulsory quota and compulsory fine country be in real mess there be the charter of fundamental right and the eu can not make change without change in constitutional law and in country constitution and they may well have to have referenda in this country we be in different position and can make change because in our dualist system we be entitle to require our court to obey the decision of parliament about sovereignty where clear and unambiguous wording be use there be the difference and that be why we can lead the world such negotiation be bind to be happen because my hon friend at the other end of the chamber have be say they believe there will be change in the european convention on human right and for that matter the refugee convention of course it be give that the law change and law change via variety of different mean include how this place vote nevertheless the uk would be see to be choose in order to tackle problem in an ineffective way to disapply the human rights act and at least to an extent not to comply with international law hear all the disparage remark about lefty lawyer activist judge foreign judge and so on all of which demean this place and be not what people who be suppose to uphold the constitution ought to be say particularly give that the majority of lawyer have hear speak in this debate be on the conservative benches if conservative member want to describe themselves as lefty lawyer that be their business but it be not helpful but when we have the law society say that the bill might be incompatible with our international obligation and set dangerous legal and constitutional precedent by legislate to overturn an evidence base finding of fact by the uk high court we should take it seriously there be no doubt whatever that for we to decide to pass law to say that rwanda be safe country be an overreach of parliament because if we have evidence to say that rwanda be safe present it to the court do it in the proper way it be dangerously authoritarian to decide on matter of fact of law rather than present it before the court it be not only an overreach however it be also ridiculous if we be go to declare rwanda safe just because we want it to be declare blackburn rovers back in the premier league and alan shearer to be year young and back in no shirt play up front for we there we be make it so but that be clearly not the case sadly if there be evidence we should present it to the court it be ridiculous for this place to say that somehow it can declare place safe just because it be convenient for it to do so we do not control migration by this kind of sophistry but deterrence be still appropriate people have ask what deterrence we be go to have the deterrent be if we have function asylum system where we actually return people whose application fail on the point about declare country safe france germany and other eu country have decide they will not entertain any asylum application from albania because it be safe country that abide by the same convention they have do it why can we think on balance we would say that albania probably be safe and the bulk of return we have have have indeed be to albania but think it be wrong for we to get out of hole on this individual case in this way where there be evidence that rwanda be not safe place the issue be that we should present evidence to the court in order to achieve that the hon gentleman have just make discretionary judgment on the safeness of albania have say that nobody can determine whether country should be deem safe or not there be many dangerous thing go on in albania which be why some people be leave involve trafficking drug and various other thing all be say be that european country will not entertain asylum application from albania because they have deem it not to be suitable and applicable so why can not we apply the same criterion to rwanda have never be an apologist for other european country they make their own decision but the clear issue be that this house have be ask to decide on matter of law when that be matter for the court if there be evidence that rwanda be safe we present that evidence to the court that be the proper way to go about it and the hon gentleman know that my opinion on whether place be or be not safe be neither here nor there the issue be whether the court have consider the evidence in front of they the evidence in front of the court be that rwanda be not safe we do not deal with that by just declare it to be safe which be unconstitutional and also ridiculous we present the evidence and if the government have evidence they should present it to the court want to go back to the issue of deterrence which be lead into before the intervention if we want to deter people who do not have legitimate claim from come to the united kingdom we should be some use at remove those people who do not have legitimate claim the fact be that only quarter of those people who be deny asylum once they have go through the process be remove and that be the problem we have government who be incompetent at do the basic inefficient and weak at tackle those people who eventually do get assess and be show not to be refugee the problem be not activist judge but weak and incompetent government be not accuse everyone on the government benches as be populist but one of the hallmark of populist be that they look at huge and difficult problem and they come up with simplistic solution the reality be that we need to be honest that this be difficult problem that be not easy to solve it be global problem and we have to work with other country to try to address it for example some of the issue around yemen will no doubt have be exacerbate by this country choose to reduce its aid to yemen if we want to influence and stop the flow of people away from troubled part of the world we should get alongside those place and try to deal with these thing at source would not make any pretence that that will solve the problem but let we not pretend that try to attack one part of the symptom be an answer it be dishonest to claim that this bill be an overall answer to the problem the third false premise be that the provision of this bill will even remotely work at well on the government own figure maximum of of the asylum seeker come to this country will end up be remove to rwanda at the cost of million and counting we could just say why not put that money into well border force why not put that money into clear the backlog why not put that money into do thing that actually would deter people from come the bill will not work though and it will not deter people and let we just think why it will not deter people many refugee who end up in this country include by come over the channel come from eritrea in the first place many would refer to it as the north korea of africa isaias afwerki be an awful appal dictator among the thing he do that be cause of people seek refuge from that country be conscript all young man at many of they particularly from christian community be then send to murder their own people people ask why be so many of the people come young man that be one of the reason they seek asylum where do they go next many will stay in the region it be important to understand deterrence let we say that some young man maybe couple of brother have escape it be hard to escape in the first place from afwerki and his evil henchman so they leave the country they end up at some point go through the lawless horror that be libya it be utterly appalling and country without rule the experience of what happen post gaddafi be reminder that there be nothing so awful in this world that you can not make it bad and libya be even bad than it be then they pass through that country with its human trafficking massive murder rate and the appalling human right experience and they eventually make it to the med they cross the mediterranean on to mainland europe and then at some point they be ask to make decision about whether they will cross the or mile of the english channel that be piece of cake compare with the horror they have endure so far do we genuinely think that the chance they might get send to rwanda be deterrent at all it be reminder be it not that rwanda be huge distraction from the issue we face this bill assume state of affair that be not true it assume that the only way to deal with the situation be to act unconstitutionally and in very anti conservative and un conservative way might add it assume that the scheme will work when it blindingly obviously will not amendment and in the name of my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael be there to challenge the assumption that to control migration we need to exempt vulnerable people from domestic law that protect their human right we do not need to try to duck out of our obligation under the echr by ignore interim injunction these provision be morally wrong they be constitutional vandalism and constitute failure this bill be about seek to distract the electorate from the reality of people daily life we have government fail to govern or to tackle the cost of living and the nhs crisis one in nine people in my constituency be currently on an nhs waiting list and the government be waste their time on something that be morally outrageous unconstitutional and will not even do the thing it be set up to do order before call sir john hayes may remind the house that this be not second reading debate it be certainly debate about the clause stand part and the amendment but it be not second reading debate there be distinction the debate on the government side of the chamber as my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton say be not on difference in aim or end it be about the mean to those end government member want to travel to the same destination what we be debate be the journey to get there so let we not exaggerate the difference between we know that the minister share that view we have engage with he and hope to continue to do so even at this late stage to improve the bill and realise the delivery of those intention the journey to that end we have to do so because mass migration be perhaps the big existential crisis face this country do not say that blithely unfortunately people say thing in this chamber as though they be definitive and use all kind of superlative indeed the hon member for walthamstow stella creasy have make brand out of that as we hear early that view would be share by large number of my constituent and as my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham also say it be now widely share in other country the bill and the amendment to it therefore affect our constituent directly and personally contrary to the contribution of the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron who claim that it be distraction far from it we can not absorb into this country the number of people who be come as consequence of both legal and illegal migration in short period of time without devastating effect on public service displacement effect on investment in the skill of our own people displacement effect on the need to reform welfare and beyond all that the ability to integrate those incoming people into cohesive society in which we all share common sense of belong in deal with the amendment we need to be realistic about the scale of the problem and the british public view of that problem they know that the vast majority of people arrive here on small boat about man under by the way about nine out of arrive be male which be far from the picture paint by some of the critic of the government and our policy they know too that large number of those people be not genuine asylum seeker but economic migrant that truth be so evident to the elector of this country that they look with bemusement at this place where it be not widely recognise we hear speech after speech from opposition members in particular must say that seem to be either ignorant of those fact or unwilling to face they rise do not know whether the hon lady be the first or the second but happily give way to she perhaps the right hon member would like to correct the record most people who come on small boat be in fact refugee because the home office grant they that status they be not economic migrant as they do not get economic migrant status they get refugee status what we certainly know about they all be that before they get here they have travel through safe country more than one in many case and fail to claim asylum the hon lady be right that we be probably too lax in how we process claim certainly we offer asylum to more applicant than france on average we grant high proportion of asylum claim than most european country we know too that the failure to remove those people cost the british taxpayer an immense amount of money when look at the figure be stagger the cost of asylum be now billion it be extraordinary that single matter should cost so much the need for the bill be justify alone on the basis that we can no long afford to deal with the current scale of illegal migration we simply can not afford for it to continue as the british sense of fair play have be test to its limit the public see that and they be increasingly disillusion by the apparent inability and unwillingness of the political elite in this country we be the political elite like it or not to accept the fact progress have be make in clear the backlog largely as result of the effort of my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick and my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham suella braverman during their stewardship of the home office they focus resource on processing claim more quickly and have considerable success in do so but the problem be that as fast as we process people more arrive until we deal with the root of the problem we can never really tackle the cost describe nor the disillusion feel by our constituent that be why the prime minister pledge to stop the boat in order to do so we need an act that be as effective as possible the amendment in the name of my right hon friend the member for newark which strongly support would ensure just that amendment to deal in particular with the human rights act take together they would fully disapply the act from the bill and the illegal migration act particularly in relation to removal to rwanda lot of nonsense be speak early about right indeed lot of nonsense prevail in this house about right right be fundamentally important we believe in the essential right that characterise our country the right to fair trial the right to go about one business freely and unimpaire the right not to be arrest without cause the right to vote in free and fair election those be important part of what it be to be british but they do not spring from the ether they be not give it be liberal myth that right be natural right be the product of decent government in decent place do the right thing they be special because we have choose they not because they be give to we by some ethereal source the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron whom like and respect will know because he know scripture even well than that right do not get mention in the ten commandment or the sermon on the mount perhaps he can find part in either of those to contradict do not mean to intervene but the right hon gentleman have tempt this be not liberal thing as many conservative ought to support it do not believe there be any case for human right have any standing whatsoever without some form of metaphysical he be quite right to say that the bible do not talk about right it talk about individual duty if have duty to he he therefore have right do not believe that right be make up by human being they be literally god give my opinion of the hon gentleman have soar to an even great height know he be the good of liberal that be not great thing to be by the way but it be well than nothing and he have confirm it in that pithy intervention the crucial point about amendment to be that they rule out use section and of the human rights act we know from experience that the good intention of government back up by legislation pass in this place have be routinely frustrate by what my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham rightly describe as activist lawyer abroad and would add dodgy lawyer in this country and delude pressure group it be not just malevolent foreigner but malevolent people here too say to the minister that the only way we will effect the policy be if we do not allow that kind of gaming of our system by those who come here entirely accept that there be among they people whom we should of course welcome of course there be people fear persecution and of course we should be proud of the fact that we provide safe haven for people in desperate need we always have and we always will but people who be legitimate applicant for asylum be be effectively compromise by system that do not adequately distinguish they from the very people have describe as game our far too lax system the bill be an opportunity to put that right but only if it be fit for purpose the amendment be not design to frustrate the minister intention or to allow the prime minister pledge to fail on the contrary they be design to make his pledge real to allow it to be effect for if the amendment be not accept by the government fear the bill will do just that fail and disappoint the very people to whom we make that pledge to stop the boat section of the human rights act deal with declaration of incompatibility and section as describe it deal with remedial measure as it stand they be not exclude by the bill that mean that unamended the bill will allow court to issue declaration of incompatibility with the echr which would effectively kill the rwanda scheme the minister must know that that be possibility at least we would argue probability but even if it be possibility why would he not want to exclude that possibility perhaps could just elaborate on the point my right hon friend be make what be most likely to happen be the amendment not to be accept by this place be that on royal assent someone will bring case seek declaration of incompatibility for the bill that will then go through the court if the supreme court be then to rule ultimately that the bill be incompatible with the human rights act it would then be up to this house and parliament to determine what to do but if the prime minister be correct that the government of rwanda would not wish to be party to any scheme that be in breach of international law the scheme would be dead my right hon friend explain exactly the point be make the intention of the bill be put at risk by the failure to close the loophole it be just that an opportunity for people to exploit in exactly the way he say the absence of provision that would strengthen or in the prime minister word tighten the bill sufficiently to avoid such an eventuality all the british people expect be real fairness and hearing with real judge we have be speak about the european court of human rights be it not the case that many who be appoint to that strasbourg court have never even be lawyer they be not qualified let alone judge often they be academic civil servant or even politician more recently as time have go on they have be human right activist these non lawyer be often guide by non governmental organisation who even help to draft their judgment they be what lord sumption have describe as ideologically commit staff lawyer why should we in this place and in this wonderful country be subservient to that notion of international justice make law here that be what our people want in that pithy intervention my hon friend have describe much of the fundamental problem of allow what my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh describe as foreign court with foreign judge to determine outcome that directly affect the interest of this country will my right hon friend give way on that point my hon friend the member for derbyshire dales miss dines advance so many compelling argument in her intervention that want to deal with all of they before give way to my right hon friend there be three aspect of this the first be that our judicial system be not common but particular and special be root in english common law but also largely owe to the separation of power mean that our court be independent from the legislature and the executive so we have strong tradition of both judicial quality and judicial independence that be not true of many other country in europe be now happy to give way to my right hon friend who will elaborate people talk about the european court of human rights in strasbourg as if it be rather like our own supreme court or that of the united states but as say early be member of the council of europe so know exactly how these judge be appoint we in the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe appoint they it be the one power that we have we be give three name and we have very little information about who those people be but it be undoubtedly true there be evidence of this that more and more of they be not like our judge distinguished lawyer and judge they be for instance human right lawyer and academic what be bad about the process be that unlike our judge they be not appoint through an independent process the political group in the parliamentary assembly dominate by the socialist and the federalist christian democrats join together to appoint the most federalist pro european judge it be that to which be allude the separation that exist in this country between the judiciary and the legislature in the political process and the process of justice simply do not apply in many of the other country in europe and it certainly do not apply far afield there be problem of the politicisation of the court and also as say early there be problem of quality both of which be refer to by my hon friend the member for derbyshire dales and my right hon friend the member for gainsborough secondly there be an issue of accountability the point about law in this country be that it be make in this place the reason why that be so significant be that this place derive its legitimacy from election democratic and fair election we be empower to make law in this parliament because we be accountable and answerable to the people as soon as we subsume that accountability into some pan national arrangement especially the kind outline in my hon friend intervention we weaken this house and by weaken this house we weaken the people who send we here that be partly why their view of the world be so at odd with what describe early as the political elite although what really mean be the bourgeois liberal elite who dominate far too much of the establishment in all its element there be bourgeois liberal incarnate exclude the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale he be liberal but he be not bourgeois at least as far as be aware be not he definitely be not the amendment that disapply the human rights act be fundamental to the bill success may just say as an aside it be of course entirely relevant to the bill sir roger that we should in government from onwards have get rid of the human rights act anyway it be blair construction through the prism of which all legislation now seem to be see it be very damaging statute that have stymie much of the work of subsequent government amendment to take together would prevent the notorious rule injunction the so call last minute pyjama injunction which emanate from strasbourg these amendment would ensure that the default position be that rule indication be not bind and this be explicitly matter for ministers the government own legal advice have make it clear that without amendment to the bill flight may be ground yet again minister will indeed have the opportunity to introduce exception but will not be bind to do so the bill must be amend so that ministers can disregard rule order we really can not allow strasbourg judge to overrule this parliament and halt flight decision must be take by those elect in westminster not by court in europe this be what the people expect of we it be what the people demand of we the bill may block claim about the general state of rwanda but it will still permit individual claim which will block removal unless such individual claim be explicitly exclude we know that spurious case be use to frustrate removal and thus the legislation will have no tooth the minister know that these thing go on for day and week and month these case be never resolve quickly and time be short consequently the government must surely acknowledge that at the very least the flight that they and we regard as necessary part of deal with the scourge of illegal immigration will be delay the amendment will block individual claim and suspensive claim limit such claim to exceptional circumstance there be circumstance perhaps when seriously ill person can not travel that should be accept hope we would all agree with that but those will be rare case the home office have already correctly exclude family child and pregnant woman but those circumstance be incredibly unlikely give what have say about the profile of those people arrive in small boat be overwhelmingly fit man under the age of this be the third migration bill in recent time it be our third and final chance as other have say to deliver on our promise to the british people to stop the boat and control our border if we fail to strengthen the bill in the way that these amendment do it will simply not work and if we fail to make the bill work we will fail the british people we will have break our promise to they thousand more people will make risky journey in perilous condition and our hotel will remain full of those await judgment at enormous cost the british people will regard this as failure that be root here in this house and in this government the minister be good man and diligent minister and be sure he understand the thrust of the argument that have be make in the committee today he will know that in the end this be about fundamental crisis of democratic efficacy the ability of nation state to deliver for its people the great conservative prime minister of all time benjamin disraeli say that justice be truth in action official report february vol this issue be matter of justice legal justice and social justice it be for that reason that the british people want to see the boat stop they simply regard it as unjust that our border be be breach with impunity if the elect government of the united kingdom can not remove people who arrive here without permission more troubling and profound question must be ask who govern our country my constituent want the government they elect and the parliament they vote for to determine who govern britain only by improve this bill and by deliver the prime minister mission of stop the boat can we answer that question this have be very interesting committee range from the metaphysical to mps feed each other baked bean and from constitutional tour of the history of scotland to the case of john hirst who live in hull he put an axe through his landlady head go to prison and fight campaign for prisoner to have the right to vote we have discuss prisoner right to vote in the past we have also hear lot of criticism of lawyer but have to say that some of the good speech we have hear this afternoon have be from lawyer do not know whether they count as leftie lawyer as they be sit on the conservative benches in the majority of case be conscious that this be not second reading but refer the committee to the report on small boat crossing produce by the home affairs committee month ago there be no magical single solution to deal with irregular migration detailed evidence drive fully cost and fully test policy initiative be by far most likely to achieve sustainable incremental change that deter journey such as dangerous channel crossing we also say that the no issue the government need to address be the backlog on which be pleased there have be some progress the backlog be still about but that be an improvement on where we be last year be concern about amendment to and to table by the right hon member for newark robert jenrick because if they be accept they would put the united kingdom on collision course with international law also want to speak to amendment and new clause in relation to the cost of the rwanda policy clause disapplie the human rights act and amendment to would extend this disapplication thereby extend the permission this bill grant for public authority to act in way that be incompatible with human right specifically amendment and appear to extend the disapplication of the human rights act to anything do under the illegal migration act relate to the removal of person to rwanda this could potentially include person detention and treatment prior to removal mean that not only would no legal challenge be possible under amendment which we discuss yesterday but there would be no specific legal obligation on public authority to act in compatibility with human right extend the disapplication of section and of the human rights act to all immigration legislation as it relate to person removal to rwanda under this bill or the illegal migration act would raise serious concern about unforeseen consequence and unintended human right violation it should also be note that amend the bill to disapply section of the human rights act which have never be do before do not have any clear legal purpose it would simply prevent the court from tell the government and the public their view on the law as the secretary of state have already say on the face of the bill that he be unable to say that it be compatible with convention right no one could reasonably presume that statement of the same from the court would have any impact at all which be why be query these amendment the former immigration minister the right hon member for newark open the debate with amendment and and he talk about take the pin out of grenade clause concern interim measure of the european court of human rights state that it will be for minister and only minister to decide whether the uk will comply at this point let again pay tribute to the chair of the justice committee the hon member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill and the chair of the joint committee on human rights the hon and learn member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry for their clear explanation of the current situation on these interim injunction for set out clearly what the uk involvement with that court be and our long stand commitment to it and for set out that review be take place on those interim injunction which be very helpful amendment and would stipulate that interim measure from the european court of human rights the so call pyjama halt the removal of the asylum seeker to rwanda in be not bind on the uk and have no effect on person removal to rwanda although the amendment allow that minister may choose not to remove someone where interim measure have be indicate amendment make amendment to exist provision on the treatment of interim measure in the illegal migration act that be design to make it clear that the secretary of state immigration officer and the court must not have regard to interim measure in relation to removal to rwanda as we have be discuss these interim measure be make under rule of the rule of procedure of the european court of human rights and therefore do not form part of the text of the convention ratify by the uk however the court the body that determine the meaning of the convention have hold consistently that fail to comply with interim measure amount to breach of article of the convention itself the obligation not to hinder in any way the right to bring claim before the court therefore any decision of minister not to comply with interim measure would be inconsistent with the uk obligation under the convention the legal advice that the home affairs committee have receive be that the amendment before we this afternoon would therefore put the uk directly in conflict with the european court of human rights worryingly there have also be report today in the medium that the government be consider amend the civil service code to require civil servant to ignore interim measure from the court the general secretary of the fda have describe that as madness interestingly there may be some synergy here with the minister approach because understand that when he be solicitor general he back the attorney general advice state that ignore rule order would breach international law and that the government should not even indicate that they would refuse to comply amendment and new clause and relate to cost and want to look at another aspect miss from the bill and deserving of some scrutiny how much this policy will cost want to speak to those proposal particularly because of what have happen recently with the attempt by the home affairs committee and public accounts committee to find out about the cost of the rwanda policy there be far too much that we do not know about how much policy will cost and how much taxpayer money be go to be spend that be why new clause which would require the secretary of state to promptly notify parliament of any payment make under the rwanda treaty have merit hope that the minister will look carefully at that new clause it be why amendment require the publication of full impact assessment on the cost involve in removal to rwanda and publication of the financial memorandum sign with rwanda also carry great merit as be say the home affairs committee and the public accounts committee have find it very difficult to get basic financial information from the government on the rwanda scheme which be why new clause be also worthy of the minister careful consideration new clause would place the monitor committee for the rwanda treaty on statutory footing which would enable great oversight of the implementation of the treaty crucially it would ensure that parliament can do its fundamental job of scrutinise government policy as the home affairs committee spelt out month ago in our report which quote from early dangerous channel crossing will stop only when we have the evidence drive fully test policy initiative have talk about and when they be properly cost it seem to that that be plainly not the case at the moment that be crucial for we not only to deliver policy that stop small boat but more widely to ensure the responsible and effective use of public money it be important to remember that when the rwanda scheme be announce the permanent secretary at the home office require ministerial direction from the home secretary to implement the policy as the permanent secretary judge he still hold the same view that there be no evidence that the scheme would constitute value for money on that basis one might think that the government would be keen to demonstrate exactly how much public money they be spend to allay fear that the money be not be well spend be very concerned about the position they have get themselves into as we still do not know how much will be pay to rwanda in the final two year of the migration and economic development partnership or the per person cost of relocate an individual to rwanda the most substantive update we have receive recently on the cost of the scheme come about by accident because someone apparently muck up and publish detail in the international monetary fund board paper we find out about that unwitting disclosure in similarly haphazard way with late night letter from the permanent secretary to myself and my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier the chair of the public accounts committee which he then post on the home office website it appear that rwandan mp be able to find out exactly how much money the british government be pay for the scheme but british mp be not allow to have the same information make available to we unless it be disclose seemingly by mistake what we do know be that follow the million pay to rwanda in the financial year there be an additional payment of million in april and furth million will be pay in the financial year as have say the deal with rwanda be for five year and the government be still not willing to tell we exactly how much be pledge in those final two year as for the money pay to rwanda already we now have some information be grateful that the minister for counter illegal migration be able to provide some information in letter which the home affairs committee have publish today it set out how the million be be spend say be spend on education on infrastructure on job creation on health on agriculture and on information and communication technology we know that the government have also pledge to pay rwanda certain amount in relation to each asylum seeker remove there but yet again we do not know how much that will be all we have be able to glean from the home office be from the economic impact assessment to the illegal migration bill publish at the tail end of its progress through parliament which estimate that the cost of relocate single individual seek asylum to third country rwanda would be per person we be tell that that represent additional cost incur relative to process an individual through the current migration system understand from previous immigration ministers that the cost of process an individual in the united kingdom be around so there be quite differential between and it be not just those core cost that we be unclear about there be multiple layer of other possible probable and prescribed payment involve in the delivery of the policy that we have not be give any detail on for instance the treaty with rwanda establish new appeal body for individual apply for asylum that will be staff by judge from we be tell mix of nationality will the united kingdom be pay for that new international appeal body and its staffing if so how much will that be the treaty also specify that any person send to rwanda will be entitle to permanent residence permit this deal with the refoulement issue that the supreme court be concern about and it mean that person will stay in rwanda even if their asylum claim be unsuccessful we do not know what the financial implication of that be for the british taxpayer and what payment will be pay if any to the rwandan government in connection with those unsuccessful asylum application the treaty also specify that the initial asylum decision will be make by individual who be appropriately train and that for the first six month no claim will be reject unless advice have be take from seconded independent expert will the uk be provide any additional money to rwanda to train these decision maker and employ these independent expert the treaty guarantee free legal advice to claimant during the asylum process will the uk be make any payment to rwanda to back up that guarantee again we have not have anything from ministers to tell we this basic information to enable we to effectively scrutinise the policy that be also before the announcement that be make in the write ministerial statement yesterday where the lord chancellor set out that there will be low level judge appoint to the upper tribunal in the united kingdom to hear appeal quickly think that that be concession to conservative members who be very concerned about the number of appeal that might flow from the bill do hear the minister on the news this morning be ask about the cost of the judge and he be not able to say what that cost be again that be another factor that we need to consider when we be look at the value for money of this policy so give the failure that have talk about in relation to transparency and give the resistance that the home affairs and the public accounts committees have encounter in get more detail on the cost of the rwanda scheme amendment and new clause would be very helpful to parliament in get that information those be the main point that want to raise today but again reiterate that huge amount of political capital and parliamentary time be be spend on this bill what we do know and what the home affairs committee say month ago be that we still do not have the evidence that this bill will actually do what the government think it will do which be to deter people from get in small boat and cross the channel there be huge amount of resource go into this but as say at the start there must be range of initiative to deal with illegal migration there be no one magic policy that the government can use to stop the problem that we have with small boat hope the minister will take that into account in his closing comment may start by draw the committee attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests the ruislip northwood and pinner constituency be part of north west london that have be shape by generation of refugee start in the period around the second world war with large member of european jews flee persecution successive wave of people have come from across the world find refuge and become part of our community understandably have lot of view to share not just about this safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill but about previous legislation that we have have on the issue of migration although will focus my contribution on the amendment around the role of the european convention and the european court of human rights it seem to that in debate which at time have become quite philosophical there be wide recognition among our constituent that share sovereignty be often in practice great sovereignty be big fan of those fine british philosopher hobbes and locke who talk about the social contract it be clear that when we work closely with our neighbour we achieve the most effective measure against widespread illegal and irregular migration flow we have already see effective work with the french authority to tackle the activity of some of the gang in northern france which have contribute to bring down the number cross the channel in my contribution will attempt to add some further evidence to our deliberation in way that hope will help encourage ministers and to emphasise my support for take forward the bill in its unamended form as know the government seek to achieve when we look at the role of sheer sovereignty many example well beyond that of the european court and the european convention on human right have significant bearing on the issue we look at for example the united nations convention on the law of the sea which set out the responsibility that the united kingdom and other have in the english channel in respect of refugee boat that have frustrate the view of past home secretaries about how we might specifically tackle that issue but we have yet to see great deal of debate in this chamber about why we should repudiate that convention despite the fact that the international maritime organisation be base just across the river the international tribunal that deal with the convention be base in hamburg and could similarly be describe as foreign court indeed our own judicial committee of the privy council act as the supreme court of appeal for number of country and jurisdiction around the world that be not part of the united kingdom and that be not subject to uk law indeed despite the fact that both the european convention and our own law prohibit the death penalty our own privy council committee draw from parliamentarian in the united kingdom have hear appeal such as the chandler case of regard the death penalty in trinidad and tobago it be clear that there be long and establish history of nation come together to establish international convention process and tribunal to administer the law in the interest of not only our harmonious relationship with each other but the long term and great benefit of our citizen in respect of that particular problem it be clear that the work do by the late james brokenshire when he be the minister deal with illegal migration to secure in particular the port and railhead in northern france have contribute to the problem we face today in that the people smuggler have nowhere else to go other than small boat which the bill aim to stop good deal have be say about the good way we can deal with the role of the european convention on human right in the operation of the bill and other matter arise from it we know the echr be very broad organisation it come into being after the second world war as we have hear my argument for why we should reject the amendment to its role and in particular those around interim measure be that we already have an extensive series of lever that we can exercise to shape thing indeed the reason those interim measure exist be not merely that judge in the court decide they would like to have they but because parliamentarian from the uk and other member state other politician ministers and governments have argue for that court to take on great role over the year in response to the challenge some of those challenge have affect for example british citizen catch up in the conflict in ukraine where those interim measure have potentially influence the safe return of those people to the united kingdom we have the council of ministers the directly appoint member of our government who sit together and determine what the priority of that convention and court should be we have the parliamentary assembly good deal have be say about the role of the judge and it be worth remember at this point that the judge of our supreme court in the united kingdom and indeed our entire judicial process be completely free of political interference the judge of the european court of human rights be directly elect by parliamentarian from their member state indeed the legal committee of the european convention on human right in the parliamentary assembly be chair by my hon friend the member for christchurch sir christopher chope who would hardly describe as bourgeois liberal like my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill think its characterisation as foreign court be no more accurate than it be to say that the international tribunal for the law of the sea be foreign court or indeed that our judicial committee of the privy council be foreign court when it deal with matter at the request of other jurisdiction which it do on regular basis have serve on the congress of local and regional authorities of europe the local government element that look at how those law be hand down and implement in practice it be clear to that we have significant number of diplomatic and other lever that we can exercise if we feel that the court need to move its practice in different direction it be also clear that the court have already begin that process in the light of comment from the united kingdom and other my argument be that it be in our interest because it benefit our citizen and our country to maintain our membership of the european convention on human right the fact that we maintain our active support for and membership of that organisation underpin much of our public influence in the world and give we the moral authority to ask other to do thing we can seek to address those issue use our elect member of this house who sit in those assembly our elect politician who sit in other assembly such as the congress and our academic and appointee who sit on body such as the venice commission which advise on the gold standard for the conduct of election we can use all those lever at our disposal to convey our view to the court and the convention organisation about how we should proceed in respect of the judge themselves it be very positive to hear from other hon member who have be part of that process because we know that contrary to what have sometimes be say there be two stage process for someone to be candidate to be judge they have to meet the requirement for international judicial appointment in term of both legal qualification and relevant experience and they be then put forward for election by the politician who place they on the court their decision certainly in respect of the so call pyjama injunction seem to be very little different from those that magistrate such as and other across this country will be ask to take on matter of judicial warrant we be ask to make decision to enable an intervention to happen at moment of urgency and then in due course there be long period of opportunity for that to be consider by the court and all other who may have stake in it be so pleased that we be hear this very clear explanation of the court and the judge after what have be say in this debate it be very refreshing to hear thank the hon gentleman who also think be lawyer do not know if he be lefty lawyer but think he be lawyer be grateful to the right hon lady be not lawyer but serve as magistrate in this country it be always my pleasure to say that belong to that even more despised race of human being the tory mps and that be formerly banker think we be right to have some degree of concern in respect of what be say in the bill and the amendment about the human rights act this house need to strike the correct balance it be fundamental principle of british justice which date back at least as far as the saxons that people may not be subject to penalty unless they have have the opportunity to be bring before court properly compose judicial authority therefore we should be concern at the idea that in the united kingdom we would exempt group of people from access to our law on the basis of the method of their arrival here however we need to balance that against the fact that people be die in the english channel drown in cold water and gang be profit hugely from that which be fuel all kind of other type of crime to an extent we be victim of our previous success in that the improved security in northern france have create and massively exacerbate the problem we face that for balance up the risk to loss of human right we need to ensure that we have really effective deterrent in place to address the problem that have arise from that early success it be and remain my view which express in the debate on the then illegal migration bill that the point at which we will establish full control of our border be the point at which we add an asylum visa to all the other type of visa we have so that there be single safe and legal route control by the british government and the rule set by this house and if people arrive on our shore to claim asylum without have gain that permission first they be automatically ineligible regardless of their method of arrival that would mirror the process we already have in place for people who want to come here to work to study to marry or to invest in the united kingdom we still have not yet put in place an effective process and system that would enable we to do that it be clearly crucial as the weather will soon begin to improve the smuggler will soon be look to invest in their stock boat and more people life will soon be put at risk that we keep our eye on the objective of return to something more like the syrian vulnerable person resettlement scheme which be describe by the unhcr as gold standard of international refugee resettlement that be the model on which we base our afghan resettlement scheme whatever logistical problem that experience and this house have recognise it as the way in which the uk wish to play part in refugee resettlement around the world however we need to ensure that we deal with the specific problem that arise small boat in the channel for all the debate and well intentione argument that we have hear the bill in its unamended form strike the good balance available to address that particular problem and ensure that no one else die en route to seek asylum here in the united kingdom for that reason will support the bill unamended it be pleasure to follow the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds it be refreshing to hear somebody on the conservative benches talk up the merit of an asylum visa that would break the model of the people smuggle gang because it would give people safe and legal route and safety and certainty nobody need be exploit by pay over everything that they own to get into leaky dinghy in the channel if they could come here for safety and sanctuary by travel as any of we would travel understand from other in the committee that conservative members be quite keen to wind up the debate early tonight because they be go to burns supper be not sure whether that be true but it be certainly rumour that hear early it make think of some of the thing that robert burns be big fan of our national bard might have to say to the conservative party about the way in which it conduct its business let start with man inhumanity to man make countless thousand mourn commend to the committee the amendment table in my name as well as those table by my hon friend the member for glasgow north patrick grady and my hon and learn friend the member for edinburgh south west joanna cherry will first address clause on the disapplication of the human rights act that act be landmark legislation it be weave into the fabric of our devolved institution and it underpin the good friday agreement it should concern we all that government without any kind of mandate to do so start pick away the stitching the law society say that the exclusion of the human rights act to this extent be unprecedented speak of defend the right of people to migrate robert burns who have verse on just about everything have one on the right of highlander against their laird who be not allow they to migrate to canada he say they an be damn what right hae they to meat or sleep or light day far less to rich or freedom but what your lordship please to gie they we should give asylum seeker far more than this government think they have right to gie they disapplye section remove the obligation for court and immigration official to take into account human right when assess the safety of rwanda disapplye section limit the protection that court can provide disapplye section force court to ignore any european court of human rights ruling of rwanda as unsafe those be important protection not only do they ensure people safety from government but they act as check specifically on the home office home office that we know have long and consistent form in make serious mistake with long last and life change consequence one need only reflect on the legacy of windrush toeic the test of english for international communication and the highly skilled migrant scandal to know the scale of home office incompetence we need the court to offer protection against the home office instinct to deport first and ask question later amendment to in the name of the right hon member for newark robert jenrick make an already unjustifiable situation much much bad liberty have state that they effectively remove the possibility of secure any remedy much less an effective one for the breach or threaten breach of right arise from removal to rwanda on the basis that it be an unsafe country robert burns say in his slave lament tear from that lovely shore and must never see it more and alas be weary weary think we all feel that weariness about the circularity of the government ridiculous argument it be unsafe for the refugee who get to come here from rwanda but somehow it be safe enough for we to send people to rwanda it make absolutely no sense this government move of people to rwanda against their will be nothing but state sponsor people traffic this government be now in effect criminal gang move people across the world people move against their will with no regard to their safety and no recourse to appeal to country they do not know involve money and profit that sound like people smuggle to conservative members either can not see that or frankly just do not care because to they these be not really people who we be talk about they never have to see they they never have to engage with they they never have they cry across the desk in front of they at community hall on friday it be utterly despicable turn now to clause which deal with interim measure of the european court of human rights interim measure be important and accord to the court well establish practice apply only where there be an imminent risk of irreparable harm clause expand on the previous provision of the illegal migration act to ignore interim measure the provision that we pass under the illegal migration act be not even in force yet as mention yesterday it be only day since that act get royal assent but here we be this afternoon legislate yet again interim measure exist not just in international law but in our own domestic law as my hon and learn friend the member for edinburgh south west say they often happen late at night that be the nature of these thing they be last minute protection for people who have no other recourse or remedy they be not unusual but refuse to comply with they as the bill set out and as the right hon member for newark amendment demand would be clear and serious breach of international law no mere technicality here it would be serious breach of international law where do that leave we with the government of rwanda whose minister have be quite clear on the need for this agreement to be compliant with international law today the rwandan president paul kagame say to the guardian that there be limit for how long this can drag on and that he would be happy for the scheme to be scrap entirely the government be on very shaky ground here be the minister and the right hon member for newark really go to have we believe that we can cross our finger behind our back and nobody will know that the uk government break international law they be have we on what be particularly daft about clause be that the european court of human rights have already respond to the concern that uk ministers have raise in november last year the court provisionally adopt amendment to rule of its rule of court on the procedure for interim measure tighten up the circumstance and the procedure the court be also change the procedure that member after member howl about early on so that judge be no long anonymous do not know whether as result of the amendment conservative members have table those judge will be force to disclose their preferred nightwear perhaps that be matter of discretion the grievance that the right hon member for newark and the uk government and their back benchers howl about be be address which make this bill even more of waste of everybody time money and energy what damage do it do when the uk government continue to behave like petulant child rather than engage constructively with the international organisation of which they be part they send judge to the court they be part of this process it be not somebody else court it be our court we be part of it furthermore place all decision on compliance with an interim measure in the hand of minister be deeply worrying suggestion minister be far less appropriate than court maybe that minister will also be in their pyjama as they sign off batch of human cargo in the dead of night but since that will presumably be british minister in union jack pyjama rather than european judge in blue onesie with yellow star conservative members will probably think that be perfectly acceptable they care more about flag than about right and they have the cheek to call we nationalist deliberately breach international law be no long something we need assume minister of this particular government would in any way hesitate to do the law society of scotland have add to the criticism of that power say that it contradict the doctrine of the separation of power between the executive and the judiciary as the right hon and learn member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright point out such move would have serious foreign policy implication support the amendment table by the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael and while appreciate its intention it be hard not to feel that the amendment in the name of the official opposition be merely an attempt to water the clause down by have minister consult with their attorney general give that the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman be the attorney general before be home secretary and then sign the amendment table today that undermine human right be not sure that be the protection that the official opposition think it be note the various amendment and the effort of the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland and his colleague to amend this bill but think we all know that they be on hiding to nothing move on to clause the extent clause the snp have be very clear very clear indeed that we do not believe in this cruel and unnecessary bill we do not support it and our attempt to decisively declare that this be not in scotland name come in the form of amendment and to in the name of my hon friend the member for glasgow north and my hon and learn friend the member for edinburgh south west they attempt to remove scotland from the territorial extent of the bill and to require the legislative consent of the scottish parliament as my hon and learn friend point out early this have significant impact on the ability of scottish court and our legal system to work effectively we have ask for the legislative consent of the scottish parliament before this legislation come into force it be gey chilly in scotland today but can say to the minister that hell would freeze over before he obtain our legislative consent to this bill move to clause on commencement amendment seek to separate the treaty from this bill and ensure that the treaty itself receive the scrutiny it deserve give the significance of the provision make in that treaty do not know how many colleague have examine the treaty but think it be quite right and quite appropriate that this house should do so in debate as the home affairs committee have ask lastly because of the way that this strange process be lay out move to clause it come last of course it do in this topsy turvy world of westminster the principle of the bill remain abhorrent to we international law be not something that state should disregard when it inconvenience they again burns have an important principle in his letter to mrs frances anna dunlop he say whatever mitigate the woe or increase the happiness of other this be my criterion for goodness and whatever injure society at large or any individual in it this be my measure of iniquity this bill be riddle with iniquity and harm we rightly call out state that abuse human right ignore their court and treat people in dehumanising manner and there be absolutely no justification for the uk do so it be merely bogeyman to distract the public from the chaos that the conservatives have preside over all these year our amendment and to seek to assert the importance of comply with our international obligation to abide by the human rights act it be astonishing astonishing that we be require to do so but as the bill preface set out the bill be very much incompatible with convention right and this tory government wish to have we carry on regardless the right sally foster fulton the moderator of the general assembly of the church of scotland have be among many voice call out this appalling legislation she say this bill threaten to destroy that the uk reputation reduce our ability to speak with any credibility on injustice and human right abuse across the world it also set worrying precedent that fundamental human right can be erode and deny to some far be it from to rush to the defence of the uk international reputation but urge member to consider the wide implication of this cruel policy it be not domestic it be international and it have wide reach implication scotland want no part of this fail expensive and cruel rwanda plan we look forward instead to the day that we be no long beholden to this insular and damage uk immigration policy and to this parliament that do not speak in our name we want scotland to take her place in the world with all of the responsibility that that entail in the international community to finish again with burns for that an that it comin yet for that that man to man the world shall brother be for that it have be very long debate have listen with intent to everybody who have speak and admit to learn quite lot today unfortunately not everybody who have speak be still here to listen to although have listen to they but that tend to happen quite lot in this house people speak for very long time at the beginning and unfortunately they never get to listen to other it be mainly lawyer who have speak often think before become member of parliament that this place would be good if full of lawyer that be what it should be about we be make law so maybe that be right be correct by my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg though do not know be go to speak with he today but he tell it be wonderful that people like yourself nick be here after listen to what have hear today and have listen to what have hear with regard to the recent post office case it seem to that lawyer be just able to talk at this level continually back and forth and back and forth in the post office case million be apparently give to look after the postmaster and million of it be spend on lawyer what be try to get at be that for all of the talking that have happen the people who put we here be still struggle like mad to understand why when we put people on plane somebody from strasbourg can say no they do have to go and we all watch aghast that this be happen they struggle to understand why as be mention in the telegraph last week someone who have be catch and convict for produce of cannabis could not be deport because he could no long speak his mother tongue they can not understand why we can not deport an immigrant who have take million from organised crime and try to smuggle it out of this country because of his human right human right be obviously extremely important and anyone who mention come out of the echr automatically get lambast by many people on the opposition benches but unfortunately the people who put we here can not understand why these thing be happen whatever happen these judge that we be talk about who we have supposedly elect need to come to doncaster and see what be happen there as say in my speech before christmas we should be able to have conversation like this without be heckled and without be call out on twitter every time we say this that be because of the nastiness that come from the left which stop these conversation happen it stop we be able to have decent conversation and debate listen to my colleague who be sit on the back row and they speak lot of sense they really do and take it on board but have hon friend who sit with who want to use these amendment to tighten up the bill when hear about what we be try to do have to agree with they that it need tighten up because we can not keep on put people on plane and then take they back off again we can not keep on let people come to this country and abuse the system use taxpayer money to defend they while we be give they board and lodging in hotel next door to school we have get to stop this happening support the amendment because want to help the government with their promise to stop the boat if we stop the boat we stop the tragedy that be happen out at sea five people die last week we need to make sure that that do not happen again we need to stop the boat because we be put here by the taxpayer of this country by my and our constituent and we need to make sure that they be get value for money for every pound that be take in their tax when we speak about human right we have to remember the right of the british people who put we here will support these amendment because have to do whatever can to make sure that the people who put here be treat fairly and their right be consider above anybody else it be pleasure to contribute to this incredibly important debate be very happy to sign the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick amendment to and to be also happy to support his amendment and the amendment from my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash yesterday have concern about the bill as it stand want exactly the same thing as the minister which be for the boat to stop and they will only stop if we have deterrent have not see an example across the world of this situation be properly deal with without deterrent and it be critically important that we have one it concern that the exceptionally narrow ground for individual appeal will not be as narrow as the government perhaps hop that be potentially why we hear talk about the judge yesterday which cause some alarm in some respect why be some of we on the government benches so cynical why do some of we have so many concern that this bill may not work in the way we hope it be experience and the fact that we have vote for two bills before the nationality and borders act and the illegal migration act that we hop would work comprehensively but have not do so it be right that the government highlight the reduction in small boat crossing by third but it be nowhere near enough we will not be thank by the people of this country for not smash those crossing comprehensively will my hon friend give way will not be give way will be support amendment in relation to the human rights act will also support the amendment of my right hon friend the member for newark on the echr remember vividly the situation in june also remember the referendum we have in where the majority of people in this country vote to leave the european union they do so because they want the parliament of this country to be fully sovereign they do not want it to be frustrate by foreign organisation whether the eu or the echr the way in which that happen in june to policy that have majority support from most of the people in this country be devastating more generally it be important that we respect the discussion on second reading when the prime minister say that he want sound international legal argument for amendment that bar have be meet and my right hon friend the member for newark have explain how that be the case fundamentally have regretfully come to the conclusion as member of parliament that we should leave the echr my prediction be that in time we will many of the debate associate with the echr be similar to the debate around brexit those who originally want to leave the eu be brand extremist and minority the same argument be make such as let reform it from the inside we will try that again with the echr and think we will be unsuccessful it be the supranational nature of the echr that be deeply uncomfortable with we have already see how that operate some member have make the point that it be not foreign court because we have ownership of it people make the same argument about the european union and the meps go to brussels ultimately when it come to that decisive referendum most people who vote on that question disagree with that view and we rightly leave the eu it be not right and the issue of the echr open up serious democratic deficit give that we leave the eu the principle for why we do be live in this debate today and we must listen on the issue of illegal migration like on the issue of net legal migration we be play with fire the level of frustration feel by million of people in the country be extreme and the warning be there from across of the world about what happen if mainstream party do not deal with people legitimate concern about mass migration if the conservative party do not responsibly and robustly deal with it and finally stop the boat the warning sign be there for what might happen just to take my hon friend point with which completely agree even far do he agree that the fact that often be not mention be that we be small island with huge population and an entire infrastructure create in the century for all these reason we have that much more pressure on our social service our infrastructure our planning and so forth my hon friend be absolutely right there be intolerable pressure be place on this country through mass legal migration and illegal migration it be right that more and more of my constituent be see the link between that issue and pressure on public service strain on social cohesion and other thing immigration at sustainable level with integration be force for good immigration at unsustainable level without integration cause intolerable trouble for the people of this country that be something they want to guard against that view be hold not just by my hon friend by many in the house and by many in the country but by many country in europe mass migration be now see as an issue of salience by country right across europe and the wide world he be far from alone he be speak for the people we have hear lot of argument about the echr and about winston churchill form it that have be defeat time and again but continue to be wheel out by opposition members do not agree do not think for moment that if winston churchill be alive today he would be comfortable with the way in which today echr operate and its supranational nature ultimately applaud the prime minister desire to stop the boat but it be not enough just to try and it be not enough to be just or of the way there we need to be of the way there we have see previously that any chink in the armour of any bill design to tackle this issue will be ruthlessly exploit we share the prime minister desire and we want to work with he to get bill that we can all unite behind to stop the boat immigration be not just an important issue honestly believe that it have become an existential issue ultimately it be important that we unite behind the bill but it need to work the question be do we think that the bill will work or not do we think it can be strengthen for all those reason will vote for the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark with certain degree of pride believe in the sovereignty of this country believe in listen to the people of this country and believe in narrow the unhealthy disconnect there be between the view of the majority of people on immigration and where we be at the moment be sorry to have get to the debate bit late will talk in general about some of the amendment be sympathetic to lot of they always listen to my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick who be always eloquent on this subject and probably right in what he say but will explain why despite my concern about the echr will not support his amendment and the other amendment that be because we be deal with the art of the possible as well as the art of what be right and wrong listen to my hon friend the member for ipswich tom hunt talk in apocalyptic term but he be right to say that there be great deal of angst and concern accord to the recent poll in my patch like in his more than want people send back without right of appeal be therefore sympathetic towards that argument be also sympathetic to the concern of my right hon friend the member for newark that the system will not work but we be deal with the art of the possible and when my hon friend the member for ipswich say that we need certainty and not or get bit concerned do my hon friend recognise that we should be focus on the practicality of what be achievable and recognise the tension in broad debate between what we can legislate for and what in reality will work within the limitation and the context be that in respect of the court or colleague in this place as well as what will work for rwanda absolutely if the rwandans turn round and say we ve change our mind we will be in world of pain trust the government think they have be naive in the past but for government members to work on the basis that we will not trust our own government and give they zero credit be go way too far in the other direction my hon friend be make series of important point do he agree that one of the reason why our constituent be concerned to see the bill pass be the enormous impact that very high level of migration have have on local government finance give that he represent an island one of the local authority in the south east of england that volunteer to be asylum dispersal area do he agree that other part of the country might do well to step up to the plate too my hon friend make good point other part of the country would do well to step up to the plate thank he for that comment return to what my hon friend the member for ipswich say about an or solution versus solution as far as can see there be four outcome for today which want to discuss in brief detail first the bill work in wonderful way and everything be perfect do think that be likely hope it be live in hope but share my hon friend concern turn around and face the committee be so sorry thank the hon lady option be that some of the legal appeal work and some do not but we begin to get the plane move sort of this summer that be reasonable success and we be head in the right direction with other measure option be that it do not work we get some brownie point for try but it be bad outcome option be that we vote down the bill today there be no flight at all the left be in clover and the liberal elite be smile all the way to the next election hundred colleague on the government benches will return and there will be no one to challenge wake or large scale illegal immigration whatsoever what will make the liberal elite the happy will be to see the bill strangle in the court because of its weakness what do my hon friend think about the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick who perhaps know this issue well than anyone else my hon friend make point about the happiness of the liberal elite but he be give subjective opinion about what he think they would love actually what they would love most of all be for the bill to die tonight we must get the bill through to give we any form of chance as say there be four option option it work perfectly it may not option it be likely to work in part we can live with that option it fail that be bad but we be try option we kill the bill tonight we can all go and look for new job that be what we be face want to see my hon friend and many other return but we need to give people the good chance of deliver on the bill the good chance of that be to try to push the government in conservative direction give my hon friend that but only as far as they can go be on the same side of the argument as my hon friend on this but my difference be that will give the government the benefit of the doubt to get the bill through third reading we have to get the bill through even if my hon friend do not vote against it but be willing to abstain that will be an improvement be it not important to note that if the bill be kill off on third reading there be no opportunity to introduce another bill to address this issue in this parliament we will be stick in the current situation go into the election thank my hon friend for that important point in the whatsapp group in which we be chat about this early one of our north east colleague post the idea that we could have new bill find that to be truly live in la la land the idea that everyone on the government benches would agree to new bill once we have kill this bill be for the bird it be this bill or no bill it be this bill or no chance we have to face reality my hon friend the member for ipswich speak eloquently about the echr and want to touch on it because it be important be not fan of it our freedom and our liberty be not because of the echr they be not because bulgarian judge get out of bed at two in the morning to strike down democratically elect law there be nobody in this house as willing as to rewrite our relationship with the echr but this bill be not the time to do it this be an argument for our manifesto but if my hon friend be to suggest that what we need to do be make the echr advisory so that we fundamentally change our relationship and vote in parliament can overrule the echr he will find no big champion than in the same way we could look to review the human rights act be as bored as he of hear ministers say in private we can do this because of the human rights act pull my hair out we be in government we should change the human rights act if we do not like it we should not use it as an excuse for inaction thank my hon friend for give way be listen to his point with interest as one who could be see as one of the architect of the rwanda scheme along with my hon friend the member for corby tom pursglove and my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel would have prefer to see the bill with the amendment from my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash and agree with many of the point make by my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick but while would prefer the bill to go far it be bill that could still work agree and thank my hon friend for his comment if there be chance of it move far then yes but do not think there be the issue be it be this bill or no bill it be this bill or no chance to return to what my hon friend the member for ipswich tom hunt be say about the echr yes accept and agree so let we reorient our relationship with the echr let we reorient our relationship with these european law let we look again do not like judicial activism any more than anyone else on the conservative benches judicial activism be the enemy of democratic accountability if we have foreign judge who be willing to get up in the middle of the night and overrule law pass in this house by this democratic body answerable and sovereign to the british people so let we talk about change the echr but we should not be do it now on precisely that point be there not far practical addition to my hon friend argument which be that override the echr in this instance as oppose to follow broad debate may lead to the rwandan side be less enthusiastic and pull out of the deal practically send we back to square one thank my right hon friend for that intervention it be good to see he on rule the pyjama injunction where judge get out of bed in the middle of the night do not even know why our government be still agree to abide by these rule as far as can see it should be matter of principle that rule injunction be advisory until such time as we wish to adopt they maybe the minister have something he would like to tell we about that it would be wonderful if he do as part of the conversation we be in period of flux as our electorate rightly become more concerned about issue relate to crime sovereignty and legal and illegal immigration we start to talk about our relationship with the european human right convention be up for that but now be not necessarily the time to do that my hon friend be make an extremely important point before he move on to the last part of his speech want to press he little far on the echr as well as the comment make by my hon friend the member for ipswich tom hunt do he recognise that some of the fundamental change in the amendment be so great that they warrant separate piece of legislation even if they be to come forward so that this house could consider they in full and in detail rather than they be attach to an extremely important bill where they could undermine its objective as well as detract from the wide debate on the echr quite agree think that we be in danger of reverse engineer load of opinion on the european convention on human right into single bill that be influence by the echr but be fundamentally about something else should like to see great debate about the echr should like to see great debate about the relationship between our law and what we do about international convention be mindful and respectful of they while at the same time understand certainly this be my view that our freedom our privilege and our right as briton do not come from post war european document we should remember where the echr come from it be effectively write in part by ourselves to help europe to recover from the appalling destruction cause by fascism but also the threat of totalitarian socialism and totalitarian communism since then we have see what be good document partly because it be write by we whose purpose be to help europe to recover and get its legal and political dignity back become target of politicised judicial activism believe that something that be target of politicised judicial activism should not necessarily be overrule our own tradition but do find tendency for that to happen my hon friend be once again make some powerful point do he recognise that the number of interim measure that be hand down in respect of the uk be extremely small in fact in some year no such interim measure be grant none the less we need to review the way in which measure that be not specifically describe in the original document that underpin the european convention on human right have evolve it be therefore right that although it remain entirely non bind and how to respond to those measure remain decision for government minister we need to ensure that our court and our system understand the role that parliament expect they to play my hon friend have make valuable point and one that be about to come on to why do some people in this country and some political group generally on the left idealise international court as if they be font of olympian wisdom when in my view many of their judgment be highly political and highly tendentious they seem to to constitute an exercise in study disrespect for the english common law which consider to be one of the great wonder of human civilisation and achievement along with monotheism and one or two other thing we seem to be allow the international court to overrule those extraordinary achievement all these great judge from on high who do not come from traditional judicial system anywhere near as strong or as noble as ours have be agree with the basic thrust that it be the bill or nothing but may gently say something to my hon friend about the european court of human rights if he look carefully at its case law he will see that british common law tradition have in fact have significant impact on the jurisprudence of that court it do not follow the pure civil law system of the continent as those who have serve on the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe will know it have actually move to hybrid system largely because of the influence of british jurist my hon friend have make an excellent point he be of course an eminent lawyer and frankly be not hon member there be still time be tempt to say will stop dig my hon friend be right in say that we have have an influence but understand from what have see and read that there have also be the influence of far more rationalist system on our own common law and do not consider the impact on eu law and casework on our system to have be entirely beneficial and entirely helpful be glad that my hon friend be make this point do not blame he because it be easy to elide the two now but eu law and the operation of the luxembourg court be very different discipline from what happen in strasbourg that court be enjoin to interpret eu law and what it say be gospel and we have to follow it that be not the case with the strasbourg court my hon friend have talk about case law will not put he on the spot too much but can he name the case that have pose problem where be they can help my hon friend the judgment in the hirst case the prisoner voting case be pretty poor in fact it be bad judgment then there be the judgment about whole life sentence which we sort out in the court of appeal problem solve the abu qatada case be long saga but we sort that out too those be the only three problem we have have in year and that do not amount to hill of bean be delighted that my right hon and learn friend have intervene because those be exactly the three point that be about to make to complete my case thank he for do that for accept the point that he make but also accept that we be sovereign parliament and that our relationship with many of these institution have change do not think our relationship necessarily reflect that change will leave it at that but accept his point and also the wisdom with which he make it at this point unless have any more intervention shall wind up rise order just before we proceed and call jerome mayhew can gently say that it have not escape the notice of the chair that significant number of member have wander in after many hour of debate during which they have not be here and then seek to participate technically the chair have no power to control that but member must understand that we deprecate this take very dim view of it as bad manner hope that be clearly understand the hon member for ipswich tom hunt sit in his place for five hour wait to speak believe that any other member who wish to speak in debate should afford the committee the same courtesy thank you sir roger should start my speech with personal apology for not have be here for the full course of this debate very much want to be here but have duty in westminster hall in two debate during the course of the afternoon which prevent from take full role in this debate be grateful to you for nevertheless agree to call in what be obviously very important debate have hear sufficient of the back and forth of the debate to know that there have be criticism from the opposition benches that the bill go too far and that there be even some word of advice and criticism on these benches that it perhaps do not go far enough before get down into the nitty gritty of the amendment it be worth go back to base principle and look at the fundamental of why the bill be necessary in the first place it be without doubt that every member of this house irrespective of their party loyalty must agree that the current position in relation to small boat cross the channel be deeply wrong and have to be address what be happen at the moment be just not fair we have see the small boat programme on our television screen for the last two or three year ever since we plug the last gap in our external border by make it hard for illegal immigrant to get on to lorry or on to the eurostar that go back almost decade in fact the business model be such that where we restrict one point of illegal access the model will seek out the next weak point in the border of our country and right now that be small boat cross the channel however these be not individual buy dinghy and set off across the channel we all know that this be massive commercial opportunity for organise criminal gang make mass of money ten of million of pound from the misery of other that money be go into organised crime which then find vent in other crime both in europe and in our own country criminal gang be impose violence on the vulnerable people who be then exploit by they in their crossing of the channel it must be right that any responsible government would take step to challenge set of circumstance where vulnerable people be be expose to risk and violence not only the risk of death as they cross the channel my hon friend the member for don valley nick fletcher say that there be five death just last week as result of this dangerous process but the violence of the criminal gang impose their will on these migrant do the hon gentleman not agree that the massive amount of money waste on the rwanda plan would be well spend on create safe legal route and clear the backlog so that those flee persecution can build well life in country that be proud of its humanitarian action as so many have in ealing southall be grateful for the hon gentleman intervention which allow to highlight the government success in reduce the backlog as the prime minister outline at prime minister question do not shy away from the point that the rwanda scheme be expensive if the cost be calculate as the amount spend per person fly to rwanda it would be very high cost indeed but that be not the point of the scheme the idea of the scheme be not that every single person who illegally cross our border will be ship to rwanda but that it will act as an effective deterrent if we send few people to rwanda the criminal gang and more importantly the people who pay they large sum of money will get the message that pay the criminal gang to be ferry across the channel be no long an effective way to gain access to the united kingdom if that be successful as believe it will be it will be very sound use of money because it will not only prevent additional cost to our society and public service but will protect the life of some of the most vulnerable people in the world while right gross unfairness in our asylum system my hon friend be make an extremely important point particularly on the cost be he aware that the president of rwanda have be report as say that the uk could well be refund if all the resource be not use because of challenge along the way be not aware of that but it add grist to the mill and strength to the government argument for proceed with the rwanda policy my hon friend take an intervention from the hon member for ealing southall mr sharma who talk about safe and legal route one of the big problem be that we have not hear how many where from and what they would look like there be supposedly million displace people across the world if of they decide to come to the uk that is million people who have to be process and find country this be worldwide problem if we do it as an individual country we would create and facilitate problem not only on our shore but on the shore where we open those centre do he believe the opposition have plan for where the centre would be how they would be man how much they would cost and what those safe and legal route would look like especially when people be leave the safe country of france the phrase safe and legal route feel right do it it feel like we should be in favour of safe and legal route and speak personally think they be part of wide solution to immigration my hon friend say there may be up to million people currently seek asylum from memory think the figure from the united nations report be actually million my hon friend be make an excellent speech this bill be deal with lot of the pull factor at least it mention or imply approach those in more constructive and positive way know that he serve on the council of europe delegation on the push factor do he agree that this domestic policy should not be disaggregate from foreign policy and our overseas aid policy let we look at the example of sub saharan africa or the sahel where the french have recently exit or be about to do so and where the uk have an important counter terrorism presence in those place fragile state that be become fail state be cause more push factor in addition some adversary of this country such as russia through its proxy in africa be try to disrupt democratically elect government in order to create migration crisis they be happy to see people come up through north africa and into europe give his international experience do he agree that we have to have more holistic view of this policy in the context of global foreign policy be grateful to my right hon friend for those excellent point they highlight one reason why the merging of the department for international development with the foreign and commonwealth office to form the foreign commonwealth and development office have the potential to link those two area of policy the challenge with push factor be substantial and it be that they have only just start he be right to refer to malign actor such as russia in the short and medium term but there be much big factor that this house need to consider over the next to year climate change the likelihood be that there will be very significant mass migration from sub saharan africa when large area of country perhaps entire country may become functionally uninhabitable through water scarcity and heat what we have see currently in push factor will be nothing compare with what we see in the future so it behove we as responsible government to design and implement an immigration policy that be fit for purpose not just for now but for the future find it frustrating when people especially opposition members talk about the need for safe and legal route as statement of fact there be such route into the uk in the past decade there be currently nine which have be responsible for refugee come to this country since overall the number of refugee or people grant asylum in this country from be approach the population of manchester we be talk about number in the upper that be twice the size of the city of portsmouth when opposition member talk about the need for safe and legal route assume that none of they have any clue what they be talk about would my hon friend care to comment be pretty settle with that last sentence we have be place of safety for about from ukraine we have open our arm to some british national of hong kong descent we have have the syria programme which believe involve about and we have have the afghan resettlement programme which involve about to all those have be safe and legal route the big difference be that the british government represent the british people decide that those be the people we want to help they be the most vulnerable and we take the decision not criminal gang from abroad it be exactly that the british people decide do my hon friend believe that the right approach be for government to consult with local authority on how many asylum seeker and refugee they can support enable they to come up with number that parliament will be able to vote on that be pragmatic and practical while warm and welcome to those who need help my hon friend make another good point we must not forget that our asylum policy depend on the support and acceptance of our people if we have policy that be reject by people because they feel it be unfair and do not represent their view then we run the risk of throw the baby of asylum and welcome people with vulnerability from around the world out with the bath water the bill help to maintain welcome stance to asylum seeker who be decide on by the government while maintain public support for the policy as whole rise as the author of the safe and legal route amendment to the illegal migration bill will shed little light on this matter my hon friend be right that we have generous safe and legal route scheme already but they be mostly limit to set group of people the importance of the scheme the government be work on be that those people who be genuine asylum seeker and genuinely flee persecution can be accommodate in some way but those scheme would be subject to cap although there be hundred of thousand million who might want to come here the illegal migration act set cap for safe and legal route so that it be the number of people we can cope with and they be the right people we will take in the most vulnerable people separate they out from the people who have no credible case for come to the united kingdom which be why the bill be so important be in accord with every point my hon friend make there be real anger on the doorstep be lucky to represent the seat of broadland and fakenham in norfolk and be knock on door just before christmas of the or so door knock on have decent conversation with constituent this be rural norfolk but of those conversation raise illegal migration as key issue that be the reality of the view of the people represent we would be mad in this house if we do not accurately reflect those view will take final intervention will my hon friend join in pay tribute to the east of england local government association and the east of england strategic migration partnership they have do amazing work support the resettlement of british passport holder from hong kong syrians come through the syrian resettlement scheme and ukrainians come through the homes for ukraine scheme do he agree that it would be more acceptable to his constituent to hear that those individual have come to the uk through arrangement agree with local authority that have the capacity to support they rather than as witness when visit the jungle camp in calais through rich smuggler who say to people that the more they can pay the more likely they be to be able to break into the uk through backdoor my hon friend be exactly right my constituent be generous minded and welcoming but they do not like inherent unfairness typically those who arrive be young man age to where be the woman and child those young man be relatively rich because they have be able to pay to to the smuggler worse still they may be indenture and end up in slave labour try to pay back debt that will never be repay we have terrible situation that need to be address the government have take effective action that we can see in hard datum from last year not just because say it at time when migration to the european union be go up by about third and to mediterranean country by fully last year the suite of intervention that the government have already make have be so effective that they have reduce migration in this country by which be over third that be not because of rwanda but in addition to rwanda it be because we have increase french patrol on the coast by and we have track down boat supply in place like romania remove the ability of the gang to physically get people across the channel we have increase raid on illegal workplace which be part of the pull factor for illegal migrant more importantly we have cut deal with albania which have mean that whereas the year before about people who come from albania claim asylum with the return policy recognise that albania be safe country just as rwanda be by the way the number of potential migrant come across the channel have decrease by more than if we want an example of why the rwanda policy should work we need only look at albania and at the result that this government have already achieve commend the government for their hard work the hard yard and the incremental gain which show that although we be not all the way there we be see reduction already and count our proposal in this bill for the rwanda relocation will make an enormous difference we have hear from government lawyer that the current process be likely to reduce the number of appeal by yes there may be the odd one who continue to appeal but that last minute process of repeat appeal will be remove that be why do not feel the necessity to support the amendment and will be support the government with your permission sir roger may on behalf of his majesty government pass on my sincere condolence to the family and friend of sir tony lloyd the former member of parliament order be sorry to have to interrupt on such sensitive issue but mr speaker intend to make statement about that later be very grateful for that guidance may start by turn to those who have contribute to this debate thank my hon friend the member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton for his powerful point challenge forensic and learn point he once again question what solution be be offer by the labour party and he be right to do so answer come there none may thank my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes as so often he debate in poetry and will come back to some of his remark in due course also thank the chair of the home affairs committee the right hon member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson she be right to ensure that she do not make second read speech but she do mention one or two amendment and other matter and shall turn to those in due course thank my hon friend the member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds he be always thoughtful measure and so often right and be grateful to he for his contribution and also for his intervention during the latter stage of this debate the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss cite robert burns and ask what he would have to say to those on the conservative benches my hon friend and neighbour the hon member for north dorset simon hoare rather cheekily from sedentary position suggest that robert burns might say to conservative members how can join you that be not the gist or the thrust of her speech but it be cheeky intervention that enjoy none the less shall turn to her amendment in due course listen to my hon friend the member for don valley nick fletcher as always do and hope to be able to turn to some of the point that he make and hopefully allay some of his fear he say sometimes the chamber empty or be not as full when he speak that sometimes happen to ministers as well that not everyone be back when they be respond to member contribution but my hon friend be here and be grateful to he for sit through so much of this debate and for his characteristic courtesy my hon friend the member for ipswich tom hunt speak with passion as he always do and be grateful to he for his contribution my hon friend the member for isle of wight bob seely speak at some length and be grateful to he for that he delve into the principle of the echr and he be entice by my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon sir robert buckland to make some pronouncement on some of its judgement which think be little mean none the less my right hon and learn friend do proffer one suggestion namely the case of hirst and be grateful to he for that be grateful to my hon friend the member for broadland jerome mayhew for his intervention and for be on duty not only in westminster hall but also here in this chamber the course of the debate have be constructive on the whole agree that it have be broadly thoughtful and instructive we have have exchange on scripture and as lawyer it be joy indeed to hear the word otiose not once or twice but several time we once even hear otiose with bell on from my hon friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill and be grateful to he for that have not hear that expression before it must be legal reference that brush past in my youth we also hear about box set from my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick and the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady and will need to do bit more research on that we touch on echr membership although my right hon friend the member for newark rightly say that this be not the place to have that full debate but he set out some of the parameter for future debate that be sure we will have clause set out the rationale for the bill it set out the legal obligation and how the treaty to which the government of rwanda have agree address the concern that be set out by the supreme court amendment and table and address today by the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss and amendment and table by the hon member for aberdeen south stephen flynn seek to exclude the core of those provision the hon member for glasgow central be clear about her intention in that regard the treaty be bind in international law and in accordance with rwandan law will become domestic law in rwanda on ratification that be set out in detail and confirm in article of the treaty it rule out anyone relocate to rwanda be remove from there except to the united kingdom that be an important part of the treaty set out in article and that be regardless of whether the individual be find to be refugee or to have another humanitarian protection need that remove the risk of refoulement everyone relocate to rwanda will receive the same treatment those with refugee status those with humanitarian protection need and even those without that status will be able to stay in rwanda and will receive the same right and treatment that address head on the concern that the supreme court set out the asylum decision make process be be significantly reform annex of the treaty if have time might turn to the detail of that contain strengthen monitor arrangement and there be also strengthen monitor arrangement to ensure adherence to the obligation be grateful to my right hon and learn friend the member for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright for his engagement do not believe that his concern be right he say offensive or otiose would suggest that neither be right and hope to be able to reassure he because clause make clear that parliament be sovereign and that its act be valid notwithstanding any interpretation of international law will come back to that notwithstanding terminology which have be so contentious perhaps in recent history what it do not mean be that we be legislate away our international obligation the purpose of the bill be to say that on the basis of the treaty and the evidence before it parliament believe that those obligation have be meet it do not mean that we do not care whether they have be meet he mention dualism and be right to do so the part of the clause to which my right hon and learn friend amendment be direct do no more than make clear what we mean by safe country which be key definition apply to rwanda namely that the united kingdom can remove people to that country in compliance with its international obligation and that rwanda will not remove anyone in breach of any international law as former attorney general he also mention the law officers convention be grateful to he for that for so often in this chamber it go unnoticed it be an important convention and as former law officer myself abide by it very strictly as know he do so be grateful to he for remind the house of it turn to the amendment table by and the speech of my right hon and learn friend the member for south swindon be grateful for his contribution not just today but yesterday it be important that the will of parliament be make clear and that follow the mammoth effort between our government and the government of rwanda the obligation that we have agree be fully set out clause ensure that it be crystal clear that it be parliament that have consider and conclude that rwanda be safe country know his concern about this sort of clause but he will know that it be not unique and that it be not dissimilar to clause of the illegal migration suspect he be encourage not to pray that in aid but it be fact all the same that it be not unprecedented to have clause such as clause in bill turn to clause the united kingdom have long stand tradition of ensure that right and liberty be protect domestically and of fulfil our international human right obligation we remain committed to that position and will ensure that our law continue to be fit for purpose and work for the people of the united kingdom though some of the provision in the bill be novel the government be satisfied that the bill can be implement in line with the convention right however it have become clear that people will seek to frustrate their removal by any mean therefore this bill go far than the illegal migration act which be take through by my right hon friend the member for newark and my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham suella braverman as we have hear that act only disapplie section of the human rights act whereas this bill and particularly clause disapplie further element of the act the effect be that the duty under section of the human rights act be disapplie for any public authority include any court or tribunal that be take decision base on the duty under clause of the bill to treat the republic of rwanda as safe turn now directly to the amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark start with his amendment and he be right that the bill do not seek to disapply section of the human rights act it do not in fact disapply the declaration of incompatibility provision in section that be the only substantive remedy against the conclusive presumption that rwanda be safe retain declaration of incompatibility be important but of course the final say on this matter will rightly remain with parliament and with the government because of section of the human rights act which make it clear that declaration can not affect the operation or the validity of domestic legislation my hon and learn friend make an important point about the extent to which the court should and can intervene on issue relate to the compatibility of primary legislation with the echr the section procedure allow the court to express view but do not trespass directly upon the function of this place in deal with the problem it simply give parliament an opportunity to rectify any situation or not frankly do he agree that section be much well mechanism for the court to use than the clunky inelegant and sometimes very problematic section procedure hear what my right hon and learn friend say about section and agree with he wholeheartedly he be right to describe it as clunky and it have be disapplie in this bill as well as in the illegal migration act if may say so directly to my right hon friend the member for newark accept entirely his comment that he be here to help the government and that he believe passionately in this policy he have have several very frank open and honest conversation with about that both in this chamber and outside it and be grateful to he for put his point so ably and so clearly but the disapplication of those section within the bill significantly reduce the extent to which public authority be bind to act as consequence of the convention right may turn to clause and the further amendment table by my right hon friend the member for newark clause make it clear that it be for minister of the crown alone to determine whether to comply with an interim measure of the strasbourg court it also make it clear that the domestic court may not have regard to the existence of any interim measure when consider any domestic application flow from decision to remove person to rwanda in accordance with the treaty what happen with the rwanda flight in june be frustrating as many member have mention it be deeply flawed process and raise issue of natural justice but change have be make since then not least in the illegal migration act on november the strasbourg court announce the outcome of its review of the rule concern interim measure the change include the naming of judge interim measure be communicate as formal decision and the confirmation of the exist practice of party be able to request the reconsideration of decision in the rule the united kingdom have respond formally to the court consultation colleague have raise concern that assume the bill pass and succeed in close down the vast majority of individual claim our deterrent will be frustrate by rule interim measure say directly to my right hon and hon friend that understand those concern no one who be here in june and see the last rwanda plane leave on the tarmac can fail to understand the importance of fix this issue that be why the prime minister have be clear that he will not let foreign court block the flight we simply can not let an international court dictate our border security and stop we establish deterrent that be why we have insert clause which be crystal clear that it be for ministers and ministers alone to decide whether to comply with rule injunction we would not have insert clause if we be not prepared to use it confirm to the committee that we can and will lawfully use that power if the circumstance arise the discretion be there we go far still and we confirm that the civil service must implement any such decision today the permanent secretary for the home office have confirm that if we receive rule indication instead of defer removal immediately as be currently the practice official will refer the rule to the minister not to be too grandiose but in this case to for an immediate decision as the cabinet office have confirm it be the responsibility of civil servant under the civil service code to deliver that decision colleague have confirmation that we have the power we would use the power and the civil service will give effect to it if plane be sit on that runway this government will not stop until it take off we all know what the opposition would do they would campaign for it to be ground the minister just say that there will be circumstance in which we will ignore pyjama injunction what be the circumstance in which the government will not ignore they and will therefore comply with they could not have be clear there be the confirmation that we have the power we would use the power and the civil service will give effect to it let respond directly to my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham she speak powerfully as she always do and always listen carefully to what she say she set out number of case in which medical reason be cite in court medical argument be present that as she say frustrate the will of this place in fact section of the illegal migration act the very act that she take through this place with my right hon friend the member for newark address that exact point about medical record and medical evidence the follow be example of harm that do not constitute serious and irreversible harm the first be where the standard of healthcare available to the person in the relevant country be low than that available in the united kingdom it be there in the statute in the bill that we pass last year the second example be any pain or distress result from medical treatment that be available to person in the united kingdom not be available to person in the relevant country that be not do not and will not constitute serious and irreversible harm my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham be right to be concern about that but those concern have be address and meet in the legislation we have pass and in the legislation that be mirror in the bill let turn to the important provision of clause will directly address the hon member for belfast east gavin robinson and his submission in response to new clause nothing in the windsor framework include article or in the withdrawal agreement affect the bill proper operation on uk wide basis any suggestion to the contrary would be to imply that the scope of the right safeguard and equality of opportunity chapter of the belfast good friday agreement be far more expansive than be ever intend will the minister give way will not give way we be unequivocal that that be simply not the case and article of the windsor framework be not engaged would be happy to write far to the hon member for belfast east and the right hon member for lagan valley sir jeffrey donaldson on that point to set out further detail hope can reassure the hon member that we have already achieve the aim he seek will my hon and learn friend give way will give way but my hon friend must be conscious that we be up against very tight deadline on the statement he make with regard to rule and so forth can my hon and learn friend explain to the committee how the government would be able to prevent judicial review of the decision take by the minister without legislation my hon friend have hear what say on that point respect and admire he he know the esteem that have for he we have good faith disagreement on the effect of clause but the clause be clear it be for minister to decide and minister will decide will the minister give way may finish my point in response to the hon member for belfast east hope can reassure he that we have already achieve the aim he seek the bill will apply across the whole of the united kingdom in line with the application of our sovereign immigration policy across all four nation of the uk as territorial whole be grateful to the hon member for his kind and generous comment about personally and for his engagement will continue to engage with he on this issue we have make progress towards stop the boat with small boat crossing down by third in but we must do more the only way to do so be if it be abundantly clear that illegal entry will never lead to new life in the united kingdom the power of deterrence be prove beyond reasonable doubt by the success of our agreement with albania parliament and the british people want an end to illegal immigration and we need deterrent we have plan plan to stop the boat and invite all right hon and hon member to back it amendment have be propose mr jenrick do you wish to press it to vote or do you wish to withdraw it with your permission sir roger would like to withdraw it however if you be agreeable wish to press amendment instead we will come to that in due course beg to ask leave to withdraw the amendment amendment by leave withdraw six hour have elapse since the commencement of proceeding the proceeding be interrupt programme order december the chair put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that time standing order no question put that the clause stand

without amendment standing order no speaker statement sir tony lloyd it be with great sorrow that inform the house of the death of sir tony lloyd he be value colleague who spend his life in public service he will be remember on all side of the house with respect and affection be sure the house will join in send our sympathy to his family in their loss hon member hear hear there will be an opportunity for member to participate in minute silence tomorrow and to pay further tribute at later date want to do that on point of order mr speaker know there will be tribute in due course because many people in this house will want to speak in that session but be grateful for this point of order just to say few word about tony and this terrible loss this afternoon we be all deeply sadden at the loss of tony speak to he last thursday when he leave hospital for the last time to spend as much time as he could with his family and be able to pass on to he our thought our respect and our affection for he and for his commitment his public service and frankly his sheer decency hon member hear hear know that that be feel not just across the labour party and the labour movement but across this house and beyond may say thank you to those opposite who have send message it be great comfort to his family to know the respect that he be hold in across this house our thought this evening be of course with his family at this difficult time as say there will be minute silence tomorrow and will give the house an opportunity for further tribute to be pay safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill third reading programme order december beg to move that the bill be now read the third time of course echo the tribute to sir tony the prime minister the government and have be clear that we will do whatever it take to stop the boat and we have of course be make progress on that pledge reduce small boat arrival by over third last year but to stop the boat completely and to stop they for good we need to deter people from make these dangerous journey from risk their life and from line the pocket of evil criminal people smuggle gang the new legally bind treaty with the government of the republic of rwanda respond directly to the supreme court concern reflect the strength of the government of rwanda protection and commitment this bill send an unambiguously clear message that if you enter the united kingdom illegally you can not stay this bill have be meticulously draft to end the merry go round of legal challenge people will not be able to use our asylum law human right law or judicial review to block their legitimate removal and the default will be for claim to be hear outside of this country only very small number of migrant who face real and imminent risk of serious and irreversible harm will be able to appeal decision in the uk as thing stand can the home secretary confirm that if this bill receive royal assent it will not breach international law yes or no my right hon friend raise an important point and it give an opportunity to be unambiguous and clear as draft as we intend this bill to progress it will be in complete compliance with international law the uk take international law seriously and the country we choose to partner with internationally also take international law seriously the previous intervention be extremely apposite will the foreign secretary be kind enough to give the advice as to why he say what he just do about no breach of international law my hon friend will know that the government do not make their legal advice public we have put forward of course an explanation of our position but be absolutely confident that we will maintain our long stand tradition of be country that not just abide by international law but champion and defend it under our new legislation migrant will not be able to frustrate the decision to remove they to rwanda by bring systemic challenge about the general safety of rwanda can the home secretary assure we that if this bill be pass tonight there will be system in place that accurately test its success month by month and week by week so that we know that all this anger all this frustration all this work be not for nothing the hon gentleman certainly speak for number of member in the house although maybe not too many on his own benches because it sound as if he want this to work whereas plenty of opposition members have try to frustrate our attempt to deal with illegal migration but we will of course want to assess the success because we want to be proud of the fact that this government unlike the opposition party actually care about strengthen our border and defend ourselves against those evil people smuggler and their evil trade to be clear we will disapply the avenue use by individual that block the first flight to rwanda include asylum and human right claim without that very narrow route to individual challenge we would undermine the treaty that we have just sign with rwanda and run the very serious risk of collapse the scheme and that must not be allow to happen but if people attempt to use this route simply as delaying tactic they will have their claim dismiss by the home office and they will be remove the bill also ensure that it be for ministers and ministers alone to decide whether to comply with the echr interim measure because it be for the british people and the british people alone to decide who come and who stay in this country the prime minister say he would not have include that clause unless we be intend and prepare to use it and that be very much the case we will not let foreign court prevent we from manage our own border as reiterate by the cabinet office today it be the established case that civil servant under the civil service code be there to deliver the decision of ministers of the crown the bill be key to stop the boat once and for all to reassure some of the people who have approach with concern remind they that albanians previously make up around third of small boat arrival but through work intensively and closely with albania and its government more than people with no right to be here have be return the deterrent be powerful enough to drive down arrival from albania by more than strasbourg have not intervene flight from rwanda have not be stop and the house should understand that this legislation once pass will go even far and be even strong than the legislation that underpin the albania agreement we obviously support the albania agreement but will the home secretary confirm that only of albanians who have arrive in the country over the past few year on small boat have be return or remove what have happen to the other as have say it be about deterrence and the deterrent effect be clear for anyone to see with more than reduction in the number of albanians who have arrive on these shore be glad that the shadow home secretary choose this point to intervene because it remind that the labour party have no credible plan at all to manage our border the opposition have try to obstruct our plan to tackle illegal migration over and over again more than time they even want to cut deal with the eu that would see we receive extra illegal migrant each and every year interruption they cheer the shadow home secretary be pleased with the idea that we be go to receive an extra every year they can laugh but we take this issue seriously because it be not what our country need and it be not what our constituent want we be unite in agreement that stop the boat and get the rwanda partnership up and run be of the utmost importance have debate about how to get the policy right be of course what this house be for that be our collective job and respect my good friend and colleague on the government benches for put forward amendment in good faith to do what they believe will strengthen the bill while my party sit only short physical distance from the party on the opposition benches the gulf between our aspiration to control our border and their blasé laissez faire attitude to border control could not be more stark stop the boat be not just question of policy it be question of morality and of fairness it be this government this conservative party who be the only party in this house take this issue as seriously as we should urge this house to stick with our plan and stop the boat may first add my tribute to tony lloyd he do such wonderful work in policing as well as in this place what farce today and yesterday have be more day of tory chaos and carnage we have prime minister with no grip while the british taxpayer be continually force to pay the price former tory cabinet ministers and deputy chair from all side have be queue up to tell we it be bad bill they say it will not work it will not protect our border it will not comply with international law and it be fatally flawed the only thing that the tories all seem to agree on be that the scheme be fail and the law will not solve it the prime minister be fail too and they know it we have fail rwanda scheme that be cost britain million that send more home secretaries than asylum seeker to kigali and that will only apply to less than of those arrive in the uk this be the third tory law on channel crossing in two year it will get through tonight just like the previous two bills do even though they fail just like the last two it be total con on the british people this chaos leave the prime minister authority in tatter he be in office but not in power no one agree with he on his policy and the real weakness be that he do not even agree with it himself the prime minister be so weak that he have lose control of the asylum system lose control of our border and lose any control of the tory party sixty tory mp have vote against the government two deputy chair be sack home secretary and immigration minister have formerly be lose and cabinet ministers have be brief openly that they do not support the bill the home secretary himself think it be batshit the prime minister try to cancel it and yet be so weak that they be still go ahead under the tories we have see border security weaken while criminal gang take hold because they have not take the action that we need the backlog soar the budget bust criminal smuggler conviction have drop by and return have halve that be instead of the practical plan that labour set out to set up the new return and enforcement unit to stop the home office from just lose thousand of people that it can not keep track of to stop the halving of the return unit to set up the new security power to go after the criminal gang and stop the drop in criminal gang smuggler conviction and to have the additional cross border police unit that we could be invest in if we be not spend so much money on this fail rwanda scheme four hundred million pound of taxpayer money be go to rwanda all without single person be send that be all in addition to the government whop multibillion pound hotel bill of course if they get flight off it will probably cost another million to million for every people they actually manage to send president kagame make an astonishing intervention this afternoon he say that he be happy for the scheme to be scrap and may be offer to refund the money think what we could do with million that be more than third of the budget of the national crime agency the kigali government have clarify the position this afternoon and it be even bad they say under the term of the agreement rwanda have no obligation to return any of the fund pay if no migrant come to rwanda under the scheme and the uk government wish to request refund of the portion of the funding allocate to support we will consider this request unbelievable the government sign deal and whole series of cheque to send hundred of million of pound of british taxpayer money to rwanda for scheme that they be warn would not work might be unlawful would not work as deterrent would be unenforceable and would be at high risk of fraud they sign it because they do not give damn about taxpayer money now they want to pass the bill and spend even more taxpayer money on this fail scheme the scheme be likely to cover less than of the people who arrive in the country last year more than people apply for asylum and the court of appeal say that rwanda have capacity for only people the immigration minister admit that it be just few hundred and not any time soon if the government ever finally implement the illegal migration act that will immediately create list of people the home secretary be suppose to send immediately to rwanda at this rate it will take the government year to implement their own fail policy to be honest it be probably even bad than that because they can not even find most of the people they put on the initial rwanda list it be totally unbelievable in the space of about month the prime minister and the home secretary have literally lose people they plan to send to rwanda bet the prime minister wish he could lose few of those home secretaries he manage to send rise the prime minister do also lose his immigration minister as part of the chaos of the last few week and month give way to the former immigration minister if the shadow home secretary do not like the rwanda policy why do she brief the times over the christmas holiday that she be in favour of an offshore processing scheme which everyone know be more expensive than scheme like rwanda and have far less deterrent effect it seem that everything she do not like be her plan except she do not have the gut to put her name to it so she brief the times anonymously nice try with total nonsense from the former immigration minister who have history of make thing up it be not clear that there be anything on the planet more expensive per person than the government rwanda scheme million to send nobody to rwanda and to totally fail give the former immigration minister credit for expose the government and the prime minister real plan in his word to try and get few symbolic flight off before general election with small number of people on they not to worry about handing over small fortune to another country or the fact that all this focus on one small fail scheme mean that the government be fail to go after the gang they have lose thousand of people the home office should be track not to worry that this new law be so badly draw up that frankly the government may be order by the court to bring people back at far huge cost to the british taxpayer turn the whole thing into an even big farce this be not workable policy it be massive costly con the government be try to con voter and con their own party but everyone can see through it million rwanda scheme for few hundred people be like the emperor new clothe the prime minister and his immigration ministers have be desperately spin the invisible thread but we can all see through it the home secretary be wander naked around this chamber wave little treaty as fig leaf to hide his modesty behind admit he do not have much modesty to hide there be thing that the home secretary and agree on we agree on work with france we agree on the deal with albania we agree on the importance of stop dangerous boat crossing that be undermine border security and put life at risk think he probably agree with we about the failing of the policy he be try to defend today we need strong border security and properly control and manage asylum system so that the uk do its bit to help those flee persecution and conflict and those who have no right to be here be return we need labour plan for the new security power the new cross border police the new security agreement the new return and enforcement unit the clearing of the backlog the ending of hotel use and keep track of the thousand of people the home secretary have lose the government will get their law through tonight the third new law in two year the third home secretary to visit rwanda with cheque book the third bilateral agreement with rwanda tory back benchers have be say that it should be three strike and you out we be now on three six nine strike and they have not even get to first base because every time they bring forward new law it make thing bad the first new law fail because its main provision be now suspend the second new law fail with the main provision not even implement forgive we for not believe word the government say and for vote against third fail bill today the only difference now be that none of their back benchers believe they either broken promise on clear the backlog on end hotel use on stop the boat and on return people who come it be chaos fail on smuggler gang fail on return and fail to get grip britain deserve well than this tory asylum chaos will simply reply to the labour party if vote against third reading this evening certainly have no intention of do single thing to support the proposition of labour front bench spokesman let get that completely clear labour be not do anything it have no plan want the bill to succeed and if vote against third reading it will be because do not believe to use the home secretary own word that this be the tough immigration legislation that we could produce nor do think we have do whatever it take can only say that in this context but it be about the law my main concern be that there will be another claim as result of this do not think anybody expect anything else when it happen it will go to the supreme court and the question in front of the supreme court will be very simple put that point in my speech yesterday and do not retract single word be extremely grateful to those very senior people some member of the government who say to privately that they agree with every word say say that for this reason if the act of parliament be sufficiently comprehensive use the notwithstanding formula and the word use be clear and unambiguous then there be no doubt at all that we would win that case in the supreme court sadly just do not think that that be go to happen explain why yesterday so there be no need or reason for to go into it now have say what have say all can say be that wish the government well but can not in all conscience support the bill because have set out my case and on principle be not go to retract it call the snp spokesperson the front page of this tawdry pathetic piece of unworkable legislation say in the name of the home secretary be unable to make statement that in my view the provision of the safety of rwanda asylum and immigration bill be compatible with the convention right but the government nevertheless wish the house to proceed with the bill it be another illegal bill that will not work and will not fix the problem it be bill for which the government have no mandate the conservative manifesto say we will continue to grant asylum and support to refugee flee persecution with the ultimate aim of help they to return home if it be safe to do so nothing about flight to rwanda nothing about extradition nothing about rip up people fundamental human right since then there have be two unelected prime ministers four home secretaries and no mandate for this bill the unhcr assessment of the bill state it maintain its position that the arrangement as now articulate and the uk rwanda partnership treaty and accompany legislative scheme do not meet the require standard relate to the legality and appropriateness of the transfer of asylum seeker and be not compatible with international refugee law rwanda have be clear that it do not want to sign up to an agreement that breach international law the bill breach international law that be very clear it be very dangerous that the government be go down this road we can not make country safe simply by legislate that it be so this government be engage in fantasy more dangerous than that they ask the court public servant and all of we to engage in that same fantasy it become upside down and topsy turvy right be wrong and wrong be right all those thing make no sense we can not make country safe simply by legislate it so we know that the bill be no deterrent because the supposedly harsh bills that come before it have not be deterrent either it have be day since the last tough harsh and difficult piece of deterrent legislation be pass and measure be not yet even in force from the government previous tough difficult harsh bill that be suppose to be deterrent so we can not believe they now we also find that the tiny number of people will send to rwanda anyway less than of those cross this year will be send to rwanda what happen to the rest of the people leave in immigration limbo to wander the street of these island the government can not say they do not know and they have no idea what they will do when people have no right and be out look for assistance the bill amount to nothing more and nothing less than state sponsor people traffic interruption conservative member do not like to hear it but it be the truth will explain to they exactly why they should listen to my description and see what they think far from dismantle criminal gang this government have become criminal gang break international law and move vulnerable people across the world without legal process no right of appeal and no concern for the safety or human right of asylum seeker to country they do not know involve money and involve profit it involve people this government will never meet and never look in the eye they will never sit across the table and watch they in tear because they can not be safe robert burns that great humanitarian of scotland say man inhumanity to man make countless thousand mourn mourn what this government be do to human right and the undermining of international law and international principle and give this assurance when scotland get its independence we will take our place in the world we will take our responsibility seriously and we will play our full part in the world as an independent nation let begin by add my tribute to tony lloyd one of the most charming and civilised politician in this house model that would do well to be replicate more widely than it sometimes be it be clear from the debate that have take place in the last couple of day that it be this side and this side only that understand the concept of deterrence when it come to the importance of deal with illegal immigration interruption the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss have have her hysterical say and will have mine that understanding be in stark contrast to the intellectual vacuum that pass for today labour party on this side the debate have be entirely about the workability of the bill and we have hear some exceptional speech over the last couple of day if may will single out that of my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick do not believe we should be demonise at any point those who want to secure well future for themselves by seek asylum in or migration to the united kingdom which be fine fair tolerant society that anyone would want to join however the principle of territorial asylum the right to access the national asylum system on set foot on land have already have coach and horse drive through it by the fact that many of these people be not come by boat from dangerous country but be come from france that can not be tolerate if we be to have control over our border even more important this point have be make frequently by my right hon and hon friend be the need to curb the evil of people smuggle and destroy the economic model of those who traffic in that most disgusting trade have to say that political infringement of the echr be nothing compare with the duty to stop people suffocate in lorry or drown while cross the channel especially give that when it come to deportation france be the country that be perfectly willing to ditch the judgment of the echr when it suit it our deterrent will be even great if we pass this legislation and can persuade other country to do the same in synergistic way the bill may not be everything that everybody want but it be much well than what we have today if have vote only for legislation with which agree my voting record in the past year might have be different from what it be today hear those on my own side say that we can replace this bill with something else but we can not as you well know mr speaker erskine may say when bill have be reject or lose through disagreement it should not accord to the practice of parliament be reintroduce in the same session this be the one chance that we have to pass this legislation what we do will be judge by our voter accord to their priority if we leave tonight with nothing that judgment will be harsh or bad it will leave we to the cringe mediocrity that make up his majesty opposition too pay tribute to tony lloyd with whom sit in westminster hall during his last speech it be about human right the very issue that we be discuss now he speak with such wisdom and we will all miss he be shocked to hear member call another member female it be classic use of misogynistic term and be shocked to hear it this be the third reading of the third bill in two year to try to stop the channel crossing the first the nationality and borders act have be partially suspend because it be make thing bad the second the illegal migration act have mainly not be implement because the home office believe it be unworkable so here we be for the third time this be the fail again and fail hard version unaffordable unworkable and unlawful it weaken our national border and undermine international court those court that protect and on which we rely as british citizen have be very concerned about the attack on the european court of human rights during debate on the bill the cost be spiral at million plus the million that be already spend on legal bill alone by november this late gimmick not plan let down people flee persecution and will not deliver on fix the immigration system it will leave nearly case in the backlog people in hotel and as we have now hear more than people miss from the system it will not fix the system that the conservatives have break it will not be that deterrent it be too small and unworkable it do not respond to the international situation of increase climate change impact and conflict around the world that be drive people to seek safety it feel like the conservatives can not cope with international reality and have stick their finger in their ear and be chant something about rwanda instead of face up to reality this let our country down what will stop the boat and the dreadful death in the cold sea be labour plan we will clear the backlog with new fast track system and officer we will end hotel use save the taxpayer over billion and improve enforcement with new return and enforcement unit to reverse the collapse in return for those who have no right to be here the conservatives start this work by employ some temporary new officer and it start to work so why not invest in the thing that work instead of this gimmick they have start clear the backlog the tories have also start smash the gang through the work that they be do in france again it be begin to work so why not invest in those thing that work rather than in the rwanda plan it be nonsense to start something but not finish it and leave half bake plan in place what work be smash the gang and work with france we would smash the supply chain with new power and new cross border police unit which would prevent the boat from reach the french coast in the first place we would work in partnership internationally to address some of the humanitarian crisis that be lead people to flee from their home we believe in strong border security and properly control manage and fair asylum system so that the uk can do our bit to help those flee persecution and conflict but return those with no right to be here we also believe in stop the gang who be the only winner from this bill under the tories we just have costly chaos it be important to speak in this debate have to say be somewhat astonish by the speech of the shadow home secretary who can not even get the name of the country right talk about the kigali government when we be talk about rwanda respected country that have recently be president of the commonwealth want to associate myself with the comment about the sad loss of sir tony lloyd as member of parliament in both manchester and rochdale he be assiduous for his constituent and assiduous when he be in government and he will be much miss in this house the reason why stand today be that be keen to make sure that this bill get through its third reading with the large majority possible so that we can say to the other house that the elect house have have its say we be do this bill solely because have have the excellent illegal migration act take through by my right hon and learn friend the member for fareham suella braverman and my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick which we should all remember the labour party oppose religiously block everything that we try to do the supreme court after disagree with the high court point to the issue of rwanda specifically it be important that parliament stand up and address that specific point so that we can get through this stage and then commence the relevant section of the illegal migration act particularly regard have safe third country be conscious that temperature be pretty high but there be genuine passion on this side of the house to respect the will of our constituent who want to see fair legal migration system and not the vague plan which really be not plan from the labour party say to my right hon and hon friend support this bill tonight so that we have the big majority possible appreciate what other member have say but clause be very specific that when decision maker be make decision parliament have give its full confidence that when people go to rwanda they will be treat fairly and that the convention will be apply then we will have not only the effective process but the effective deterrent which think the whole house seek let we be clear and let we talk with one voice wish the opposition would join we but know from their track record of oppose the illegal migration act that they might talk the talk but they be full of bluster they do not really mean it and they do not really care know that this conservative government care and know that every conservative mp care we need to make sure that the lords listen to the elect house be gutte by the loss of sir tony lloyd he be decent kind wise man and an excellent member of parliament we will all seriously miss he they say that the small the stake the more ferociously they be fight over the small stake be that if this bill work of the asylum seeker who come to this country might just end up be send to rwanda at cost of million and counting we know it will not be deterrent as we know that people have travel from the horn of africa through libya over the mediterranean and through europe as if the chance that they may go to rwanda will put off the tiny fraction of people who try to cross the english channel have take all the risk they have take to get as far as france of course people travel from france they be not go to bloomin sail directly from libya be they for pity sake people will come from france the french government could say to spain and italy no these people should stay in your safe country the house will see where be go if we do not work co operatively the whole thing fall down the real issue be the backlog of asylum case that this incompetent government have fail to clear have cover the issue of deterrence but the people smuggler may well decide to bring people into this country under the radar without claim asylum at all we would not reduce the number come here but we would massively increase the number of people who end up in the black market as victim of trafficking and sexual slavery and so on only quarter of those few people who be deny asylum have go through the system be remove by this government we have government who talk tough and act weak if they actually want deterrent they would make sure that there be system to deal with those people and they would remove the one who be not genuine asylum seeker even the government own figure show that of the people who come here to claim asylum be legitimate and genuine refugee if the government want to deter people they should assess they and return the one who be not genuine refugee the weak thing about this bill be that it be predicate on the government desire to demonise the world most vulnerable people because they think the electorate like it they have misunderstood and massively underestimate the british people and certainly my constituent who be well than they think they be can tell the government about my community in half the child who survive the death camp in nazi occupy europe come to our shore in fact they come to the shore of lake windermere they be the windermere boy the windermere child and we be proud of that legacy because it speak to the kind of people we be in the lake and in britain have visit some of the refugee camp in europe and when speak to the people who seek to come to the united kingdom by the way it be important to remember that european union country take more refugee per head than the united kingdom the thing that drive they to come here be not benefit or the nhs but belief in britain they believe that britain be the kind of place where they can raise family in peace where they can earn living and where they can have religious freedom and other liberty that reputation be build on hundred of year of proud experience of what it be to be british our forefather and foremother build that reputation and it will take more than this tawdry government and this shabby legislation to undermine that reputation overseas the government want to make britain unattractive and they will fail the bill will fail it be costly expensive failure and it deserve to be reject by this house will be quick mr speaker this have be useful debate already because we have hear from the opposition party where they stand we have hear from the scottish national party that it want scotland to take its place among the nation of the world what we do not hear be whether the snp want scotland to take its fair share of the refugee of the world because as yet it do not do so it be good to hear from labour that it do have plan to stop the boat it be our plan it be everything we be do already just without the rwanda bit which be the one essential piece of the jigsaw that will act as an effective deterrent and stop the boat the hon member for westmorland and lonsdale tim farron make passionate speech but think he be say that we should just be more like europe on refugee and asylum and be not sure that that be what the public want wish briefly to pay tribute to few people first pay tribute to the government whips who have do brilliant job today congratulate they and honour they for their effort they have be more successful than have today but be glad that we be all more or less united again as party pay particular tribute to the minister for counter illegal migration who have work with colleague across our party and across the house to address the concern we have be pleased to say that some commitment have be give today and in the past few day although do not think they go far enough want to acknowledge the important work that my hon friend the member for stone sir william cash and my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick have do in committee because their amendment which so many of we have support in the past two day would have make significant improvement to the operation of this bill we be all in the same place as many colleague have say all conservative members want to do the same thing which be establish an effective deterrent that would ensure that people who cross the channel be immediately detain and remove do not think that this bill as draft be go to work we will see legal challenge that will clog up the process and ensure that the deterrent be not enforce regret that we be not honour the pledge we have make to the people to control our border effectively which be what they vote for in and in so decisively what all the opinion poll and our constituent tell we and what all common sense tell we be such an important part of our commitment and responsibility in government regret that although the bill pay tribute ostentatiously to the essential concept and principle of parliamentary sovereignty it do not in fact ensure that that be what we will have we believe that statute pass in this place have supremacy over judge make law and certainly over the jurisdiction of the european court be afraid to say that much as the government agree with the principle have just establish the bill as it stand still allow lawyer to use foreign international law commitment and protocol to override the supremacy of parliament and deeply regret that we could have get well bill through parliament in this session we could have develop it and understand that it would have be possible to bring forward bill of different scope that would have achieve the same end regret that we be not do that but understand that this be where we be many of my colleague have decide to vote with the government tonight because they do not want to cause the political disruption that would ensue from government defeat and honour they for their decision respect that greatly and think it be very honourable position my view be as say at the outset that the bill need these improvement do not think it will work and we could have do well nevertheless the fundamental fact be that conservative members be unite in our commitment to stop the boat through this policy the real division be not the gangway on the government benches but the aisle between we and the opposition benches the great value of the debate we have be have be that it expose the position of the opposition party they do not believe in stop the boat and we all do the tribute receive about tony lloyd today come from the ex chief constable of west midlands police who use to be the deputy chief constable of greater manchester police he say that tony be one of the good people he have ever work with so stand here to say that want everybody in here to know that they be about to vote for bill when they have absolutely no idea how much it be go to cost we have not be give that information be here during the debate in committee early when the chair of the home affairs committee my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson say that there be view that each person send to rwanda would cost that pique my anger so greatly because have just come from an event with the home secretary to do with it be year on from the independent child sexual abuse inquiry where we be consider what progress we have make since then be hold in my hand piece of paper that say that in some child be sexually abuse and come forward to say that and then look up how much money the home office allocate to its sexual abuse against child fund in it be million which work out be for every child who have be rap in that year and think about the political capital of walk round and round the lobby for the third bill try to do something that will work the prime minister could find judge yesterday do know where under the rape victim in my constituency be wait seven year for their case to get in front of judge frankly people who think that it be worth the amount of time spend waste taxpayer money on something that have not work the last two time we try it and will not work this time should be ashamed of themselves for vote for something when they have no idea how much it will cost the people in their constituency hope that those who turn up today feel shame for the amount of airtime they have take up when they do not do so for the victim of child excuse would someone like to intervene no be in british court last week not foreign court but british court with victim of human trafficking she have be traffic twice we have deport she once already as traffic victim but she be re trafficked back to this country and go to the upper tribunal with her last week she have two child bear of the repeat rape that she have suffer as victim of human trafficking and the home office be try to deport she again the judge scold the home office lawyer for dare to bring the case in front of they and because be sit in the courtroom the home office lawyer be not so keen to give their evidence in front of so they do not really give yes wonder why they do not want to talk about how it be fine for woman who have be ritually rap repeatedly to have to go back to where that have happen before she have be traffic here have hear nothing in any of the debate today about what happen to the victim of human trafficking when we scoop up all these people without any appeal what happen to they currently have sit in courtroom where this government be abuse they would never vote for the bill and neither should anybody else be first elect to this house on the same day as tony lloyd in he be brilliant friend and comrade who vote against the iraq war student tuition fee and the renewal of trident and he be brilliant shadow northern ireland secretary he will be much miss by many good people all over this country this bill be an appalling piece of legislation it fail to take any account of the human suffering of people who be force through lack of any other alternative to try to make very dangerous crossing of the channel have meet people in calais who be desperate poor and confused and have travel from afghanistan and other place they be victim of war human right abuse poverty and so much else the government be now claim that the only way to deal with the issue be to attack what they euphemistically call foreign court when in reality that court be the european court of human rights which be part of our judicial system they be try to offshore their obligation under international law and treaty on the global stage it be the wealthy country such as australia and britain that want to offshore issue surround asylum and the right of people to seek asylum and pretend that somehow or other they be do the world favour we have to work with other country to deal with the issue of the desperation of so many refugee in europe and far more in other part of the world the bill blame those people for be victim and play into the narrative of the most backward horrible remark make in our national medium and newspaper about asylum seeker without ever recognise that those people who have seek asylum legally in this country it be always legal to seek asylum that be there in treaty will eventually be our doctor lawyer teacher and engineer of tomorrow as they be all over europe the bill play into this racist trope against refugee all over the world and attack refugee because of where they come from hope that the house tonight reject this bill hope that in future we do not come back to this kind of debate but instead start to look at the issue of human right abuse victim of war victim of environmental disaster and the need of those people to be care for on this planet as fellow human being rather than make they out to be the enemy that they certainly be not desperate people be look for place of safety surely it be our the home secretary be get very excited but it be his obligation to try to make sure that they do have place of safety in which to survive for the rest of their life too pay tribute to tony lloyd think that we would all admit that he be far far well man than most of we in this house those of we who have survive thus far advanced cancer often feel particular poignancy know the home secretary will agree with this point when friend be lose to cancer so my condolence go to tony family hope that we will have proper time to commemorate he as you have say mr speaker want the boat to stop not because do not value the life of those who have pay thousand of pound to risk their life on the high sea in unseaworthy vessel but because do value their life despise the people trafficker and do not want the generosity of the british people to be test to breaking point be vote against third reading today for four reason first agree with the right hon member for newark robert jenrick and the hon member for stone sir william cash and for devizes danny kruger who be not all here now that this bill will not work it be false promise and be sick of false promise it be waste of money and be sick of the government waste our money and be very sceptical that it will actually act as deterrent after all if the freezing water of the channel that can take life in matter of minute be not deterrent how will chance of be transport to rwanda act as deterrent secondly this bill be base on heady mixture of gross exaggeration preposterous wishful thinking and miserably misconceive machismo let we look at the exaggeration the right hon member for newark say yesterday million of people in the world want to make that report january vol in small boat where on earth be his evidence for that the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman say that there be many instance of asylum seeker purport to be homosexual to receive preferential treatment in asylum application where on earth be her evidence for that many have claim that the vast majority of those arrive in small boat be economic migrant but the evidence be that when the home office have investigate it have grant of they refugee status thirdly the right hon member for newark say yesterday the law be our servant not our master official report january vol but it be wrong that even without amendment this bill place ministers above the law it mean that even if dog be factually dog and court have interpret the law have adjudge it to be dog the government can declare it none the less to be cat the former attorney general say early quite rightly that we rely in the uk on international law it be the basis of how we protect ourselves and our interest how then can we argue that china russia and the houthis should not renege on international human right law when we ditch it when it be inconvenient for we and how many of we condemn russia quite rightly when it declare by statute law that luhansk and donetsk be part of russia when they be patently part of ukraine as lay down in international treaty fourthly and finally the right hon member for newark say yesterday that we be not parish council official report january vol agree so let we stop behave like handforth parish council let we behave like the house of commons protect ancient liberty include the right to appeal respect the rule of law and honour our international commitment like honourable member the committee of the whole house have go through the bill and not make any of the varying and contradictory amendment from the varying and contradictory faction of the tory party we be leave with bill that in reality nobody actually want the hardliner on the tory party right do not like it something to do with foreign court the tory leave do not particularly like it because they realise how close it sail to breach our international human right obligation the official opposition do not like it because think it be too expensive the snp be oppose to the bill and the entire hostile environment policy in principle because this be just completely the wrong way to deal with some of the poor and most vulnerable people who come to these shore seek refuge and safety we want to welcome refugee and encourage they to contribute to our economy and society but it seem that even the republic of rwanda be get cold foot and no wonder notwithstanding the fact that the united kingdom continue to grant asylum to asylum seeker from rwanda why should country that aspire to be prosperous stable african democracy allow itself to become political football for wannabe leader of the opposition that currently inhabit the tory benches accord to the prime minister today the good or perhaps bad thing about rwanda be that it be not the uk and the very fact of its not be the uk be deterrent to people come here because they might be deport to it by the same logic if the government threaten to deport people to disneyland that would also be deterrent because disneyland be not in the uk of course disneyland be place where dream be suppose to come true but think the dream of the former home secretary the right hon and learn member for fareham suella braverman and indeed the former immigration minister the right hon member for newark robert jenrick of flight take off to rwanda will not come true and neither will their dream of become the next leader of the opposition after the election the snp dream of an independent scotland the dream that will never die that have its own independent humane asylum system that recognise human right and want to welcome refugee will come true and soon rather than later question put that the bill be now read the third

funding in devon welcome the minister and colleague to the debate few year ago at dinner host by the rotary club of exeter be sit between the bishop of exeter and dr john searle the founder of hospiscare brilliant local independent charity provide specialist care to people across our county must confess that it be surreal experience for this something year old from devon who be more comfortable in pub than at black tie dinner they both speak to about local hospice service and the good work they do in devon dr john searle sadly pass away last year and pay tribute to his work his compassion and his determination our society would be so much well off if we have more people like john and will always treasure the conversation we enjoy hospice service in devon provide incredible support and comfort to those suffer from terminal or long term life limit condition patient often have multiple condition and complex need and often require high level of support as the member for east devon be acutely aware of the work and impact of hospice locally several charity provide hospice service across east devon and want to pay tribute to the one base in my constituency sidmouth hospice at home and hospiscare sidmouth hospice at home have day centre in sidford with specialist nursing team work with local nhs dementia service team who benefit from the use of their building live in sidmouth they do we proud on that point will the hon gentleman give way will be the hon gentleman intervention to do with devon it be to do with the hospice and charity that the hon gentleman refer to this debate be about funding in devon be sure the hon member for strangford could say something that relate to funding in devon thank you mr speaker the hon gentleman be right to refer to hospice funding in devon but while the hospice funding and charity giving in devon be good suggest that it may be even well in strangford each year in northern ireland our fundraiser add million to the four hospice without that money those hospice could not function do the hon gentleman agree that the government must stop rely on people charity to fill the gap and increase funding immediately to meet that need know that his charity giver in devon do well but the one in strangford do equally well thank the hon gentleman for his point one of the point he raise with early when he tell he be go to intervene on be about fundraising and that have be really difficult since covid for all sort of reason across the rest of my part of devon hospiscare run hospice at high view gardens in exmouth and searle house in exeter and it have run have fantastic clinical nurse specialist team in budleigh salterton exmouth and far afield in neighbouring constituency hospiscare be the big of the local charity and it support people each year however these charity need dedicated team and lot of funding to support many thousand of patient funding matter even more because we know that devon population be age and grow in devon there be proportionately more old people than the national average more than of the total population in the devon county council area be age over compare with less than one in five of the total england population and of these people be and over by devon population age between and be predict to increase to which be rise and the plus population will nearly double to hospice across our county be therefore play an increasingly key role my hon friend be right to highlight the future challenge for hospice would he agree that plan such as those come forward for rowcroft hospice in my own constituency to very much integrate and provide both nursing and sheltered accommodation alongside the hospice service they will continue to provide show way to generate additional income while not conflict with their core purpose completely agree with my hon friend these service be dynamic and they be work and the people of torbay be well serve be remind of the increase importance of hospice by dr timothy dudgeon constituent of mine from ottery st mary he first approach two year ago and we meet at one of my regular surgery in exmouth shortly afterwards his plea be simple hospiscare one of the charity have mention need fair funding from the nhs in devon to cope with grow demand fully agree with he but here we be two year later because the nhs simply be not listen have raise the matter through meeting letter and everything else to the nhs devon integrate care board and be take my call to the floor of this house because want the chair of the icb dr sarah wollaston formerly of this place to realise that be not let this unfair deal for devon hospice go without challenge the issue here be obvious to all and the solution be simply common sense which be something we ought to try little more often hospice across our country and county be face perfect storm income from fundraising be fall while cost and demand for their service be rise hospiscare in devon have tell that it be face million deficit in the next financial year meanwhile sidmouth hospice at home have tell that its average case load have rise by over in the last year alone amid this perfect storm have be call on the nhs devon icb to increase its funding for all of our hospice icb be responsible for determine the level of funding for palliative and end of life care in their area this be devolution and support it the government do not decide how funding be spend local organisation should know their area well and where to send their money however question the situation in devon if the icb need more money to achieve fair hospice funding would bang down the door of any minister to help they if ask but they have not ask and we have face wall of silence that was intriguingly until couple of hour ago when receive letter from the nhs devon icb it be intriguing timing do we not think give that it do not reply to previous letter send last year now it have finally respond to one of my letter from november the nhs devon icb say that it be work on plan to move towards more equitable nhs funding start in the next financial year be sure colleague here will be press for more detail about that the wall of silence we have all face in devon be why have launch campaign and petition on my website to put pressure on the icb to increase funding to our local hospice which resident across my constituency of east devon and beyond be support first raise this with nhs devon icb two year ago after meet with dr timothy dudgeon really hope the minister can support my message to the icb and its chair dr sarah wollaston our message be crystal clear there need to be fair deal hospiscare be fund for of its cost from nhs devon icb compare with the national average of from icb across england sidmouth hospice at home receive no funding from the nhs in devon at all and that put it in small minority in the country receive no money from local nhs body that simply can not be right be grateful to the hon member both for give way and for secure the debate this evening which be really significant one know from the seaton and district hospital league of friends where there be the seaton hospice at home facility that the palliative care nurse who work there be amazing people and they help people to die in very dignified fashion give that we have such fantastic people who work for such organisation as hospice at home in seaton and sidmouth do the hon gentleman agree that they ought to continue to have physical location in which to work from as they do currently at seaton hospital do he also agree that the minister might do well to talk to nhs property services so they can continue to have that facility at seaton hospital the hon gentleman make very good point about seaton hospice at home and it do fantastic job for the resident of seaton and the surround area he also make good point about seaton hospital which of course we face challenge with locally as he know all too well as the member for tiverton and honiton it be important to recognise that nhs property services be an arm length body have say that recent meeting with one of the ministers who have sponsorship of nhs property services have shed some light on the attempt to make sure that that building of seaton hospital be protect for future generation but want to speak about somewhere else in devon briefly my hon friend the member for north devon selaine saxby can not be here but be tell north devon hospice have be try to get its hospice at home service commission for decade the icb agree that it should be but will still not fund the service which save north devon district hospital million through avoid admission similarly my hon friend the member for south west devon sir gary streeter and the hon member for plymouth sutton and devonport luke pollard have raise the same issue with st luke hospice in plymouth this be plainly unfair now must be the time to strengthen our hospice give they fair funding and help they take pressure off the nhs be grateful to the hon gentleman for introduce this adjournment debate the threat face by the charitable palliative care sector in east devon be emulate in my own constituency in scotland have two of the large hospice in scotland st margaret of scotland hospice in whitecrook and the child hospice in ballach and the big challenge be how to be take seriously by nhs managerial structure there be vibrant and commit palliative care structure in these two charity but sometimes the big challenge be they be take seriously by community health partnership in my area or integrate care board in the hon gentleman area the hon gentleman have hit the nail on the head he be absolutely right now must be the time to strengthen our hospice give they fair funding and help they take pressure off the nhs hospiscare have calculate that its service save between two and three hospital admission every day these be patient the local nhs will have to cover if the hospice have to cut its service sidmouth hospice at home have calculate that it be save the nhs locally more than night of hospital stay through prevent admission shorten stay length and speed up discharge be that not what we want the benefit of fair funding be plain to see strengthen our local hospice take pressure off our nhs but without fair funding and give the perfect storm of less fundraising income more cost and more demand there be real risk they may have to cut vital service that include in patient bed and specialist community nursing provision this can not be allow to happen that be why urge the nhs in devon to listen to the case have make today and the minister to back my call it be high time for fair funding for our brilliant hospice in devon thank my hon friend the member for east devon simon jupp for secure this debate about the funding of hospice care in devon know that he be huge supporter of hospice in his area include sidmouth hospice at home and hospiscare we have hear this evening how passionately he campaign on behalf of the hospice that serve his constituency and how hard he be work to make sure they get the support and funding they need my hon friend may know other member in the chamber for certain know that respond to westminster hall debate in november on support for hospice service in south devon know this subject be of great interest to member who represent that part of the country as well as to colleague across the country all of we here recognise the importance of palliative and end of life care which support people at some of the most difficult time whether individual patient or their loved one most palliative and end of life care be provide by the national health service hospice be crucial part of the network of end of life and palliative care and they do truly wonderful job care for people during those difficult time experience that with my grandmother who spend the last few week of her life in hospice number of year ago they do wonderful job for she and her family as we spend some precious time with she towards the end of her life take this opportunity to send my thank to everyone work in palliative care whether in the nhs or in hospice for what they do to support people at that time and their loved one across the country thousand of people receive palliative and end of life care we have an age population with many people live with complex health condition approximately people die every year in the uk and it be demographic fact that that number will increase in turn likely increase the number of people need palliative and end of life care hospice specifically support more than people with life limit condition each year in addition to provide hugely important bereavement support most hospice be independent charitable organisation that generally receive funding from statutory source and charitable donation they be root in their local community and be cherish for the compassionate care that they provide indeed that funding model be one of hospice strength although many will receive funding through the nhs significant majority of their funding will be raise from their community that be part of the strong relationship they have with their community that diversity of funding be another strength of the hospice model on the source of funding for end of life care the minister talk about it be split model in which some be provide by the nhs and some provide as charitable donation and charitable giving the work of seaton and district hospital league of friends be fund by charitable giving the same be true for the model that axminster hospital league of friends be seek to set up with that funding the seaton league of friend build wing of seaton hospital yet it be expect that that will be give back to nhs property services what can the minister do about that the hon member raise that question in the westminster hall debate refer to he be talk about specific situation rather than spend the limited time have address that be keen to respond to my hon friend the member for east devon who have secure this debate on hospice funding in devon be talk about the enormous importance of hospice and their role in our community and the strength of have hospice in our community add to the significance of the care they provide mention my own experience hospice do this thing of make time that can seem completely unbearable become somehow bearable that make difference not only for the individual care for by the hospice but for all those around they let turn to devon specifically devon do reflect the national picture with nhs palliative and end of life service such as specialist nhs team community nursing care and marie curie night care service mention that because some people may think of hospice as the sole provider end of life care in any community the picture be broad than that but of course hospice be important indeed nhs devon have grant arrangement with four devon hospice that operate in patient bed in east devon specifically patient can receive end of life care in hospital at home in care home or from hospiscare or sidmouth hospice at home to which my hon friend refer in england integrate care board be responsible for the commissioning of end of life and palliative care service to meet the reasonable need of their local population as part of the health and care act palliative care service be specifically add to the list of service that an icb must commission reflect the importance of end of life and palliative care in our healthcare system add that will ensure more consistent national approach and support commissioner in prioritise palliative and end of life care in july nhs england publish statutory guidance on palliative and end of life care to support commissioner with that duty that include specific reference to ensure that there be sufficient provision of specialist palliative care service hospice bed and future financial sustainability acknowledge that hospice like many organisation and indeed household be have to contend with financial pressure include rise energy cost that be why charity include hospice have already benefit from the energy bill discount scheme which provide discount on high energy bill and be run until of march hospice may also be entitle to reduction in vat from to in addition to that in nhs england release billion in additional funding to icb to provide support for inflation icb be able to distribute that funding accord to local need it be therefore an option for they to support palliative and end of life care provider such as nhs contract hospice with rise cost from inflation recognise the financial challenge that hospice continue to face and the difficulty there be in raise fund from local community when people themselves be face pressure with the cost of living my hon friend make clear case for the financial support that the hospice in his area deserve encourage he to continue to argue that point it be good to hear that he have be in touch with his local integrate care board which be the organisation responsible for assess palliative care need in his community and ensure that the need be meet my hon friend be not the first member to ask to meet to discuss this topic or to call debate on it be work to increase the transparency and the information available to colleague and our constituent so that they can be assure about the provision of palliative and end of life care to that end have organise meeting next week with representative from nhs england and have invite member from across the house to attend it for an update on palliative and end of life care and to ask question directly of nhs england on this topic have welcome the opportunity this evening to talk about the wonderful work of hospice not only in devon but across the country assure my hon friend and other members present that be committed to support hospice to continue what they do so well in our community and to improve access to palliative and end of life care for people across the country whether that care be give by hospice or by the national health
