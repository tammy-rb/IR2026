right hon friend take the opportunity to remove it once and for all before the general election commend my hon friend who have be work diligently on this important issue our view be that we need to do

helpline receive report of homophobic abuse in care home over the past four year yet of the service provider account for in those allegation be still rat as good by the care quality commission will the minister work with cabinet colleague to end discrimination against lgbtq resident in care home to ensure they be safe in the care system and would she support the development of pride in care quality mark and an care champion scheme if only that cheer be for the hon lady raise really important point it be something feel really passionately about myself and it be go to increase in prevalence as we get generation become old because people have be more out in recent year have be speak to people about this important area of work and will continue to raise it with colleague in relevant departments prime minister the prime minister be ask engagements if he will list his official engagement for wednesday march know the whole house will join in congratulate vaughan gething on his election as welsh labour leader and expect election as first minister of wales and also in offer mark drakeford our good wish on his retirement the government lead will always work tirelessly to

inflation have fall to from its peak of over down by almost steep fall since the and now at the low level since september and people pay packet be go far with real wage grow for eight month in row and taxis be cut by for the average worker that be why we need to stick to the plan to deliver bright future for our country we now come to the leader of the opposition thank the prime minister for his word in welcome vaughan gething to his post as first minister of wales as the first black leader of any european government it be historic moment that speak to the progress and value of modern day wales also pay tribute to mark drakeford for his long steady service in wales with violent prisoner release early because the tories wreck the criminal justice system small boat arrival already this year because the tories lose control of the border the nhs struggle to see people because the tories break it million pay more on their mortgage budget that hit pensioner and billion hole in his sum why be the prime minister so scar to call an election as say in january my working assumption be that the election will be in the second half of the year must say think that out of everybody the leader of the opposition would be the most grateful because he have now actually get time to come up with plan for britain we be all look forward to finally see it oh we be ready just call it let we just take the prime minister rwanda policy when the tories first announce this gimmick they claim it would settle ten of thousand of people the home office then whittle it down to mere four time that number have already arrive this month and the backlog stand at can the prime minister see any flaw in his plan to deport less than of that backlog since become prime minister the number of small boat crossing be actually down by over third that be because we have double national crime agency funding and we have increase illegal immigration enforcement raid by we have close bank account deport illegal migrant and process over case more than at any point in the last two decade it be crystal clear as we be see from the labour party opposition in this house that while we be committed to stop the boat the labour party would keep they come the tragedy be we know the prime minister do not even believe in the rwanda gimmick he try to stop fund it but he be now so diminish that his entire focus be stop his mps hold the sword of damocles above his head perhaps even literally in the case of the leader of the house his great hope be to placate those in his party with couple of empty plane pray they will not notice when the flight stop go the boat be still come and the cost keep mount how have he manage to spend million of taxpayer money on gimmick to deport people it be crystal clear that not only do the labour party not have plan to fix this issue but the truth be it do not actually care about fix this issue the right hon and learn gentleman talk about gang when we give the police new power to crack down on the people smuggle gang he spend month campaign and vote against it but thank to our new law criminal have be arrest and have be convict serve over year behind bar if it be up to he those criminal would still be out on our street the truth be that if he be not the labour leader he would still want to be their lawyer hon member more order have prosecute more people smuggler than the prime minister have have helicopter ride and that be lot interruption have do it this rwanda gimmick be go to cost the taxpayer million for every one of his people that they deport know the prime minister like to spend lot on jet setting but that be some plane ticket it be the cost of tory chaos and it be work people who be pay the price the man he make his immigration minister let the cat out of the bag when he say the prime minister symbolic flight will not provide credible deterrent we know the prime minister himself think it would not work if the people sell this gimmick do not believe in it why should the country the right hon and learn gentleman be very keen to talk about who he prosecute he be bit less keen to talk about when he defend hizb ut tahrir but when it come to this question of how to deal with people who be here illegally his value be simply not those of the british people after all this be the person who campaign to stop the deportation of foreign dangerous criminal dangerous criminal be jail for deal class drug after he fight to keep he here gangmaster be convict of carry knife after he fight to keep he here so whether it be represent terrorist or campaign for criminal it be clear whose side he be on and it be not the british people it be genuinely sad to see the prime minister reduce to this nonsense let we take another example which start with interruption order after year of tory chaos in the prison system the justice secretary be reduce to beg the prime minister either to send few offender to prison or to release they even early must say have sympathy for anyone try to get an answer out of the prime minister so what be it go to be few criminal behind bar in the first place or more release early on to our street which be it thank to our record and plan violent crime have fall by we have recruit more police officer give they more power and keep serious offender in prison for long what be the right hon and learn gentleman record he vote against great protection for our emergency worker oppose tough sentence for violent criminal and fail to give police the power they need it would be back to square one with labour soft on crime and soft on criminal you can see why he do want an election mr speaker why his party have lose faith in he and why half his cabinet be line up to replace he no answer no plan no clue the prime minister have never have the courage to stand up to his party so let help he out and say to they what he wish he could say the mortgage mayhem the waiting list the criminal walk free they be the cost of tory chaos and if they can not bring themselves to stop the endless game and gimmick and stop put themselves before country they should pack up go home and waste somebody else time it be that difficult be it prime minister the right hon and learn gentleman talk about his idea but we be two week on from the budget the shadow chancellor find time to make one hour speech last night and we still do not know how labour be go to pay for its billion black hole but while he try to talk down britain and the progress we be make today news show that the plan be work inflation down energy bill down wag up pension up and taxis cut by that be the choice high taxis and back to square one with labour or tax cut and real change with the conservatives the uk birth rate be fall the while number of those require fertility treatment to conceive be rise there be no employment right attach to those undertaking fertility treatment and no pay time off work will the prime minister join in encourage employer large and small and across the united kingdom to sign up to the fertility workplace pledge that have launch with fertility matters at work lgbt mummies fertility network uk and many other to support those undertaking fertility treatment when they be in work may start by thank my hon friend for her excellent work campaign on this issue she be right employer should offer their staff understanding support and flexibility while they be undergo fertility treatment the good way to improve the experience of those undergo treatment both woman and their partner be through voluntary approach that be why join my hon friend in encourage all company to sign up to the fertility workplace pledge call the snp leader with his back benchers look for unity candidate to replace he which of the now numerous bear again thatcherites on the labour front bench do the prime minister believe good fit the bill it be surprising mr speaker to hear all this talk about the from the shadow chancellor in particular but if you see what be happen in place like birmingham where taxis be go up by and service be be cut whether that be social care child service or in some street the light literally be turn off it be unsurprise why they be talk about the just say that what they have do to birmingham the conservatives will never let they do to britain of course there be serious point to be make here because the institute for fiscal studies have warn of the conspiracy of silence that exist between the labour party and the conservative party when it come to billion of loom public sector cut indeed just last night it outline that the fiscal rule of the labour party and the conservative party be in effect identical with such continuity on offer the public be right to be anti westminster be they be surprised to hear the hon gentleman quote the ifs because it also describe the recent snp budget as in its word misleading and say that pain be almost certainly come it be savage tax and axe budget because here be the reality while nhs spending in england be go up in real term in scotland it be go down while taxis be be cut by the uk government the snp government be put they up that be the contrast and where the snp or indeed labour be in charge it be work people who pay the price the prime minister rightly often criticise the scottish government for the extra tax they put on resident in my part of cornwall we have an extra tax call the tamar toll have be work on petition with my constituency neighbour my right hon friend the member for plymouth moor view

something that the dup campaign to achieve when other be call for rigorous implementation of the protocol to his credit the prime minister be able to work with we to deliver the real change to the

partnership she will know that housing be devolved area but will happily look into the issue the prime minister should be aware that the people of romford be appal by the catastrophic reign of the

understand his desire especially with london be run by the labour mayor with nightlife decimate crime increase and the mayor raise taxis on hard work people by more than london can certainly do well the only way for pride to be restore in london be with susan hall as its new mayor sunday be the second anniversary of ferries illegal sacking of british seafarer despite what ministers have say have face no sanction and this government new code of practice on fire and rehire would not stop it happen again this parliament will be the bad on record for living standard and real wage be still worth less than in after year why have this government fail to deliver well deal for worker across britain as the chancellor recently point out living standard be high in real term than in if the hon

campaigner like herself the next five year will only look bright for wrexham last week the prime minister rightly call conservative party donor frank hester comment about my right hon friend the member for hackney north and stoke newington ms abbott racist it have since emerge that mr hester have make comment that group of indian member of staff should climb on the roof like on the roof of

horticultural nursery and piece of agricultural land will he point out that the last place to build home be prime agricultural land especially in an area where developer have enough permission to meet

community by build the right home in the right place make sure that everyone make good use of brownfield land conserve our countryside that be also the point he make which be important have be crystal clear we must protect agricultural land food security be incredibly important and we need our farmer to produce more great british food we know the prime minister have receive advice about the legality of the israel gaza war that he have have time to consider it and that government can and do publish such advice will he tell the house what step he be take to act on that advice in review uk arm sale in support the proceeding of the international court of justice and international criminal court and in exercise the uk vote at the un security council we continue to call for israel to respect international humanitarian law and for civilian to be protect too many civilian have be kill and we want israel to take great care to limit its operation to military target those be point that both and the foreign secretary have make repeatedly to prime minister netanyahu we have previously assess that israel be commit and capable of comply with international humanitarian law and of course we always keep that under review the prime minister will be aware of plan by national grid to build network of metre high pylon through much of rural lincolnshire this be cause much consternation particularly in rural village can my right hon friend assure my resident that when ministers finally consider the consultation that come forward from national grid they will give sympathetic consideration to put some of the section underground my hon friend be absolutely right to raise the concern of his constituent he will recognise the balance we need to strike by make sure that we give our country the energy security it need but do it in way that be respectful of the impact on local community will make sure that minister take into account the concern he raise and that all the view of local constituent be take into account give that the prime minister and his government day be number and that they will soon be in opposition will he use the small amount of time available to he to join united nations member state in recognise the state of palestine our position have be consistently clear we will recognise the state of palestine when it make the most beneficial sense for the overall peace process of course we be commit to an ultimate two state solution but in the here and now what we be call for be an immediate sustained humanitarian pause that would allow for the safe release of hostage include british national and would allow more aid to reach gaza we urge all side to seize the opportunity and continue negotiation to reach an agreement as soon as possible hmrc self assessment helpline urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer to make statement on the government decision to close the hmrc self assessment helpline every year between april and september you have good news minister thank you mr speaker thank the hon member for ealing north james murray and other for raise the important issue of hmrc customer service and its plan to provide well service for taxpayer as member probably know his majesty revenue and customs have announce that it be halt plan change to its helpline but aim to encourage more taxpayer to self serve online it have listen to the feedback and recognise that more need to be do to ensure that all taxpayer need be meet while also encourage those who can to make the transition to online service make the good use of online service allow hmrc to help more taxpayer and to get the most out of every pound of taxpayer money by boost productivity hmrc helpline and webchat adviser will always be there for taxpayer who need support because they be vulnerable or digitally exclude or have complex affair recognise that such reassurance be not communicate clearly enough yesterday of course the pace of this change need to match the public appetite for manage their tax affair online the change in the self assessment vat and paye helpline announce by hmrc will therefore be halt while it engage with stakeholder which mean that the phone line will remain open as usual hmrc will now work with stakeholder include while continue to encourage customer to self serve and gain access to the information that they need more quickly and easily by go online or to the hmrc app which be available thank the minister for his response but the question that be tempt to ask be who on earth be run the treasury this morning just after we have request the urgent question we find out that the chancellor have tell hmrc to pause this change that be turn of quite extraordinary speed and indignity follow hmrc announcement yesterday that it would be permanently close its self assessment helpline altogether for half the year from april to september this morning treasury source say minister have halt this change immediately imply that those ministers have be take by surprise by the announcement can the minister tell we whether any treasury ministers have any involvement in the decision announce yesterday or whether hmrc announcement be make without any ministerial involvement in announce the closure of the helpline hmrc second permanent secretary and deputy chief executive say that the change would allow our helpline adviser to focus support where it be most need help those with complex tax query and those who be vulnerable and need extra support can the minister confirm that hmrc plan to help those who be vulnerable and need extra support be now in tatter after the chancellor chaotic turn note that report of the chancellor position refer to pause of the change rather than scrapping of it altogether can the minister confirm that the self assessment helpline will now remain fully open this year if this plan be merely pause will hmrc still be look at month long period of closure of the helpline in the future it be clear that yesterday announcement of the helpline closure come not as part of comprehensive orderly or effective plan to help customer to move online but rather as panicked response to the collapse of hmrc service level to an all time low and it be clear from today chaotic turn that this government be fundamentally unstable and have give up on serious governing be sure the hon member be aware that hmrc be non ministerial department minister set strategy and work closely with the department on operation and communication it be important to recognise that people work for hmrc they go to work every day and try to do the right thing and it be important to recognise that many people there work very hard the overall strategy be absolutely right and completely support it and will give the hon member an example of why we need to encourage and support the move to online service in hmrc receive more than million call on just three thing that can easily be do digitally reset online password get one tax code and get one national insurance number that involve almost people work full time to answer just those call and such resource could be redeploy the hon member can be reassure that those who be not digitally savvy and those with difficulty will always be able to access service include telephone service call the chair of the treasury committee may thank the financial secretary and the chancellor for listen to the howl of pain that come from ordinary taxpayer when they see the announcement yesterday those who contact the hmrc hotline be the most law abide tax pay people across this land this morning the treasury committee have publish more datum show that it be increasingly difficult to contact hmrc by telephone while fully endorse what the minister have just say about the long term strategy to move people online it can not be do by randomly shut down hmrc telephone line the minister have an excellent digital track record in the private sector before he come into parliament may urge he to use that experience to make this much more of gradual transition for those law abide citizen of ours thank my hon friend and the select committee for their work in this area know that hmrc customer service have be an area of focus for she and other for some time and we appreciate the input recognise that she acknowledge the potential opportunity and the upside to encourage more people to go online but the point she make be really important hmrc have take the feedback with good grace because it be important that we move at the speed at which the public be willing to move of course some people be not willing or able to move to purely online service be sorry for not respond early to the hon member for ealing north james murray on whether the telephone line will stay open yes of course they will call the snp spokesperson this be absolute chaos the proposal to permanently close the self assessment helpline for half the year be truly half baked and irresponsible as be the plan restriction to the vat helpline the reversal be welcome but the fact that the announcement be make at all highlight the disconnect at the heart of hmrc customer operation as the federation of small businesses have point out customer service level be at an all time low view back up by the public accounts committee at time when the chancellor policy be fiscally drag more people into paye the proposal be typically tone deaf to people need fran heathcote of the pcs union have say that the combination of low pay and micro management be rife across the whole of hmrc customer service department the minister say that hmrc be non ministerial department but we know that it have be tell what to do by the chancellor overnight when do the government get notice of the announcement be it reaction to the chancellor decision to cut hmrc budget by billion next year will he now ensure that the cut be reverse and order hmrc to recruit more customer service staff and will he now instruct hmrc to make the reversal permanent as outline few moment ago think we can all appreciate that in order to serve customer and particularly those who most need support we need to ensure that those who do not need to go online have alternative channel by the way the customer service level be high in online channel and the use of the app which encourage all individual to use those who can go online will find very effective and efficient service so this be absolutely the right strategy and one that completely and utterly support we have also previously have trial closure of the line and the report release yesterday show that it work quite well the hon gentleman also ask about redeployment hmrc be proactive in notify people who for example do not need to provide self assessment form think more than million people be notify last year that they do not need to do so follow other change in government policy we have also communicate that those on high income up to for example but do not have complex tax affair do not need to provide self assessment return there be broad package go on here to enhance and improve customer service but we recognise that many people like and would prefer telephone service despite extensive government investment in rural broadband in my constituency there remain lack of connectivity with small business the elderly and the vulnerable still have difficulty go fully online what can the minister do to ensure that nobody will be leave behind in derbyshire dales my hon friend make the really important point that there be still people in this country include in her constituency who be not digitally aware or who be digitally exclude for variety of reason that be why an important part of our strategy be to ensure that those who be digitally exclude and those who be vulnerable or have particularly complex affair can always reach human being this be another chaotic government turn with the chancellor take the decision this morning to scrap plan to close hmrc phone line less than hour after the measure be announce treasury source admit this morning that close hmrc helpline would be to the detriment of the general public and the vulnerable who need access to the helpline to support they with tax matter this be part of wide malaise within tory break britain where many of my slough constituent can not speak to doctor when they want to can not register for an nhs dentist and much bad besides so why be this decision take in the first place mention in my opening comment will stress it again because it be important that nobody scaremonger about this that it be never intend and never would have be the case that the vulnerable the digitally exclude or those with complex affair would be unable to access these service even with the proposal set out yesterday on that particular point the hon gentleman be just wrong be grateful to the minister for his statement which welcome last september in this very place raise the issue of heavy fine be impose on self employ constituent for late submission of self assessment form even though no money be owe meet the minister in post at the time but will the current minister please write to with an update on progress thank my hon friend for raise this matter reiterate that there be very good reason why hmrc structure and relationship with government be as it be because it would be inappropriate for minister to interfere with individual tax affair however would be more than happy to raise his point with hmrc and respectfully ask that it pay it due attention of course the government set broad policy as former financial controller of small business in rural place have use those helpline extensively not least in sort out dispute when hmrc have get its datum wrong give that our own experience be that the website process be byzantine that the wait on the phone line be inordinately long and that billion of tax go uncollecte by hmrc every year how can anyone have any confidence that the treasury be work effectively very simply we have one of the low tax gap report in the world at about precisely because of the clarity of the tax system and the efficiency of hmrc in gain the tax that be owe of course there be customer service challenge and be have conversation with hmrc about that hmrc be also hold to account in the chamber the treasury select committee and elsewhere as appropriate it be important that we recognise that hmrc receive million telephone call and million piece of correspondence in if it be private sector business we can see how it would make sense strategically to move where appropriate as much of that activity as possible online where it can be deal with more appropriately and often more quickly the women and equalities committee which be currently carry out an inquiry on the right of old people this week meet independent age and range of stakeholder in andover they make the point that old people need to be able to access all service on the telephone as people who be disabled or have visual impairment find online service difficult to be able to communicate effectively people who be hard of hear need website with british sign language overlay independent age and the stakeholder meet be horrify at yesterday announcement on the closure of the helpline what consultation have there be with my hon friend the member for mid sussex mims davies in her expand role as minister for disabled people on the potential impact of these change when members of parliament deal with hmrc on constituency casework it now try to push we into use the telephone rather than email can the financial secretary assure that vulnerable people will still be able to use telephone service will he comment on the contradiction between how members of parliament and the public be deal with by hmrc assure my right hon friend that we be have live conversation with hmrc about how it communicate with member of parliament on behalf of our constituent some member tell that they would prefer telephone call whereas other would prefer email it be important that we have both be more than happy to communicate view and opinion from across the chamber on that point be well aware that one of the big area of concern about yesterday announcement and one of the reason why the feedback have be so loud be that vulnerable people include those with disability might not be help it be never the intention or the plan that such people would be unable to access online webchat or other channel the minister have speak about member of the public who be willing and able to access service online member have to complete our own self assessment form be willing and able but still need access to telephone helpline he say that people be need to answer the same three question which obviously can not be handle by the online system follow this announcement be he confident that hmrc have the digital tool necessary to cater for more than million self assessment taxpayer need to correct the hon lady as the vast majority of the point raise could be handle online include through the app one of the thing we must do be communicate far more clearly fair point have be raise in the chamber today and will continue to discuss it with hmrc because there be clearly some challenge with communicate what be available where help exist and so on but there be wealth of information on the digital offering particularly the app and encourage people to adopt they where possible the hon lady make valid point that people who can not adopt they will need other help and we be listen it be clear that hmrc make serious mistake and the government act commendably quickly in intervene to put matter right be sure they will now take close interest in what happen next as matter of policy will the minister ensure that whatever the future hold it will not be anything so sudden or brutal and that there will be trial period before anything so dramatic be implement across the board as mention few moment ago there have be trial closure of telephone service the recently report result show that the trial work quite well as we hear overnight and be hear again in the chamber today the important challenge be that the confidence behind that have not be effectively communicate the reassurance that personally receive on what will happen to help those who be not able to access online service include the disabled those without digital access and those with particularly complex case be not communicate that be important to make sure that as hmrc move forward and policy be develop we move at pace with which people be comfortable hope that hmrc screech turn be result of the minister action if it be congratulate he on step in so quickly do he agree that at time when more and more people be be drag into complex tax return because of fiscal drag when million people have their call to hmrc unanswered in january and when record number of people be put in their tax return late because they can not get information hmrc should not have adopt such policy will the minister give we an assurance that this be not temporary and that whatever help income tax payer require to pay their tax will be make available give the right hon gentleman an assurance on the latter point as have outline several time today think we can all recognise that the move to digital where appropriate will relieve the burden on the people answer telephone call and on some other service allow they to deliver precisely the end goal that he describe simplify the tax system be goal of government policy give an example of people on high income with relatively simple tax affair those who pay through paye for example and we be try to remove as many of those people as possible from self assessment completely understand the right hon gentleman point although decision on individual tax case be rightly manage independently by hmrc political and public pressure see this ridiculous decision squash what step will ministers take to improve the accountability and performance of hmrc there be variety of channel and tool include my ministerial oversight the treasury select committee and other body also play an important part be not suggest in any way shape or form that be remove myself from responsibility for hmrc as have ministerial oversight if colleague have concern they can always raise they with it be my job to raise those concern with hmrc refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests as chair the public and commercial services union parliamentary group do the minister accept that one of the more disgraceful aspect of this episode be that neither the trade union nor the staff appear to have be consult prior to yesterday announcement do he accept that this be no way to conduct industrial relation or to deal with staff how do he see yesterday announcement in the light of the public accounts committee comment that the department have to improve its ability to reach out to taxpayer and that it need additional resource why be the government now restrict customer access to the department hmrc and have hear and respect the view of the pac and other body include their recommendation and suggestion for improvement of course many of these body suggest that the continue move towards digital and online be an important part of that process as have say do not have day to day operational responsibility for hmrc but do have oversight proactively request meeting with the union several week ago and that be what have tend to do in all my ministerial role this be welcome turn but do my hon friend accept that one of the problem be hmrc chronic lack of productivity be that not make bad because so many people be work from home my hon friend be correct that focus on productivity be key and can assure he that these be exactly the kind of conversation that be have the chief secretary to the treasury be lead cross government review of productivity hmrc staff be require to work in the office for of the time have ask hmrc to assess and monitor the productivity of staff who be work from home versus staff work in the office and there be very little difference because of the concern express by my hon friend and other will keep an eye on it the reprieve be welcome but if we be to keep these helpline open can we at least resource they properly and make they work speak to chartered accountant in my constituency this morning and he tell that when he recently phone hmrc with complex query on behalf of client it take minute to get an answer when the phone be answer there be an acknowledgment of the problem he suggest that the answer might lie in his client wife datum be incorrectly order at which point he be tell that the staff be allow to handle only one case per call and that he would have to hang up and phone back with another minute wait for an answer surely that be no way to treat customer thank the right hon gentleman for raise that point and be happy to raise it with hmrc be regularly contact by constituent who have have poor service from hmrc as be sure many of my colleague be these people be pretty certain that they would still be wait have they not get their mp involve my constituent mr mccall retire to care for his terminally ill wife in but have since be chase repeatedly by hmrc to provide tax return for he do not use email and have describe the diabolical experience he have have with the phone line he wait minute for an automated voice and the line then go dead do the minister accept that that service level be not acceptable at all and thing must improve would he like to take the opportunity to apologise to mr mccall for the distress that hmrc have cause he yes be sorry to hear about those circumstance for the hon lady constituent as say have to be careful give the need to keep at arm length in individual case but she also raise broad policy point lot of training and work go on repeat that some people work for hmrc many of whom be dedicate hard work and well train individual and they often do thankless job but she make valid point and will happy raise that issue speak incorrectly few moment ago so may take the opportunity to correct what say mr speaker hmrc staff be require to work in the office of the time not of the time the government be force to extend the state pension top up through to april next year because of unacceptable delay on the department for work and pensions hmrc helpline for that issue the minister have mention that review will take place will that helpline be in its scope it be concern to many many constituent as say have ongoing engagement with hmrc it be operationally independent but do have some oversight and ministerial guidance be appropriate appreciate all the comment make by hon member today these will be live conversation and hmrc be listen to the conversation today will be happy to raise with it the point that she make first let thank the minister for positive response and for try to solve the problem we appreciate that constituent have tell my office about their struggle to get through to hmrc on the phone line there be no doubt that people still rely on service that allow they to speak to an individual that be so important as it be for we as mps we have million call unanswered in january alone which illustrate clearly the problem that the minister be try to address do he not see that there must be an enhanced service for all of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland to ensure that all call be answer and deal with the well option of personal phone call be right and we need drastic change to be make it be important that hmrc command respect to broad degree it do across the house and among our constituent because that be how we can ensure that we comply with tax requirement where there be confusion uncertainty or valid question it be important that people can get help advice and support for some people it be appropriate to go online to get that but that be not the case for everybody as say the comment make today be very much appreciated suspect that the hon gentleman will recognise that as have say many time it be important that all of we encourage and support the digitisation of these service and the adoption of the app by our constituent because that will help ensure that the time available be focus on those who most need help and support royal assent have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that his majesty have signify his royal assent to the follow act supply and appropriation anticipation and adjustments act national insurance contributions reduction in rates act trade comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership act bishop stortford cemetery act hong kong security legislation urgent question to ask the foreign secretary if he will make statement on the security and human right implication of article in hong kong thank my right hon friend for his urgent question yesterday hong kong legislative council pass new national security legislation unanimously under article of the basic law the bill which rush through the legislative process and be likely incompatible with international human right law will come into force on saturday since we have see hongkongers right and freedom deliberately erode as result of the beijing impose national security law and this law continue that pattern yesterday his majesty government make it clear that the law overall impact will be to far damage the right and freedom enjoy throughout hong kong it will enable the authority to continue their clampdown on freedom include freedom of speech assembly and the medium it will far entrench the culture of self censorship dominate hong kong social and political landscape it fail to provide certainty for international organisation include diplomatic mission operate there broad definition will negatively affect those who live work and do business there although britain recognise the right of all jurisdiction to implement national security legislation hong kong be also require to ensure that law align with international standard right and norm as set out in un treaty the sino british joint declaration and its basic law hong kong be an international city respect for the rule of law its high degree of autonomy and the independence of its well respect institution have always be critical to its success the british government have urge the hong kong authority to respect right and freedom uphold hong kong high degree of autonomy and the rule of law and act in accordance with its international commitment and legal obligation let conclude by welcome the contribution our grow hong kong diaspora make to life in the uk they be safe to live here and exercise the right and freedom that all other british resident enjoy we will not tolerate any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate harass or harm individual or community in the uk this law have no effect in the uk and we have no active extradition treaty with hong kong welcome the government statement but it do not go far enough article allow sentence of up to year imprisonment if an individual fail to disclose that another person indicate an intention to commit treason which include peaceful protest or voice discontent if journalist disclose information deem to be national secret they will be jail for year since the passage of the national security law in the people of hong kong have endure relentless oppression in contravention of the sino british agreement yet the uk have do very little to hold those responsible to account remind my right hon friend that the united states which do not sign that agreement have sanction people include senior individual in hong kong whereas the uk have sanction none have two question as result this legislation harmonise hong kong and china national security system with devastating consequence for human right it also change business and legal arrangement last year the us government warn us business that they can no long rely on the protection that the rule of english common law afford in hong kong why have the uk government not do the same for our business secondly we now know that foreign commonwealth and development office internal document show that the department pause target sanction against chinese official in november one document state fcdo have pause consideration of this work indefinitely as one of the parliamentarian whom china have sanction must say that that be terrible decision and it fly in the face of the evidence will the government publish those document and make statement explain why they no long wish to sanction chinese official thank my right hon friend for his comment which will deal with as good can he indicate just two or three of the defect in this appalling legislation he be right to identify they he do not ask whether the legislation be in breach of the sino british joint declaration in fact it be not the hong kong government be legislate for themselves the british government declare in that china be in ongoing breach of the sino british joint declaration my right hon friend ask about the rule of english common law and the warning give by the government of the united states the british business community be extremely experienced and well able to reach conclusion for itself but if ever the british government advice be seek we would always give it he talk about target sanction know that he be sanction hope that he will bear that with the necessary fortitude it be outrageous that he and other should be sanction in that way we do not discuss our approach to sanction on the floor of the house but my right hon friend may rest assure that we be keep all such matter under regular review call the shadow foreign secretary hong kong new national security law be the late degradation of the right and freedom of hong kong it be cause fear and unease not only to hongkongers but to uk and other foreign national live and work in hong kong as well as international business and organisation operate there and many outside hong kong article provision apply to hong kong resident and business anywhere in the uk we have see where that can lead there be the frankly appalling attack on protester in manchester in december what step be the uk government take to counter the threat of transnational repression especially towards the hongkonger who have come to the uk via the british national overseas passport route many will feel unsafe and unprotected and be deny access even to their own pension ask on their behalf do the minister accept that the law not only undermine the legally binding sino british joint declaration as the foreign secretary put it but represent clear breach if so will he say that to his chinese counterpart the minister say that he do not talk about sanction but it be of concern that although the us think sanction be appropriate the uk government seem to be sit on their hand in the constant absence of the foreign secretary can ask the minister whether the foreign secretary accept that his golden era with china be strategic mistake that undermine british influence over hong kong set we on rodeo of inconsistency towards china and fail to stand up for the uk national security interest can we expect the foreign secretary to deliver the strong clear eyed and consistent approach that be need thank the shadow foreign secretary for his comment agree entirely with what he say about article he chide for not say more on the issue of sanction the point be make hope that he will accept that this be common to both party when in government be that we do not discuss our application or consideration of sanction or sanction policy on the floor of the house but when we feel it be necessary to act we certainly do the right hon gentleman ask about the view of the foreign secretary give his long career and understanding of china from his time as prime minister the foreign secretary have speak out very clearly on the change that have take place since he be prime minister the right hon gentleman ask whether the legislation be breach of the sino british joint declaration as have say we decide in that china be in ongoing breach of that on the issue of whether it be breach of international law the bill specifically say that it will be compliant with international law suspect that the proof of the pudding will be in the eating the shadow foreign secretary slightly steal my script about the golden era of sino british relation trumpet by then prime minister cameron while the minister say that thing have change since then one thing have not change communist china be totalitarian state then and it be totalitarian state now be it not about time that the foreign commonwealth and development office learn that lesson my right hon friend speak with great experience on these matter from his time on the intelligence and security committee agree with he about the nature of china the question be whether china would respect the sino british joint declaration and recognise the uniquely brilliant feature of hong kong as an international trading city it be matter of great regret that politic have trump economic in that respect as perhaps it always will in the case of china call the scottish national party spokesperson thank the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith for secure the urgent question let try to get some answer from the government about response to what communist china have do and critically what we can do in the uk about confucius institutes back in may the open university brag about be the first online confucius institute until the government be allocate at least million to mandarin language teaching channel through university base confucius institutes will the minister confirm that that have stop there be some confusion about that in relation to the comment make by the shadow foreign secretary the government of country such as the united states and other believe that sanction be possible the netherlands and germany have discourage their university from engage with the confucius institutes sweden have go as far as would by ban they on provide answer there be practical thing that the united kingdom can do about what be go on in hong kong will the government consider end the right of confucius institutes in the uk and will the minister clarify the government allocation of funding to mandarin language teaching through those institute we be very much aware of the confucius institutes and the way in which they operate can assure the hon gentleman that we always keep such matter under review if we have any change to make to what we be do we will be sure to announce they in the house there be no doubt that article will have chilling effect on freedom and human right in hong kong it be design to far stifle all criticism of the chinese regime and its policy both inside and outside hong kong give the number of uk dual national in hong kong what plan do the government have to protect uk citizen from political persecution by china both here and in hong kong will the minister look again at extend the bno passport scheme to child bear before thank the chair of the international development committee for her comment as she know we create the british national overseas route in which create pathway to permanent citizenship for british national overseas passport holder it be work extremely well of course we always keep it under review but we have no current plan to change it it be suppose to be one country two system but that have clearly disappear the big picture be that it be increasingly clear that china be openly pursue compete interpretation of the international rule base order nowhere be that more evident than in hong kong the independence of the judiciary have disappear along with freedom of speech and of the press hong kong own democratic structure have be severely challenge and erode the new national security legislation will see the introduction of closed door trial detention for up to day without charge and the lowering of the bar of when life sentence can be impose believe my right hon friend the minister have business experience in hong kong so what impact do he think these new draconian measure will have on the international community do business with hong kong in the future thank the former chair of the defence committee for his question during my business career be in and out of hong kong very regularly it be quite extraordinary how hong kong brilliant pre eminence in business be be undermine by this legislation and indeed by much other legislation and act by the chinese government hong kong be build on independent institution high degree of autonomy and openness to the world all those thing help to increase the economic activity the living standard and the wealth of country or city and it be deeply regrettable that this do not appear to be recognise by the government of china this be yet another nail in the coffin of hong kong democracy and can not believe that we be here yet again talk about the matter my thought be with the family of hongkongers who be here they must be look at this and wonder what it mean for they the trade comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership bill be pass in this place yesterday and give that china be next in line to join we do not get cast iron assurance during the debate that britain would stop it from join the cptpp in his role as foreign minister would the right hon gentleman care to give that assurance now should china be join the cptpp while it be do thing such as this the hon lady be an extremely experienced parliamentarian and know that will not add to what my right hon friend the secretary of state for business and trade say here yesterday she do however talk about the threat to citizen in hong kong and here will add to what say early that we suspend our extradition treaty with hong kong in and that be absolutely the right thing to do why be the government continue with their policy of continuous appeasement of china do not recognise the point that my hon friend make we have relation with many regime whose value and view we do not share that be the nature of international diplomacy and international business none the less can assure he that british ministers be forthright in their interaction with their chinese counterpart as he would expect have some sympathy for the minister because think he share my sense of shame be one of the parliamentary delegation that go to hong kong after the one country two system deal go through our job as parliamentarian be to find out what local people think of the agreement can remember these all party group assure the people of hong kong that they would be safe and secure in their democracy and that it would not be challenge what the minister say be not very encouraging this be not just totalitarian communist dictatorship but ruthless dictatorship there be sanction that we could be take some of we in the house have beg the government to do an audit of the extent of chinese influence in this country include how many company they have take over how big be their influence it be massive the whole of the electrical distribution in london and the south east be directly own by chinese company surely we can take real sanction against that country which have go back on everything it promise over hong kong be most grateful to the hon gentleman for his opening sympathy and support which be always very welcome in respect of the audit of chinese involvement much of that work be effectively do by brilliant british investigative journalist he will have read as have many of the report that they have publish it be one of the difference between china and britain we have an open free and democratic system which enable we to scrutinise and pursue these matter in way that be not possible in china the message that this legislation send out be that political control trump all else include the economy bear that in mind what assessment have the deputy foreign secretary make of this national security law both in relation to economic stability competitiveness and performance in the city of hong kong not least in relation to the confidence of foreign investor and the potential impact on social cohesion my hon and learn friend make an extremely shrewd point the impact of this legislation be of course devastate in the area that he identify this be not legislation that be scrutinise in the way that we understand legislation to be scrutinise it be not subject to consultation or scrutiny by genuinely democratically elect member but that be merely one of the defect that have be identify during this session the all party parliamentary group on hong kong which chair hear very powerful testimony this morning from young hongkonger who have be political prisoner in hong kong we will now see more people endure the indignity of political imprisonment and the bno passport visa can be withhold on the basis of the applicant have be in prison surely that be something that must be review that be not matter as the right hon gentleman will appreciate only for we but he be right in his fundamental understanding as he have set out about the breach of the law that be go on as he might have see volker türk the un human right lead have say that it look on the face of it incompatible with international humanitarian law have also be at the hong kong all party group meeting this morning too hear the powerful testimony give by those pro democracy activist who have suffer so much in advocate their cause welcome my right hon friend statement in his opening he say that the law do not apply here of course it do not but that be not how the chinese see it it be for they an extraterritorial law it outlaw external interference that intend to interfere in hong kong affair ban the work of non governmental organisation advocate for human right and civil liberty and might also affect those hongkongers in the uk who be work in the uk civil service or the uk armed force can my right hon friend assure that active discussion be happen across government with the home office the ministry of defence and other to ensure that hongkonger live in the uk have the protection necessary against any future chinese prosecution my hon friend know great deal about these matter and speak with great wisdom on they he be right to speculate that these discussion be take place across government they take place through formal mechanism most of the time but suspect that he be concerned about the possible misuse of interpol which be an issue that have be raise and which we take extremely seriously in the requirement to protect individual right and uphold article of interpol constitution he may rest assure that we continue to watch over these matter with all possible concern and rigour thank the minister as always for his answer as have be state today the action be in clear breach of the sino british joint declaration and of human right law in which and other in this house take particular interest have hear clearly what the minister have say but number of concerned asian constituent in my area have contact about the message that this send to those who have leave the chinese regime they raise concern about the protection of those who live and work here if we can not hold the chinese to their word we have to ask whether anyone be safe what message do the minister have for my constituent at the end of his interesting contribution the hon gentleman ask philosophical question and think he seek rhetorical answer by the very way in which he express his question he make clear precisely what the danger be we have see throughout the trial of jimmy lai that this be political prosecution once again we call for his immediate release finally the hon gentleman talk about this be breach of the sino british joint declaration point that be make early as the hong kong government be legislate for themselves it may or may not be breach technically but we have be perfectly clear since that china be in ongoing breach of the declaration thank the minister for respond to the urgent question and the question of other present bill present tobacco and vapes bill presentation and first reading standing order no secretary victoria atkins support by the prime minister secretary oliver dowden the chancellor of the exchequer secretary james cleverly secretary gillian keegan secretary chris heaton harris secretary alister jack secretary david davies michael

note bill en private parking regulator bill presentation and first reading standing order no emma hardy present bill to establish regulator of privately own car park to make provision about the power and duty of that regulator and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill standard in public life code of conduct motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to provide for statutory code of conduct for ministers of the crown for statutory code of conduct for member of the house of commons and members of the house of lords for statutory code of conduct for councillor in england and for connected purpose we be here today in the mother of parliaments place that be steep in our country history from pass act of union to overthrow tyrannical monarch place that chartists and suffragette fight for the right to be in and place that have approve our country most important human right and equality legislation however many people across our great country and nation state feel that the mp and ministers who sit in the uk parliament and make new law on their behalf no long represent they people across the country feel that while they play by the rule too often too many of we do not they be engage every five year or so in general election but rarely in between while they struggle to make end meet public money be treat by some as personal fiefdom to bestow on their chum and benefactor when people lose faith in democracy they seek political extreme polling from the institute for government recently show that two third of our constituent say that they do not think the current government behave to high ethical standard likewise polling from the uk anti corruption coalition find that two third of voter believe that uk politic be become more corrupt our democracy be fragile and the reputation of those of we in this place as be in it for ourselves will if not tackle lie the groundwork for some of the country most abhorrent force that be what seek to address in the bill while be proud to be labour mp the bill be not party political the reality be that when one party be see as behave in way that lack integrity it affect not just that party but the reputation of politician on both side in the context of the cost of live crisis and the flail economy some might describe attempt at political reform as somehow ephemeral but that misunderstand that our political and economic crisis be two side of the same coin the failure to provide political stability have deter the private sector investment that we need to supercharge economic growth taxpayer money be be waste on scandal as wide range as carillion greensill and personal protective equipment procurement precisely because the seven principle of public life commonly refer to as the nolan principle selflessness honesty integrity leadership objectivity accountability and openness be not at the heart of public life my bill set out proposal to address the current gap in achieve those principle by define what be need to promote adopt and regulate the expect standard of behaviour of mps ministers and councillor first my bill would put the ministerial and member code of conduct on to statutory footing and introduce national statutory code of conduct for local councillor secondly it would establish new commissioner for ministerial standard fully independent office protect by statute thirdly to mirror that arrangement for mps it propose that the office of the parliamentary commissioner for standards which currently oversee the code of conduct for mps be establish as an independent statutory office finally it would establish new ethic commission to review how our parliamentary system can develop to reflect the modern inclusive empower democracy that we want to become in the century and beyond will take each measure in turn my bill propose that the ministerial code include the seven nolan principle be put on to the statute book that would bring we in line with the code in northern ireland and add both great credibility to and awareness of the code this measure have receive cross party support even the former chancellor george osborne tell the lead podcast that it would be great agenda to put the ministerial code on statutory footing wholeheartedly agree and that be what my bill would do it be absolutely right that the nolan principle which be currently guide principle would also be codify right honourable and honourable and lay colleague on the committee on standards have state though the independent adviser have not historically launch investigation into breach of process or constitutional principle neither the code nor the adviser term of reference make this clear my bill would address that lack of clarity by empower the new commissioner for ministerial standard to act independently from the prime minister and launch their own investigation into allegation of breach of the code the nolan principle as an independent and statutory office the office of the new commissioner for ministerial standard would also be protect from the vagary or displeasure of prime ministers we have very recently see prominent example of decision not to ask the current adviser on ministerial standard to conduct investigation decision make by the prime minister on the whim of the day the fact that in the last four year parliament have see two holder of the role resign indicate the tension regard those decision know that this measure also enjoy deep and widespread support include from the institute for government furthermore my bill propose that the parliamentary commissioner for standards should also become statutory office and that under its purview in addition to member be investigate for potential breach of code of conduct rule member could be investigate for serious and serial breach of the nolan principle paragraph of the members code expressly prohibit the commissioner from investigate allegation solely about breach of the seven principle of public life reform of our politic also need to extend to town hall across the country we all know from our constituency that the vast majority of councillor work tirelessly try to make difference in their community but unfortunately minority use their position for their own purpose and threaten our democracy as result my bill would also apply to local councillor who be often member of the public first contact with an elect official if we rightly want to empower council and community to do more and because as us congress speaker tip once say all politic be local we must strengthen code of conduct in local government my bill propose standardise national councillor code of conduct which include the nolan principle and be accompany by statutory accountability system finally turn to how we address the issue that raise at the beginning of my speech the disengagement of people from the political process and the dangerous decline of our democracy my bill would set up an independent ethic commission of constitutional and legal expert to advise parliament on system wide reform the ethic commission would work alongside citizen assembly to come up with recommendation to restore confidence and rebuild engagement in our political system secure our democratic future urge member on both side to support my bill to strengthen our standard in public life and to restore the public trust in we as their elect representative in parliament question put and agree to order that debbie abrahams dr dan poulter layla moran and caroline lucas present the bill debbie abrahams accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday april and to be print bill point of order on point of order mr deputy speaker refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be chair of the all party parliamentary group on dentistry and oral health when launch the nhs dentistry recovery plan exactly six week ago the secretary of state for health and social care repeatedly assure the house that the plan be back by million of new funding she say there be million on top of the billion that we already spend on nhs dentistry in england she make that very clear add this be additional money have prioritise dentistry across the board but this be million of additional money in addition to the billion that we spend in england official report february vol we be all therefore very surprised to hear the under secretary of state for health and social care the right hon member for south northamptonshire dame andrea leadsom explain to the health and social care committee yesterday that the plan to deal with the crisis in nhs dentistry be not in fact back by any additional investment she explain that it be all come out of the billion that be currently so underspent as those two statement stand in direct contradiction with one another fear that either the secretary of state or the minister may have inadvertently mislead the house as we celebrate world oral health day hope that you may be able to advise mr deputy speaker on how we can seek clarity on this issue and have the record correct on the floor of the house thank the hon member for her point of order and for give forward notice of it she will know that minister be responsible for the accuracy of what they say in the house whether in the chamber or before select committees although it be not matter for the chair those on the treasury bench will have hear her concern and if the minister or the secretary of state think that correction be necessary be sure that one will be forthcoming post office horizon system offence bill second reading relevant document third report of the business and trade committee post office and horizon redress instruction to deliver beg to move that the bill be now read second time be pleased to present the bill for its second reading it will quash the conviction of those affect by the post office horizon scandal in england and wales one of the great miscarriage of justice in our nation history the legislation will clear the name of sub postmaster whose life be ruin because of the horizon scandal those wrongly convict of or caution for offence of false accounting theft and fraud all because of faulty it system that the post office have implement instead of listen to whistleblower such as alan bates when they raise concern the post office viciously pursue they for the shortfall some be suspend or dismiss hundred be prosecute convict and imprison other be harry as thief by their local community several be drive to suicide the government can not turn back the clock or undo the damage that have be do but we will seek to right the wrong of the past as good we can by restore people good name and ensure that those who have be subject to this tragic miscarriage of justice receive fair and full redress the bill represent crucial step in deliver that the whole house appreciate the effort that the government be make to rectify this problem at last but appeal to they to listen to the cross party representation make from both side in this house and all side in northern ireland include by the first minister the deputy first minister and the justice minister for northern ireland who have appeal for the few than people in northern ireland who have be affect by the scandal to be include in the bill we be work closely with the northern ireland executive we have carefully consider the territorial extent of each piece of legislation and we be rigorous in our commitment to devolution the hon gentleman should be assure of the amount of work that be take place to ensure that we get the bill do properly in way that will not have unintended consequence thank he for that point this new legislation will quash all conviction that meet the clear and objective condition lay out in it we recognise that postmaster have suffer too much for far too long which be why conviction will be quash automatically when the bill receive royal assent remove the need for people to apply to have their conviction overturn be extremely grateful to my right hon friend for give way understand entirely why the bill be necessary she will agree that it be important that we do not through the bill set any precedent for the interference of this house in individual conviction unless there be exceptional circumstance such as these that mean that the bill must be tightly draft at the moment condition the last of the condition that she have mention be that at the time of the alleged offence the horizon system be be use for the purpose of the post office business why be that not phrase differently to say that horizon base evidence be present in the case against the person convict there be material difference between those two thing just seek to understand why she have choose that formulation rather than the alternative my right hon and learn friend make good point about the final condition in the bill that be something that we consider but it would likely have require case by case file by file assessment of each prosecution that would have add significant time and complexity which be what our solution avoid one thing that have be keen to emphasise be that speed and pace be critical this have take far long than would have want and would not have go for solution that would have impede this and create complication put on the record my thank to and commendation for the under secretary of state for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for the way in which he have approach the groundwork for the bill among those exclude from the scope of the bill be those who go to the court of appeal and lose their case or be not give leave to appeal to the court what we now know would have be quite useful in many of those case should we enlarge the scope of the bill to include those who lose their case at the court of appeal or be not give leave to appeal in the first place as many of they may well be truly innocent thank the right hon gentleman for that point that be also something that we consider carefully it be part of the trade off that we have to make in do something unprecedented parliament overturn conviction we respect the judgment of the court of appeal it have go to an appellate judge we be willing to consider some of those case individually just to ensure that nothing have be miss but the bill have be draft in consultation with the crown prosecution service and the judiciary we want to ensure that we be bring everyone with we concern such as his have be raise but this be more or less the consensus that we think will get the bill do and allow redress as quickly as possible will elaborate on this point far when speak hopefully if catch mr deputy speaker eye but there be already datum about the case that the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne refer to those that be outside the horizon case itself but be attempt to get themselves exonerated on the basis of other datum as far as can see they fail precisely because they be not part of the horizon case so ask the secretary of state to return to this issue before report and look at whether we can solve that problem thank my right hon friend for that intervention that be something we can look at again at further stage of the bill we understand the issue that hon member be try to resolve and agree with they that we need to make sure that everybody who deserve justice get justice but we also have to be careful to make sure that we be not exonerate people who we know for fact have commit crime be grateful to my right hon friend for give way and commend her work and that of my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake not only in recognise the plight of these people and put in place compensation for their suffering but in ensure that these criminal conviction be expunge from their record it be really important for these people that they regain their standing within their community as my right hon friend have rightly say so many of these whistleblower be fail by the current law the public interest disclosure act it be really vital that we not only put that right but have good look at the law again know that framework review be go on and have speak to my right hon friend and my hon friend about what more can be do have table whistleblowing bill that will sort this problem out it land within the department for business and trade it be something that be within my right hon friend gift will she support my private member bill on friday thank my hon friend for all the work she do in chair the all party parliamentary group for whistleblowe she be right that this issue need consideration and we be go to look again at the whistleblowing framework it be something that come up time and time again in many respect will not comment yet on her private member bill because have not see it but thank she for all her work on this issue welcome this bill know that it be groundbreake and possibly set some nerve off with the judiciary but think the judiciary need to look at themselves and how they have deal with some of these case on the point that my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne raise small number of case be not within the scope of the bill perfectly understand why but we have to get those case look at again because evidence have come out in the sir wyn williams inquiry that be not available at the time will the secretary of state commit to at least sit down with the judiciary to look at these case and emphasise the fact that there be new information and that responsibility for some of this injustice have get to lie with the justice system thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention the court deal very swiftly with the case before they perhaps bit too swiftly that be why the sub postmaster suffer so many miscarriage of justice and it be right that we make their exoneration as simple and quick as possible so while my priority be pass this bill for the bulk of the people who have suffer that do not mean we will not be able to look at other scenario later and see if we can find solution where we genuinely believe that there have be miscarriage of justice that be not for to do at the dispatch box it will not be up to ministers there will be caseworker who will carry out that work but we have to be careful to make sure that we be exonerate the right cohort hear what the secretary of state say but would just say to she that this be small number of people and they have to be look at can ask that she show the same zeal that her hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake have show in his approach to this process we need commitment not to get these case sort today accept that the secretary of state can not do that but that the department will look at they think that will send quite strong message out to people the department can always do that this be something that we believe be so critical in order to make sure everybody get the justice they deserve and we need to make sure that we carry out the process in such way that everyone have confidence in it we can continue to look at case and see if there be other solution but as the right hon gentleman have rightly say that will be outside the scope of this bill be very grateful to the secretary of state for give way and also pay tribute to the exceptional work of my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake and the way in which he have engage in what be sensitive issue not least constitutionally do my right hon friend accept that it be not ideal under any circumstance for this house to trespass upon the legitimate preserve of the independent court it should only do so under the most exceptional circumstance there be case that this be one of those instance but while we can legitimately criticise failing in the criminal justice system such as in disclosure which be part of the system it be important that we do not get into the territory of impugn the individual decision of judge make in good faith on the evidence properly before they one thing we could do to emphasise the exceptional nature of the bill would be to introduce sunset clause so that at an appropriate time when the bill have serve its purpose perhaps some way in the future once those who need to be find and contact have be able to come forward and have their conviction quash it would no long be the constitutional anomaly that it might otherwise be if it stay on the statute book indefinitely be very happy to consider sunset clause my hon and learn friend make very good point and really appreciate the fact that he can see the tightrope that we be walk get justice for postmaster while not interfere with judicial independence think it be important that we emphasise the wholly exceptional nature of this legislation but we be deal with wholly exceptional circumstance we hope the point about disclosure be one that can not make strongly enough and we have to look again at our presumption about machine and what they produce when it come to criminal litigation can press my right hon friend to reiterate the wholly exceptional nature of this legislation think we need to be careful when it come to sunset clause because we do not want to end up frustrate the purpose of the bill which be to deal with the hundred of people who have lose faith in the system and might be difficult to track down and identify be not particularly in favour of sunset clause but we do need to emphasise the exceptional nature of this legislation be grateful to my right hon and learn friend for his intervention be very happy to emphasise that and will do so again later in my speech do enjoy it when we have two lawyer who disagree on particular point will be take this as their application to join the bill committee the bill include duty on the government to take all reasonable step to identify conviction that have be quash it also create duty to notify the original convict court so that record can be update and people good name can be restore other record such as police record will be amend in response the bill make provision for record of caution for relevant offence relate to this scandal to be delete while the financial redress scheme will be open to applicant throughout the uk the bill measure to overturn conviction will apply to england and wales only we on the business and trade select committee hear absolutely harrowing account from postmaster of what they have go through as consequence of the post office action but many of those case take place many year ago can the secretary of state be confident that the audit process in an organisation such as the post office will in future identify what have happen at an early stage and do she agree that legislation such as this should never come before this house again that this should not happen believe that the inquiry be lead by sir wyn williams be currently look at that issue it be important that audit process work at the high level and that people be able to rely on and have confidence in they so thank my hon friend for raise that point on the question of territorial coverage as say early to the hon member for north antrim ian paisley my department will continue work closely with the northern ireland executive and the scottish government to support their approach to address this scandal ensure that every postmaster who have be affect receive the justice they deserve irrespective of where in the united kingdom they be indeed my colleague and hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake the minister for postal affair have already meet justice ministers in the scottish government and the northern ireland executive to offer our support accept that the department be very keen to respect the devolved settlement in both northern ireland and scotland but can stress to the secretary of state that there be political consensus in northern ireland and ministers in the newly restore executive would welcome parliament act in this particular area due to the nature of devolution in northern ireland we have to have public consultation so in the good case scenario we be look at well towards the end of this year before we can replicate legislation here in westminster as this be national scandal it do require national solution to avoid situation of inequity in which some postmaster in part of the uk be exonerate while other be still wait take the point the hon member make very seriously we do understand but we want to make sure that we do not create any possible unintended consequence by legislate on devolve issue so we be work hand in glove with the northern ireland executive to make sure this go through as quickly as possible we know that the number there be much small and that the postmaster there have be identify he be right to raise the point but want to reassure he that we have every confidence that we will be able to get this do at the same pace could put that question in slightly different way the minister for postal affair have set out an ambitious timetable for the passage of this law the overturning of conviction and the dispensation of compensation with it all possibly be do and dust with hope and follow wind by the end of july could the secretary of state commit to similar timetable when it come to the case that have be raise in northern ireland that be certainly something we can encourage the executive to work to but can not personally make that commitment because it would not solely be up to however just want to reassure the house that this be something we care about we be not prioritise england and wales because it be england and wales we be do what we can as quickly as we possibly can to make sure that we do not create problem later by rush and not do thing properly think that that be good and ambitious target but it would not be up to to make such commitment be aware that the approach we be take in this bill be novel one with it parliament be take function usually reserve for the independent judiciary as my right hon and learn friends the members for kenilworth and southam sir jeremy wright and for south swindon sir robert buckland and my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill have say however be equally aware that the postmaster long and punish fight for justice must now be swiftly draw to close the circumstance surround the scandal be wholly exceptional and they demand an exceptional response from government so would like to take this opportunity to reassure the house that the introduction of the bill be in no way reflection on the court and the judiciary which have deal swiftly with the case before they would like to commend both the secretary of state and her team for bring forward this bill the sub postmaster have face miscarriage of justice that have take many people breath away be aware that this be specific and focused legislation but two south ribble constituent come to see who have be royal mail customer and they describe scenario of prosecutorial practice very similar to what sub postmaster be subject to would the secretary of state consider expand the scope of the legislation in future to other people who may have be subject to poor treatment thank my hon friend for her intervention can look specifically at the case she raise but think they may actually be cover by this bill would be wary of expand the scope too broadly the consensus we have with the cps the judiciary and so on have be achieve by the legislation be very tightly scope but we do want to make sure that people who have be at the end of an injustice can have those wrong right be very happy to look at the specific case of her constituent be very clear that this bill be about correct conviction that be make in error however there be of course number of employee direct employee of the post office who be never convict but have their good name ruin and their career destroy and have find it very difficult to gain employment because they be unable to get reference from their previous employer indeed probably the bad thing that happen to they be that they be identify in their community as people who be perhaps steal from pensioner or treat member of their community unfairly this bill will do nothing for they could the secretary of state outline what the post office be do to contact those individual who be discipline by the post office and dismiss so that they too can have justice thank my hon friend for that question he be right that many people have their reputation traduce because of what happen with the horizon scandal where shortfall be falsely make by the post office and they have to pay we have compensation scheme to address those sort of wrong because this bill be specifically about overturn conviction it can not apply to they but where they have suffer other damage we have compensation scheme that we hope will apply in those circumstance we have not take the decision to legislate in this way lightly give the factually exceptional circumstance of the horizon scandal the number of postmaster involve and the passage of time since the original conviction it be right that the state now act as quickly as possible any further delay would be add further insult to injury for postmaster who have already endure what believe be an arduous wait indeed some have lose trust in the system and want no further engagement in many case the evidence they would need to clear their name no long exist however must make two point clear to the house first the government position be that it will be parliament not the government that be overturn the conviction so there will be no intrusion by the executive into the proper role of the judiciary secondly this legislation do not set any kind of precedent for the future it recognise that an extraordinary response have be necessitate by an extraordinary miscarriage of justice on this bill receive royal assent no further action be require by the victim of this scandal to have their conviction quash the government will take all reasonable step to notify the relevant individual and direct they to the route for apply for compensation further detail of this process will be set out in due course the secretary of state be be characteristically generous in give way again the evidence the select committee hear be that many people seek compensation for the injustice they have suffer find it very complicated and very confusing to understand the range of case law require to put in particular kind of claim for example for loss of reputation when she trigger the notification provision would she reflect on something she could add which be tariff to help people put in claim for the right kind of compensation what none of we would want to do have overturn the conviction be to let people get short change on the compensation provide standardised tariff could cut through so much of the complexity and help people get what they be due thank the right hon gentleman know that be recommendation from his report and it be something we be actively look at and consider as the bill progress through the house there will be many suggestion that we will be able to look at to see whether it can be improve in any way however we must make sure that we do so in way that do not jeopardise any of the objective of the bill any of they at all as be say further detail will be set out in due course and there will be process for anyone to come forward where their conviction meet the criterion but we have be unable to identify they the new primary legislation will be follow by route to rapid financial redress on basis similar to the overturned conviction scheme which be currently administer by the post office so we do not need provision in the bill to deliver that scheme my department not the post office will be responsible for the delivery of redress relate to the quashing of these conviction the minister for postal affair will return to the house at later date to provide detail on how we intend to deliver that redress welcome the change that have be make in the compensation some of the proposal for example for fix sum be go to make lot of case easy to sort out do not feel comfortable have the post office anywhere near this frankly and neither do the sub postmaster will the secretary of state think about system of compensation that in practice cut out the post office there be no trust there among the sub postmaster do personally have any faith in the post office no do not thank the right hon gentleman that be one reason why my department will be look after the redress deliver by the scheme let reinforce the point make by the right hon member for north durham mr jones there be people write to this week about the current handling of their case by the post office and post office lawyer frankly it be barbaric the post office need to be take out of it reassure my right hon friend that this be something be look at in great detail the post office have clearly be dysfunctional organisation for very long time and that be one reason why have be actively take step to look at the management and process in place which as he rightly say many of the sub postmaster have lose faith in it go without say that work to offer prompt financial redress alongside the bill continue as of march conviction have be overturn through the court of those case people have claim full and final redress and of those have reach settlement the post office have pay out financial redress totalling million to postmaster with overturn conviction under the horizon shortfall scheme as of march eligible claim have be submit the vast majority of which have be settle by the post office and million have be pay out in financial redress include full and final settlement and interim payment finally under the group litigation order scheme work from the same date claim have be submit have be settle by my department and million have be pay out in financial redress include full and final settlement and interim payment official in my department be work hard to get those case settle quickly and we have make offer within working day in response to of complete claim in summary the bill amount to an exceptional response to scandal that be wholly exceptional in nature and have shake the nation faith in the core principle of fairness that underpin our legal system we recognise the constitutional sensitivity and unprecedented nature of the bill but believe it be essential for we to rise to the scale of the challenge the hundred of postmaster catch up in this scandal deserve nothing less of course no amount of legislation can fully restore what the post office so cruelly take from they but hope the bill at least begin to offer the closure and justice that postmaster have so bravely campaign for over many year and that it afford they the ability to rebuild their life for that reason commend the bill to the house be pleased to be at the dispatch box to welcome the bill in do so candidly recognise the difficult legal and constitutional position it represent will outline why believe it be require and the exceptional nature and caveat that we should all realise on second reading the horizon scandal be quite simply one of the most egregious miscarriage of justice in british history it rob people of their life their liberty and their livelihood as we now know drive by misguided belief that technology be infallible and worker dishonest the post office prosecute innocent people indeed they be the very people in whom the post office should have have the most faith those who deliver vital service in all our community those prosecution cause unimaginable pain and suffering which no amount of compensation can ever alleviate to add insult to injury the journey to justice for the sub postmaster have be mire in great many delay and barrier some of the people affect have tragically pass away before have have the chance to see justice the bill will free hundred of innocent people of their wrongful conviction and it afford we the chance to make huge stride in right the wrong of the past that be why labour will give it our support however this must be just one of several step still to come if amend be ever to be make for this most insidious of injustice the conviction must be overturn compensation must be deliver at pace and justice must be seek from the independent inquiry we must recognise today for what it be victory for the sub postmaster to have the strength of character to lose everything and then to get back up and fight be truly humble and the recognition and admiration that those people have earn be absolutely right nevertheless member across the house will be acutely aware of the unprecedented nature of this legislative action we all recognise that we should not have need to get to this point and it be important to explain why we be take this step why we believe this be an exceptional case and why therefore this should never be repeat in future hope in this speech to do that wish to recognise the work of the many people who have get we to this landmark occasion first no member could deny that we would not be where we be today pursue this particular route be it not for the recent itv drama mr bates vs the post office although the horizon post office failure be scandal to which the house have be respond for some time the drama bring the story to wide audience and reinvigorated the campaign it be powerful reminder of the way that art and culture can be use to tackle injustice and raise public awareness thank everyone who be involve in that project include my constituent julie hesmondhalgh secondly pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones and lord arbuthnot in the other place and all those colleague who champion constituency case from the beginning their tireless campaigning have be instrumental in get we here to today thirdly want to recognise the attention that the under secretary of state for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake have give this matter and the progress he have achieve so far thank he for work cross party on the design of this legislation and for keep and my hon friend the member for birmingham ladywood shabana mahmood regularly update also note that the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully who be in his place be the first to get to grip with this scandal in the way that be require he will be leave this place in the come month and hope that will do so with sense of pride in the work he do and thank he very much for it however today must be moment when above all else credit and recognition go to the sub postmaster and their courageous search for justice they have be unrelenting and undeterred and we owe they great deal to be jail or bankrupt because of faulty it and to have no one believe that their character matter more than number on spreadsheet be why the scandal strike such nerve with the public without the bravery of the sub postmaster we might never have know that this injustice take place it be worth take moment to reflect on that the bill will overturn case that be prosecute by the post office and crown prosecution service we know it be vital step in the course for justice for sub postmaster but we also recognise that do so undermine fundamental principle of our democracy the separation of the judiciary and the legislature overrule the court in this way could set an incredibly dangerous precedent and one that hope we will never use again in an era of ever creep populism there be real threat that the well intentione action we take today could be abuse in future for completely unwarranted purpose concur with my hon friend statement about the separation of power do he agree that it be time for the court and judicial system to reflect on their role in the scandal and on why they do not raise red flag when they should have do the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill say that we should not criticise individual judge but some of they act in way that frankly say this know some of the case as do do not reflect the good of our judiciary my right hon friend make powerful contribution many thing go beyond the bill and the independent inquiry that we be currently look at regard the role and experience of our constituent in the legal system how government and executive agency function and the evidence give to ministers and the accountability we seek from that great deal have to change as result of this understand his point thank the hon gentleman for give way he be be generous with his time do he also agree that we must look not only at how lawyer have handle this but more importantly at those who produce the evidence in the first place to persuade prosecution hope he will agree that lesson must be learn by those who blindly say these people be probably guilty and build up case around that when as we have find that be not the case thank the right hon member for make those powerful point which reflect on the nature of the evidence that be give one of his hon friend have already make the point about the role of technological computer base evidence in the legal process to be frank there be also the post office approach to the datum as it see it which assume it believe to be way of unveil wrongdoing rather than question that datum most of our constituent ask how could the number of conviction have go from five or six year to or without that be flag in some way clearly the power that be at the time think the datum be reveal wrongdoing rather than necessarily reveal something go wrong we can see from the contribution we have already have that all member participate in today debate and who will participate in the bill future stage be mindful that what we be say be not only important but might be reference in future consideration in that vein let clearly state that this legislation although far from ideal be the only option on the table for we to resolve this horrible injustice but let further state that any incoming labour government would never use this kind of action again there be exceptional circumstance to this case that make it unique rather than it be moment to set precedent for handle any future injustice the post office horizon scandal take place over decade and there be at least decade worth of investigation that demonstrate the falsehood behind many of the conviction make against sub postmaster that bank of evidence will only grow from the independent inquiry lead by sir wyn williams the challenge to right this wrong be not lack of clear evidence but sheer volume of case that be overwhelm the appropriate route to justice through the court of appeal lament that our justice system be under such strain and it would be remiss of not to point out that well service criminal cases review commission could have avoid the extraordinary step that we must now take in addition we must also recognise that cohort of sub postmaster with conviction be understandably reticent to take part in another process in criminal justice system that so badly fail they the first time around for the purpose of the historical record an important qualification for take this step be the scale of cross party support that the legislation be attract have raise that point with the minister before and believe it to be an essential safeguard may thank the shadow secretary of state for his cross party and collaborative approach which have bring we significant step forward recognise the point he make on the scale of the problem which be why we have to act in this way it be probably the least bad option for how we deal with this may push back gently on his point that we have only start to act significantly since the tv drama we welcome the public outcry that come as result of the drama the new attention that have be focus on the issue and the new claimant who have step forward but push back because it be important that the public know that we be act prior to the drama we implement the shortfall scheme in the inquiry back in and the glo compensation scheme in the horizon compensation advisory board be put in place early in and the fix sum award of be put in place in autumn last year we also have the overturned conviction and the exploring of different way to do that on mass basis all these thing be in place by the time of the post office horizon system compensation act which we consider in december last year and which the shadow secretary of state and speak to during its consideration much work have be undertake we very much welcome the new impetus we have all get from the attention that the drama have bring about be always keen to hear from the minister think be fair in make the point he raise in my introductory remark simply make the point that the constitutional significance of legislation like this require level of public consent the statement that the prime minister make in january just after prime minister question would not have be possible without the sheer breakthrough in public consent and the demand for change and for justice that come from that will always be fair to the government ministers and point out even to some of their critic that we be deal with thing we have the legislation that colleague have work on it be fair to say there be less interest in some of that in the chamber before we have the television programme but let we be frank that we have the impasse of people not want to go back to the process the estimate we have at the time be to year that be what bring we to that point and we have to recognise that as well as pay tribute to the role that art and culture can play in bring thing to an audience which we should welcome finally think speak for everyone in the chamber when say that in no way do anyone take lightly what we be propose to do today this action be unprecedented and we should make every effort possible to ensure that such action never again have to be consider this legislation be not totally the first precedent there have be case relate to people who be shoot in the first world war for cowardice and then exonerate after the event and so on do the shadow secretary of state agree with the notion that we should put sunset clause on this provision to ensure that it in no way become precedent when we look at the precedent it be interesting to note that there be clearly legal difference between quash conviction and pardon after an event have take place which be the precedent we be more familiar with be receptive to what colleague be say about sunset clause from judicial or safeguarding point of view clearly we want to capture as many people as possible who deserve to have their conviction quash when we get to committee which assume will be on the floor of the house be sure there will be an attempt to do that be not the point about sunset clause that none of we know what be around the corner or what the future hold once this legislation have expire the law of sod dictate that somebody somewhere will come up with case that require to be deal with that be eminently possible sunset clause would serve no useful purpose other than smooth few ruffle judicial legal feather hear what the right hon gentleman be say and we do not want to do committee stage on second reading we be hear about the necessity of ensure that where case fall beyond the specific circumstance to be fair to the government understand why the legislation have be draft in this way to address this particular cohort for simplicity and straightforwardness they can still be identify some of that could be do on the number but we will have time to explore this matter in committee on the issue of consent the shadow secretary of state be right to point out that all side of the house have consent to this legislation and that be what make law change flow much easy lot of good will have be express about northern ireland and increase the territorial extent of this legislation but that good will butter no parsnip as someone else in the house often say the fact of the matter be that ultimately we must ensure that northern ireland be include in this legislation if motion come forward to instruct the house to extend the bill to cover northern ireland would the opposition support it so that those fine word and good will be turn into strong action will say something specifically about the territorial extent of the bill but the straightforward answer be yes there be circumstance here to which we should listen hope the hon member will not mind say this but when all political party in northern ireland be in agreement on something it be usually worth listen and understand why that might be the case will address specifically how we might deal with that matter later in my remark the shadow secretary of state be make brilliant speech do he agree that we might want to reflect on measure to de risk the speed of pay compensation it be important that we overturn conviction but it be also right that we accelerate compensation just because the department be run the scheme be not necessarily guarantee that payment will flow quickly this morning the business and trade committee crunch the datum on the glo scheme and unfortunately it would appear that of offer have take more than day have take more than day and have take more than day we obviously need to get the measure right and there be lot of issue at play but de risk the speed of compensation sound like something we should reflect on thank my right hon friend for those remark and for all the work the select committee have do to assist this process he be right to say that while it be one thing to pass the bill what everyone want be for it to be route to speedy compensation as soon as possible welcome some of the change we have see such as the optional up front payment available to people to get through some of the complexity of the case when the select committee publish its report it look at the recommendation to include in the bill deadline for the government to pay compensation but we have since receive useful information about how binding limit might restrict the most complex case in an undesirable way in his closing remark will the postal affair minister undertake on behalf of the government to reflect on that point because everyone will want to be able to say we care and we have push forward the need for compensation payment to flow smoothly have to say to my good friend the shadow minister that this be where depart from the select committee the advisory board have be very clear that we need to make the system simple to be fair to the government they have listen on the lump sum payment what we need be to get those simple case out of the system be not sure they be concentrate on the complex case know the nature of some of those case they will be complex it be not just the government or the advisory board say that talk to the lawyer who be put case in there be lot of work to be do on those case they be not straightforward and they will take time put an arbitrary deadline on they might lead to their not be properly address and some case will be about more than although it be good idea to try to speed up the system some of the step already take by the government will do so thank my right hon friend for that the work of the advisory board on all this have be invaluable and be very much appreciated we can all accept that number of case may seek compensation payment well in excess of because of the scale of the loss and the complexity no one would want or seek to do anything to prevent those case from conclude in the way that be necessary simply ask the minister to reflect on how the government can give assurance on the good way to do that come back to the issue raise by colleague from northern ireland about the territorial extent of the bill provision and the desire to overturn the conviction of the small but significant number of affected sub postmaster in northern ireland who would otherwise fall beyond the scope of the legislation can tell colleague that the labour party support the call make understand that this would be complex constitutional undertaking but give that every party in northern ireland and believe every minister in the new assembly be call for inclusion in the bill we must recognise that because this be an unusual case the scottish government have specifically ask that the bill also take in scotland understand that the labour party support that position too but we have not really hear any rational reason why scotland and northern ireland be exclude from the bill the hon gentleman will not mind my teasing he about call for unionism from the scottish national party interruption just on this issue as understand it the issue be that the scottish judiciary do not support inclusion that be ridiculous hon member will have chance to speak can not speak for every part of the judiciary in the uk but believe that that be the issue the nature of the always distinct legal system in scotland be key part of this whereas in northern ireland it be slightly more complicated fear that the issue be not so much with the scottish judiciary as with the prosecute authority give the remark already on the record from the lord advocate if may will offer the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens through the shadow minister rational reason it be about political accountability the line of political accountability lie through the scottish parliament and the crown office there be good and compelling reason about delay for make an exception for northern ireland particularly in relation to the requirement for full public consultation those argument do not apply in scotland hear what the right hon member say can foresee it be see as reasonable to extend the legislation to northern ireland in way that will not apply to scotland give the position of lot of colleague in scotland and without the scottish parliament and scottish judiciary want to be part of that extension the shadow secretary of state be make powerful speech particularly about the impact on the life of the sub postmaster the or so in northern ireland have experience the same turmoil as those in great britain we thank the shadow secretary of state for his endorsement of northern ireland inclusion in the bill we would make further call for that today be grateful to the hon member for those word know that colleague from northern ireland be keen to bring forward an amendment on that ask ministers to reflect on the scale of political support that we have see and be see and to take the issue away for further consideration before the committee stage so that justice can be bring to the sub postmaster think in northern ireland to conclude for many people who watch the itv adaptation of the horizon scandal in january it will have be hard to believe that the ongoing tragedy be not work of fiction so egregious and pernicious have the impact be on people life however it be not tv show it be very real and have have real world impact lesson must be learn and justice must be serve in the week after the drama believe attention sadly have to be turn away from the sub postmaster and their need and the conversation become much more about the soap opera that have be seemingly ongoing with the management of the post office address that issue will demand serious attention but the priority today should be provide sub postmaster with justice it be welcome that we have return to that core issue today labour will support the legislation it be right that innocent people have their conviction overturn not just so that they can begin to turn the page on the scandal but so that it lead to the quick access to compensation that everybody rightly deserve not every story will finish with happy ending as we know some people do not live to see this and other have lose so much that their life could never be put right however the action we can take in this place can go at least some way to ensure that the next chapter of the story of the sub postmaster will be their own and will be base on the principle of justice and fair treatment that everyone want to see hope the secretary of state will not take this amiss and will understand that mean no criticism of she or her minister of state or indeed his predecessor my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully when say that the bill represent the good of bad job everybody have say it already there be difficult trade off between natural justice and fast low stress solution for the postmaster that be what this bill attempt to achieve that being say it be not the way would have do it it be not what would have propose the court should and could have consider all the case in which the conviction be base on horizon evidence in one set of proceeding take senior legal advice on this it would have be perfectly possible to take three or more former supreme court justice out of retirement give they courtroom and task they to deal with this in three month they could have bracket very similar case together there would have be hundred in those category and then they could have focus on the one that be really difficult regrettably it be rumour that the judiciary itself rebuff that course of action which think be unwise and plain wrong as the right hon member for north durham mr jones point out the judiciary have responsibility too that be why we have go this route and have every sympathy with what ministers be try to do even so the bill still risk lump the genuinely innocent majority with very small potentially guilty minority each difficult case could have be deal with on its individual merit rather than abandon due process in the rush to bring this disgraceful episode to close we get into this situation by fail to follow proper process and be wary that the government almost by default be again fail to follow proper process to extricate themselves from this historic mess despite my misgiving will not stand in the way of the bill because it will serve the vast majority of postmaster to secure justice for they for that reason will support the bill however that be not to say that the legislation will not continue to create problem of its own recommend that member read some of the early report before report stage the bae systems detica report which everyone should read be six month review of the post office fraud and non compliance issue in it paint picture of complete chaos in the post office accounting system not just horizon but all the accounting system over decade ago it be know that post office system be not fit for purpose in modern retail and financial environment note that it refer to not just horizon the report go on to say that atm cashpoint accounting be clearly flawed and that remove the atm reduce the risk of spmr be suspend by spmr the report mean sub postmaster and be afraid that suspend mean persecute as that be outcome that be not horizon relate that matter because dozen have come forward to raise concern over second it system use by the post office call capture again document show that capture be know by the post office to have issue early on the culture of denial in the post office over the decade be truly extraordinary the bill will exclude people who have already have their appeal case hear and reject those rejection may well have occur because the evidence that the appeal be base on be not horizon but some other failure of the accounting system we must be careful not to give up once we pass the bill but to see if we can also absolve people who be not guilty because of the wholesale chaos that exist rise give way to probably the well inform man in the house on this matter my right hon friend make good point the post office main account would have have debtor say that they be owe money order will the hon member please face the chamber so that the whole house can hear he my apology the debtor would have say that those innocent sub postmaster owe the post office corporate account what we now know to be ten of million of pound but they be wrong that be fictious and they be not owe that money will we ever get to the bottom of that and restate the post office account which must have be materially wrong year after year throughout that period from my hon friend have more experience of this issue than anyone and he reinforce my point frankly if have magic wand would force the post office to re audit every set of account for the last year and give back the money but that will not happen it would drag on forever and we know the stress that it be cause postmaster even today my worry be that we may feel at the end of this process that we have solve the problem but there will be some perhaps only dozen or hundred not thousand who will be leave not absolve or exonerate but who deserve to be that be the risk of this approach give the right hon gentleman argument will he reflect on whether we should include in the scope of the bill those who go to the court of appeal initially but lose or those who be not give leave to appeal on the basis that we simply do not know then what we know now should we provide for that handful of case perhaps under in the bill rather than exclude they those be precisely the case be focus on there may be other that we do not know about but they be the most obvious one agree but again if have magic wand would use the mechanism that mention of unretire few supreme court justice and say these be more complicated and require bit more insight you can deal with these en bloc will you please reconsider they on the one hand want to exonerate people who be truly innocent but on the other postmaster still call up and say whatever you do do exonerate the guilty it seem to that the good way be judicial or quasi judicial route over and above what we be do here no doubt we will debate that at some length on report will still support the bill because at the end of the day it be the difficult compromise that the government have find they have get to where they be by talk to everyone include the right hon member for north durham who be not in his place just now and take all the expert advice the bill be necessary have telephone call just yesterday from victim of the scandal which mention in my early intervention her name be janet skinner and she be not my constituent but she call anyway she tell that year later she be still go through misery and despite have promise that they would not post office management be put she through an inquisition demand document from she from year ago during that time she be in prison and have to sell her house so she probably have no document give the disruption of all that the post office itself will have those document somewhere and if it do not it ought to have they that barbaric mindset be still go on from frankly sickeningly inadequate and self absorb post office management as we see when they give evidence to the committee of the right hon member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne that be problem and we have to get the bill under way as fast as possible pay enormous credit to both the junior ministers who have deal with this my hon friend the members for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake and for sutton and cheam they be both formidably good at their job at time when the whole whitehall and post office system be desperately try to ignore the issue they do heroic job of drag it back up the priority list the minister need to force the post office to solve the problem or as the right hon member for north durham say force someone else in its place to put this right quickly easily gracefully and with minimum stress for the postmaster have be listen intently to everything that have be say today would like to reflect on the number of time have stand here and talk about the horizon business do not want to repeat my previous remark but agree with everything that the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds say which have be repeat in this chamber many time we be come close to point where we may see movement towards justice for sub postmaster the exoneration bill be vital to that be deeply disappointed that scotland have be leave out of the bill have be work hard with the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson and have have many meeting with northern ireland mps from all party if northern ireland be to be include in the bill can see no reason why scotland can not be have every sympathy with the hon lady and in particular with northern irish members on this matter northern ireland be very special case in so many way for reason we all know be there reason why the scottish parliament and the scottish government could not simply replicate the bill and carry it through thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention there be absolutely no reason and the scottish government be indeed prepared to do that there be ongoing work on that but it will mean that scottish victim will have to wait long for exoneration the scottish parliament have provision in its own standing orders for emergency procedure just as we have it would be open to it to do it in three day if it choose to thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention be surround by lawyerly people and be not lawyer in fact sit in room last night for briefing where be surround by lawyer and even the lawyer be agree that they could not agree on the right way forward the right hon gentleman be absolutely correct and the scottish government will do that but they can not do it until we see what happen with the bill as it be bring towards enactment and until we can take into consideration all the amendment that may be necessary for northern ireland that will create delay yes the scottish government can can not say they will because be not member of the scottish parliament or the scottish government and it be possible for the scottish parliament to pass bill in three day but it must be align with the exoneration bill pass here otherwise scottish victim will not be treat equitably and fairly on january the minister speak in this place to believe the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine and say he see no reason at that point why there could not be uk legislation at an interministerial standing committee on march the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities say that he see no reason why that could not happen yet few day after that the bill arrive in scotland with no mention of scotland at all it be the scottish government belief that the bill could be amend to take into consideration the difference in legal term for example amendment would be need to bring about alignment on embezzlement and to cover all the different crime if you like well not crime because the sub postmaster do nothing wrong so that the bill would apply in scotland the bill could clear the deck of all the thing sub postmaster be charge with and convict for so it be all possible the issue be one of timing with sub postmaster in scotland be tell okay you ve wait but you have to wait long in this place and right across the work have do over the past few year on the post office there have always be cross party agreement on get thing sort out for the victim as the hon member for stalybridge and hyde say that be the point of the whole thing it be about the victim it be about what have happen since mr bates vs the post office be broadcast sit with my daughter in law who be herself lawyer do hold that against she and she keep say be this true marion be this true and have to say that yes it be thank the hon lady once again for the all the work she do as have say to she on number of occasion our official be work together on weekly basis and have meet my counterpart in scotland on this issue she will acknowledge that the uk parliament be take political risk this be unprecedented and unpopular in some quarter do she not accept that as politician there be time when we have to stand up and accept the political responsibility and accountability for do the right thing in our own jurisdiction just in the way the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael say agree with the minister of course do but let we think back to the victim scottish victim should not have to wait any long than victim across the rest of the united kingdom if the scottish government be to expedite bill in the scottish parliament without know exactly where this bill will end up already today there have be talk of amendment to it to help northern ireland then that would not be right either will the hon lady give way want to move on but will be extremely grateful to the hon lady be absolutely willing to listen to the case she be make that we could in theory amend the bill to cover scotland but do not if be be honest follow the logic that it would take long to pass bill affect scottish sub postmaster in the scottish parliament than to amend the bill before we do not agree that extend it to northern ireland would in any way adversely affect the scottish situation the hon member have every right to disagree with but come back to my main point the scottish legislation would have to mirror what be do here so we treat victim across the piece the same way but there would have to be certain amendment make because of scot law that be my point we can not do it in scotland until it be do here so that it mirror what have be do here the other point want to make be that this have nothing to do with the scottish parliament or the northern ireland assembly the whole business of horizon arise here under post office ltd which be wholly own by the uk government as the single shareholder there be therefore logic to say that the mess be make here so it should be clear up here no matter whether there end up be separate bill in scotland with this bill relate only to england and wales everyone across party agree that this must be sort the bill be not really what we would all want to do it be unprecedented there be risk and so on but at the end of the day it have to be do the scottish government understand and support that but want it do here to cover everyone be most grateful to the hon lady who have be very generous in give way she say that the scottish government want to see what happen here we have hear that bill can be pass in three day once the bill go through this place then in matter of day not week it can be replicate in scotland and pass in hour give that the matter have be go on for year and year and year fail to see what the big issue be with have few day more so that bill can get through in scotland there be absolutely no guarantee that it would just be few day more there be the different timing of scottish parliament sitting and lot of other consideration that the right hon gentleman will not know about and do not normally need to know about will be seek to amend the bill will take advice and then attempt to do what be go to be do for northern ireland be well aware that that may seem futile exercise to some but this be democracy and this be what have to be do from scottish perspective and be more than happy to take that on would like to close with some message that have already come out from member across the chamber as constituency mp first have meeting with sub postmaster in two month after be elect have no notion of what horizon be or of the damage that it be do to my sub postmaster over the last almost nine year and more recently since mr bates vs the post have have to listen to grown man and also woman try not to cry because of what the post office have do to they none of they not one be actually charge or prosecute they just go on put their own hard earn cash into their till so that they could open their post office the next morning have plead with all those people and plead again with people across the uk who have be affect to come forward but the problem be the lack of trust those who be prosecute be suffer but so be those who be not they be suffer from post traumatic stress disorder they be traumatise by what have happen to they also want to raise very briefly the case of those who work for partner of the post office people who work for the union of shop distributive and allied workers scotmid or cj lang who be sack by their employer and could not get an equivalent job and who be depressed and ill for year as result we really must take those people into consideration understand that bill can not be magic wand and make everything go away but think it imperative for the house to keep at it agree with my right hon friend and call he that gladly the member for north durham mr jones that we can not impose time limit because it might mean that people do not receive justice or redress should be happy to speak to the minister later and catch up with all the to ing and fro ing between scotland and this place but still stand here say this be what the scottish government have look at and this be what they want because they think it be good for the victim in scotland it have be privilege to sit here listen to the amazing contribution from the secretary of state the shadow secretary of state thank the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds for his kind word and all the other member whom we have hear from and will hear from after my own short contribution as we have just be remind by the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows we have be come here time and again for year and year often repeat ourselves but we have to repeat ourselves that be the point the shadow secretary of state talk about that powerful itv drama mr bates vs the post office and how it prompt public outcry become minister in february shortly after the group litigation order case that be feature towards the end of that drama and be pretty sure that the email alan bates be type to send to the postal affair minister be send to he be send quite large invoice which politely decline to pay at the time have page and page of mr justice fraser judgment to look at and reflect on be in different position from my predecessor who maybe should or maybe should not have sit there and read the rune and see what be go on why there be so many people involve and why the number of prosecution be go up and up over year what do have be those page of damn judgment from mr justice fraser think that the public outcry that arise from the itv programme have give power to the current postal affair minister my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake who have be work tirelessly he have read out timetable show the incredible amount of work that he have be do since leave that role know that he be man who understand what justice and fairness look like follow his experience of financial scandal such as the miscarriage of justice at hbos read he be constant come to in that role if anyone be go to delve into this work it be always go to be my hon friend think that the documentary help he to pull some of the lever that junior ministers sometimes need to pull in order to be hear and to enable we to swim through the treacle in other departments in order to get thing do so more power to his elbow that bring to why we be do this in the first place the central issue be often see as software failure even in the documentary it be deliberate dramatic plot device to show computer sit in the corner of the post office blink away like slightly alien life force that be drain the money away but it be not software failure it be human failure we all know that software go wrong we remember the millennium bug but the problem here be group think and people double down for reputational management which be push back and make sure that the postmaster believe that they be the only one experience these issue we know now and we quickly come to know that hundred of people be in the same position the fact that this be human failure mean that we need human solution we have to be human first and politician second the hon member for motherwell and wishaw speak of watch grown man try not to cry be not the good at do that myself although be not directly involve recently attend the presentation of the asian award round the corner from here and to my surprise see hasmukh shingadia vijay parekh vipin patel and seema misra member may remember seema story in particular she be pregnant at the time when she be charge in west byfleet those people be receive award and recognition and it be lovely to see the outpouring of support for they in the room those be the people who receive the award but do my hon friend agree that an award be due for every single sub postmaster for sure we can not do enough for these people they have be cast out as pariahs in their community they have be charge they have be put in prison they have lose house family and health because of body that be ultimately own by the state we as collective body have destroy these people life there be not enough that we can do for they we be look at what be in the bill and at all the other compensation scheme as well but we have to act we be have to conduct this mass exoneration in the first place not just that the wheel of justice turn slowly but because these people be so trigger whether by ptsd or simply by total mistrust of the system that they do not want to go through another process with someone in authority say kind word warm word and then let they down for the second time or bad it be action not word on which we will be judge when stand up at that dispatch box know that whatever talk about could not expect the postmaster to trust know that they would trust on the basis of my action and know that my hon friend the current minister feel the same way welcome the bill it be important for we not to let perfection be the enemy of the good let we get this do because we can not come on to the second bill and these people compensation until they have be exonerate not pardon for they have do nothing wrong let we make sure that we accentuate that as well that be why be keen for we to rush this legislation through yes we need to scrutinise it but it be short bill so we can do that quickly and then we can get on to that life change money that that we keep talk about and try to restore some semblance of their life to those whose life have be destroy this be second reading and we will get into the specific in committee and on report but let offer few possible solution the solution that my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis talk about early bring back judge would at least add capacity to the system my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill who be no long in his place previously say something similar when he say that we do not necessarily need this kind of law which be frankly trample quite lot on the independence of the judiciary that be why the government have to move really carefully which be one reason for some of the concern raise by the business and trade committee about the people who have not be able to go to appeal or who will not be include because they have be refuse leave to appeal or have fail in their appeal there be still more that we can do for victim of this scandal they will be able to appeal at another time but maybe there be something we can do in the way that my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden and my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst suggest in their contribution to accelerate their case and not just let they have to go through the same situation that they would otherwise have do may respectfully suggest that that may be the case for scotland and indeed northern ireland be not an expert or lawyer and it be not for to give advice but it occur to that if the propose amendment do not go through and the territorial extent stay as it be that be for this place to judge in other stage of the bill perhaps there be other method that we can use to make sure that postmaster in scotland and northern ireland do not receive compensation more slowly we all want this to be do as quickly as possible the postal affair minister my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton have talk about get the majority of the compensation deliver by august clearly that be not go to happen because we have only just get this bill through so we will have to exonerate the postmaster however if we can get the horizon shortfall scheme and the rest of the glo largely do by that time and restore these people live to some sense of normality then we can do the rest of it we still have not finish because we have to get sir wyn williams report back and get the investigation do some previous contributor to the debate say that it might take week or month to deliver the compensation and that there might be complication remember speak to the solicitor who represent the people involve the glo say if we give you lot and lot of money and you distribute it how long would it take the answer be about month it be about how we apportion the money and work it through the same kind of thing that the advisory committee have be wrestle with and the solicitor would have to do that internally it be not matter of give people life change sum of money in one block and then everybody be okay it be about make sure that we can work through the system which will inevitably take time when make sir wyn williams investigation non statutory it be to get speed into the system to make sure that we do not have to lawyer up as it be describe always want money to go to the victim not to lawyer talk about the same thing again as say if we can get the compensation out we have to get the answer we keep on talk in this place about the horizon scandal the infected blood scandal and any number of scandal and keep hear people say that it must never happen again do you know what it usually do why because we talk and talk about it but we do not learn the true lesson or get the answer one of the thing we need to consider both now and later be how we stop this happen again reiterate the point make in my speech when the inquiry look at it there be systemic failure right across the board my hon friend be right to say it be human failure system failure and an organisational failure the post office be an arm length department what we be find with this and other case be that arm length department be disaster when it come to correct mistake and deliver accountability do he agree that we should think about that when we be do this as usual my right hon friend be absolutely on point in our department we have number of arm length organisation which be true of other government departments as well they be representative of the government and we elect politician or the government will inevitably be hold accountable if there be no direct relationship it be very difficult to speak from the dispatch box with enough authority and information to be able to take that accountability commend my hon friend for very passionate and committed speech the point about learn lesson be crucial fear as do other in this chamber that in the old time we would say that the file be sit on shelf collect dust nowadays it would be archive and just stay there do my hon friend agree that serious attention need to be pay to ensure that we learn from this episode and the countless other occasion when thing go wrong there need to be some sort of set up to make sure that other body voluntary organisation or those at arm length actually take on board what have be say absolutely that be really good case in point hope my right hon friend will be in the next parliament to help drive this through have say be step down so will not see sir wyn williams final report not from these benches anyway hope the house take it to heart and drive through the lesson learn recommend book by matthew syed call black box thinking he compare accident in the nhs with accident and near accident in the airline industry with aircraft even just near miss get learn from not only by the airline in question it have to be pass on to every airline in the world there be collective sense of learn in the industry have enjoy the hon gentleman consider speech so far when he be minister do he have potential solution for what my hon friend the member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows mention the asda employee in scotland who have be catch up in this scandal do not but the issue be worth look at this be human scandal and it be not just about the postmaster who be directly affect be not sure how we start to unpick that as it get wide and wide but hope and trust that the government will reflect on it as we do the wide learning be tempt to intervene on two of the intervention hear but that be impossible here it be certainly possible that the person who have the contractual relationship with the business concern such as small post office could submit claim to the horizon shortfall scheme which could include amount that should be pay to individual who work for they so that they can be compensate through that route give that we be look at public sector or quasi public sector organisation it would be dangerous to assume that there be problem with governance as my hon friend say from the back benches deal with number of scandal that involve private sector organisation such as lloyds and the royal bank of scotland we see year of obfuscation around similar kind of problem we should not jump to conclusion we should probably let the inquiry report first and have debate from there my hon friend make really good point to follow on from the intervention from my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden it be difficult for we as parliamentarian and doubly difficult for government ministers to speak with authority on behalf of public organisation rather than the private sector which we do not speak on behalf of without necessarily have all the fact because there be only so much we can drill into obviously we want to right the wrong of the past and make sure as well we can that the people situation be restore so that they can have future for themselves and their family there be also the case of the post office itself the post office still have more branch than the bank and building society put together know that there have be closure in certain area that be whole other debate perhaps for westminster hall but none the less the post office have massive impact on people life especially in rural community we must not forget that when we be look at the post office its brand and its overall aim this be not reflection on the current management or anything like that we have to give the post office future thank the hon gentleman for his work on this issue and other issue protect local post office and look at the range of service they can offer to the community have he have any further reflection about the role of post office in community also want to thank he specifically for the work he do to support my constituency perhaps now that he have leave the government he can tell the house his own thought on post office as part of the local community and the potential for new service to be base in they appreciate the hon gentleman kind word regard when we work together on his constituency issue we ask the post office to do lot of work of social value and economic value and those often conflict it be difficult to get that right we can not ask the post office to turn good profit as if it be just another bank as well as to do the thing we sometimes expect as parliamentarian especially when we talk about our own constituency and those in more rural area that be something we have to give careful consideration to my original point be that while we be right the wrong of the past we have to remember that this be an important organisation for our country and our constituent and we have to give it future as well can begin by declare an interest as member of the horizon compensation advisory board it be pleasure to follow the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully when he be minister he grasp this issue and drive it forward and be sad to see that he be stand down at the next election one thing he can claim great credit for be be the only minister have deal with apart from his successor who have compassion and want to sort this out okay we have some quite heated disagreement on occasion but at least he be prepared to listen he bring unique set of skill and when he leave the house he can have this great achievement for the individual affect as great credit to his parliamentary record welcome the bill it be solution put forward by the horizon compensation advisory board and want to pay tribute to professor chris hodges lord arbuthnot and professor richard moorhead who sit on the advisory board with we when we come up with this plan do we think that the government would agree to it no we do not be we shock when they do we be will not say what chris hodges say privately at one meeting because it would be unparliamentary this be difficult thing to do and it come after year of heartache and lot of campaigning by the sub postmaster alan bates have already be mention and pay tribute to he and the as the hon member for sutton and cheam say if they have not take that court case the dam would not have break this be down to those individual who have the tenacity to do that over the year have it be easy for those individual no it have not as someone who have be involve for many year can tell the house that we do sometimes doubt ourselves and ask whether we be miss something we be not miss something it be complete injustice but when the system and the state be against person it take great courage and tenacity to continue know that some have self doubt along the way but all credit to they they stick with it it be not just the horizon case it be also hillsborough grenfell windrush and the contaminate blood scandal where people be still wait for compensation the state and the justice system which be there to protect citizen actually become the enemy of the citizen do my right hon friend agree that we need to find way for people to get quick redress and have their case hear rather than the state say that it can not be wrong in any circumstance and leave these people to fight for such long time to get justice agree totally with my hon friend and pay tribute to he in all these debate over the year he have always be on my right hand side argue for his constituent thank he for his work and his persistence my hon friend also raise big point when the state get thing wrong badly wrong in this case but he mention other case as well it go into tortoise mode and say that it can not be wrong well it have be wrong be not make party political point here because be not one across the house we need to come up with system of deal with these case in term of the transparency of information that we need to get out of the system and of have swift compensation system for put thing right we need to work on that in the next parliament on cross party basis as the minister say early he be involve in number of case that involve not the state but the private sector but they be very similar this be something would certainly like to work with colleague on also want to thank the minister for his work would not describe he as show pony in politic he be the steady shire horse of this place he be solid and determined and he push on even when obstacle be put in his way also give credit to he for the cross party work he have do he have not see it as point scoring he have work closely with my hon friend the member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds and other member across the house and really appreciate that would just say to any new ministers after the election if you want two example of how to do the job the hon member for sutton and cheam and the minister be it and they should take credit for that today bill be historic we be do something very unusual and there be delicate balance act to be strike between this place and the judiciary understand that always respect the judiciary but also reflect on the fact that it have some question to answer in this process we have the trade union movement for the lawyer early on when the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill and the right hon and learn member for south swindon sir robert buckland be on their foot it would not be debate without that lobby come in but the judiciary need to ask the question how do we get into this position there be pattern here and robust question be not ask the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst say that we should not attack judge but the conduct of certain judge in some of these case be not very sympathetic to the victim and we need to reflect on that do not think this place should interfere with the judiciary the instant reaction that this be fight between parliament and the justiciary be wrong but in this case the judiciary get it wrong the other area that desperately need to be look at be the use of computer evidence in court case at the moment there be no reference to computer code in law after the election or soon we need an urgent review to reflect how computer be not static machine they might be machine but their software and code be ever change that be important support the current approach although accept that some people be not comfortable with it as the minister say only case have be deal with so far so will explain why be committed to this approach last year have phone call from an individual from the north east do not want to identify he who say that his friend wife have be prosecute and that he think it might be horizon case say get he to speak to or can go to see they it take quite few month for he to persuade his wife to meet it be only when go to see the victim in her small council flat in the north east of england that understand why such people never come forward this woman have run successful sub post office but she be prosecute by the post office she should have comfortable retirement and highly respect name in the local community in which she still live but she do not she be traumatise by her experience and she be very reluctant to see she be terrify and keep ask my name will be in the paper again will it say no no one will know what you have tell she would never have come forward to go into court process have subsequently speak to the family to reassure they that if the bill be enact the victim will not go to court this woman be terrify her good name will be clear and she will have access to the compensation that she rightly deserve that be just one example and there be numerous other people ask whether the bill be messy way of do it but do not think it be because people like that victim would never have justice without it some people might be uncertain about what we be do but be not these be unique circumstance and do not think they set precedent we can ensure that these people have their good name restore when the newspaper have say that sub postmaster steal money that they do not steal it take lot for they to stay in their small community this happen year ago and the victim be still traumatise which be why this bill be the right approach welcome last week announcement that fix award will be offer through the horizon shortfall scheme the advisory board be press for this and the minister champion it too these award be good way of ensure that we deal with case speedily read the select committee report and disagree on the time limit we need to settle the straightforward case they be not all straightforward but some be the minister like do not want to pay lawyer it will be well if we can avoid pay lawyer by ensure that the compensation go to the victim and fix award be the way to do it consider this to be like bucket and we need to take out the simple case we then need to consider the more complex case which will take time it be easy to say that official be deliberately slow down the system but do not believe that at all even the lawyer represent these people need time to do it as the minister know some case will be very expensive more than the compensation award this be the right approach my right hon friend be make an excellent and powerful speech and particularly concur with his description of the enormous challenge that many victim face do he agree that the nature of any review or policy development be particularly important if we can find way to speed up the compensation by deal with the slightly less difficult case first it could benefit everyone and may reduce the cost to the government and the public think it be in fairness the minister want to get these case do quickly as do the advisory board one controversial thing be that some people will get little more money than they lose be comfortable with that because would soon they get the money than it go to the lawyer or the process be drag out if we can get those case deal with speedily some progress have be make on that we can then get the effort and force put into sort out the more complex one the right hon gentleman rightly say that some people may get little more money than perhaps come out of the arithmetic but would most of we not pay anything to avoid what they have go through exactly if somebody get more money out of this than they have in quantum lose be comfortable with that as believe be the minister it be well put it into their pocket than into the pocket of lawyer who will take their time with this add to the trauma that these people will have in deal with these case over many year let turn to the bill horizon pilot scheme provision because we have to address not only the horizon scheme but the pilot that come before it condition for overturn conviction in the bill be that the horizon system be be use at the time of the offence clause make provision in respect of any version of the computer system know as horizon and sometimes refer to as legacy horizon horizon online or hng use by the post office we know that there be difference between those pilot scheme and the actual horizon scheme that take over know that have be able to recite some of these thing in my sleep people use horizon pilot scheme in the north east as early as one go on to be convict and other lose their livelihood and be make bankrupt recognise that be the start date in the bill but check the post office website again this morning and it say that the roll out and pilot of the legacy horizon system as refer to in the bill as part of condition start in so what system be people pilot in be they pilot legacy horizon if they be that would be at odd with what be on the post office website would like the minister to refer to that and provide clarification in his wind up as lot of those case be in the north east of england in the area represent let turn to another system one that be pre horizon the capture system as understand it it be software develop by the post office itself come across it through case that have be refer to give all the publicity about the horizon scheme it amaze that the post office do not come clean and say oh by the way we have horizon pre horizon and the capture system beforehand if we look at the case we see that this be very much because of the attitude of the post office towards the prosecution we have sub postmaster who be accuse of steal money and their contract be terminate in some case they be prosecute there be ridiculous situation in coventry where woman be take to court and prosecute the judge throw out the case on the first day say there be no case to answer but lo and behold what do the post office do it take private prosecution against she to recover the it claim she have steal which bankrupt she that show the mentality of those in the post office lot of those case mirror horizon case have refer case to the minister five of which relate to individual who go to prison as have do before put on record the excellent reporting by karl flinders of computer weekly and steve robson of the newspaper on those case it have be down to those two and other to do the detective work so we need the post office to turn up the heat and ensure we get answer will the minister tell the post office that it be not good idea to threaten legal action against journalist this week after his late story steve receive phone call threaten he with legal action that be not very bright especially as he have all the evidence to back up his story if that be still the attitude of the post office that show why the current management need to go understand why the government can not include capture in this legislation but we need mechanism to deal with those case because capture be important have case but there be clearly more out there clause give the secretary of state power to make further consequential provision by regulation will that provide potential way to include capture case the minister have all the information and he be on top of the brief raise the issue today and will propose an amendment in committee to see whether we can flesh out the matter but we need way to deal with those case have case but there be certainly more out there be delighted that the right hon gentleman have raise that point refer in my speech to the bae study that highlight capture atm cash management and variety of other issue associate with audit failure and basically describe chaotic management system early postmaster may not have be exonerate by subsequent analysis because people be look at horizon and nothing else but we owe it to they to get this right even if that be after this bill have move through the house people might think that because the system be not horizon the bill do not apply to they but the case be deal with show that there be an injustice have speak to individual who go to prison the computer system be not same but the post office show the same attitude in the way it go at individual it do not believe the postmaster they be go to be find guilty come what may that approach to the investigation and the presumption of guilt be what my hon friend the member for south ribble katherine fletcher be refer to in relation to her constituent and royal mail as it be before ownership have transfer the case do not get as far as prosecution but investigation officer the same kind of people that we have see at the public inquiry make that presumption have see some of those individual at first hand at the public inquiry people have say that everyone who be go to make case have come out of the woodwork already but that be not true people be still come forward be hear about case on weekly case thank right hon and hon member from across the house who be keep busy by refer case to please send they to be quite happy to help deal with they notice this morning that there be another three case in my inbox the hon gentleman make the key point that we need to look at those individual to ensure we get some type of justice for they have to say that be surprise by this but follow the television programme nearly new case come forward on the horizon shortfall scheme alone we may wonder what these people be do all this time well in some case they be not aware of what be happen in other case they be hide they be hide yes because of shame and thing such as that it be only now that we realise what massive miscarriage of justice this be that people have have the confidence to come forward this bill will help with that shall come off capture because think the minister have get my point but return to those case that have already go to appeal do not criticise the government on this but we must find system for deal with those few case that have go through it be no good the court of appeal hide behind the fact that they have go through because as the hon member for sutton and cheam have say new evidence have come out of the inquiry that be not available to the court at the time we can not just leave those people hang can not remember off the top of my head how many individual there be but there be not that many let just clarify that point total of people have come forward since the tv dramatisation seven people have take their case to the court of appeal and be hear and six have be refuse leave to appeal which make total of in that cohort what fine research assistant the minister be he be right the number be in single figure let we look at those case let we see whether we can move forward on this be not criticise the government for not include those individual understand why they be not in the bill but we need to look at they there be thing that come out of the inquiry that would have change the outcome in some but perhaps not all of those case if we do not look at they those people will be leave outside the remit of the bill on the territorial extent of the bill think the case be make early in relation to northern ireland see no reason why the bill should not include northern ireland we have cross party support for it in northern ireland and as understand it the executive be on board as well we need to recognise that in committee have to say to the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows that have less sympathy with the idea of include scotland in the bill not because those individual should not get justice they should but because the issue be different in scotland there be in fact two issue first there be the legal position the way thing be prosecute in scotland be very different from how it be do in the uk furthermore there be mechanism to do it so the scottish government just have to get on and do it accept what she be say about wait to see what we do but they would need cross party support in the scottish parliament if that be to go forward do hope however that some amendment on northern ireland be bring forward in committee and would certainly support it finally let talk about the notification of individual reference be make early to record keeping which be not brilliant at the post office we have to try to find reasonable step as the bill say to notify individual we need to look at that because again some of these case will be legacy case sadly some people will have pass away before they be able to get justice perhaps we need to say how we get to those case that be possibly more difficult to get to than other to conclude the bill be long overdue which make this historic day think of the woman sit in front of in her council flat in the north east of england whose life have be ruin for the past year and who have have daily trauma because of the injustice and financial heartache that she and her family have face with the bill she will finally get justice if that be the one thing do in my time in this house it will make very happy it be great honour to follow the right hon member for north durham mr jones and that poignant ending with which we all empathise he have do an enormous amount get we to this point and thank he for it there be no doubt that today be very good day it have be bring about by the secretary of state ministers past and present they be not show pony at all the prime minister particularly through his action at the beginning of this year and the chair of the appg the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows have work with she many time and thank she for all her work all those people must take credit for where we be but it have take an awfully long time the minister be right that an awful lot of work have go on behind the scene to get to this moment equally have total empathy with the comment receive from member of the public that it should not have take the turbocharging of an itv drama to put right this scandal when people across the united kingdom know that the situation be utterly wrong sometimes wish that there be as much palpable anger in our community about other scandal as there be about what have happen to sub postmaster so that we could fix some of those problem let we not be too critical however we should applaud today lifting of the barrier by quash conviction to speed up the compensation that be due to people as have rightly be say across the house the judiciary will raise concern that be only to be expect but conceptualise this as an unprecedented situation that require an unprecedented solution the odd conviction that be warrant may slip through the net but this have be go on for more than year as have also be say we must not let perfection be the enemy of the good that sum up the whole predicament and issue fairly well be new mp in this place albeit not such new mp any more and be able by quite some accident to talk about the matter with degree of personal feeling have be great privilege never expect that in would become sub postmaster for company that have purchase supermarket with post office in the back of it or that in budgens of aylsham which be the post office that be the sub postmaster for would become the good post office in the entire country be very proud of that and it have mean that my speak about this issue have pick up quite lot of attention it have be real privilege to bring my voice to the campaigning suspect that will probably be the only serve mp who have be sub postmaster for the foreseeable future what bring the debate home to be that could so easily have be catch up in this problem have we purchase that supermarket couple of year beforehand could have be suffer the consequence face by so many of the man and woman we be represent this afternoon still remember my stepfather wander into my office and say well you the finance director duncan you will be the nominated legal sub postmaster we think very little of it other than when be give postman hat at the staff christmas party remember go on the post office training course without shadow of doubt the people meet be always good decent law abide citizen the sort of people we see in the drama documentary and about whom we have speak so often every single one of we in the chamber this afternoon will have constituent who have be catch up in this matter the right hon member for north durham talk about people be traumatise that be absolutely true in the past three or four week have sit with lady who run post office in my constituency she say duncan have see you on the television will you come round and talk to be run village post office have be able to sleep for year because lose money and want to know whether could be recompense the minister be incredibly helpful he immediately give all the link for where could help that lady she and sit down and go through her book and record for the good part of an hour tot up few of her column at the end of that process say want you to sleep well tonight do not think you have lose any money think that you be one of the lucky one you may have have some loss in one year but gain the next because the system just do not work we need to get that message out have quite few case in which people be not prosecute but they put money lot in some case back in the hon gentleman just speak about ensure that people come forward to get redress and that be important some feel that they be not victim because they be not prosecute or do not lose their livelihood but have one case in which someone put in over period and those people need redress the right hon member be absolutely right the people watch this debate or read report about it must always remember that they can come forward seek redress and get help and support if all else fail contact your local mp most of we just want to help the community and the people we be so privileged to represent entirely take his point be very lucky in the case of the woman be deal with could say you can sleep easy tonight because you be one of the lucky one the system do not work properly that closure be tell that lift weight off her shoulder we in this place often have the ability to open door that people can not open themselves be so pleased to be able to help that lady represent what we keep talk about sub postmaster and mistress be pillar of their community everybody in their village or town know that those people be criminalise and simply not believe that be where the whole of this sorry period start in the business that run remember be incredibly worried when the till go down that we have lose money know one thing for sure the staff be not take money trust they entirely the problem be the culture at the post office which have become corporate beast it be lose its soul in the early when there be an enormous push to be stand alone organisation to not be reliant on the government and to sell sell sell financial product remember go to post office conference and meet paula vennells the irony be that the conference be call together but while it be go on hundred of man and woman up and down the country be be convict for crime that they have not commit that be not very collegiate the legislation may not be perfect there be department for work and pensions conviction that have take up with the minister that be not include in the bill and know the reason why or his explanation that do not mean that do not support what we be do today but certainly want to say this we be not there yet think this whole situation be go to run and run for many year to come do not say that light heartedly because think that real closure for people up and down the country do not just mean compensation and conviction be quash it mean criminal prosecution of those within the post office who know what have happen but do not take the action that they should have take suspect we will see those prosecution come forward in the year to come have probably say seven or so time in this place that fujitsu need to face some real question of course it will it have already accept that it will contribute compensation but how on earth could piece of software write by multibillion pound corporation have have back door into it with no audit trail through which somebody could simply alter figure that be absolutely frightening as mention before it prompt question about the account of the post office and its auditor so many problem will never be fix as have also say many time want figure for how much money be steal from all of those innocent sub postmaster nobody have ever be able to tell what that figure be or where it go or even where it go we could add up the figure that be take off innocent man and woman in the itv drama alone but across the country suspect it be ten of million of pound possibly even more than million that figure need to be identify so that we understand the full scale of what happen here of course the inquiry will conclude later this year which will finally give we some real evidence of what go wrong although have sum up by say there be still many question to answer we must remember that today be very positive day for many many people who be watch who be catch up in this situation say again and place it on the record that it be nice when the house come together there be great number of people in the chamber this afternoon who have do an enormous amount of good and can hold their head very high that we have get to this place today first welcome this piece of legislation and thank the current minister the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake the former minister the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully and the right hon member for north durham mr jones who guide through some of the issue when first become involved in this matter it have be long battle but the job of this house when it identify an injustice be to ensure that that injustice be address and this be an injustice be still baffle by how we ever reach this stage how post office official ministers and judge do not question how people who have so much to lose suddenly turn into thief in their ten and hundred this do not happen over long period of time it be identify over short period of time yet those people be prosecute unquestioningly indeed some who know the fact feel that because they have start go down this route they have to continue to justify it even if that mean withholding information and pretend that it be only one or two people so that other be not alert to what be happen it be an injustice have hear argument today that we have to tread very carefully with this legislation that it be very delicate that it could annoy the judge and everything else as the right hon member for north durham have point out the judge be also responsible because they hear evidence do they question it as rigorously as they ought to have do do not know do not know many of the individual case but it be quite clear that many similar case be come before the court and somebody should have ask especially give that the people who be be bring before those court have so much to lose their reputation be destroy and up until this point they have not engage in that kind of behaviour be not all that sensitive about step on some judicial toe with this legislation this house have on many occasion be quite happy to overlook some of the legal issue in the context of northern ireland exonerate or give letter of comfort to people who have be guilty of murder and so on so do not really have great deal of sympathy with the argument that we have to be very concerned to tread carefully in relation to this piece of legislation there be just two issue that want to raise the first be the issue of those who have go through the court of appeal already or have have their leave to appeal reject give that in most case the evidence that be present and the judgment that be make would have be make on the basis or at least partly on the basis of trust in technology the very thing we be say be wrong in the case of those we be now seek to exonerate mean that we should be look at those case whether or not they be deal with on one to one basis they should not be ignore because the same kind of evidence use in those appeal case be use in the court case again it would be an injustice not look at those particular issue regardless of how that be deal with and whether we should include the appeal case totally or they should be look at individually think we can not ignore that one of course the issue really want to address be clause on the territorial extent of this bill have have conversation with the minister and know he be sympathetic and understand the issue in relation to northern ireland however when listen to the argument really do not think there be case for exclude northern ireland from the scope of the bill yes justice be devolved issue and the minister have say on other occasion when have raise this with he that we have to be very careful of the political sensitivity however have to say that there be not much concern in this house about political sensitivity when we put through list of bills the length of my arm that be controversial people in northern ireland do not want those bills take in this house and the party be divide on they in this particular case there be no division and there will be no kickback from any party in the devolved administration in fact the first minister the deputy first minister and the justice minister the three ministers who will be responsible for this have all write to the minister indicate that they would be fully supportive they would be fully supportive because they believe that it would not be possible to keep in step with the timing of the legislation that will go through here and the reason for that be quite clear it be the way in which the northern ireland assembly be oblige by law to consult on legislation do not even know whether the legislation would first have to be include in the programme for government which would be one step and after it have be include in the programme for government consult on however even if it we only have it as stand alone legislation outside the programme for government there be week consultation period as the deputy first minister and the first minister have point out that mean legislation could not even be consider in the northern ireland assembly this side of the summer recess so we would be talk about the autumn there be compelling case not only because there be no opposition but because if it be to go down the route of the northern ireland assembly it would be delay do the right hon gentleman agree with that the number of case be small have hear different figure but we be talk about no more than case but that can not justify the delay which he be eloquently describe in keep these people from their recourse to justice think that be right some people may of course turn that argument around and say it only small number of case so why should we be concern but although the number may be small since this issue have become so public there be public outrage on behalf of those who have be unfairly treat many people who have speak to about this have not be affect personally by the horizon scandal but there be sense of injustice that some people be affect in such way they lose their reputation their money their business in some case their family and their peace of mind and there be need not to delay any long if at all possible one way of ensure that there be no such delay be to include northern ireland in the bill when the secretary of state be ask about this issue she say that she want to avoid unintentional consequence those unintentional consequence be unspecified because we do not get any example but do not see how there could be unintentional consequence from include northern ireland in the bill it be tight piece of legislation it specify who be cover by it what offence be cover and the way that the exoneration would be implement by have record remove and so on can not see where the unintended consequence would be and find that argument fairly weak the hon gentleman have describe the logistical problem do he agree that if the territorial provision be extend to scotland and northern ireland all that would be require be legislative consent motion from the northern ireland assembly and the scottish parliament which would be clean and more efficient way of deal with this issue for people in northern ireland and scotland be not even sure that in northern ireland legislative consent motion would be require simply because the executive have already indicate that they would be happy for northern ireland to be include do not see how this would tramp on any political sensitivity and it can not have unintended consequence another argument have be but look you go to upset the judiciary in my view it do matter whether the judiciary be upset by decision make in this house or in the assembly if they be go to be upset they be go to be upset suspect they will not be however because be sure that many of the judge recognise that in the light of evidence that have now become available the decision make have to be look at again anyway do not think there be an argument there another argument that be make think by an opposition member be that politician in devolved administration should take the risk and take responsibility for the job they be require to do do not mind politician take responsibility for thing they have be responsible for but this be not an issue that politician in northern ireland or indeed scotland be responsible for the post office be not devolved issue it be reserve the prosecution be initiate by action take by the post office to say you ve get to man up and take be not so sure that that argument stand when this be national issue the post office be organise on national basis and the compensation will be organise on national basis therefore to there be no responsibility there for the devolved administration as matter of fact the situation be different in scotland where prosecution be take in the name of the procurator fiscal service or the lord advocate depend on the forum and they receive only the report from the post office the prosecution decision be make by the prosecute authority understand that in other part of the united kingdom the post office can prosecute in its own right but that be not the situation in scotland and that be why it be different be not go to enter into debate about scotland because do not have enough knowledge of the situation but surely the way around this issue relate to the individual responsible for have take the prosecution and for advise the scottish government that be perhaps where we should be look if they be all satisfied that the decision should be take here in westminster why not include that in the bill be sure the scottish nationalist can argue their case very well the one thing would say as unionist be that be pleased that the snp recognise that there be role for westminster if the scottish government want to give some of their power to westminster on this particular issue will take that as unionist win the fact be that the scottish government want the bill to go through for all four nation of the uk and they would give legislative consent motion for that to happen that surely indicate that in this case as the right hon member have already say this issue arise here and should be sort out here in scotland and in england there be prosecution by the cps the prosecution that this place will exonerate through the bill be not only post office prosecution be not go to become kind of spokesperson for the scottish national party on this particular issue be argue the case for northern ireland but also believe there be parallel know that there will be difference and we have hear the argument back and forward today as to why scotland might be treat differently and everything else but there be sour taste in people mouth because of the injustice over the horizon scandal let we not let that persist if there be way of sweeten the issue and deal with it respectfully impact on everybody and ensure that those who have have this cloud hang over they those who have lose out financially and in many other way can be exonerate and sort out let we do it quickly and fairly and ensure that we put this injustice behind we as quickly as we can it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson he say that he be proud as unionist to see this decision be take here but say to he gently be wary of scottish nationalist bear gift of uk accountability because essentially that be where we have come to today will pick up the point about territorial jurisdiction later but first want to say word or two of more general application lot of people in this debate have speak about this legislation be unprecedented and about the concern of some in the legal profession and the judiciary and the discomfort they feel those feeling of discomfort be entirely appropriate and legitimate and would be more concerned if they be not there however it be because of the wholly exceptional nature of the situation face those prosecute as consequence of the deception of the post office and fujitsu and the misuse of the horizon software that we should have bill of this sort along with my colleague on the liberal democrat benches have no difficulty in support the bill should declare an interest as recover solicitor it be and half year since surrender my practise certificate no doubt to the relief of many to my former colleague would say that it be worth ask why we have court in the first place essentially we have court because it be important that there be body able to give the general public confidence that the various vehicle of the state work properly and that people can get justice do they get it right all the time no of course they do not when be solicitor we often use to say justice have to be see to be do and it often have to be see to be believe let we not forget that the judiciary be like the rest of we if they be cut they bleed they be vulnerable to the same human foible as we they ultimately have to be accountable for people at moment like this those who have say that the judiciary need to take look at themselves be right to say that take mild exception to the suggestion that somehow or another the doctrine of the separation of power build an impenetrable wall between the different leg of the constitution it do not this house create the very institution of the supreme court barely year ago we interfere all the time in the running of the court by set their budget and tell they what rule of procedure and evidence they can follow and nobody take exception to that what we be deal with here be an interference of different order altogether but it be one that conform to the principle that there be occasion when this house as sovereign parliament have to act and intervene think the nature and scale of the injustice that have be visit on people here absolutely justify that the question about territorial jurisdiction be an important one listen very carefully to the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows who incidentally rate very highly at the risk of kill her political career stone dead by praise have enormous respect for how she have manage the all party parliamentary group on post office and the very measured and effective way she have prosecute the case for postmaster sub postmaster and post office employee that apply not just in relation to the horizon scandal but in the day to day operation of the post office itself it pain to find myself in different place from the hon lady say to she last night that be still open to be persuade but my starting point have to be that we judge the issue by the outcome for the postmaster themselves essentially can we get those affect in scotland to the same place by allow the scottish parliament to do its job constitutionally as it be charge to do or in order to get everybody in the same place at the same time do we have to do it here to kill the right hon gentleman political career should say that have the same respect as he have for my hon friend the member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows as he say this debate be about how we can well get justice to the victim can offer as solution something that be happen now the criminal justice bill which have not reach all stage of the parliamentary process already have legislative consent motion from the scottish parliament for the area of the bill that impact scotland perhaps that be way of get around the territorial debate if scotland and northern ireland be put there it would allow legislative consent both in northern ireland and scotland to happen concurrently at the same time as the legislation be pass here that be one way in which the procedure could be do however say to the hon gentleman and the hon member for motherwell and wishaw that the question of quash conviction be just one element of justice the other important element be that those who be responsible for initiate the prosecution must be accountable that accountability would be miss if the provision for scotland be put in this bill or the criminal justice bill that accountability be important for the quality of justice if it be achievable within the timescale we be balance compete demand the position of northern ireland be qualitatively different because there be statutory requirement for week consultation the scottish parliament do not have that requirement so it would be able to proceed apologise for not be here at the beginning as be chair the energy security and net zero committee the other leg of justice that must be serve be compensation which be sure the right hon gentleman be come to anyway compensation be not just for those who be convict as lot of people out there dip into their own pocket and pay money to the post office to keep the heavy away and prevent prosecution those people also need to see justice one of the big thing be move the legislation forward so that all that happen and the money get to the people the hon gentleman be right if he have be listen he will have hear speak on number of occasion about my work to support constituent who be pursue claim as part of the historic shortfall scheme that would be the route to compensation for the people to whom the hon gentleman refer we have take particular approach quite deliberately and for good reason because the post office function be reserve legislatively to the united kingdom parliament as united kingdom operation the compensation should be pay on uk wide basis however the decision to prosecute be take in scotland by law officer accountable to the scottish parliament for that reason it make sense for the scottish parliament to deal with the consequence of those prosecution do not necessarily have the answer but the problem be that if the scottish parliament quash the prosecution there could be hiatus while we wait for westminster to do something and the money arrive it be chicken and egg situation would much prefer the scottish parliament to sort it and to have the resource to compensate but unfortunately in the uk that be not the world we live in do not think it be unfortunate but highly fortunate and deliberate that we be in the uk but we will save that debate for another day the compensation can and will be pay on uk wide basis give the timescale that the government have outline so far we would expect the conviction to be quash on the basis of this bill by the middle of july that give the scottish parliament time to meet the same timescale so that victim in scotland have their case quash by that time the right hon gentleman be make some important point about the way the prosecution system work in different part of the uk which we must take into account on the point by the hon member for na eileanan an iar angus brendan macneil on pay redress the key thing be overturn the conviction once that conviction be overturn wherever in the uk that individual will have immediate access to the redress scheme wherever they be in the uk there be no hiatus as he describe it be grateful to the minister for that those who be not convict will have access to compensation through the historic shortfall scheme process available to they at the moment the bill relate only to overturn conviction there be discussion about territorial extent which understand and be happy to continue to discuss the three compensation scheme the horizon shortfall scheme the group litigation order scheme and the overturn conviction scheme be all uk wide so that whatever detriment be experience wherever they be in the uk there be no delay to compensation there be no difference in term of compensation between one part of the uk and another we be keen to expedite it wherever it be in the uk and we have work to do do not really need to answer that so will take the hon lady intervention thank the right hon gentleman one of the issue about timing and it be about timing be that think everyone would agree that it be good that every victim be exonerate at the same time as we do not yet have the programme for the timing of the committee and third reading stage it be possible that the scottish parliament could be in recess it will be in recess as early as june full month before this place that be political decision for the scottish government who control the scottish parliament business to take may gently correct the right hon gentleman the recess date be not set by the scottish government they be set by the parliamentary board they be set by the parliamentary bureau of which the majority of member come from the snp and the greens have keep this fairly broad in its term can just say gently to the hon lady that if the scottish government instead of try to evade political accountability would take their responsibility seriously and get on with it they would get on with the drafting of the necessary legislation if they want to wait and see how it all work here to see if there be further amendment then of course they can do so they should be mindful of the fact that apart from this one point on the substantive provision in the bill there be complete unanimity across all party in the house so would not see this as bill that be likely to attract amendment on the substance if the hon lady wish to introduce her amendment relate to jurisdiction at later stage then that be another matter altogether if we consider the consequence for the substance of the bill we would effectively be write whole new part of it for example if we have regard to the offence for which compensation be to be pay very few be term of art in scots law so we would be write new bill to be insert here why be the scottish government so resistant to get on and do what they be constitutionally charge to do when they could do it if they start now in timescale that bring everybody to the same place the hon lady herself say that compensation have to be do equitably and fairly put it to she and to her colleague that the consequence of their route be follow would be scottish victim have justice of less quality because the decision about prosecution be accountable to this house in england and there would be no such accountability for decision on prosecution if they be to be take in the scottish parliament not true can the hon gentleman sit to my left explain to why he think that be not true will and be always to his left as he know if the parliament discuss legislative consent that be where the accountability take place say to the right hon gentleman again he do not need to answer it today because the bill will go through other stage and the minister say he be consider it that hope he will consider the criminal justice bill example and legislative consent as solution to the issue it be solution to the issue inasmuch as it be another mean of do the same thing that the hon gentleman party want to do in respect of the bill but it be not solution inasmuch as it allow that level of accountability and it be the accountability that matter the current lord advocate dorothy bain have already say on the record that not every case involve horizon evidence will be miscarriage of justice and each case must be consider carefully and with regard to the law it be also important to recognise as other have say here the important constitutional role of our appeal court in scotland and that due process must be follow that be qualitatively different approach from the one that be at the heart of the bill the lord advocate may be right but that be where she have to explain herself and she also have to explain the decision that be take by her predecessor it be year ago now but do start my legal career meagre and modest though it may have be at the crown office in edinburgh elish angiolini whom we be fête here week or two ago for her report on the working of the metropolitan police be my first boss when be trainee solicitor there my second boss be frank mulholland now lord mulholland the second lord advocate who would have have responsibility for some of these case all of they will have to be accountable in their own way the current lord advocate will of course be accountable and it be obvious from the statement she give to the scottish parliament that her work be already fairly well advanced she have confirm that the scottish criminal cases review commission write to potential victim of the horizon scandal in she have also confirm that the crown office have identify another case that be be review by prosecutor and that many of those case have be contact by the sccrc as well as of march people have come forward to have their case review eight of they have be refer to court with six have their case clear the remain two case be still pende an outcome give the amount of work that have be do and give the nature of what the lord advocate have say on the record it make to my mind absolutely no sense for the scottish element of this one narrow part on the decision to prosecute to be take differently it come down to accountability and if we have learn nothing else throughout this whole sorry episode of the horizon system and post office ltd surely we have learn that at the end of the day accountability make difference it be pleasure to follow the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael will return the conversation to the subject of northern ireland but only briefly because the issue have be air reasonably well already today let first put on the record my own and my party welcome for the bill and thank the minister for the work that he have do so far we certainly recognise that this be highly exceptional situation that justify the approach that have be take we can not be certain that we will never face similar situation at some time in the year or decade ahead but this situation do warrant that approach because it be about exoneration and concept such as pardon do not quite fit the bill it should be clearly on the record that there should never have be prosecution and that any conviction should be entirely void the word amnesty and pardon suggest that something wrong have be do prior to those development thank the minister for his ongoing engagement specifically in respect of the conversation have have with he about northern ireland also thank the opposition front benchers for make it clear that they be open to the inclusion of northern ireland in the bill want to explain briefly why we believe that action be warrant in westminster in that regard this be essentially uk wide scandal that require uk wide solution the post office be reserved matter so we need uk wide response the issue that have come about be not in the gift or control of the devolved administrations who could not have seek to prevent they even if they have have the foresight to identify the problem that be emerge the difficulty now be that if northern ireland be leave to act separately we will see further injustice emerge the executive have just be restore and they have other priority at present such as get up and run however even if the assembly have be function for some time the process would require public consultation on how business be do in northern ireland not carry out such consultation would pose the ongoing risk of judicial review which would far complicate matter and probably elongate the process that would be counterproductive so the public consultation have to be price in bill will take time to draft and the department of justice can look at what have happen in england and wales but there would still need to be minimum of eight week in practice probably week for the public consultation that would then have to be evaluate and any legislation introduce in the assembly would go through its own process even with the good will in the world do not see how the process could be conclude until well into the autumn of this year and it could take long that would create situation in which some of the victim of the scandal who have receive false conviction will be wait long for justice than their counterpart everywhere else in the uk give that exoneration be the gateway to compensation they would be far penalise in the sense that they would be doubly delay in receive exoneration and in access compensation so natural justice lean heavily towards the administration in london take action on behalf of northern ireland in response to the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson want to stress the scale of the political consensus on this issue in northern ireland that be rare but it be precious whenever it do emerge there be sense that we want this to be do as quickly as possible and we want to be pragmatic utterly dismiss the notion that parliament be treading on devolved toe by act in place of the executive and the assembly right across the political spectrum the party want this to happen so there will be no political blowback on action be take obviously it have to be do on case by case basis but give the extraordinary circumstance of this situation there be an overwhelming argument for northern ireland to be include in the bill look forward to hear the minister summation shortly hope that he can give an indication of whether he be willing to accept amendment in committee subject to the proper motion be put in place to facilitate change to the legislation as currently draft we be now over two decade into this scandal with the victim still suffer the ongoing consequence of this injustice unjust prison sentence bankruptcy ostracisation from community family breakdown and homelessness tragically as we have hear this scandal have lead to some people take their life accord to the post office horizon it inquiry at least sub postmaster have die without see justice or receive compensation as of august and at least four have take their own life all our thought continue to be with their family this scandal have be seismic tragedy at every stage the mental toll and stress that victim have face be beyond what many of we can begin to comprehend this scandal have be define at every turn by an abuse of power disregard for sub postmaster life the passing of blame and perpetual delay this bill be an important step forward in address the great miscarriage of justice in our country it will mean that hundred of innocent victim will have their rightful innocence return to they however this be just one of number of action that need to be take to make amend and to correct this terrible injustice we need to see conviction quash compensation deliver urgently and justice seek from the independent inquiry along with other colleague pay tribute to alan bates and the many sub postmaster who have campaign and work tirelessly to see justice this bill mark an important victory for sub postmaster and pay tribute to their bravery and perseverance in the face of so much suffering and adversity they have have so much take from they and yet they have keep fight this be truly remarkable and it be wonderful to hear the tribute that have be pay by so many across the house and also across our country pay tribute to my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones for all his work fight on behalf of sub postmaster and to lord arbuthnot for his year of work on tackle this injustice also thank the minister for postal affair the under secretary of state for business and trade the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for all his work from the back benches as well as from the front bench there have be many member across the two houses who have highlight the injustice suffer by sub postmaster and extend the opposition appreciation for the work they have do and for the cross party nature of the campaigning that have go on thus far think we can all agree that the influence of the itv drama mr bates vs the post office have be very significant in this campaign the minister have do huge amount of work but there be no deny that that programme have bring to the attention of the wide public the scandal that have affect so many sub postmaster however it should not have take the release of that drama to get to where we be today this be in no way criticism it be recognition of the fact that certain scandal have need that wide attention from the medium from programme and documentary before attention be receive but we be where we be and it be encouraging to see the step that have be take this bill will quash the conviction of the sub postmaster and other who work in the post office branch who suffer as result of the horizon scandal as have already be say and far stress the quashing of these conviction must not set precedent the bill undermine key part of our democracy the separation of the legislature and judiciary as have be say early it be constitutional anomaly we must understand the weight of this so that such action be never consider again the legal solution of this bill be wholly exceptional and isolated case where these necessary action will be take to match miscarriage of justice unprecedented in both scale and impact as the shadow business secretary my hon friend the member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds have make clear an incoming labour government would never use this kind of action again echo the comment on the territorial scope of today bill and restate that the labour party support the call to extend the provision of the bill to the case in northern ireland every party in northern ireland and every minister in the new assembly be call for their inclusion in the bill their exclusion will sadly only delay the exoneration of victim in northern ireland all the more so hope the minister will seriously consider this decision and what can be do far and take on board the point that have be make by hon member include my hon friend the shadow business secretary we have hear many powerful contribution in today debate and there be broad agreement on the bill necessity the right hon member for haltemprice and howden sir david davis highlight his misgiving and he describe the bill as represent the good of bad job of course he extend his support and highlight the bill unprecedented nature my right hon friend the member for birmingham hodge hill liam byrne make the case for speed in grant compensation my right hon friend the member for north durham mr jones raise important concern about the potential limitation of set deadline for pay compensation while ensure the proper handling of complex case hope the government will take those point into consideration my right hon friend also raise important point about the need for the judiciary and the government to learn broad lesson from this scandal so that they can be apply to other scandal number of which have be mention in the debate include the contaminate blood scandal and the windrush scandal it be encouraging to see such eagerness to reflect and learn so that thing do not have to go this far before be address the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows have be tireless advocate and campaigner for justice for sub postmaster and she rightly highlight the need to continue our laser sharp focus on support victim she and other in her party relay once again the concern that scotland have be leave out of the bill the hon member for sutton and cheam paul scully speak powerfully about his time as postal affair minister as he be stand down commend he for his work in the department and for his wide cross party work on number of issue include myanmar with and many other colleague we wish he well in his future endeavour like other he raise the need to learn lesson and to ensure that when we say that scandal of this scale must never happen again we truly ensure that they never happen again the hon member for north norfolk duncan baker speak powerfully about his career as sub postmaster he bring insight to this debate and the campaign and he reflect on how he have support his constituent who have face trauma and how he have draw those lesson into the minister work be strike by the way in which he reflect on the wide issue the hon gentleman say that work be need on the post office culture in tackle wide systemic issue and he say that the post office be lose its soul as we look to the future hope the government will consider how we make the necessary reform so that the post office be fit for purpose he rightly say that fujitsu need to be hold accountable and that it should pay compensation although that be outside the scope of this bill the minister and other need to ensure that fujitsu pay for what be cause by its technological failure the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson make powerful case for those whose appeal have be reject and he argue that their case need to be reconsider know that the minister have respond and will look at those issue closely the right hon member also make the point about territorial scope reinforce the point about the need for northern ireland to be include in the bill the point about the week consultation have be make consistently as it mean that the or northern irish case will face huge delay that mean far suffering so it be important for the government to consider include northern ireland as we have call for the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael make the case for the scottish government to introduce legislation in parallel in scotland much work have be do in scotland and the case for need to work in parallel in lockstep to ensure that there be provision in scotland have be make the hon member for north down stephen farry speak about prosecution that should never have take place once again he make the case for northern ireland inclusion and for avoid delay we have hear many powerful testimony from victim who have say that they lose decade of their life to this scandal katie downey who set up the group lost chances for the child of sub postmaster to support the child of some of the victim of the scandal say that when her father be make bankrupt by the scandal she be year old and her family have to flee to france she stop speak for two year as result of the trauma her childhood be shape by this injustice we must not forget the wide reach impact of this scandal on family member there be child spouse parent close friend and neighbour who have not only journey with the victim but suffer themselves and live out the consequence of this injustice seema misra be jail on her son birthday while she be pregnant after be pronounce guilty of steal from the post office she run she have be wrongly accuse ms misra and her husband have be try for baby for eight year and what should have be one of the happy moment of their life become nightmare she be put under suicide watch in prison and describe how she reach rock bottom those be only two story of the horror that have define the life of victim today thank colleague from across the house for powerfully share the example of the case they have deal with be they those of constituent or case they have come across through their campaigning work also thank colleague for the tireless work they have do in advocate for those people tell their story talk to ministers and persist these people story and voice must be central in shape our next step in the pursuit of their compensation of justice and of their exoneration we welcome this crucial piece of legislation but it be by no mean anywhere close to an end point it be merely further step in the right direction in secure justice for the sub postmaster we support the work of the independent inquiry in uncover the full and precise truth of all that have unfold in the post office truth and justice have be deny to sub postmaster at every turn and hope that the inquiry will finally provide the transparency that be desperately need there be much still to be do in the pursuit of justice for sub postmaster and we must all continue to support they and do all we can to right the many wrong they have suffer order before call the minister may remind those who have contribute to the debate that it be very important to get back for the wind up include for the beginning of the one by the shadow minister call kevin hollinrake for member of the house the wide public and most of all the victim of this horrendous scandal today bill can not come soon enough the day that the conviction be finally quash redress be finally pay and those victim can get on with their life can not come soon enough the bill will quash relevant conviction of individual who work include on voluntary basis in post office branch and who suffer as consequence of the post office horizon it scandal it will quash on blanket basis conviction for various theft fraud and related offence during the period of the horizon scandal in england and wales the bill be an exceptional response that recognise the constitutional sensitivity and unprecedented nature of the situation the government be clear that give the factually exceptional nature of the case the legislation do not set precedent for the future relationship between the executive parliament and the judiciary the scale and circumstance of the prosecutorial and investigatory misconduct mean that rapid approach be need to deliver long overdue justice while respect the separation of power and delicate constitutional balance first speak on the matter from the back benches some year ago in the context of other scandal involve the royal bank of scotland and lloyds bank after gentleman call paul marshall barrister involve in the case write to draw parallel between the post office horizon case and the banking scandal it be back in march that first speak about the issue and lee castleton tragic case because of the scale of the injustice the depth of the damage and the despair and the unacceptable delay in deliver justice we must act in this exceptional manner will touch on point raise in contribution to the debate thank the shadow secretary of state the hon member for stalybridge and hyde jonathan reynolds and the shadow minister the hon member for bethnal green and bow rushanara ali for their collaborative approach join they in thank one of my predecessor my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam paul scully on the tremendous job he do we all wish he well in whatever he choose to do in his new life but remind he that he still have work to do in this place because we have much work to do gently push back on some of the point make by the shadow minister who say that the tv drama have stimulate the work that have go on in recent week and today we be public servant and we should respond to public outcry so welcome the new attention focus on the issue by the general public the medium and the house however remind hon member and most importantly the victim that we put many measure in place to try to deal with the matter not always as successfully or as quickly as we would have like the horizon shortfall scheme and the inquiry which start in the group litigation order compensation scheme the horizon compensation advisory board on which the right hon member for north durham mr jones sit so effectively and the fix sum award for those whose conviction have be overturn which be put in place last autumn the exploration into how we might overturn conviction more quickly begin some month before the tv dramatisation come to our screen indeed the post office horizon system compensation act assign deadline date that prove difficult for some of the victim the shadow secretary of state point to possible service level agreement in response to issue raise by the business and trade committee about timing for compensation as he and the shadow minister know there be service level agreement in the current compensation and the group litigation order compensation scheme that say there will be response to of final claim submit within day we be hit against that metric so we be make progress we be consider such agreement in element of the new scheme and other scheme so will come back to the house about that the hon member for stalybridge and hyde raise the point about northern ireland as many other member have and we be take that very seriously we be sympathetic to the issue particularly as the assembly be newly form the requirement for public consultation in that jurisdiction may delay thing and we will bear that in mind in our deliberation the shadow minister quite rightly raise the point about the impact of this not just on the victim but on the victim family their child and their spouse indeed terrible thing have happen to many of those family include break up and suicide we have all witness on our tv screen the extent of this problem we will certainly consider mental health support for the affected individual my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill talk about sunset clause interestingly follow his intervention on sunset clause three other legal opinion on similar matter do not all agree with his point the key thing be that all conviction be quash the day this legislation come into effect which should be in july irrespective of the fact that we may not have identify somebody in the list of people whom we will write to follow the passing of this bill their conviction will have be quash if they come forward to self certify and we look at their case that conviction will have already be quash we just need to mark the record the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael speak about political accountability which shall come back to bit later because he raise some very important point my right hon friend the member for haltemprice and howden mr david davis say that this matter should have be deal with in the courtroom think that we would all have prefer to see that have describe this process in the past as the lesser of two evil we must acknowledge that the first of the conviction be overturn in thus far only conviction have be overturn that pace of progress can not be countenance which be why we have take this particular approach thank he though for his kind word on my work but reiterate that the secretary of state have be hugely supportive of everything that have be ask to do and that want to do in this space the same apply to the prime minister and the chancellor of the exchequer and many other ministers right across government let turn now to the hon member for motherwell and wishaw marion fellows for whom have great deal of time and with whom have spend great deal of time work on this issue her work on the all party group on post office be also invaluable fully understand her point about scotland she want to ensure that her legislation work simultaneously with this legislation we believe that that can happen in scotland there be no barrier as such with scotland in the way that there be potentially with northern ireland we also must bear in mind that the lord advocate tend to have different opinion as to whether this be the right way to go about thing in take this route we have have to make some difficult political choice one be to exclude case that have be hear by the court of appeal that be the decision that we have to take here as say these be very difficult choice the point about political accountability be important which be why we decide to use this objective criterion route the hon lady objective criterion would have to be different for instance scotland have different prosecutorial system so the legislation can not be identical there be difference whichever way we look at this so be sure that this debate will continue thank the minister for give way he know that we have huge admiration for the way that he have try to wrestle his way through these issue at the end of these proceeding intend to lay an instruction to the house motion be that necessary can the minister tell we now that he will take this on and include northern ireland in the bill understand the hon member point can tell he from this dispatch box that it be something on which we will continue to have dialogue have talk to his colleague today and yesterday in fact meet the first minister the deputy first minister and the justice minister yesterday to discuss these matter they raise some interesting point that we need to take into account be very happy to keep those conversation ongoing so will happily have further conversation with he after this debate the minister be show his customary politeness and kindness he have outline the discussion with northern ireland the main issue be how we get solution that satisfy everyone across these island so will he also have those discussion with the scottish government particularly around the territorial issue and will he say something about asda employee in scotland who be also catch up in this absolutely give the hon gentleman that assurance we want everything to happen simultaneously our ambition be to get the legislation pass by july if people choose the fix sum award route we can pay compensation rapidly they have two choice of route to take the can be deliver very quickly literally within week of pass the legislation we want to pass the legislation by july we could be pay compensation as quickly as by august exactly the same thing can happen in scotland if the scottish government effect the legislation at the same pace my official be work with official of the snp lead government in scotland on weekly basis to try to ensure that that be the case have meet with my counterpart in the scottish government to talk about this issue do not quite get the hon gentleman point about employee he might want to intervene on again so can address it properly number of member have mention as have the particular issue of asda employee in scotland have the minister think about that employee generally be an issue because they do not have contractual relationship with the post office which be require to enter the compensation scheme but if the company itself do have one it could make compensation claim that could then be pass on to that individual be very happy to discuss individual case with the hon gentleman or with other member pay tribute again to all the work of my hon friend the member for sutton and cheam agree that this be case of human failure as well as technological failure and that the wheel of justice be move too slowly that be why we have step in in this way be always grateful for the work of the right hon member for north durham not least on the horizon compensation advisory board he have make some important recommendation which we have adopt he give four legged analogy about the person be he call more shire horse than show pony which take as compliment would describe he in four legged way as well he be cross between terri and rottweiler and he be highly effective in the way he approach this issue the right hon gentleman ask about conviction relate to pilot version of horizon that be why we have set the date at december that be the first point of the roll out of an application call pathway which be predecessor horizon application we think that the legislation and therefore the redress scheme capture if can use that word case that relate to the pilot scheme in clause as the right hon gentleman know we look at the capture system slightly differently capture be stand alone spreadsheet rather than network computer system there be no remote access for example the key thing be that what we be do here be exceptional and unprecedented we have the body of evidence because it have be before court part of the reason the court make its decision in be base on the horizon issue as it put it we do not have that body of evidence with capture we be keen to talk to he to ensure that we look at the evidence that conversation will continue the right hon gentleman talk about the power to make consequential provision we do not see that as give we the ability to include another group of people there be different reason why that power be in the bill it be for matter that be consequence of the bill which we do not think be the right vehicle to include people for example who have be affect by the capture system as say we will continue to discuss that as say early we understand the argument about northern ireland and we will continue to engage as we will with other member of this house in term of reasonable step the process be in development it be about mark the record and write to individual when we have pass the legislation we will write literally that day or the next day to those individual to say you conviction have be quash and we will give they detail about how to claim compensation know that the minister be commit to ensure that everyone be contact what about the legacy case when people have pass away will someone try to contact their estate for example those be challenging issue the key thing hope the right hon gentleman take this in the right way be that what we be do here to quash conviction do not require people to come forward when the conviction have be quash we will contact the most relevant person in that context those people can take forward claim in exactly the same way and it will be consider in exactly the same way as any other claim the estate the family can claim compensation agree with the minister but think this need to be give some thought perhaps the advisory board might look at legacy case in which people have pass away because those entitle to compensation might not come forward we might have further discussion about that be very happy for we to look at that and to work with the right hon gentleman and the advisory board take this opportunity to pay tribute to he lord arbuthnot sir chris hodges and professor richard moorhead for their work in this area we will continue to work closely alongside the right hon gentleman my hon friend the member for north norfolk duncan baker recognise the work of people other than on this matter not least the secretary of state the prime minister and the chancellor recognise that he be the only serve postmaster in this place so we always listen carefully to what he say like he we encourage people to come forward to claim compensation the people not include in the legislation those who have be convict as result of prosecution by the dwp can still appeal in the normal way and encourage they to do so if they feel that there be ground for that my hon friend ask about fujitsu and the quantum it be due to pay our view have always be that we should let the inquiry conclude and determine responsibility we will then know the extent of the compensation bill and that will be the right time to have conversation about contribution for which fujitsu have already accept moral responsibility we welcome that although the post office have have chequer past in this regard believe that it have very bright future and we be keen to ensure that it do we should always keep that in mind understand what the right hon member for east antrim sammy wilson say about the territorial extent of the bill as say meet the first minister deputy first minister and the minster of justice for northern ireland yesterday and will continue to do so we be determined to ensure that measure be bring forward as quickly as possible in all area of the united kingdom the right hon member make compelling case about the need for public consultation in his jurisdiction we be aware of that there be case in northern ireland and we be keen to ensure that they be overturn as quickly as possible we will continue work to ensure that that happen the right hon member for orkney and shetland talk clearly about ensure that prosecutor be accountable for their role decision be take in scotland he be right to say clearly that legislative consent motion do not offer the same level of parliamentary accountability and think we should all reflect on that his final word be accountability make difference the hon member for north down stephen farry talk about his preference for the measure to be uk wide we understand that we have have several conversation and will have many more be sure understand his point about the risk of judicial review and of delay to public consultation he feel that he make an overwhelming argument we will keep those conversation go concur with the shadow minister the hon member for bethnal green and bow and echo her tribute to alan bates jo hamilton lee castleton journalist nick wallis campaigner dan neidle another journalist tom witherow lord arbuthnot karl flinders and many other include many member of this house we pay tribute to they for their work we recognise the profound impact that the horizon scandal have have on those who be falsely accuse it have take too long to get to this point and our ambition be to get this legislation through both houses by july and compensation pay to the victim by august through this bill we will exonerate those who be so unjustly convict of crime that they do not commit and

house of lords motion make and question propose that this house do now wood suppose ought to begin by wish my hon friend the member for glasgow south west chris stephens very happy birthday base on what he be say about the birthday present he have just receive madam deputy speaker as you and other occupant of the chair often remind we topical question be suppose to be short and to the point but have be unsuccessful in catch mr speaker eye during topical question to the foreign commonwealth and development office last week and follow my point of order later that day he kindly grant this adjournment debate to explore what would otherwise have be very short topical question where be the foreign secretary and why be he not answer question in this house we now have the opportunity to explore that in little more detail and be grateful to mr speaker for that we might as well acknowledge at the start that even though we have more time than might have be expect to explore this issue suspect that the government response will be relatively short and that the minister will simply suggest that the house must wait patiently for they to publish their response to the procedure committee recent report on this issue within the usual timescale however that do not change the reality that the appointment of david cameron as foreign secretary in the house of lords have have immediate and practical consequence for member of this house and it raise wide question about the relationship between the two houses the accountability of ministers more generally and the kind of precedent that his appointment have set the government should be prepare to answer those kind of question at any time and they should certainly have think some of those thing through before the appointment be make if they be go to smash up convention by appoint foreign secretary from the lords they should not have to hide behind convention about timescale for respond to select committee report before try to justify that decision and deal with its consequence there be therefore two interlinked theme that it be worth explore first be some of the practical implication and consequence relate specifically to the current foreign secretary be member of the house of lords but there be also the wide principle involve about how ministers especially those who sit in the lords be scrutinise by the elect house commend the hon gentleman for secure this debate speak to he beforehand and well understand the issue he bring to the house there be clear disconnect between the essence of elect democrat and the scrutiny of secretaries of state who sit in cabinet and moreover the electorate do he agree that in order to tackle this issue and ensure that all secretary of state be liable to answer to member of the house of commons more must be do to overcome this issue in future and ensure that it do not become regular occurrence thank the hon gentleman another important parliamentary convention have now be observe with his intervention in the adjournment debate be grateful for and agree very much with the point he make and we will look at all that in bit more detail indeed most of we will be familiar with the context that he start to describe the prime minister announce on monday november that david cameron would be appoint to the house of lords and would serve as foreign secretary mr speaker write to the procedure committee on november request that it explore option for enhance scrutiny by the house of commons of senior ministers in the house of lords the procedure committee of which and some other member present be member publish its report and recommendation include the key recommendation that the foreign secretary should appear before this house to answer question on january two month later we be still wait for the government response as say in my point of order last week there have be two session of fcdo question since that report be publish and no sign of the foreign secretary in fact there have be three session of fcdo question since his appointment and if the usual rota continue we can extrapolate that there ought to be another three session before the summer recess fcdo ministers have respond to urgent question include one today and make eight oral statement since the new foreign secretary be appoint there have be write statement from fcdo ministers in the commons three of which have be on behalf of fcdo ministers in the lords include one in the name of the foreign secretary himself as each question session pass and as each urgent question be answer or statement make the accountability gap grow wide the frustration of member of this house increase and the absurdity of the situation become clear welcome this debate as lord cameron have agree and as have be re instigate he be now take half an hour of question in the lords directly to he not to other ministers in the house of commons we get no minute and no question to the foreign secretary that can not be right for democratic chamber can it absolutely that be precisely why it be important that we have the opportunity to draw these point to the government attention incidentally do not know whether he have write it down or say it anywhere but around the time of his appointment there be indication from lord cameron that he would be happy to co operate with accountability mechanism but they do not seem to have be put in place and will come back to that accountability be particularly important as the hon gentleman suggest because we be live through time of significant global turmoil with perhaps some of the big threat to the establish rule base order of peace and security since the second world war there be no guaranteed or permanent mechanism for member of this elect house as whole to directly question and scrutinise the work of the government chief diplomat their rove ambassador on the world stage their voice in the corridor of foreign power his majesty secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs the right hon david cameron baron cameron of chipping norton be grateful to the hon member for bring forward this debate our constituent be write to we at this time about the challenge situation we see in gaza and clearly they want answer from the person who be make decision give the lack of accountability in the system when there could be war crime be commit not least by our own country in trading arm it be absolutely right that we should have the opportunity to scrutinise do he believe that we need to ensure that we have foreign secretary who be elect democratically from our country and that they should not be sit in the house of lords yes precisely the key point be accountability to this elect house and will come on to that in more detail we have be elect to hold the government to account and we be be deny that opportunity because of decision make by the prime minister much of this come down to what the prime minister and the government want to achieve by the appointment of david cameron in the first place it might have shake up the world of break news and podcast analysis for few day it might have signal some kind of change in direction of the government priority it might have calm the blue wall even if at the same time it be slightly worry the red wall it also send strange message to every conservative member of this house perhaps every member other than the prime minister himself that none of they be good enough or have the necessary skill or experience at this point in time to be the foreign secretary that apply not least to the immediately previous foreign secretary he may have be redeploy to be home secretary but he have still essentially be judge by the prime minister not to be the right person for the job the end result as we have already hear in intervention be woefully inadequate opportunity for member of the commons to scrutinise effectively the work of the foreign secretary and by extension the foreign office as whole many of we have huge amount of respect and regard for the minister for international development the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell not something people will often hear snp members say about conservative ministers however he now have to effectively deputise for the foreign secretary in this house without any additional ministerial support have be provide in the commons team as far as can tell so by definition he have more to deal with than before it must stretch he and his team no matter how deftly and effectively they try to work no matter how capable any of the ministers be none of they can truly answer on behalf of the foreign secretary for the simple reason that they be not the foreign secretary they will not have be in the meeting he have be in be on the trip he have be on or attend the summit he have attend so all their answer all their response to question and all their position outline in statement be second hand at well my hon friend the member for west dunbartonshire martin docherty hughes who can not be here this evening write powerful letter to the procedure committee when it be consider this matter he highlight the ongoing situation of his constituent jagtar singh johal who have be arbitrarily detain by the government of india for nearly seven year have hear from many of my constituent who share those concern about the treatment of mr johal my hon friend letter and his point of order in the house on january draw attention to what he call the extraordinary lack of response from the foreign secretary to letter about this case and his frustration about not be able to raise these concern directly with the foreign secretary on the floor of the house such frustration and concern be present in other evidence take by the procedure committee and have be hear in other departmental question urgent question statement point of order in westminster hall debate and even in intervention right here this evening the procedure committee consider range of option and possibility for enhance scrutiny of lords ministers particularly the secretary of state it look at previous suggestion of hold question session in westminster hall or one of the large committee rooms or convene special grand committee either here in the chamber or elsewhere but it come to the conclusion that the simple and most straightforward way to scrutinise the foreign secretary would be for he appear in the chamber during departmental question and for any relevant uqs or statement and to answer question from the bar of the house the hansard society suggest in its evidence that there may be some practical and presentational issue with the foreign secretary standing presumably at lectern at the bar of the house while other ministers continue to answer from the dispatch box think the word use be ridiculous perhaps some of we would have some sympathy with that but it should not be insurmountable then there be the question of whether the lords would need to give permission for one of its member to appear in the commons or whether the commons would need to agree to some kind of resolution to make change to its standing orders but none of that should be insurmountable all of these issue start with the actual appointment of the foreign secretary be in the gift of the government ultimately whether the foreign secretary come to answer question in this house like pretty much everything else that happen here be for the government to decide the government can make it happen or they can choose not to make it happen by choose not to do so they will send message about exactly what kind of regard they have for this house for the mandate we have for our constituent and therefore for our constituent themselves we can recognise that the appointment be not totally without precedent the procedure committee report and the very thorough and helpful library briefing on the subject both list various example of ministers and secretaries of state who have serve in the lords in recent and not so recent time but that do not mean that those situation be not also sub optimal in how the ministers be scrutinise and hold to account there have be some attempt to distinguish between secretary of state for various government departments and those that have be consider great office of state however the concept of great office of state be not write down anywhere and any prime minister at any time could choose to change or divide the responsibility of the treasury home office or the fcdo which not so long ago be the foreign and commonwealth office before one of the many former prime ministers we have have in recent year merge it with the department for international development in each case where secretary of state have be appoint in the lords whether that be lord mandelson as business secretary or baroness morgan as culture secretary the govern party at the time say that it be all fine and there be line of accountability to the commons and the official opposition at the time be suitably outraged and say it be an appalling state of affair that would never happen on their watch that tell we lot about the interchangeability of the two major party in uk politic and the imperative of any incumbent government of whatever colour to maintain the establish status quo of constitutional convention and practice perhaps that start to get we to the broad point of principle at play and the broad question of whether the government and the prime minister or indeed any past or future uk governments and prime ministers really care all that much about scrutiny by this house and the role of the commons more generally the established principle in this parliament and the devolved institution be that the executive be draw from and accountable to and through the legislature there be plenty of example around the world where member of the executive the equivalent of ministers and secretaries of state be not draw from the legislature in many of those case however we think particularly of the united states there be an incredibly thorough vetting and approval process appointment hearing in the united states senate can take day or week even for relatively junior appointment close to home in scotland parliament indeed we see it happen today in wales with the appointment of the new first minister the appointment of scottish government cabinet secretaries and ministers must be agree to by parliament before they be approve by the king incidentally that include the lord advocate and solicitor general for scotland who be not member of the scottish parliament but appear in its chamber which be design to accommodate they so they can sit or stand and answer question and be hold to account by the elect member process for approval of ministers by vote of the legislature could quite easily be adopt in this parliament my hon friend the member for perth and north perthshire pete wishart try to introduce something precisely to that end through ten minute rule bill in previous session in some respect it ought to be formality because if the government can command majority that accept the prime minister decision about ministerial appointment it should be able get those appointment through at the very least it would allow some public deliberation and question about the wisdom of individual appointment and the relevant experience suitability and perhaps outside interest of ministers designate be sure that people might have have question about the foreign secretary outside interest upon his appointment such accountability be not something that government confident in their decision making and command of majority in the house should be afraid of there have also be question about reciprocity if ministers who be lords be to appear before the commons to take question should ministers who be mp appear before the lords on the face of it that might not seem an entirely unreasonable question but it come back to the point about accountability which be relevant to the intervention from the hon member for york central rachael maskell member of the house of lords have be appoint to their position for the rest of their life by the prime minister of the day or perhaps because they be bishop in the church of england or someone ancestor member of the house of commons be accountable to their voter our constituent make choice about who should represent they and we make representation on their behalf not least by ask question of ministers that come back to the point make by the hon member for york central the question of whether the minister be elect be slightly beside the point in this debate do not expect response from the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart on behalf of the people in his constituency be put question on behalf of the people of glasgow north to the government and expect and look forward to response from the parliamentary secretary to the cabinet office as the hon lady say our constituency inboxe be full of huge issue none big at the moment than the situation in israel and gaza and the need for an immediate ceasefire however there be no way for any of we to put those view directly to the foreign secretary have no method of put that point on the record directly to he and of receive response on behalf of the people of glasgow north that lead we not just to question about the scrutiny of lords ministers by the commons but to the role and purpose of the second chamber the accountability of unelected parliamentarian the relationship between both houses and the relationship between the legislature and the executive that go back to the point that and many other have make before meaningful reform of the lords be not possible without meaningful reform of the commons meaningful reform of the commons would mean the government in particular the prime minister give up significant power of patronage appointment and executive control neither of the main party want to give that up once it have achieve power there be reason why the labour party have be promise and fail to deliver meaningful reform of the house of lords for over year give up the power to directly appoint member to the house of lords would be significant diminution of the prime minister power of patronage fully or even partially elect the lords would inevitably challenge the assumed supremacy of the commons the first priority of any uk government on acquire power be to retain that power that will not change after the next election no matter the outcome the minister will tell we all to wait patiently for the government official response to the procedure committee report and perhaps even tell we that it will be publish soon or before the recess we can take pretty good guess at what it will say if the government want the foreign secretary to appear before this house at departmental question or at any other point they would have already make arrangement for that to happen constituent in glasgow north some of whom be represent by the hon member for rochdale george galloway once upon time will look on with confusion disappointment and increase disenchantment the scottish parliament be not perfect but its procedure for scrutiny of ministers and accessibility to the wide public be light year beyond what be in place in westminster just as there be reason why the labour party have repeatedly fail to reform the lords there be reason why the snp refuse to take seat in the unelected house when scotland become independent perhaps there will be some kind of second chamber of parliament or strong system of participative and deliberative democracy through citizen assembly to explore proposal before the legislature take they forward whatever the shape and form it will be decide by the people of scotland who be and always will be sovereign in scotland irrespective of the convention and tradition of westminster foreign secretary in an independent scotland certainly one with an snp government would work to uphold peace and human right around the world invest in poverty reduction and tackle climate change and represent country proud at last to be free of nuclear weapon of mass destruction the long westminster diverge from that vision transparency and accountability and the more prime ministers of whatever flavour from whatever wing of whatever party think they can avoid scrutiny by elect parliamentarian and appoint their friend donor and ally to position of power without consequence the more the people in glasgow north and across scotland will come to realise the difference that we can make and will make with independence congratulate the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady my successor as the member of parliament for the most educate place in britain it be once say that the glasgow hillhead constituency have the high pro rata subscription rate to the new statesman of any constituency in the land he show it in the erudition albeit on rather ruritanian state of affair of his contribution be grateful to he for secure this debate and for give time that might otherwise have be appropriate by he to make this contribution some chicken some neck mr churchill famously say to paraphrase mr churchill some secretary of state some time this be not comparable to peter mandelson be the business secretary in the house of lords this be time of great international peril where foreign affair be undoubtedly the big single item in our inboxe it must be true there be million on the street well it be certainly true of my inbox there be million on the street about britain foreign policy there be demonstration daily and weekly all over the country people be seize of our role in international affair have never know time like it and there can not be many member in the house who have participate in more foreign policy issue from the until now when our people be so occupied and many be preoccupy by our role in the world what be about to say be in no sense disrespect for the current occupant of the foreign secretaryship quite the contrary he be big improvement on his predecessor and he be cut above his likely successor do not demur at all from the idea that lord cameron be skilled international diplomat our problem as country which be forever lecture other people on the quality of their democracy be that we now have an unelected head of state an unelected prime minister and an unelected foreign secretary the second most important piece on the treasury bench that be ruritanian it be actually rather absurd if you start to consider it the hon member for glasgow north be adumbrate the possible outcome of lectern be erect just at that white line there the microphone would need to be adjust and face that way instead of towards you madam deputy speaker that be ridiculous if there be will there would be way the silence from the government in response to the procedure committee beseech of they to find solution to this situation be eloquent as such lengthy silence always be we have situation where daily if not hourly new and dramatic foreign policy development be occur just this day for example prime minister netanyahu announce that the port be build in gaza with the rubble of the home destroy in the bombing include the skull and the bone of the people destroy with the house and lie unburied under the rubble be be build for the deportation of million of palestinians from the territory an act of ethnic cleansing of the foul kind we would have expect statement from the foreign secretary in the light of such dramatic development but statement come there none and good have come there none his able deputy and share the hon gentleman feeling for the minister of state he be fine man and have know he for very long time can not possibly cope with all this workload as effectively lord cameron deputy in this place his vicar on earth but even if he could he would still not be the foreign secretary we can not continue to be democratic country will the hon gentleman give way of course rise order hope that the hon gentleman will be brief because it be very unusual for member to come in after an adjournment debate have start and then to intervene let add that it be important for everyone who do intervene to stay until the end of the debate thank you for that strict reminder madam deputy speaker do the hon gentleman agree that if he or be to secure an urgent question the same principle would apply and the foreign secretary would not be here indeed could not be here for reason which be what be they about architecture kindly guide with your eyebrow as you normally do madam deputy speaker if be go on for too long be not entirely sure about the timing of all this as matter of architecture for democratic chamber to be bereft of the presence of its principal diplomat and the country principal diplomat at time of massive international tension be completely absurd on this day in our country go off to fight the most disastrous war that we have fight for well over year it be disastrous decision but at least it be decision that the prime minister and the foreign secretary of the day be ready to and have to defend each and every single day the debate not many of we who be here now be involve in they except thee and madam deputy speaker be of the fierce and most urgent kind but we may now be on the brink of world war three little macron may be about to march his legionnaire into odesa create the grave international crisis since the second world war and we will not be able to question our foreign secretary about it we will have to wait for the morning edition to learn what the government intend to do war in ukraine war in gaza maybe war against iran war in the red sea war everywhere foreign secretary nowhere nowhere at least where he can be question by the people in this country who be elect to question he that be the point madam deputy speaker it be our duty to hold ministers to account but by definition in this situation we can not hold the occupant of this office to account we talk about great office of state at such time of high tension there can be no doubt that the second most important office of state in britain today be that of the foreign secretary but he be outwith our reach we can not as we once do rub shoulder with he in the division lobby we can not even see he in the members tea room we can not bump into he in the corridor we can not in any way impress on he that million upon million of our fellow citizen and our constituent have this or that concern or point of view on the great issue of the day this be untenable madam deputy speaker be seek to inject some note of urgency and passion into this because it be an untenable situation wish that it have be possible to find one conservative member who be capable of be foreign secretary it would have be much easy and this debate would not be happen but none of they be up to the job it be therefore immediately incumbent on the government to bring forward solution whereby we be able to look in the eye of the second most important politician in the state and press upon he the political preoccupation that occupy the concern of million of we it be pleasure to follow the hon member for rochdale george galloway agree with every word he say and be not sure that have ever be in position to say that rise to make few observation about the procedure committee report which be not an easy one do not think that any of we come into this place with the idea that we would willingly invite member of the house of lords to come and sit on these green benches and address we and do not think that any of we want to accidentally encourage this government or future one to appoint more secretary of state in the house of lords because they can get away with it find bit of accountability do not make it all right however the simple fact be that the government appoint somebody from the house of lords as the second most important member of the government at probably the most dangerous time in the world in my adult lifetime result in situation whereby we can not question he or impress our view on he before he go around the world and we can not hear from he about what he have say at all his meeting actually think that the appointment of lord cameron be very good one he be an incredibly able politician and from the look of it he have be work incredibly hard to represent our national interest around the world will not criticise the individual who have be appoint but surely the government can see that this be not tolerable situation for the elect house to be place in the procedure committee try to come up with some sort of solution that give we bit of accountability accept that we could not find perfect solution we start with our predecessor committee view on the appointment of lord mandelson and lord adonis back in the committee recommend have question session in westminster hall every couple of month but the problem we have with that be that westminster hall be not big enough if lord cameron be to appear in westminster hall to answer general question about foreign affair or even on single topic we might find that substantially more mps would want to ask question than could be safely accommodate which would equally apply to any committee room in this place then we would have to work out whether we would have ballot question in advance which be not generally do in westminster hall we would have to put in place whole load of arrangement that we have never have before for the relatively short time leave of this parliament hope that lord cameron be foreign secretary for long time which would mean that such arrangement be need for lot long but if we rule out westminster hall and any committee rooms the only thing we be leave with be conduct question session in the house of commons chamber we do not have general support for the idea of have member of the house of lords sit on green bench and address this house from the dispatch box and there be not great deal of precedent for that it leave only the bar of the house as the place to conduct such session we even talk about the idea of lord cameron beam in from the screen like president zelensky do or like boris johnson do when he be answer prime minister question when he have covid not have the foreign secretary here so that we could look he in the white of his eye would have be imperfect too if we believe that this house should have some level of scrutiny of the foreign secretary there be no alternative to it take place in this chamber and the procedure committee come up with the least bad option of that happen at the bar of the house we would have no problem with the government say let have he on that bench and at the dispatch box but it would be equally imperfect to have he here for general foreign office question we could have recommend that he come here for dedicated half hour question time like he do in the house of lords the problem be that that would give the one secretary of state in the house of lords great accountability in the house of commons because he would answer question for whole half an hour month whereas any other head of department probably answer only handful of question in their half an hour of question time we could then have more scrutiny of the secretary of state in the commons than in the lords which would not be perfect either all the option we have be terrible but this be not the starting point of the committee or the house it be the position we be put in by the government and we be try to find the least bad way of fix it hope the minister do not resort to nit pick about individual idea hope he engage with the general principle that if the government choose of their own volition to have one of the great office of state hold by someone who be not member of the house of commons there should be opportunity for the house of commons to have regular scrutiny of that individual we should be able to question they on what they be do and try to impress on they the view of this house so that they can present they around the world alternatively should we just leave it and accept that this be the way it have always be give that ministers in the lords do not appear in this chamber think that the balance we need to strike be that if someone of that seniority be deal with issue of the level of importance we be see at the moment we have to find way forward in this situation have great regard for the minister for development and africa my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell but with the good will in the world he be not the foreign secretary we need to be able to question the foreign secretary on the big issue hopefully the minister will give we the good news that the government have come up with preferred way for this to work so that we can get on with this rapidly that be what modern democratic parliament have every right to expect if we be go to have ministers in senior position who be not member of this house we must find way of scrutinise they as be do in nearly every parliament around the world that appoint ministers who be not in that chamber they find way to do it this be not rocket science and it be not without precedent we can find way of do it so let get on and do it congratulate the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady on bring forward what be genuinely interesting and surprisingly well attend adjournment debate think it be the well attend adjournment debate have take for some time be in mischievous mood would gently refer he to the answer that give he on november february and march and resume my place but alas mischief elude and will give he as full an answer as can obviously the government be consider the very good and serious report into this situation from the procedure committee it be not an anomalous situation it have arise before but it be right that we should consider it in modern light in the meantime while we be wait for the government full consideration there be number of way in which the foreign secretary be be hold to account by parliament as whole in the house of lords he answer question on november december january january february march and march report april vol correction know that the house of lords be not place where the scottish national party go to play as the hon gentleman know because we have debate this on number of occasion think that be great shame understand that the party plan and vision to break up the kingdom fail with the support of the scottish people be pleased to say after that juncture snp members would have do well to accept that that be once in generation vote and that they be plausibly go to be here for some time if people continue to elect snp members to this house it would therefore have be wise of they to stick few people in the upper house so that the view of their party and that part of the electorate could be represent in that part of parliament they choose not to consequently they be now unable to question the foreign secretary when he stand to answer question in the lords but that be their prerogative the minister will know that our constituent voice will not be hear in the other place and that it be we who be elect to bring those voice forward on october the foreign secretary at the time invite all member of this house over to the foreign office to ask question could the minister explain why the foreign secretary have not make himself available even in an informal way off the record so that members of parliament from the house of commons can scrutinise he over his decision making the hon lady will have an opportunity to ask that question of the foreign secretary colleague when they next come to the house can not answer the particular because they pertain to the foreign office in the meantime there will be opportunity to ask question of the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell although it be true that he be not the foreign secretary he be in the cabinet and be bind by collective agreement he sit in discussion at the high level on all matter relate to foreign affair and he have answer question in this house on november november november december december december december january january january january january january february february february march and march member of this house have have opportunity to ask question of he man who sit in cabinet and who know the foreign secretary mind be sure he will be very grateful to hear the comment of the hon member for glasgow north about his workload but can assure the hon gentleman that my right hon friend be very capable individual as the hon member for rochdale george galloway say and workload be not problem from which he suffer while we await the government response to the report it be possible for member to write to the foreign secretary know that the hon member for glasgow north have write to he once and have do so assume that he ask all the question he would like to ask if he have not he be welcome to write second letter there be broad point that raise with my hon friend the member for amber valley nigel mills when be before the procedure committee which be that there be an historical dimension that work with the grain of what the committee be say this issue first arise as you will probably know from your history lesson madam deputy speaker in when the commons choose to summon two peer the duke of buckingham and the earl of arlington to answer question the duke of buckingham because he be consider to be lascivious wicked and scandalous in his lifestyle and the earl of arlington because he favour papist they be admonish by the commons and send on their way the response of the lords be to point out that their house too have privilege and that it be not within the power of the commons to forcibly summon members of the house of lords to the bar of the house the lords pass standing order that say that member of the house of lords could not be summon here however it be still clear that members of the house of lords could be invite and there have be number of instance in which member of the house of lords have be invite to this house and have answer question in the earl of balcarres and earl cornwallis be bring here to answer question about the army conduct during the american revolution in lord melville come to this house at his own request have be impeach he ask that the house give he an audience lord teignmouth be question twice about indian affair in and more famously the duke of wellington come to give an account of the peninsula war in raise these point because we be all aware that there have be moment in not so recent history when commoner have come to the bar the last be in when mr junor be summon over an issue in the press my point be that if the commons want to it be capable of invite member of the lords to come to answer question here to certain extent history place the solution at the disposal of the hon member for glasgow north the commons could invite the foreign secretary now to come to the bar of the house to answer question however appreciate the hon gentleman be look for something more routine and for that be afraid he will have to wait until the government respond to the report in conclusion it be right that we have this debate it be important that there be scrutiny of the government and of the cabinet and that be what this government seek to provide question put and agree to house adjourn
