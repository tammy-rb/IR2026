in northern ireland and in great britain we will not hesitate to take the action that be necessary to respond but we be not go to make snap decision because we be also try to negotiate an economic agreement with the united states of america an industrial strategy would be very welcome but be not the reality that any assistance under an industrial strategy in northern ireland would be subject to eu state aid rule that any raw material for industry in northern ireland that come from gb would have to pass through the international eu custom border and that many good would have to be make to eu

for different scenario we do not yet know apart from the tariff on car and on steel and aluminium what else the us administration may announce later today but the effect of any tariff if impose will be feel equally in northern ireland and across the rest of the united kingdom we will have to deal with the consequence when we know what the us administration have decide be afraid that reveal that the government have provide business with no information to help they prepare for the different scenario that may emerge the secretary of state will be aware that in some scenario northern ireland

refer to do not reflect the treasury assessment of the number of farm that will be affect which be base on claim submit in the past understand the farming industry concern but the treasury be clear

economic prosperity deal with the us it be why we be work with all industry and sector likely to be impact our decision will always be guide by our national interest that be why we have prepare for all eventuality and will rule nothing out our deep sympathy be with the people of myanmar and thailand we be send immediate lifesaving support to assist their effort may also extend my personal condolence to the family friend and colleague of christina mckelvie she be much love and will be sorely miss especially by our scottish national party colleague here and in scotland this morning have meeting with ministerial colleague and other in addition to my duty in this house shall have further such meeting later today this week the full state pension will rise by year put money in the pocket of pensioner in glasgow and across the united kingdom do the prime minister agree that this rise be possible only because of labour plan for change and our commitment to the triple lock my hon friend be absolutely right we can commit to the triple lock because we have restore stability after the conservatives crash the economy that mean that next week million pensioner will receive up to more that be an extra over this parliament include million pensioner in scotland the contrast could not be clear the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon mel stride call the triple lock unsustainable and the leader of the opposition want to means test the state pension so that she can cut it call the leader of the opposition the triple lock be conservative order rather than the prime minister congratulate himself on what we do why do we talk about what he be do from sunday labour job tax will mean that many british business face terrible choice cut wage put up price or sack their staff what be his advice to those business the right hon lady say that the triple lock be conservative policy the conservatives be once think to be the party of sound finance but they blow all of that she ask what we be do we be clear up the mess that they leave we be deal with global instability and we recognise the pressure that be bear down on business individual and work people that be why we be roll up our sleeve yesterday be pleased to announce the national living wage increase by that be pay rise for million of worker we have announce for the warm home discount now extend to million household which be one in five family wage be go up fast than price never forget under the conservative party there be the bad living standard on record inflation up to and public service leave on their knee the only mess be the one that the prime minister make with his budget they have an emergency budget last week that fix nothing he say that he be bring stability but all we see be fragility during the election the prime minister also promise that he would not increase taxis on work people but even the office for budget responsibility say that the job tax will be pass on to worker on average family will be poor why should anyone trust he again the right hon lady fantasy figure be about as much use as liz truss economic planning she turn up every week to carp from the sideline about decision that we make in the budget yesterday she hold press conference and could not say whether she would reverse the decision that we make at the budget understand because she can not bring herself to say that she do not want the investment of an extra billion in our nhs be not surprised at that as that is million extra appointment more gps pay rise for nurse and so on let get her position right if can follow it she want the extra billion in the nhs which be pay for by the national insurance rise she want that but she do not want to reverse the national insurance rise she be now reduce to this absurd position of voting against budget carping against budget that she actually agree with do not agree with make people poor do not agree with pensioner poverty do not out there they be call it awful april and that be because of decision the prime minister have make because he make promise and break they his promise be worthless people be get poor before the election he pledge to freeze council tax instead it be go up everywhere even in birmingham where tonne of rubbish go uncollected on the street do the prime minister regret promise the british people that he would freeze their council tax when he have so obviously fail have to ask the right hon lady this if she do not want people to be poor why do she not resign when she be in government the last government put up council tax for year in row she think be actually the minister responsible for council tax and in that year what do she do she put it up even now the local government association conservative group manifesto state on page its current position we ask that that the government remove the cap on council tax who be lead the charge hampshire county council want hike we say no slough council want hike we say no windsor and maidenhead council be tory now lib dem want hike and we say no it be no surprise that council tax be cheap under labour council than under tory council the prime minister do not want to talk about birmingham and that be because he know the situation will say it again tonne of rubbish on birmingham street normally state of emergency be call for natural disaster not labour one his policy have leave our economy dangerously fragile the chancellor once again leave herself no room for manoeuvre economic expert real economist say that she will either have to break her fiscal rule or put up taxis which will it be think the right hon lady must have pick up the script she be use few week ago because only then she be say that we be go to put up taxis in the spring statement the situation in birmingham be completely unacceptable and fully support the council in declare it major incident to resolve the situation we will put in whatever additional support be need when the conservatives be in government we lose more day to strike action than in any year since the nhs worker be on the picket line not on the frontline and that send waiting list through the roof so we will take no lecture on industrial harmony from the conservatives the whole house would have hear that the prime minister do not say whether he could keep to his fiscal rule that mean it be either change that or put up taxis nine month ago we leave labour the fast grow economy in the interruption we do remember watch his mps laugh at their first destructive budget they have have another one that have make our economy dangerously vulnerable the bank of england say that his policy have push up the cost of live for family do he disagree with the bank or do he accept his policy mean high bill the right hon lady must be the only person leave in the country who actually think the tories do well on the economy when they be in power that be what be test at the last election living standard be the bad on record and inflation soar up to the nhs be on its knee she be so obsessed with talk down the country that she have not read the obr forecast properly growth be up in in in and in that be thank to our planning reform the large growth measure the obr have ever cost what do the tories do when that bill come before parliament they abstain we do not grow the economy or build house by abstain they be the same old party they have not change nothing new the prime minister talk about inflation we leave it at it be now twice what the obr forecast when we be in government the fact be that his decision have make our economy fragile just as we face global trade war in november urge he to seize the draft us trade deal that the conservatives negotiate instead he lose our most experienced trade negotiator it be no wonder he can not get tariff deal for british car the conservatives secure investment for that industry with million from bmw billion from nissan and billion from jaguar land rover labour record be car industry in crisis even before tariff with more job now at risk he say he be prepare for all eventuality can the prime minister tell we exactly what he be do to protect the british car industry from his failure to negotiate we be take calm pragmatic approach and keep our foot on the ground constructive talk be ongoing on wide economic prosperity deal with the us that be really important at this moment we be work with all sector that be likely to be impact and we be guide by our national interest at all time and that be why we have say we will not rule anything out but it be important at moment like this that we do not have knee jerk reaction and that we be cool headed about this that be why we will not rule anything out the right hon lady be the trade secretary who fail to get trade deal with the us today the trump administration will announce new tariff that will hurt work people in the us and around the world do the prime minister agree that at time when big tech have grow fat by corrupt our politic and preying on young people the wrong approach would be to pander to his bullying tactic and the tech billionaire in his imperial court by cut the digital service tax can he assure the public that the poor will not get cut while the rich get free ride thank the hon member for raise this important issue there be issue in relation to northern ireland in particular that we have to deal with very carefully we will always put the national interest first and that be why be pleased that talk be ongoing and they be constructive talk believe that trade war be in nobody interest and all of the sector and industry impact be of the same view so we will continue to make that progress in the national interest call the leader of the liberal democrats associate myself with the prime minister early remark particularly about myanmar and thailand support the aid despite the budget cut hope we can be as generous as possible because of the humanitarian crisis there the prime minister have show commendable leadership over ukraine with his plan for military coalition of the willing against putin will he now provide similar leadership with an economic coalition of the willing against trump tariff and for free trade so we can avoid global trade war and global recession every week the right hon gentleman try to tempt to make what think be false choice between our relationship with the us and our relationship with other country particularly in europe think that be the wrong choice on defence on security and on intelligence for reason that we have rehearse across this chamber also think it be wrong on trade and on the economy we have good deal of trade balanced trade relationship with the us and believe that our interest be well serve by calmly try to secure deal that be in our national interest while at the same time prepare and leave all option on the table hope the prime minister be able to cut deal but increasingly fear that the deal will not be good enough to avoid global trade war that be why one of the option must be to work with our european ally our commonwealth ally and other because if we do not tackle trump tariff we could be say goodbye to free trade for generation turn to domestic matter three year ago the american private equity firm kkr buy stake in northumbrian water since then people across the north east have see their water bill soar while in the last year alone northumbrian water have dump nearly million tonne of raw sewage into durham whitburn coast conservation area kkr be now poise to buy into thames water because minister have rule out special administration regime will the prime minister guarantee that thames water will not be allow to repeat the same trick of put up bill and dump raw sewage at the same time the conservatives allow it he should not in relation to the beginning of the right hon gentleman comment really do not think it be sensible to say that the first response should be to jump into trade war with the us that can not be the first response of the united kingdom and will resist his urging to do that in relation to water the right hon gentleman be absolutely right to point out the conservative party appalling record on water just like its record on everything that be why be pleased that we have already pass the water special measures act to take the necessary measure but we will go far yesterday the work and pensions committee visit manchester where we see the power of devolution in action in this case help people to find work with just percentage point separate labour and conservative candidate at the last mayoral election do the prime minister agree that to get the maximum advantage from labour devolution offer the west of england need an ambitious labour mayor in helen godwin for more job to fix our bus and to get the home we need build believe it be good for community when their leader have skin in the game helen godwin grow up in stapleton go to college in filton and have great record fighting for the community where she be raise her family our plan for change have deliver record funding for the west of england more money for well bus pothole and get young people into work that be the difference labour mayor work with labour government deliver for the west of england the prime minister will know that many in the house will be assuage by his suggestion that he will act in the national interest in relation to tariff but most will not have consider that in act in the national interest what occur in northern ireland be no long solely in his control he know that export from northern ireland be uk export and rightly so yet import to northern ireland could be affect as consequence of eu retaliatory action in keep all his option open now we have to live in world of the consequence of the last government with his support will he indicate whether he be prepared to take step either to exempt northern ireland from eu action or to take retaliatory action if the eu do not do so thank the right hon gentleman for raise this issue which be of real importance to his constituent and to everybody in northern ireland it be very serious issue that be why we need to be calm and pragmatic and that be what worker and business in northern ireland would want to see from this government at time like this we be as he would expect look carefully at the detail of any retaliatory tariff announce by the eu if they be announce and what impact they might have on business as he know where good do not enter the eu business can claim full reimbursement of any eu duty pay but reassure he that the interest of northern ireland be at the forefront of our decision he may want to know that this morning the business secretary speak to the northern ireland executive because this be serious issue and we need to work together to resolve it in the interest of everybody in northern ireland while the last government resort to damage keyboard diplomacy this government be lead bring nation together this week to tackle illegal immigration like the prime minister have see at first hand how counter terror power can disrupt threat before life be lose that same approach be essential in dismantle the smuggling network do he agree that it be time that the conservatives and reform drop the posturing put national security first and back our border bill the conservatives try an open border experiment we be now tackle illegal migration they talk about flight we have already remove people with no right to be here under their rwanda scheme which be only ever suppose to return think people year what we have achieve in nine month would have take they year we have replace gimmick with real deterrent the prime minister have speak very movingly and with genuine sincerity and affection about his time as young man in the langdale valley in the lake district in my constituency and how that help to shape he wonder whether he be aware that the hill farmer who maintain those stunning landscape in the lake and elsewhere will be earn on average significantly less than or barely half of the national minimum wage due to cut in their income despite the fact that they provide the backdrop to the remarkably important tourism economy will he agree to meet and upland farmer in the lake and the dale so that we can design scheme together to end this poverty and equip our hill farmer to produce food and protect our epic landscape for generation to come the hon gentleman and share love of the lake district we still go back there with our child this be obviously serious issue which be why we put record amount into farming at the budget and also set out our road map will happily make sure that he get meeting with the relevant minister to go through that and to take on board any point he have to make in relation to it hundred of resident in my constituency at union park be face massive million charge to repair their heating system and for fire safety work that have not be put right by the developer which have now declare bankruptcy and walk away their new freeholder have wash its hand of responsibility and be instead leverage huge ground rent bill and fine against those resident do the prime minister agree that that be exactly why we have to move forward with our plan much delay by the conservatives to abolish the outdated leasehold system once and for all as part of our plan for change the deputy prime minister be say absolutely in my ear we will end the feudal leasehold system which have leave million of homeowner subject to unfair cost and unreasonable practice our reform include clear standard for repair and maintenance and that will give homeowner great say in how their home be manage know the housing minister will have hear what my hon friend say this labour government have fail the british public at every turn they have abandon the waspi woman leave they without the compensation they deserve they have turn their back on pensioner by fail to support the winter fuel allowance they have let down child by keep the two child benefit cap in place and they will inflict further hardship on the most vulnerable by slash billion from benefit perhaps the most immediate and visible failure which pose an immediate and direct health risk to the people of birmingham be the appalling financial mismanagement of labour run birmingham city council after more than decade of labour control that council incompetence have lead to mountain of uncollected rubbish pile up on every street so large that they can be see by satellite orbit in space it be nothing short of disgrace and damn indictment of labour inability to govern will the prime minister take urgent action to protect public health and the people of birmingham by immediately deploy the order we be mean to ask quick question otherwise nobody be go to get in have say that the situation in birmingham council be completely unacceptable but the hon gentleman might want to tell his constituent that we have deliver million extra appointment for the nhs so waiting list be come down for they we have deliver increase in the national living wage include for his constituent and we have get record investment into this country grow the economy include for his constituent my constituent be grafter they

have never put an exact date on it and we do not intend to do so now follow signature the government will bring forward bill to enable the implementation of the treaty and parliament will of course have the opportunity to scrutinise the treaty in the usual way before ratification repeat that the government inherit situation in which the long term future of the military base be under threat this deal be root in rational and hard head determination to protect uk security and that of our ally it will protect the base on diego garcia and cement the uk and us presence in the indo pacific for generation to come thank you mr speaker for grant this urgent question it be incredibly disappointing that only day after foreign office oral question ministers have have to be haul back to the house to explain what be go on yesterday at lunch time downing street brief that the agreement between the uk and mauritius under which the uk would give away the chagos island and pay for the privilege have be finalise that be not say in this house yesterday the prime minister of mauritius have also issue public statement confirm that despite be interrogate on this botched deal in the chamber yesterday ministers give no indication of this very significant development we be still completely in the dark about fundamental question of enormous importance how many billion of pound of hard press british taxpayer money will we be expect to fork out to lease back territory that we already own this come as vulnerable pensioner be have their winter fuel payment rip away and family farm and business be be punish with new taxis by this labour government what safeguard will be in place to protect the military base on diego garcia from other state that may try to establish foothold on the archipelago minister have so far refuse to publish even map of the buffer zone what happen to the vital military base on diego garcia at the end of the treaty and what kind of sovereign right if any will we be able to exercise over diego garcia in the meantime the prime minister of mauritius say that he force change to the arrangement on the exercise of sovereign right and the lease extension will the minister finally confirm that the account give by the prime minister of mauritius be correct he can not simply stand here and avoid these question the house do deserve answer so do the british public the taxpayer put simply the british indian ocean territory should remain british but labour have prioritise appease the whim of left wing lawyer and activist rather than stand up for our national interest it be high time this deal be ditch finally there have be report of imply military threat to the chagos island british sovereign territory labour members may laugh but this issue be fundamental to the security of our country from the regime in tehran the iranian regime have threaten this space these purport military threat be important we understand that in response to such report there have be an unusual build up of american bomber aircraft and equipment carry aircraft at the joint uk us military base on diego garcia this be very serious and we clearly need to take these threat seriously we would welcome clarity about the foreign office diplomatic response on this issue on parliamentary accountability for this issue have answer no few than five urgent question on the subject in the last six month and have answer write question from she and her colleague we discuss this twice at foreign commonwealth and development office question yesterday as have repeatedly say when the detail of the treaty be finalise it will be present to this house and there will be full scrutiny in the usual way have explain that bill will be bring in to put into force the important aspect of the treaty that require legislative change and there will of course be full debate as there should be in this house simply reject the basis of much of the right hon lady question as have say repeatedly if there be not problem why do the government of whom she be part start negotiation and go through round of they there be significant challenge and this deal be paramount for our national security we will not scrimp on our security and it be important that the deal be put in place as have be recognise by all the party we will only agree deal that be in the uk good interest and protect our national security importantly the right hon lady ask about the security provision to protect the base these will include full uk control over diego garcia include control of the electromagnetic spectrum and unrestricted access to and use of the base as well as buffer zone around diego garcia in which nothing can be build or put in place without our consent there will be robust mechanism and review process to ensure that no activity on the outer island can impinge on the base operation indeed there will be prohibition on the presence of foreign security force either civilian or military on the outer island as the prime minister have say the full detail will of course be set out when the treaty be lay before parliament and that will include cost we will not scrimp on security the right hon lady ask an important question in relation to iran she will understand that for operational reason and as matter of policy we do not offer comment or information relate to foreign nation military aircraft movement or operation the uk in close co operation with our ally in the united states closely monitor the security environment in the indian ocean region to identify and mitigate any potential threat to the base on diego garcia share the minister bafflement at the opposition utter obsession with this issue can he confirm that under the agreement the vital us uk military base and its operation will be completely unaltered share my hon friend bafflement with so many issue go on in the world do question the number of time this one have be raise we have answer all the question before we welcome the fact that the united states recognise the strength of the deal it be root in rational and hard head determination to protect uk security and that of our ally once sign it will protect the base on diego garcia which be under threat and cement the presence of the uk and the us in the indo pacific call the liberal democrat spokesperson follow yesterday intervention by president trump it appear that the white house have the final say on the future of sovereign british territory meanwhile the chagossians continue to be ignore the process of secure the deal have be shambolic chagossian have be deny their right to say and it be shameful how they have be treat will the minister confirm whether there be any plan to ensure that the chagossians be finally include in discussion at this eleventh hour of the negotiation hard work family around the country will rightly be question why the government seem to be willing reportedly to negotiate such significant payment to mauritius at time when winter fuel payment have be scrap the confected consternation of the conservatives be also bemuse give that it be their foreign secretary who first signal the uk intention to secure an agreement as the minister confirm the treaty must come before the house for scrutiny especially give its importance to our national security can he confirm when that will happen and that this house will have vote on any final deal it be absolutely right as have say on many occasion that the new united states administration have chance to consider the agreement we welcome the fact that the united states recognise the strength of the deal we hear the comment that have be make and that be because it will fundamentally protect uk and us security interest remind the hon lady that we have legal obligation with the united states in relation to the operation of the base and it be only right that it be consult with full engagement in the process the hon lady ask about the chagossians we deeply regret as have say many time the way chagossians be remove from the island but the negotiation be between the uk and mauritius with our priority be to secure the full operation of the base on diego garcia however we have work hard to ensure that the agreement reflect the importance of the island to chagossians have set out to the house number of time the mechanism and system that will be in place to do that it be really important to respect the many different view within the chagossian community there be not one settle view for example the chagos refugees group one of the large chagossian group have in fact welcome the agreement can the minister confirm that the confirmation of the legal status of the base on diego garcia will strengthen our influence in the asia pacific and put we in strong position to counter the influence of china absolutely can our national security and that of our ally have be at the heart of the agreement there be significant problem the former government know that which be why they start negotiate we have complete the deal with the full involvement of the united states and with consideration of all the important measure which have set out on many occasion to keep the base safe the minister know the regard have for he but when he say he have appear at the dispatch box many time with this information he know that it have have nothing to do with give we information it mean he be drag here the question want to ask the no question which be not cover in the detail he set out today be how much will taxpayer pay for this settlement and out of which budget will it come can he guarantee that at no stage will it come from the defence budget increase as say yesterday financial element over year be crucial to protect the operation of such vital base we will not scrimp on our security once the treaty be sign it will be put before the house for scrutiny before ratification in the usual way and that will include the cost the right hon gentleman ask where the budget be come from the term of the treaty and the associate funding arrangement be still be finalise financial obligation include departmental budgetary responsibility will of course be manage responsibly within the government fiscal framework do the minister agree that it be vital the uk government fulfil their obligation under international law do he recognise that the january bind judgment of the international tribunal for the law of the be hand down under the conservative government find that the uk current administration of the archipelago constitute wrongful act and must be bring to an end as rapidly as possible there do appear to be some confusion about the different legal judgment among the opposition as can hear from the chuntering there be number of way in which the operation of the base be not sustainable we be very clear that without deal as the previous government recognise we would face serious real world operational impact on the base that would erode our ability to operate key frequency vital for our own communication and to counter hostile state affect everything from overflight clearance to secure contractor with consequential rocketing cost decline investment and degraded facility we be not willing to take that risk and have therefore secure this base for our security and that of our ally the united states be busy increase its presence on diego garcia most recently with its spirit aircraft probably face towards iran give that how much will the trump white house be contribute to the endowment that the minister propose we hand to mauritius as have set out on number of occasion and again today when we present the treaty we will present the cost and the arrangement and the house will have the chance to scrutinise they we welcome the fact that the united states recognise the strength of this deal which be because it be root in rational and hard head determination to protect our security and that of the united states and our presence in the indo pacific as say before be not go to get into operational discussion about matter at the base in relation to the presence of aircraft thank the minister and his team for their tireless effort to secure the future of this vital base which be exactly the right thing to do will he assure that no less than the most robust of security provision will be in place can absolutely assure my hon friend of that fact it have be at the core of the detail of this arrangement we will retain full control over diego garcia and have robust provision to keep adversary out include unrestricted access to and use of the base for the united kingdom and the united states the buffer zone mention the comprehensive mechanism to prevent activity on the other island threaten the base operation and ban on the presence of foreign security force in all inhabit british overseas territory british sovereignty flow in my opinion from the self determination of the islander and resident and that be exactly the same with the british indian ocean territory even though the population be displace british sovereignty flow from chagossians and their right to self determination ask the minister again what effort he have make to engage with the wide possible constituency of chagossians and whether he will give they veto over this deal if it be not acceptable to they the island be not permanently inhabit and that be one of the fundamental issue in this situation as have say repeatedly we be do many thing that will be supportive of the chagossian community include engage with number of different group there be range of opinion and think it be important that we recognise that there be of course some who support this deal we continue to put the interest of the chagossians at the heart of this agreement again full detail of that will be available in due course yet again the opposition be attempt to sow division between the uk and its ally and indeed to share our ally sensitive operational information if they succeed it will have impact on our strategically vital relationship with the us and india do my hon friend agree that the opposition should consider wait until the treaty be ready for scrutiny rather than damage our vital national interest in this way completely agree think some of the speculation have be hugely unhelpful we have be hugely grateful for the close co operation between the united kingdom and the united states throughout the negotiation and to the administration for their extensive and detailed engagement which have help we to make progress on this deal as my hon friend rightly point out this agreement have be welcome by other important partner include india china have not welcome it of course because it know that the agreement will strengthen the presence of the united kingdom and the united states in the region today mark the anniversary of the start of the war in the falklands another key overseas territory government member keep refer to the non bind advisory judgment as the basis of the chagos deal if the argentinians be to seek similar judgment against the falklands would the minister cede control have to say as have say on number of occasion in this house that such attempt to make false comparison be extremely unhelpful and would not be welcome by the resident of the falkland islands can absolutely assure the hon lady that our support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the falkland islands be absolute and iron clothe have make that clear on many occasion as have the minister for the armed forces and the government as whole will the minister confirm once again that any agreement that be make will return to this house for scrutiny my hon friend ask very important question as have set out there will be multiple opportunity for this house and the other place to consider this matter not only through the normal constitutional reform and governance act process but through the bill that will be bring forward to make the necessary provision under the treaty which will go through the normal process full scrutiny will be afford to member of this house the president and vice president of the united states have make clear their detestation of country freeload on defence and security matter we be not ask for the detail we be not even ask for the quantum but we do deserve to know in this house today whether the government have ask the us to contribute to the base on diego garcia that be so vital to it yes or no as have say on number of occasion we welcome the us endorsement of the deal and of its strength and we be grateful for the close co operation between the united kingdom and the united states the full detail will be provide when the treaty be present to the house thank my hon and gallant friends the members for north east derbyshire louise jones and for leyton and wanstead mr bailey for their question can the minister confirm that this agreement will close potentially dangerous route for irregular migration be that possibly one of the reason the conservatives open and preside over round of negotiation on it can absolutely confirm that that be also why we agree an important arrangement as an interim with st helena which have speak to the house about that have absolutely be at the heart of it but our primary objective have be to protect the national security of the united kingdom our ally the united states and our partner want to go back to the question from the right hon member for south west wiltshire dr murrison and for beverley and holderness graham stuart and indeed the question ask the minister the last time this issue be raise in the house the minister be well aware that what we be talk about be primarily us base surely he can at least tell the house today that conversation have be hold with the us and that it fully understand that compensatory package will be make and that there be question over who will primarily contribute to that package can he make that clear to the house today refer the hon gentleman to the answer give moment ago we be absolutely clear that the united states recognise the strength of this deal we have have excellent co operation with the us throughout the full detail will be provide in due course not only be the government prepare to give away sovereign british territory but they be prepare to pay for the privilege of do so by hand over billion to mauritius the minister can not say where the money be come from but can he at least agree that that money would be well spend restore the winter fuel payment to pensioner in need and relieve social care provider hospice and charity from their national insurance increase here in the uk rather than be hand over to mauritius quite frankly the hon member neglect to mention the shocking mess that his former government leave we to inherit have be clear in this house on many occasion that we will not scrimp when it come to the national security of this country whether that be in relation to diego garcia or investment in defence and our armed force that be exactly what my hon friend the minister for the armed forces and the defence secretary have be set out on our wide defence spending what we be do in this deal be protect our national security and defence and that of our ally the united states the minister will have hear the feeling of the house so can he provide we with the specific guarantee that the foreign secretary have secure in relation to prevent hostile state such as china from increase their influence in the chagos island while we as nation be still pay for they the hon member have ask an important question and have answer it number of time to reiterate there will be robust security provision in that regard that be why china have not welcome this deal we will have full uk control with the united states over diego garcia we will have buffer zone around diego garcia and we will have robust mechanism to ensure that no activity in the outer island can impinge on the base operation crucially there will be prohibition on the presence of foreign security force on the outer island either civilian or military what disgrace this shabby chagos deal be turn out to be labour be not just give away our national security they be go to pay billion to mauritius for the pleasure instead of raise taxis on people and business in this country why do the minister not stand up for britain and stop this deal we be stand up for britain by defend our security and that of our ally and we will not scrimp on that it be critical to secure the operation of this base it be crucial to our interest and that of our ally as have ask many time if there be no problem why do the hon member former government start negotiate over this this be perhaps question for the minister for the armed forces who notice be also on the front bench on the buffer zone can the minister state categorically that it will be sufficiently wide to protect all the capability on the base yes surrender sovereign territory base on non bind legal judgment and fork out taxpayer money for the privilege what kind of deal be that it be one do behind closed door evade the scrutiny of this house do the minister agree that this deal be prime example of what happen when we have government of lawyer for lawyer rather than government for the british people simply reject the premise of the hon member question the government inherit situation where the effective operation of the base be under threat claim that we negotiate this deal simply because of the international court of justice advisory opinion be wrong that be not the only challenge that we face as the previous government know without deal mauritius would have inevitably pursue legally bind judgment and there would be huge implication from that not have deal would affect the real world operational functionality of the base which be so crucial to our national security and that of our ally the minister make reference to the uk have full control over diego garcia but early this month receive this response from he the right to operate and maintain the naval support facility diego garcia be hold by the government of the united states this include function as be necessary for the development use maintenance operation and security of the facility will he explain what control we would have over naval support facility diego garcia in the event that us and uk defence priority do not align and at what level the control over the base lie the hon member ask an important question the us operate its naval support facility and although will not get into the operational detail of that for obvious reason the full detail will be provide can absolutely assure he that we will have control over diego garcia and will be work closely with the united states over it as we come to the end of this urgent question be still no clear on the substance of this disastrous deal so the house must now make assumption give that the minister be sit next to the minister for the armed forces can we assume that this deal will be come out from the ministry of defence naturally the foreign office and the ministry of defence work closely together on this matter as indeed department do across all government have be very clear that the term of the treaty and the associate funding arrangement be still be finalise the responsibility will be manage responsibly within the government fiscal framework as for understand the reason for this deal and why it be necessary suggest that the hon member ask some of his formerly ministerial colleague on the conservative benches the minister be an incredibly honourable man and he be much like in this house so say this with all gentleness my constituent be tell that the deal with the indian ocean territory be overwhelming and that the cost factor be something that they can not quite understand and neither can do the minister understand why pensioner in my constituency and across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland be wonder why at time of reduced help and aid the government be hand over sovereignty of land and then rent it back at cost to the public purse will the minister outline where the money will come from when it have be decide that pensioner and ill people on personal independence payment can not have the support they deserve due to the lack of money within government know that the hon gentleman ask his question with sincerity and he be much like in this place too suggest that he make it clear to his constituent that financial element to this deal be crucial to protect operation it be crucial for the security of his citizen in strangford and the citizen of the united kingdom and of the united states and our interest overseas some of the figure that have be quote in the medium be simply inaccurate and of course this will happen over year period we will not scrimp when it come to our security it be important that we invest in it and that be exactly what this government be do on point of order mr speaker be it relevant to the question we have just have it be link to the comment of the liberal spokesperson the hon member for epsom and ewell helen maguire in her question to the minister she note that the winter fuel payment have be scrap this be simply not true the winter fuel payment have not be scrap it have be mean test and to say otherwise be misleading it be similar to when the liberal democrat tory coalition government mean test child benefit order think we have get the gist it be point of clarification rather than point of order and the hon lady have get it on the record let we move on gaza israeli military operations urgent question to ask the foreign secretary to make statement about the israeli government announcement that they be expand their military operation in gaza we be deeply concerned about the resumption of hostility in gaza the uk do not support an expansion of israel military operation continue fighting and more bloodshed be in nobody interest all party include israel must observe international humanitarian law we urge all party to return to dialogue and ceasefire negotiation ensure the return of all who have endure unimaginable suffering it be clear that this conflict can not be win by bomb and bullet but by diplomacy aid should never be use as political tool israel must restart the flow of aid immediately block good supply and power from enter gaza risk breach international humanitarian law and it should not be happen we be do everything we can to alleviate that situation gaza be also the most dangerous place in the world to be an aid worker over aid worker have be kill since the start of the conflict despite renew fighting the united nations and humanitarian organisation must be able to deliver their vital work year on from the appalling attack on world central kitchen aid worker lesson have not be learn we be appal at recent attack on aid worker which include the attack on united nations office for project services guest house and the killing of at least eight palestinian red crescent medic our thought be with the victim and their family those responsible must be hold accountable the government of israel must urgently ensure that there be effective deconfliction mechanism in place to enable agency to deliver their impartial mandate safely on march the uk and france call an urgent un security council meeting to discuss the risk face humanitarian aid worker in gaza since the hostility resume the foreign secretary have speak to secretary rubio special envoy steve witkoff the israeli foreign minister gideon the israeli minister for strategic affairs ron dermer the eu high representative kallas and the un emergency relief co ordinator tom fletcher return to ceasefire be the only way we will bring the conflict to an end and return to negotiation for last peace in the region that be the only way to deliver the two state solution that we all want to see both israelis and palestinians have the right to live in peace and security the israeli government brutal decision to expand their military operation in gaza be not about security it be about domination and erasure it come on top of month of collective punishment include since march the long aid blockade since the war begin welcome the minister confirmation that the uk do not support the israeli government expand military operation in gaza will he now finally name what be happen as genocide and undertake structural investigation into genocide and other crime under international law commit in israel and the occupied palestinian territories to ensure that the uk be not complicit in israel ongoing genocide illegal occupation and system of apartheid will the minister immediately suspend the direct and indirect supply sale or transfer include transit and tran shipment to israel of all weapon munition and other military and security equipment will he immediately suspend the provision of training and other military and security assistance and recognise that otherwise there be clear risk of contribute to the commission of serious violation of international humanitarian law and international human right law include crime under international law as the minister mention the uk be significant provider of humanitarian aid to the region what assessment have he make of the impact of today report on the humanitarian crisis although he touch on this lightly give the uk level of influence with israeli authority will he confirm that he will use his position to actively oppose current and planned attempt by israel to establish permanent military presence in gaza and to oppose move to alter gaza border and demographic make up or to shrink its territory include through any expand buffer zone and construction of permanent checkpoint the hon lady ask series of important question as have say to the house on number of occasion determination of breach of international law be for competent court and we support those court in their work on weapon want to be clear that we continue to stand by the assessment that we make soberly in september and the suspension of license that that involve the hon lady ask about the uk view on permanent presence in gaza be happy to restate our policy now we welcome the proposal by arab nation call the arab initiative which would allow for reconstruction of gaza the safe return of palestinians who have be displace and for those remain in gaza to rebuild their life without forced displacement which we oppose call the chair of the foreign affairs committee we have have several urgent question and statement on gaza over the last few month each time have come to the chamber and ask the government what be plan what be plan when israel end the ceasefire which be what have happen what be plan when israel far right government choose their survival over the life of the remain hostage which be what seem to have happen what be plan when annexation of either the west bank or gaza be not just threaten but actually happen which be what be happen now my question be this what be the government do to turn our ally head from american trade war and towards the tragedy unfolding in the middle east to do whatever they can to restore ceasefire and the road to peace my right hon friend who have be press on these issue for some time be right to raise those question she ask whether there be plan in all of my experience there can be no plan in israel palestine there be only one route which be widely understand by our ally in the region and beyond and it must be two state solution the route to two state solution must involve compliance with international humanitarian law it be clear even from the short exchange that we have already have in the chamber that the british government policy and the israeli government policy differ they will continue to differ until we return to pathway to two state solution there be no plan our plan be for two state solution and we will work with our ally in the region on the security council as we do on friday and close to home in order to pursue those argument call the shadow foreign secretary thank you for grant the urgent question mr speaker this be clearly difficult and dangerous moment for the middle east way must be find through the dreadful impasse that have lead to the breakdown of the ceasefire agreement as have be say time and again the key to sustainable end to the conflict be the release of the remain hostage so cruelly hold by hamas terrorist since the atrocity of october their continued captivity be intolerable the british government should be able to bring their influence to bear and the foreign secretary should be directly involve in all effort to find way through work with israeli counterpart the us and key regional player and mediator country we say that in the chamber yesterday the minister state yesterday as he have today that the government be in regular contact with all those involve in negotiation official report april vol that include the foreign secretary who speak to his israeli counterpart last week will the minister inform the house what direct minister to minister discussion have take place about the current military operation be ministers inform in advance and have they be give any information about the objective that israel be seek every week we come here to ask question of ministers and it be unclear exactly what level of influence the government have what be the government plan what be their vision of way through what discussion have they have in recent day with vital interlocutor on humanitarian aid do the minister feel that he have make any progress in his effort to try to unblock the current aid access situation we have speak about this many time will he update the house on what have be happen to british aid while the restriction remain where be that aid it be the conservatives position when in government as indeed it be now the position of the labour government that there can be no role for iranian back hamas terrorist in gaza future will the minister be propose to our critical partner road map for how this will end and how that future will become reality these be important question that the right hon lady have ask the foreign secretary have be directly involve in minister to minister contact too have be talk with all those affect very much welcome her comment about the hostage of course the whole house want to see they all release and be sure that many of we will be think of avinatan or he have british mother who have be hold almost certainly in terrible condition ever since october know that the whole house will continue to think of those hostage victim the right hon lady rightly ask about humanitarian aid accept that our effort in recent day to try to prevent the blockade from continue in gaza have not be effective in the first part of this year we see very welcome increase in aid go into gaza include uk aid even during that great flow there be still unwelcome restriction on the nature of the aid go in which make reconstruction shelter tent and sleeping bag hard to get into gaza when they be desperately need so there be improvement and we can see route by which we might see significant increase in the amount of aid get into the gaza strip which be desperately need but at the current time the report be extremely depressing we discuss some of they yesterday the right hon lady ask about our plan for reconstruction and what discussion we be have with other we have discuss the arab initiative with those involve closely we think it be plan with real merit it must not allow hamas to have role in government we be absolutely clear on that point and think arab partner be very much of the same view that be the basic idea from which we must work on march the first day of eid israeli attack on gaza kill dozen of palestinians add to the death toll since israel breach the ceasefire agreement israel be now in the process of enact the large forced displacement order hundred of thousand of palestinians from rafah how will this end israel can not and will not stop be the goal ethnic cleansing we be witness that be the goal the complete destruction of gaza we be now witness that be the goal the permanent occupation of gaza and the west bank we continue to witness that be the goal complete end to the two state solution israeli ministers have make their intention clear will the minister unequivocally condemn their action for what they be war crime and crime against humanity my hon friend have be fearless and persistent on those question do condemn the comment of israeli ministers which amount to force displacement or the annexation of palestinian territory we recognise international humanitarian law and call on all our ally include israel also to abide by it the scene in gaza in recent day have be hard to watch and we will continue to make those point to the israelis with all the force that my hon friend would expect call the liberal democrat spokesperson israel expansion of military activity in gaza include strike on un medical facility displacement of civilian and the defence minister new proposal to seize large swathe of territory be gravely disturbing it seem that international humanitarian law be be violate this week report that the israel defence forces kill and bury humanitarian worker in mass grave be also appal the ceasefire must be restore israel must immediately end its illegal blockade of humanitarian aid into gaza to bring desperately need relief to million people who have suffer enormously hamas must also release the remain hostage immediately and unconditionally will the minister update the house on the conversation he be have with israeli american and middle eastern partner regard the restoration of the ceasefire all side must recommit to political process he say that there be only one route so ask he once again will this government now recognise palestinian state give hope to million of palestinians will he also outline what the uk be do to hold those who attack aid worker in violation of international humanitarian law accountable and to protect those aid worker who remain in gaza those be important question let start with humanitarian aid worker the whole house will have hear the prime minister respond to my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham we of course want to see accountability when humanitarian worker be strike we particularly expect accountability when british national be affect my thought be with the family of all those affect by the world central kitchen incident what do we want to see next by way of accountability we want to see the israeli military advocate general go through the investigation at proper speed it have be year come to proper finding and answer the question of whether criminal charge should now be lay this house have discuss question on the recognition of palestinian state many time we will recognise palestinian state as part of contribution to two state solution we be all watch the event in the occupied palestinian territories at the moment and see how distant functional palestinian state look under these circumstance our first effort must be to restore the basic functioning of palestinian life in both gaza and the west bank where it be also under threat recently visit the occupied palestinian territories with the foreign affairs committee travel to area in west bank and see at first hand the settler violence that palestinian man woman and child be face day in day out they be live their life in constant fear in this house we all support two state solution but that be be undermine daily by the action of the israeli government especially in the west bank we be see it be annex in real time the minister say that we will recognise the state of palestine when the time be right but fear there may be no state leave to recognise will the government look again at stop all settlement good come into the uk those be important question the uk consider settlement illegal under international law we be clear that settlement good must be properly label and they do not benefit from the trading regime that would otherwise apply to both israel and the occupied palestinian territories my hon friend question be the right one we need to ensure that there remain viable path to two state solution there be no other path to peace in the region and all our effort be focus on that outcome when be the minister responsible the current minister be then an outstanding official in the department he will therefore know that when present an egregious list of complaint to the deputy prime minister of israel as well as to the chief negotiator he simply storm out of the meeting leave the ambassador with his head in his hand therefore ask what leverage do we actually have the right hon gentleman be kind about my service know that he raise some of the issue with some force as he say during his time in this ministerial role that underline the hard truth here which be that the israelis must be persuade to relent from course of action that both the conservative and labour party as well as the other party in this chamber have see be totally undermine the long term stability of the region which be important not just for israel and for palestine but for the uk and our friend and ally in the middle east the poor people of gaza be trap between hamas who refuse to release the hostage and defence minister katz who be now threaten the total destruction of gaza do the minister share my despair at the lack of leadership commit to peace will he also talk about what diplomatic effort we be make as well as through aid spending to try to create moderate leadership in the region that can establish the long term circumstance for peace and reconciliation my hon friend have do much work over the year on question of peacebuilde we too be commit to play our part in try to build up the connection between the two society that could allow for the kind of moderate leadership at the most local level that be so necessary for make peace we see that in our own experience of northern ireland many in this chamber have rightly press we on the proposal from the alliance for middle east peace and we look forward in the come period to set out what we will do to support peacebuilde effort watch with dismay as do the foreign secretary the many civilian ask for peace on both side the many civilian protest both in israel and in the occupied palestinian territories for return to ceasefire that be what we want to see we have hear ministers refer many time to the risk of breach of international humanitarian law on the one occasion on march when the foreign secretary admit that withholding aid to gaza be breach of international report march vol he have to retract the admission and refer again to risk of breach if the recent attack on aid worker constitute further risk of breach will the minister outline what would constitute an actual breach the foreign secretary have clarify his comment on the occasion to which the hon gentleman refer and he will know well from his own background that long stand policy of government of all kind be that it be not for ministers to act as court there be competent international court that make such determination the resumption of the conflict in gaza be incredibly tragic and it be especially heartbreaking for the hostage family and all those brave people we have see protest in israel against their government and in gaza against the death cult that be hamas do the minister agree that the conflict today could end if hamas release the hostage and leave gazans to live in peace and security will he update we on plan for the international plan for peace for israelis and palestinians my hon friend be right the hostage must be release and hamas can play no role in the future of governance of gaza their role which be correctly describe by the shadow foreign secretary as be support by iran have be malign it have be malign for the palestinians for the israelis for the uk and for the region on my hon friend question about the proposal for the international peace building fund we will come back to the house with further detail of our approach as the situation continue to evolve we want to carefully consider how good we can contribute to peace building in the way that describe in answer to previous question thank the minister for raise in his answer to the shadow foreign secretary the plight of avinatan or who be proud to be twin with he be brutally capture by hamas terrorist day ago in march his family receive sign of life for the first time and in that same month number of colleague hear in parliament from his mother ditza british citizen her move story in parliament about her continued fight for her son release do the minister agree that hamas could end the war now by release avinatan and all the remain hostage and will he assure ditza that all avenue be be pursue by this government to make that reality be grateful to the hon gentleman for mention ditza too meet she and avinatan sister recently those two incredibly strong woman be do absolutely everything that they can for their love one and can assure they from this dispatch box that we be do everything we can to secure his release associate myself with the minister remark about the killing of the british world central kitchen worker by israel in gaza and extend this sentiment to palestinian aid worker too it be almost year since be last in gaza and not day go by when do not think about what see do the minister agree that what israel be do in gaza be reach new and uncharted territory in its level of danger both to palestinians and to the prospect of two state solution ever be realise do he far agree that it be past time for fresh co ordinate international action to stop this when will he be able to come to the house to outline what this action will be my hon friend have see event in gaza with her own eye and know from all her work before she come to this place how commit an advocate and an actor she have be for those suffer some of the most unimaginable pressure and horror agree that they continue to suffer those pressure and see those horror we take the step of call the un security council to session on these question on friday solemnly and soberly we will work with our international partner on these question because they be an egregious threat to the life of palestinians to two state solution and to the stability of the region will come back to the house to give she further update as my hon friend would expect we need ceasefire now again because the situation on the ground be as bad as it have ever be if not bad speak to my friend whose family be in gaza and he tell that last week their home be bomb multiple time while they be shelter in the basement with no food or water they be now barely survive surround by destruction terrify and without aid for over month he say this be not self defence this be the destruction of family like mine if this government do not support this escalation where be the consequence we do have leverage why have they not suspend all arm sale to the idf not because of risk of it hit civilian but because we have principle and will show intent be grateful to the hon lady for share that story in the chamber know that many member of this house have receive similar story over the last few day and indeed have be do so for the month that this conflict have be run have set out our position on arm number of time in this house and would like to say that the decision take in september be decision of principle and they remain decision of principle the two principle that underline our position in relation to arm licence for sale to israel be that we be concerned about risk of international humanitarian law and that we will continue to defend israel against threat to its security and safety include from iran we have suspend weapon that could be sell to israel and we have fly the raf in its defence when iran threaten to strike it with missile the world be incredibly complicated thing be move very quickly and recognise the strength of feeling in this house on the question of arm our position remain the same and it be one of principle what we be witness in gaza be the weaponisation of starvation with the ongoing blockade of food water medicine and shelter now in its second month there be also the heart wrench despicable discovery of the killing of further aid worker find in mass grave and large scale hostility have now restart this must stop give that it be clear that the netanyahu regime be not listen to the uk government and will only listen to president trump what pressure be our government put on the us to ensure that the israeli government finally end their aid blockade as you would expect madam deputy speaker will confine my comment to the discussion that we have rather than the policy of other ally but my hon friend who have raise these issue many time be right have say it at this dispatch box the prime minister say it at prime minister question early and the foreign secretary reiterate it yesterday we want the aid blockade to end immediately it should not have be put in place palestinian civilian be suffer and we expect urgent action we of course discuss these issue with secretary rubio with special envoy steve witkoff and with whole range of our counterpart in the us system we work closely with our american colleague on the middle east and in whole range of national security field and we be clear about our policy with they as we be with the israeli government and the palestinian authority can ask the minister to bring sense of urgency to this the people of gaza be starve every bakery be close there be insufficient water there be no power no school be open no hospital be fully function it be an utterly desperate situation yet believe we be still allow raf akrotiri to be use as staging point for israel and still supply part for jet which be bomb the people of gaza and bomb the rubble there what be the government do to ensure that israel stop the bombing and that food aid get through very very urgently for the people of gaza merely to help they survive hope the house be under no doubt about the urgency with which myself the foreign secretary and the whole ministerial team treat these issue think have already answer the question in relation to arm in this session the humanitarian need have be on terrible and vivid display over the last few day we be aware of the report to which the right hon gentleman refer and we raise these issue with the urgency they demand the hostages and missing families forum in israel say this morning that it be horrified to wake up to the news of the expand military operation and that be because it know the risk that this pose to its love one but it be the love one of palestinians who have already suffer so much that be most relevant today they themselves know that the annexation and the forced displacement of man woman and child be simply unacceptable so can the minister tell exactly what he and this uk government have do to make representation to israel both about that israeli aggression and about the new expand settlement in the west bank which be deliberately design to suffocate any future state of palestine can assure my hon friend who have be doughty campaigner on these issue that we have raise both the risk of return to war and indeed the settlement he refer to directly with the israeli government and we will continue to do so welcome the minister reply to the urgent question but be sure he will forgive when say that we have hear all this before there be sense of hopelessness in this place at the downward spiral we seem to be on but it must be nothing compare with the hopelessness be feel by the gazans and also the israeli population the israeli regime be not listen to we or to its own population who be protest and simply want the hostage home the region need some hope and it have already be suggest that if we be to go down the route to two state solution we need breakthrough that breakthrough might come if this government recognise palestine as state recognise the hon lady remark the sense of hopelessness must be acute in gaza and say to all those watch in the region that the uk will continue to do everything it can no matter how hard it be to try to return to ceasefire have address the question about the recognition of palestinian state there must be breakthrough we need to get back on the path that both side be on before if stability be to return to the region rise order many right hon and hon member still want to get in and there be an important statement to come so could question be little briefer please thank the minister for come to the house and the hon member for bristol central carla denyer for raise the matter concur with the comment of my right hon friend the member for islington south and finsbury emily thornberry in that we have be here before we keep get the same response our constituent continue to write to we about this they want hope the reality be that over thousand palestinians have be kill within the last fortnight today mark month since israel break that ceasefire block critical aid into gaza in defiance of international law ask the minister know he and the foreign secretary be work hard what more it will take before we as uk government take different course of action because israel be not listen to warm word any long my constituent in lincoln have strong view about the horror they see and know many constituent right across the country be write to their member and strongly express their view would not describe our policy as warm word and think many of our friend in the region would not describe it as such either we have take concrete action since become the government we have restore aid to the united nations relief and works agency we have take the arm suspension measure that have be discuss we have sanction settler we have continue to use our position at the un security council to try to bring attention and action to some of the most egregious area of concern and we will continue to do so can not promise this house that will be able to return next time with something different to say the fact that my remark may seem repetitive indicate that the problem be difficult and the solution feel distant but we must continue to work on the path that this whole house know we must get back to which be towards two state solution last week the foreign secretary be unequivocal in say that both side hamas and israel be guilty of commit atrocity do the minister agree with the foreign secretary that that be the case think the hon gentleman be try to return to the question ask by the liberal democrat member to be clear on the determination of crime we leave that to court on the determination of risk we take action as affirm by the international court of justice in its advisory opinion israel be violate the peremptory norm of the palestinian people right to self determination the prohibition against racial discrimination and apartheid and the prohibition against unlawful use of force its occupation of palestine be illegal and must end as soon as possible will the minister acknowledge that the uk have duty to suspend all military co operation and trade with israel duty that stem from wide range of intersect international obligation in the face of grave illegality commit by the state of israel my hon friend ask about the advisory opinion of the icj we accept that the israeli settlement in the occupied palestinian territory be illegal and have be clear about that policy position be afraid that we will take some time yet to return to this house with full response to the icj advisory opinion which have number of novel element of international jurisprudence and we be consider it with the seriousness and soberness that it require we agree on the fundamental the settlement be illegal and must be bring to an end recent polling suggest that over of israelis will support any deal that bring the remain hostage home if that can be achieve the likelihood be that peace and rebuilding can be achieve especially if egypt can be involve along with finance from saudi arabia and the gulf will the government please push for that can confirm that we want to see all the hostage return and reconstruction plan for gaza base on the arab initiative with the full involvement of the region reconstruction plan that can allow palestinians to remain in their home be devastate to hear of the expansion of military operation in gaza this week alongside the aid blockade in the region that be clear breach of international humanitarian law the minister have say that he urge israel to respect ihl if israel continue to ignore the international community on that what concrete step will we take to hold it accountable my hon friend have serve both in our military and as an aid worker he know well and feel strongly as do many in this house the agony of what we be see we have determine that there be serious risk of breach of international humanitarian law by the israeli government we will continue to press they on those point will not issue further comment on sanction which think be underlie some of his question as to do so could reduce their impact while no one want to see the continuation of war in gaza under the term of the ceasefire agreement israel have the right to take action where there be an immediate threat we have see that hamas have refuse to release hostage and be now fire rocket into israel they be plan further attack and indeed attack and murder their own citizen who protest against they be it not reasonable in those circumstance for israel to take action to defend its own country should it not be the priority of this government to ensure that hamas release the hostage whom they be cruelly and cynically hold and to ensure that uk aid be not use to prop up hamas and help they to reassert their authority agree with the right hon gentleman of course israel have the right to legitimate self defence consistent with international humanitarian law concern about the risk of breach of international humanitarian law underpin our concern he be absolutely right that hamas be threat not just to israel but to their own people and have be absolutely clear on that question on numerous occasion at this dispatch box where there be any report that hamas be benefit from aid go into the gaza strip or anywhere else we take serious action in response if the rule of international law be to mean anything we must uphold it so just as we recognise that take hostage be breach of international law we must recognise that kill aid worker be breach of international law my constituent will be listen to the minister recognise the work be do but completely perplex as to why we be not do more to uphold international law in practice he be right to argue that the court need to be involve he say that he want this issue to be deal with by the relevant competent court and talk about novel element of jurisprudence delay our ability to do that can he explain to my constituent what more it would take for the united kingdom through the auspex of the un security council to make referral to the international criminal court give what we be see and to uphold international human right law directly my hon friend ask an important question recognise that for constituent in walthamstow and elsewhere question of international law may seem very arcane when we be face with the kind of image that we be all see this morning and have be see for month so let clarify she refer to the icj advisory opinion that advisory opinion long in gestation refer to the presence of israel in the occupied palestinian territories it pre date the october attack she also refer to the icc which have hear referral in relation to conduct on both side of the conflict since the october attack we respond in the fullness of time as require by the icj which have take some time in its complex determination about the status of the occupied palestinian territories we have respond on the icc to the timeline require we do so late last year we can all see the discomfort of the minister in have to embroider language refer merely to the risk of the breach of international law and not speak as plainly on behalf of our country as many member would wish he to speak of course we all want the hostage to be free just as we want the million hostage in gaza be hold hostage by the murderous idf which be treat they with disdain and starve they to be free if the minister be not prepared to make the statement that many of we wish for he to make will he at least admit that the action of the far right israeli government can no long be describe as self defence have be accuse of many thing but not of embroider so if there be any doubt let be clear the position to which stick at the dispatch box on the determination of law be one that have be hold consistently by both party in government for long time there be good reason why we would not want people to stand at the dispatch box make determination of law and it be why we have court and an international legal order that this country have proud history of establish and maintain we have determine that there be risk of those breach we be not make determination we be look to our own law pass in fact by those now on the opposition benches and follow they through thoroughly and vigorously in the discharge of our duty we have say that we think there be serious risk of breach of international humanitarian law that be the same as say that we think there be serious risk that israel be not simply act in its own legitimate self defence that be why we have take the step that we have last year raise the concern of constituent whose family member be stick in gaza without food and water the situation have worsen since the aid blockade be particularly worried about the escalation of hostility impact most on woman and girl supply of female hygiene product be at critical low woman be give birth on hospital floor and doctor be perform section without adequate medical supply may ask the minister on behalf of the hundred of constituent who have write to what the uk government be do to end the aid blockade will he reassure that the government have communicate the sheer urgency on the ground to the israeli government be grateful for the opportunity to comment on particular case involve constituent in gaza my hon friend work incredibly hard for her constituent as do many other member where be in direct correspondence with member about the fate of constituent and their relative in gaza will not provide running commentary from the dispatch box but the foreign office will do everything it can to ensure that british national in distress and their loved one include in gaza be able to get to safety can confirm to she that we have raise the urgency of these matter with the israeli government another day another statement another day of predictable and depressing answer nothing be more predictable and depressing than the statement we be do everything we can be we really do everything we can when we do not call out genocide and ethnic cleansing as we see it happen in real time be we do everything we can when we have not impose bilateral economic sanction be we do everything we can when we have not even call in the ambassador to express our concern if we be indeed do everything we can why have the government just sell million worth of technology for israeli submarine that be be build to house nuclear weapon we be do everything we can recognise from the commentary of many member how unbearably frustrating they and their constituent find this situation have be call for ceasefire ever since have be minister it be also deeply depressing for to be in this situation today as have be so many time in the house we will continue to do everything in accordance with the measure have lay out this afternoon to bring the conflict back to ceasefire the minister have be generous with his time not just today but over the past few month both in the house and in private meeting but every time we meet the situation be bad and get bad as the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran say it be now as bad as it have ever be do the minister agree that unless we in the international community take firm immediate action to force change as matter of urgency nothing will be different and there will be no point talk about peace or two state solution because those opportunity will be lose not just for now but for the foreseeable future and the consequence for those in the region particularly the people of gaza will be unimaginable thank my hon friend for his kind word in the time that we have be in government we have see the situation deteriorate but we have also see it improve hope to be able to return to the house with the news that we be back at ceasefire recognise how distant that feel at this moment but ceasefire would be not just vital step towards two state solution and an enormous contribution towards get aid into gaza but the step change require for international diplomacy to bring stability to the region some aid worker have be kill in gaza over the past day and we be now year and day on from the awful attack on the world central kitchen how many british aid worker be in gaza and what tangible action will the government ask israel to take to guarantee their safety do not believe that be in position to confirm the current number of british national in gaza as aid worker but if be will write to the hon member those at the hostage and missing families forum which represent most of the captive family say that they be horrified to wake up this morning to the israeli defence minister announcement about expand military operation in gaza they also say that the israeli government have an obligation to free all hostage from hamas captivity and to pursue every possible channel to advance deal for their release hostage have be release only when there have be ceasefire so ceasefire be paramount for the release of hostage if we believe that israel should stop bomb gaza we need to stop supply it with part for bomb if we believe in two state solution it be about time that we recognise palestine have already comment on the question of recognition assure my hon friend that we be not provide part for bomb we have set out the provision on arm suspension there be question about the global supply chain for part where those part be go indirectly to israel on which have elaborate in the house on number of occasion that remain our position nearly woman and child have be kill in gaza since october in the light of evidence submit to the un human rights council show israel use of starvation as method of war the denial of human right and humanitarian assistance and concerted policy of destroy gaza healthcare system will the government take immediate and tangible step to demonstrate the uk commitment to uphold international law by cease provision of military support to israel suspend all export licence and impose two way arm embargo set out our position on arm suspension early in this urgent question let try to approach this in another way it be obvious that israel have be embolden by the explicit and implicit support of the us government for what it be do that have be fundamental change the us government have rule out two state solution as understand what have the minister be do or what can he do to work with our colleague in the european union and with the arab state to develop clear plan for two state solution and clear timeframe for all country recognise palestinian state as you would expect madam deputy speaker will not seek to characterise the foreign policy of other they can set out their policy themselves on co operation and co ordination we have be in extensive dialogue with those involve in the arab initiative and we have work with germany france and italy and make joint statement on this and wide issue recently expect that in june we will join an important international conference about two state solution where we will discuss that with our partner time and again we have hear ministers at the dispatch box say that they be do everything they can and talk about the diplomatic lever that they be try to pull we all know that since the ceasefire be break because of the israelis not comply people have be kill mainly woman and child and aid worker assassinate we know they be assassinate because some of they have their hand tie behind their back the minister know that there be only three action we can take stop trade sanction and recognise palestine those be the only action that this government can take to prevent israelis cause more damage which one will he take as the hon gentleman know be diplomat before and ultimately it be diplomacy that will resolve this conflict that be the lever to which we must most vigorously apply ourselves just suppose that we close our airbase in cyprus just suppose that we apply great sanction and withdraw export licence just suppose that we recognise the state of palestine would the minister be make the same statement what analysis have he make of that it be hard enough to respond to the fact as they be will not be draw by my hon friend into such complex chain of hypothetical thank the minister very much for his answer and for his understanding and honesty hamas be terrorist murderer rapist and child killer they hide their and their weaponry in child bed they hide their missile in their school hospital and house what step have the minister and the government take with the un to bring all the kidnap hostage home alive rather than in the coffin that be parade around by hamas terrorist murderer at the last hostage handover what step be they take to underline the point that the israelis would not be intensify their plan to strike be the murderous hamas not content to hold hostage and fire rocket into israel daily we have work with our partner in the region the israeli government the us and many other to try to secure the safe release of all those with uk link who have be hold hostage of course we want to see all hostage release but it be on british national and those with link to the uk that we have turn the focus of our effort this have be heartbreaking for and for so many in this house it have be so joyful to see british national escape from the clutch of hamas alive and heartbreak when british link national have return deceased know that the whole house will be hop for avinatan or and all other who be be hold to be return alive and well soon the killing of innocent palestinian civilian many of they woman and child by israeli force be simply heartbreaking the minister know that have be raise my concern and those of my constituent with he since be elect to this house last july be grateful for and appreciate the step that he and the government be take on aid and arm yet here we be what more can the government do to stop the killing of innocent palestinian civilian ensure the release of all remain hostage and ensure that aid get to those who so desperately need it in gaza thank my hon friend for his question and his persistence on these issue so many colleague on the labour and opposition benches have raise the plight of palestinian civilian and of hostage with real force and urgency ever since we come into government and be sure they will continue to we will continue to take the step have outline to try to effect change and we recognise the great urgency for we all as military activity intensifie hope to return to this house in due course with update on our diplomatic effort under the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide to which the uk be signatory state have an obligation to prevent and punish genocide that obligation to prevent involve act immediately so will the minister outline what the government be do and say what step they be take to ensure that genocide be prevent in gaza the hon member will have hear my previous comment about determination will answer the question that think he be ask which be about what we have do since we come into government to try to reduce the suffering in the occupy palestinian territories and indeed in israel we have take firm and far reach step on the suspension of arm on the restoration of funding to unrwa by use our role on the security council and by raise these question forcefully with the israeli government and all relevant regional partner we be work night and day to try to ensure that those in harm way be no long at risk recognise today as we have do almost every day since we come to government that there be yet more to do since hamas war crime of october we have see multiple flagrant breach of the rule of the international order this week palestinian paramedic red crescent worker be find in mass grave alongside their abandon emergency vehicle that come on top of four week total aid blockade what be our red line about how this war without end in which ceasefire and sign agreement can be toss aside be be conduct our position on the conduct of war be that take by international humanitarian law we have set out the risk and our concern about breach and we continue to take action that be in line with our assessment more than palestinian child have be kill since israel new offensive begin what worry about the government be that they do not seem to have any red line that israel must not cross we need robust action not word the two state solution which be on its knee be not by product of peace it be the route to peace if the time for recognition be not now then when be it what will the government response be when israel permanently occupy part of gaza as its defence minister seem to be insinuate it will my hon friend have long commitment to these issue and know that she have travel to the region she be right to say that the two state solution must be central to this she ask about annexation can be clear once again from the dispatch box that we want resolution that provide for the occupied palestinian territories to be palestinian as be consistent with relevant security council resolution commend the minister for the care and concern with which he update this house but we keep come back to the same point and situation this morning announcement by the israeli government about more incursion be condemnable we all know where this lead over the past year and half we have see mass displacement it lead to suffering and to hostage not be release and it take we close to the abyss will the minister join in make it clear that any forceful transfer of palestinian civilian and any annexation of palestinian territory be unacceptable and would be breach of international law my hon friend remain deeply committed to these issue and be pleased to reassure he that we do not support the expansion of military operation by israel announce this morning we continue to oppose force displacement of the palestinians palestinian territory must not be reduce in the conduct of this war in the past few day the bad extremist ben gvir have rejoin the israeli government red crescent medic have be kill by israeli force and israel have start fresh ground invasion kill hundred of woman and child with the specific intention of annex palestinian territory after every atrocity and illegal act the foreign office express its concern and then thing get bad have the minister consider what step the government should take to make thing well on the ground for palestinians and israelis of course that be the thought in our mind every day as we see the imagery and be send it by our colleague and our constituent every day this government see with our own eye the horror in gaza and every day we ask ourselves what we can do to try to ensure that this go in the direction of our policy and not in the direction that it have do the direction of the end of the ceasefire that lead to far too many hostage continue to be detain and aid restriction have continue long after and other have call for they to end as my hon friend would expect every day these question haunt we we be back here again aid worker shoot dead and dump in shallow grave hunger use as weapon of war hospital bomb now there be new plan to seize large area of gaza all that have come in the past few day israel be carry out war crime after war crime on december the foreign office issue press release rightly refer to russian war crime so do not see why there be reticence here be afraid that expression of concern be not enough when will the government act treat israel as they have rightly treat russia and impose serious sanction have set out the step we have take and the sanction we have issue and will continue to return to this house with further update recognise what the minister have say about what have be do but give the desperate situation what more could be do through diplomatic effort to ensure that israel allow in humanitarian aid at speed and at scale and to support the arab initiative so that gaza be rebuild as part of recognise viable palestinian state we will continue to work with our partner who be party to the arab initiative and indeed our partner in the united nations security council where we have call session and issue statement we will continue to work along those line in the way that my hon friend would expect have simple question and be look for very simple answer do the government recognise israel plan for large scale force evacuation in gaza as ethnic cleansing if not why not we continue to oppose force displacement in gaza put on record my sincere desire to see the israeli hostage return as soon as possible the international development committee recently spend time in geneva as part of its inquiry on international humanitarian law we discuss at length the way that country increasingly conflate the legality of resort to war with the legality of conduct in war we see aid be block and land be annex without it seem legitimate justification or even significant condemnation will the minister please explain what the government be do to ensure that international humanitarian law stop be openly break and be give the respect it deserve my hon friend and east midland colleague be right to raise the issue of the deterioration of the application of international humanitarian law there be too many place in conflict where there be very serious risk of breach of ihl in the conduct of hostility we be do all we can in geneva and new york and on the ground in place include israel and the occupied palestinian territories to ensure that the risk of breach of ihl do not continue thank the minister for come to the house to respond to question school base nursery capital grants with permission will make statement to update the house on the roll out of nursery in our primary school this labour government be bring the change that family deserve we make promise to the parent and child of this country and not nine month in we be act to deliver on they free breakfast club be already be roll out the curriculum and assessment review be in full swing and child social care be see the big overhaul in generation we have fund for new place for pupil with special educational need and disability back for up to more apprentice to qualify new improvement team for our school and new allowance for our kinship carer promise make promise keep here today we go far this million in funding for primary school to open and expand nursery be big step towards deliver nursery for school big step towards deliver childcare for parent and big step towards deliver the good start in life for all our child want that good start in life for every child because want opportunity for every child want every child in every village town and city across our country to grow up know that success belong to they that be the kind of country want to live in the country that this labour government want to build with opportunity not just for some but for all our child to achieve that we need to start early before university or college and even before school in the early year of our child life those year be fundamental to opportunity that be where gap in learning and development first appear and the long we wait the wide they grow and the hard they be to close that be why when be in school college and university even in those place they agree that the big chance to make an impact on our child life sit in those crucial early year that be why this be my no priority if we get this right and we set all child on the track to success that be where they will stay that be why despite the huge fiscal challenge that we inherit from the conservatives we choose to invest more than billion in the early year at the last budget it be why the early year be central part of the prime minister plan for change set the target of record share of child start school ready to learn that be why be today announce the school that will be deliver our first wave of new and expand school base nursery many of these school base nursery will serve community face big challenge where there be strong evidence of need overall it mean up to more nursery place for young child where they will have the big impact with most of they start in september this year that be vital because that be when the final stage of the hour week childcare entitlement will kick in when that be join up with the offer for three and four year old work parent of child from nine month right up to the beginning of school will get government fund hour of childcare week the school be just the start it be on the road to school base nursery we will work with school voluntary and private provider teacher and local partner to find and spread what work by the end it will mean that ten of thousand more parent have the power to choose the hour they want to work what contrast with the conservatives because what we inherit be not just an offer that they have not bother to fund but pledge without plan with place promise and provision missing parent make decision on the back of those promise again and again hear from parent how much they have be rely on the promise that the previous government scatter about like confetti across our country this government be deliver change in month when the last government wait year before sign post date cheque the change that we be make will give parent more control over their life time to choose their work hour and money back in their pocket the last coram report show that the effect be start to flow through childcare cost for under three in england have halve since the expansion but ultimately childcare and early year education be about child it be about launch lifetime of learn and start as we mean to go on so as we roll out these school base nursery we be also add the big ever uplift to the early year pupil premium close the attainment gap and give every child the support that they need to learn and grow and we be support early year educator to build their expertise it be not just what be teach in those nursery that count but where they be locate they be in primary school which be no accident we be centre school in their community start early work with the voluntary sector and private provider too so that the move from nursery to school be natural step from one room to another sometimes even in the same building as be the case at st anne church academy in weston super mare have nursery on site mean that strong long last relationship with family can be build parent feel that they be part of the community so they engage more when their child start nursery and then move into school when their child start reception there be no big scary change build the sense that school be where they be mean to be see that powerfully this week when go to peterborough to visit fulbridge academy little oak nursery sit at the heart of the school while be there speak to hannah work mum whose little boy nile go to the nursery she tell all about the difference that little oak be make to her family and about how her son be make friend and take big stride in his learning ready to join his two old sibling at school in september the nursery play big part in make fulbridge academy the centre of that community it be the same for free breakfast club which be why we announce the early adopter this year school be the beat heart of their community where child come together to eat learn and grow it be good for attendance and achievement for behaviour and belong and for child and their life chance that be the point this be action for they to give they the start that they deserve because that be my no priority build on deep and fierce commitment to the child of this country in the first year of their life take their first step into the world in our young child face and in the face of all who work with they we see something that for so long have be miss from our country hope we see the hope of bright and well future the hope of secure and prosperous world the hope that tomorrow can be well than today and the hope that this be government that be on their side that be the future that we shape together not face alone that be the hope that so many people in our country have that our good day lie ahead of we that be what the people of this country choose in the general election last july when they choose hope over fear and choose bright tomorrow not bitter yesterday and that be why be so focused on get on and deliver change because it matter so much for life now not in some distant future early year be where future be make where life chance be win and where healthy society be build that be the prize on offer our young generation be the first generation for whom opportunity be open to all right from the start and know that member from across the house will agree that that be prize worth fight for commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state we welcome the education secretary announcement but let we be absolutely clear the policy that she be talk about represent investment of million but the government be take away half billion pound from nursery by fail to compensate they for the national insurance increase that will have catastrophic effect on nursery up and down the country which will be force either to close or to put their price up catastrophic be not my word but that of the early years alliance follow labour national insurance bombshell on the childcare sector in her statement the education secretary say that she inherit pledge without load of nonsense it be our plan that be deliver the expansion of funded childcare this autumn and our plan that she today confirm have already halve cost for under three accord to independent research that be our plan madam deputy speaker but it be her plan that be shut nursery up and down the country and that will put up cost for parent just last week host roundtable with some of the unsung hero of the sector nursery owner many be in tear struggle with very real decision about whether they can keep their door open one of the owner share with that she be stop her own salary so that she can continue to pay her staff the amount they deserve another owner be have sleepless night worry about how she would provide proper care for the child now that she can no long afford the staffing cost thank to this government decision it be clearly absurd for the government to ask the sector to absorb the increase in national insurance while keep fee the same the consequence of that be entirely predictable nursery will have to either close or put up their price recent survey by the early years alliance say that sadly around nursery that it speak to may have to close because of this government job tax that be what the education secretary no priority look like parent will lose out too accord to the national day nurseries association increase to national insurance contribution will force nursery to raise their fee by those be the obvious consequence of this government decision will the education secretary finally admit today how much the job tax be cost the childcare sector will she monitor the impact of closure that happen thank to her job tax on childcare availability on the specific in her announcement today will she confirm the location of the school base nursery and how they be choose be they choose on the basis of surplus primary place or be they in area where we need more childcare provision if it be the latter how be they identify those nursery will be base in school so be it her intention that they will mimic the school timetable or will there be year round provision and will their hour be long than the school day will school base nursery be compensate for the impact of the job tax if so what will she do to address the inequity that that will cause with other provider as the early years alliance have say today if the government be truly serious about break down barrier to opportunity it must come to the realisation that increase school base provision can only ever be one piece of the puzzle fail to recognise this will simply mean that more family lose out it be right under this government more family will lose out while welcome the education secretary announcement the reality be that labour decision be make childcare more expensive and hard to hard work family will bear the brunt of this government failure it be time for the education secretary to stop make broken promise and actually make early year she no priority it must be profoundly drain for the right hon lady to come to the chamber when face with such good news and to bring such studied force negativity every single time six week ago be in the house deliver the news that we be support hundred of school across our country to open free breakfast club and we get much of the same study forced negativity then today not nine month into this government we be begin the roll out of school base nursery as we have promise to the people of this speak about visit and the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston neil should go and visit the school base nursery that will shortly be open in his constituency never hear from conservative members that they will be visit those nursery or breakfast club so maybe they could take time out of their busy schedule to go and do precisely that the only priority that they have be to bring back tax break for private school take away resource from our state school that be the one idea that they have their idea of fresh thinking be to spend money they do not raise on plan they do not make on the question ask by the right hon member for sevenoaks laura trott we be invest billion in expand early year entitlement alongside double the early year pupil premium million expansion grant and compensation for school base nursery the contrast between this government and the conservatives be like night and day be proud that at the department for education under labour government it be week in week out the department for hope the hope of bright and well future for our child and our country we have free breakfast club cutting edge curriculum for all our child the big overhaul of child social care for generation fund for up to new school place for child with special educational need and disability back for up to more apprentice to qualify new improvement team in our school new allowance for kinship carer and new support for expand foster care that be the difference between this labour government and the conservatives we be the party of hope if the conservatives recent leadership contest be anything to go by they can not decide if they be the party of fear or the party of despair early year be another strand of education that be decimate by the last government although those on the conservative benches have not value this sector as former teacher mum and now an mp know its value for child and family in our community although in portsmouth we do not have one of the nursery announce in today first wave commend the government on this initiative take this opportunity to commend and praise all those who work in the sector provide opportunity for the young people in my city thank they for their fantastic work also take this opportunity to ask the secretary of state to update the house on delivery of the plan september childcare expansion and to explain how she expect parent to benefit from the hour roll out across the fabulous nursery in my city be grateful to my hon friend who bring real expertise to this place through her background and wealth of experience in education through the expansion that we be roll out this year parent will see considerable saving but crucially it will ensure that all our child get the good possible start in life while recognise her disappointment that her own constituency do not benefit this time around note that portsmouth south secure school base nursery this time around of course this be only phase of what will be wide roll out as time progress call the liberal democrat spokesperson access to flexible high quality early year provision give child the start they deserve and parent the choice they need to live their life and it be one of the good possible investment we can make in the future of our country for those family live in childcare desert leave by the previous conservative government today announcement will be welcome news welcome the sorely need uplift in the early year pupil premium but school base nursery can only ever be part of the puzzle we will never fix the crisis in early year without fix the deep problem face private and charitable provider they deliver the vast bulk of the government free entitlement yet they face some of the tough challenge in make end meet the government national insurance hike the failure to ensure that rate actually cover delivery cost and damage guidance to local authority on funding agreement which come into effect this week mean that many be struggle to stay afloat we have already hear that the early years alliance survey find that four in say they would reduce their number of funded place for three year old and four year old in the next year some say they would be force to raise their fee for parent for non fund hour and almost third say they be likely to permanently close can the secretary of state tell how that be extend choice for parent building blocks nursery in teddington in my constituency be now operate at loss and face some incredibly painful decision that will hurt parent child and staff while welcome today announcement will the secretary of state commit to an urgent review of the rate pay for free entitlement to ensure that they cover delivery cost will she finally take this opportunity to recognise the deep damage that the national insurance hike be do and ensure that early year provider be exempt finally will she look again at the damaging guidance issue by her department on charge and funding agreement be grateful to the hon lady like she pay tribute to the big range of provider that play crucial role in support our child early education that extend to private voluntary provider and childminder who be crucial part of the sector the announcement we be make today on school base nursery be design to deal with many of the challenge that she identify arise from the childcare desert leave behind by the conservatives we also know that school base provider have great share of the market in more deprive area and of those announce today will serve disadvantaged report april vol correction alongside that note that the hon lady welcome the big ever uplift that we have secure in the early year pupil premium which will make big difference to the life chance of child from more disadvantaged background when it come to the rate we will always continue to keep those under review the hon lady ask about the charge guidance that have be issue believe it be important that parent have great transparency when it come to charge and fee and where they be able to exercise great choice in what be be offer to they believe that be the right approach not least as we move towards system in which the vast bulk of childcare be back by government have see more tory mp change lightbulb than there be in the chamber today welcome the statement from the secretary of state as do thomas gray primary school very good school in my constituency the parent and child do fantastic job there and thank she for it do she agree that quite simply action speak louder than the many word the opposition say agree with my hon friend like he pay tribute to the amazing staff work right across education in our school and nursery for the vital work they do like the right hon lady and really enjoy her sunlit uplands speech anyone would think there be leadership contest on in the labour party do not quite hear the answer to the question from my right hon friend the member for sevenoaks laura trott about the way in which the increase in national insurance contribution will hit all nursery at once whereas at the moment we be get an initial tranche of out of an intend new arrangement for her announcement to be fulfil over how long period do she expect to get from to be glad that the right hon gentleman like bit of hope and optimism think we could all do with bit of hope and optimism in the current world the leadership contest be really look forward to be the one that we be go to see very soon in his own party it will be treat for all of we in this house although hope it do not happen because would much prefer for thing to carry on just as they be note the question that the right hon gentleman ask we have secure an extra billion in the budget take the total to billion for early year entitlement in addition we have million expansion grant compensation for public sector employer and alongside that the big ever uplift in the early year pupil premium we be work very closely with the sector to deliver the place and the staff require and we will continue to do so in the month ahead answer the question in answer to the question this be the first phase and we will roll out the over the course of this parliament warmly welcome the refocusing on early year by this government and also welcome the school base nursery announcement today be particularly excited about the one at tranmere park primary school in guiseley in my constituency how many child do we think will be affect by this announcement and how many parent will benefit from it be grateful to my hon friend and look forward to the extra place that will be available in her constituency to serve local family what we be set out today will create new childcare place most of which we expect to be available from september we be move rapidly to support school to put in place the space for child that we know be require behind capital funding what give child the good start in life be the people such as early year practitioner teacher and teaching assistant the early year sector be struggle with crisis in recruitment and retention especially in rural area such as my constituency that lead to few place for child and high cost for family what step be the government take to address the lack of resource skill and experience in school and other early year sector for deliver high quality education to under three agree with the hon lady that it be the brilliant people work in early year education who make the big difference to our child life chance of course we need to put the capital in place to create the physical provision but it be the people who deliver it who matter the most know that the hon lady bring expertise in that area to this house agree that there be more to do to support the workforce but we have already take important step to support the sector to recruit and retain more staff ahead of the final phase of the roll out we have also recently introduce an experience base route to work in the sector at level and have publish the early year teacher degree apprenticeship standard new undergraduate route to early year teacher status later this year we will set out more detail on wide reform include look at the question about workforce that the hon lady have raise warmly welcome the statement from my right hon friend and neighbour particularly welcome the fact that yohden primary school in my constituency one of the most deprived and disadvantaged community not just in the county but in the country will benefit that be tremendous news but can my

announcement be an important first step in the government ambitious plan for change break the link between background and success and make sure that record proportion of child start school ready to learn this be the first phase of what we intend to do but there be more to come right throughout this parliament on friday meet incredible woman run nursery and pre school in havering they contact because they be in utter crisis business rate national insurance and wage bill be all rise while the government cap what they be allow to charge and then do not cover the cost of the free childcare hour be offer fee be go up and nursery be now at risk of mass closure the education secretary be drive private nursery to the brink while not provide enough school base one to fill the gap and be afraid that her talk of hope be absolutely delusional as parent with two small child who speak regularly to the woman run those nursery watch labour back benchers jeer the shadow secretary of state for ask question be absolutely disgusting what urgent action be the education secretary take to prevent meltdown in childcare that be go to affect work family across this country too speak to early year provider school nursery and childminder right across our country on regular basis unlike conservative front benchers who seem to spend most of their time complain about announcement that this labour government be make also pay tribute to the early year workforce and the staff in the hon lady constituency for the important work that they be do as have say in number of answer we have set out billion in funding alongside the big ever uplift to the early year pupil premium and million expansion grant to create the place that be require and that be on top of the million of capital funding that have announce today welcome this government continue commitment to break down barrier to opportunity and welcome the investment in the nursery at monks orchard primary school and fairchildes primary school in my constituency visit fairchildes early in the year and know that that money will go to very good use do the secretary of state agree that accessible childcare be essential support for all family and can she outline how today announcement will help to boost household income be delighted that my hon friend have be able to see at first hand in her croydon constituency the impact that this funding will have on family it will support we in ensure that record proportion of child arrive at school ready to learn and will make significant difference in support family and child development critically as my hon friend identify it will also put more money directly back into parent pocket the figure be welcome the government announcement today but not every parent need full childcare place many just need somewhere to go with their child especially in the early month as parenting can be an isolate and overwhelming experience what be the government do to support community base option such as one club and the sure start centre which provide vital space for parent and child alike agree about the importance of family support service especially for our young child the hon lady mention sure start that be proud achievement of the last labour government and when her party be in coalition with the conservatives we see sure start centre close right across the country however she make fair point about the support that be require in the early year which be why we be do more and will do more in the month ahead while access to early education be critical part of what many family want alongside access to high quality health visiting and speech and language support community provision be also critical that be why be work very closely with the health secretary to ensure that all family have good access to both education service and health and care service would like to express my gratitude and welcome this news today two new nursery will be open in bristol north east the tynings school in staple hill and avanti gardens in fishponds both area that have lot of young family but not enough nursery provision can the secretary of state reassure other family in bristol north east and across the country that this announcement be just the start and that under labour government we will see lot more nursery place open parent in my hon friend constituency will be able to benefit now from the expansion of school base nursery but this be just the start alongside the expansion in primary school that have set out we be work very closely with private and voluntary provider and with childminder to deliver the place that family in my hon friend constituency and across the country be promise by the conservative party but that this labour government will deliver emma who run nursery in the small village of sayers common in my constituency write to recently about the impact of national insurance rise recognise that today announcement be focus on really deprive area and can see that two primary school in crawley in west sussex that will benefit that be town with proper deprivation but deprivation also exist in rural area and be worried that today announcement be give with one hand to deprive urban area but take away with the other by hammer nursery in our rural village with increase national insurance contribution can assure the hon lady that the list of school announce today cover constituency the length and breadth of our country serve constituency both urban and rural recognise her point about ensure that there be good adequate provision in our rural community as well and if she want to share emma letter and experience with would be happy to respond thank the secretary of state for invest in battle hill primary school in the ward in which live where be proud to be school governor for year do she agree that invest in nursery in deprive area such as battle hill be essential in order to give very young child good start to their education journey agree with my hon friend that be where we will make the big difference to child life chance all the evidence be clear that where gap open up early they endure into the long run which have last impact on child ability to do well at school and get good gcse and on their earning potential into the future pay tribute to my hon friend for the work she have do over many year to support her community include as school governor while too be excited about the opportunity for some community be really concerned about the grow gap between school base nursery and community base one setting in my constituency such as cuddles trailway tots and nature nursery when those nursery have write to ministers to express their concern they have often be encourage to apply for small business rate relief but give the space standard that relief simply do not apply in the average early year set pay in business rate so those nursery can not apply because of the standard require by the education service in wales and scotland nursery be exempt from business rate and school have they factor into their funding formula how be we go to make sure that community setting benefit and that we be not just see toddler transfer into school setting with other setting close be sure that if the hon lady write with further information the under secretary of state for education my hon friend the member for portsmouth south stephen morgan will be happy to respond to her question but hope can give she some reassurance by say that of the school that will receive funding will be in partnership with private or voluntary early year provider on the school site moreover many of the provider that will deliver the service have announce will do so around the school day many school will ensure that there be provision throughout the year but also at the start and the end of school day often deliver in partnership with private or voluntary provider four school in suffolk will benefit from today announcement and two of they be in my constituency be delighted that reydon and waldringfield primary school will benefit do the minister agree that this new scheme will directly benefit rural constituency such as mine at time when access to nursery provision be even more challenging for family include work family than it be for their urban neighbour be delighted to hear about the impact that this will have on my hon friend constituency and throughout suffolk we believe that in rural community there be an important role for school base provision and expand early year opportunity where school be already at the heart or our community what have announce will allow further provision create early year place that will support child and their family and crucially it also represent an important step in support child development welcome the announcement curry mallet church of england school in my constituency be successful in this funding round and can expand its early year provision however many early year provider such as hassockmoor childcare in barrington face significant funding challenge give that more than three quarter of entitlement place be provide by private voluntary or independent nursery why be those not more central to expansion plan as they continue to experience the nightmare of increase employer nic price rise and sadly the risk of closure they be central to our plan and they have critical role to play in support for child and family and delivery of the roll out but school base nursery also have an important role in support child from more disadvantaged community where they already have high proportion of the market share we think that that can be expand far to provide high quality early year provision which will involve work with private voluntary and independent provider pay tribute to the early year workforce and strongly support the secretary of state announcement which build on other announcement make recently by she and other in her department will she say little more about the benefit for in particular the most disadvantaged child include those who may have english as second language we know from all the evidence that child from the most disadvantaged background have the most to gain from high quality early year education today announcement will allow we to provide more place for they alongside the expansion and the big uplift in the early year pupil premium when it come to childcare we be determined to enable child from more disadvantaged background to take up place welcome the announcement and in particular the increase funding but the government also need to address the problem of fund nursery provision in the private sector the castle kindergarten in my constituency have write to say that new restriction on what nursery can charge parent to bridge the gap between government funding and the actual cost of childcare service be put most private provider in precarious position accord to recent article in the times nearly of childcare provider plan to limit the number of government fund place owe to those restriction will the secretary of state meet along with my constituent to discuss this issue my hon friend the parliamentary under secretary will be happy to meet the hon gentleman to discuss that far in respect of charging and guidance think it an important principle that parent should have transparency on what they be be charge and what they be be charge for especially when it come to access to government back provision as for funding have already tell the house that we have increase the early year pupil premium by and alongside that be the million expansion grant this year the rate for under two have increase by on average welcome the announcement of capital funding which will benefit armthorpe shaw wood academy in my constituency but what revenue funding nursery will receive the investment in my hon friend constituency will allow parent to take up the offer of expand childcare and entitlement and we will ensure that the place be available to they eligible parent will have access to the entitlement that we be expand and roll out with the billion of investment that be announce in the budget thank the secretary of state for her statement and warmly welcome the inclusion of great horwood church of england school in the first round of funding like every school leader in buckinghamshire milton keynes and the country as whole the school headteacher paula shaw be work tirelessly to ensure that all child and their family have the opportunity to thrive do the secretary of state agree that it be vital to ensure that parent in both urban and rural community never have to choose between their family and their job agree with my hon friend and pay tribute to paula shaw and the team for all their work to support child and family we be delighted that so many school come forward to apply to take part in this first phase demand far outstrip supply so we will be return to this however be also delighted that paula and her team feel able to take part and to see the benefit that the extra place will bring to my hon friend constituent this have be game change announcement for my community not only have runshaw college in leyland be award million as part of the high education capital improvement fund but northbrook primary academy also in leyland and longton primary school have be include in the school base nursery provision be delighted about that and thank the ministers do the secretary of state agree that this offer huge opportunity for the development of young child as well as put large sum back in the pocket of work people we promise and we deliver and that be why the conservative benches be empty my hon friend be brilliant champion for the people of south ribble and it be testament to his hard work that he continue to make the case for investment as well as put more money back into parent pocket through our breakfast club and by roll out primary base nursery we be enable all our child to have brilliant start in life know that my hon friend be as passionate as be about ensure that we break the link between background and success so that where child be from do not determine what that child can go on to achieve be delighted that the fantastic ringway primary school in stakeford in my constituency will be among the first in the country to host school base nursery that combine with the much needed and long in the planning rebuilding of the school facility will have an immeasurable impact on the life chance of young people in my area do my right hon friend agree that investment of this nature mainly in socially deprive area will be of huge importance and will she commit herself to roll out further such scheme on my patch as soon as possible my hon friend can be assure that the early adopter breakfast club programme for instance be just the start of national roll out too be delighted that

bill presentation and first reading standing order no blair mcdougall present bill to make provision about labelling requirement for certain grocery product where the manufacturer have reduce the size of the product and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday july and to be print bill co operative housing tenure motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision that occupier of dwelling own by certain form of co operative shall occupy those dwelling by virtue of their membership of the co operative and not as tenant or under any other type of property interest to make provision for co operative tenure and for the right and obligation of the co operative and its member and for connected purpose it be my privilege and my pleasure to introduce the bill have always have co operative value they be in my bone it be not far from the mark to say that be bear in the co op it certainly feed clothe and provide essential good to in my early year and have take those value with throughout my life for six year serve as director of the co operative development society support community housing project and co operative across the country co operative housing be more than just an idea despite the significant barrier they face there be hundred of co operative housing project across the country and the number be grow just last week be lucky enough to visit coin street just over the river in waterloo forty year ago the coin street community builders come together to fight against the rapid development of unaffordable commercial housing in london which be lead to the total collapse of the community around they shop school and community space be all close they fight hard to buy the land and build new housing co operative on the bank of the thames today there be four housing co operative on coin street all manage by their resident many of whom have live there for decade these be more than just home for the people who live there they be route to training education decision making and genuine power this be housing do differently for too many people housing be something they have little control over work people have face housing sector that be break and have little opportunity to change that for too long when it come to housing power have feel very distant from community but for co operative housing project power have always sit directly with resident when decision be make resident be in the drive seat they have an active stake and say in the place they call home the power of that should not be underestimate crucially co operative housing project provide an alternative to the spiral rent and mortgage cost that too many member will be familiar with and which have plague the housing sector for decade want to place on record my thank to lucy grove and finn byrne from the coin street team and to tom coin street resident for all the work that they do to promote co operative housing and its potential and for show around last week pay tribute to david rodgers the long stand chief executive officer of cds housing and his successor linda wallace and to my great friend laura blake for all the work she do alongside to promote co operative housing now be the moment to grasp the opportunity that co operative housing offer just last week the government announce new funding package for community lead housing co operative and community land trust unlock thousand more home over the next decade this labour government understand that community lead housing be about put power into the hand of local people who will take lead in design the home they want to see in their community this be the first time the government have support this approach to financing house building on this scale and it have rightly be warmly welcome by the sector and by community who want to get involve in locally lead community housing solution unlock the power of co operative housing will be possible only if it be give foundation in law co operative housing do exist in the uk and in many case it thrive but local people seek to form housing co operative face an uphill legal battle without co operative housing tenure be set out in law adviser regulator lawyer bank and other who would normally be task with support people with their housing be not properly equip to do so in the case of co operative housing the united nations have declare this to be the international year of co operative and have call on member state to create enable environment for co operative this labour government already have bold commitment to double the size of the co operative and mutual sector and have be clear that co operative should play vital role in drive inclusive growth that be feel by work people and community now should be the moment to commit to co operative housing tenure so that this part of our sector can grow and thrive as it have never be enable to previously as be sadly often the case the uk lag behind our neighbour around the world when it come to co operative housing and its position in law sweden have have co operative housing law for more than century and norway for almost year it be no surprise that in those two country and in many more co operative housing be far more prevalent and successful than it be here to close want to reflect briefly on the role that co operative housing project be play in wide community be proud and privileged to be labour and co operative mp and to be part of the co operative party community britain campaign which argue that work be already under way in so many of our community to solve in serious and innovative way the big challenge that our country face we see that in local community own energy project in which people come together not just to tackle climate change through clean energy but to upskill local people we see it in agriculture in amazing initiative such as the english mustard growers co operative which be keep mustard alive in my constituency and across the east of england we see it in local initiative such as men sheds which be fight the loneliness epidemic or community kitchen which be bring people from different culture together what learn at coin street be that it be more than just housing development the co operative model have foster genuine community build on land own by the co operative be community pub collection of small independent business multi purpose neighbourhood centre include nursery and soon to be develop community leisure centre the co operative even have relationship with the renowned rambert ballet school nearby which allow resident of all age to access dance and culture at accessible and affordable price coin street be rich community lead by the need and want of local people it all start with the co operative model group of people come together to build something different and reap the benefit at time when share space like community centre pub and leisure centre have disappear across the country there be surely case for this model to come to the fore question put and agree to order that andrew pakes helena dollimore dame meg hillier paul waugh preet kaur gill ms stella creasy alice macdonald gareth snell florence eshalomi sarah hall alex sobel and rachel blake present the bill andrew pakes accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill onshore wind and solar generation beg to move that the draft infrastructure planning onshore wind and solar generation order which be lay before this house on march be approve good afternoon madam deputy speaker this instrument be another important step in support the deployment of onshore wind and solar which be critical to achieve the government mission for clean power by an effective planning system be key to unlock the new infrastructure our country need to deliver our energy security and resilience it be important that planning application be determine through an appropriate planning route that reflect project size impact and complexity where potential issue be identify and mitigate as necessary the nationally significant infrastructure project regime be govern by the planning act whereby decision on development consent be make by the secretary of state for energy security and net zero the nsip regime apply to large project with megawatt threshold determine which energy generating project be deem nationally significant follow submission into the nsip process an extensive examination period will commence where interested party include local authority people of office and the general public can make write or oral representation to the examination ensure that the voice of community be hear during the decision make process rather than traduce what remain of our countryside what assessment have the minister make of the uk morocco power project run by xlink which would deliver gw of energy and power about of our grid need it would seem that the block to this project be not the moroccan government nor the government of country through whose territorial sea the cable would pass but reside instead in whitehall what be the minister do about it give credit to the right hon gentleman for the ingenious way he bring that up in debate on solar and wind in the uk he raise good point we be look at the detail of proposal that have be put forward by private company be not go to say anything more on the floor of the house rise have give way already turn back to the statutory instrument in front of we until recently the de facto ban on onshore wind generation in england introduce by the conservatives limit the deployment of onshore wind in england those change to the planning legislation set an almost impossible bar to meet result in the pipeline of project shrink by more than with less than mw of onshore wind generation consent and become operational in the intervene period in july this government disapplie those planning policy test and commit to reintroduce onshore wind into the nsip regime reverse the damaging policy of the past year and place onshore wind on the same footing as solar offshore wind and nuclear power station as such through this instrument onshore wind project with generating capacity of more than mw in england will be eligible to be consent under the nsip regime this legislation be crucial to achieve our net zero commitment ge vernova renewable company in stafford eccleshall and the village struggle with really long waiting time for an expansion of its site but it have recently be approve which mean good new job for people who live in my constituency that exemplify the importance of streamline the planning process which will eventually lead to low bill for people in my constituency and around the country do the minister agree that this legislation be integral to develop the job we need across the country and would he like to come and visit ge vernova with thank my hon friend for that warm invitation will of course consider it and look forward to visit her constituency at some point she make an extremely important point we be reform the planning system to deal with challenge that have mean that for too long infrastructure that be incredibly important for our energy security have be hold back by dither and delay in the process we want to sweep that away and move forward much more quickly the prize be energy security but as she rightly point out this be also about job and investment in community right across the country will the minister give way will then need to make progress the minister talk about our energy security what will increase our energy security be issue new oil and gas licence so that we can have more home grow energy why will the minister not change his policy on that we really be stretch this debate but be very happy to discuss this matter the point have be raise on number of occasion and the answer be always the same it be not deliver energy security at the moment we have say very clearly that oil and gas play crucial role in our energy mix now and it will continue to play role for decade to come but the north sea be already in transition the reality of the past year under the conservatives be that more than job be lose with no plan for how to deal with it we be determined to deliver on the transition and on energy security which will get we off the rollercoaster of fossil fuel price that we be all still rid will the minister give way will make little progress and come back to the right hon gentleman although we have minute be conscious of time this instrument be about make sure that onshore wind project in england that offer capacity of over mw will be eligible to be consent under the regime it reflect advance in turbine technology over the last decade with modern turbine be large and more powerful reintroduce onshore wind into the nsip regime will provide an appropriate route for nationally significant project seek planning consent where they be of certain scale and complexity so that local impact can be carefully balance against national benefit and the need to meet the uk wide decarbonisation goal this will provide great confidence for developer and grow the pipeline of potential project in england once again be extremely grateful to the minister for give way he talk about national impact wonder what provision there be under this legislation for protect national landscape many of the windy place in the uk be among our most beautiful whether it be the hill and mountain of our national park or the down of our national landscape like the north wessex down in my constituency which be an area of outstanding national beauty but be now national landscape many of my resident be concern because the minister be quite right that the turbine that be now be develop be huge it be likely to mean that for most of our lifetime we will lose the landscape to these new development will this system still encompass consideration of protect landscape and make sure that it stay as it be for future generation the right hon gentleman raise an important point as have always say from the dispatch box in this role there be balance to be strike here we need to build nationally important infrastructure and that do mean much more onshore wind in england to match the significant amount of onshore wind that have be build in scotland over the past few year include not far from my constituency but the balance must be strike with protect land as well even if we build the significant number of project that be need there will still be protection for land in the area he mention the planning system allow for those consideration to be take into account the nsip regime already include nuclear and solar we be say that the ban on onshore wind introduce by the conservatives be not rational decision so we be bring it back into this process interruption the shadow minister say that it be absolutely rational but his party former energy minister the right hon member for beverley and holderness graham stuart say that it be always mad think we should remember that not everybody in the conservative party agree with it include suspect the shadow minister himself let come to the second part of the statutory instrument the question of solar solar have be subject to mw nsip threshold since it be originally set out in the planning act however much like onshore wind solar panel technology have see significant advance in efficiency enable great megawatt yield per site evidence suggest that the mw threshold be now cause market distortion with modern technology mid sized generating station have generating capacity great than mw and therefore fall within the nsip regime that be likely to be disproportionate to their size scale and impact that have result in large amount of ground mount solar project enter the planning system artificially cap their capacity just below the mw threshold lead to potentially inefficient use of site and grid connection the approach set out in the order be continuation of the minister work to build the clean energy infrastructure that the country need agree that the capacity threshold and the reintroduction of onshore wind generation station into the definition of nationally significant infrastructure project will help deliver the triple benefit of decarbonisation energy security and job creation however as the minister know cornwall be leader in the roll out of onshore wind and solar energy do he agree that the order will further opportunity for renewable energy growth across cornwall that would have be ignore by the flat earth climate change denier in the conservative party thank my hon friend for the point although be disappointed because while he normally invite to visit cornwall he do not on this occasion will not take it personally since he be elect to this place he have do fantastic job in deliver job in his community on the clean power mission most recently by look at some of the raw material that be so essential he have make great progress on that so pay tribute to he my hon friend be of course right about the conservative party scepticism of policy that it use to support so wholeheartedly and one that have deliver economic growth right across the country it have now turn its face against that be not sure whether that be flat earth or not be sure that the shadow minister will regale we with his long list of commitment in this space but it be clear that the drive to net zero be deliver industrial opportunity job manufacturing and investment in community that have suffer for so long under economic decline as well as deliver on our climate ambition and energy security that be the right path for we to be on will return to solar for second raise the nsip threshold to mw for solar will ensure that mid sized project have access to more proportionate planning route via local planning authority it should incentivise project that would otherwise have cap their capacity to develop to more optimal and efficient scale we be talk about increase the threshold from mw to mw wonder whether the minister be aware of the average size of nsip project approve by the government since last july if so why have the threshold be keep artificially low at mw and not raise significantly high otherwise we will see huge number of small project come through and be classify as nsips such as those approve by the minister so far rather than large project the hon gentleman have ask number of write question on this topic to try to get to the heart of the matter and he be now test on the number which think we do provide he with in response to one of those write question since it be not on the tip of my tongue will write to he with the answer on the general point do accept what he be say part of the reason for the instrument be to try to get to more rational point where we do not have project limit themselves artificially to level base on figure we settle on mw because we think it strike the right balance by allow large project that can deliver the outcome we want in the energy system through the town and country planning act while limit the number of project come into the national planning process we think that balance be right but we will continue to look at it the hon gentleman have raise important point with in in write question that be happy to discuss with he in more detail the government be mindful that mid and large scale solar and onshore wind project that may be prepare to enter the planning system might have already invest and undertake preparatory step with the expectation of enter particular planning regime therefore change the nsip criterion at short notice could result in project enter into different regime from that which they expect which could increase cost for developer and cause delay therefore the instrument before we also make transitional provision for onshore wind and solar project that be already in the planning process when the order come into force the provision will therefore ensure that project already progress under one regime will not be require to move into different one in conclusion through consultation we seek view and support evidence on reintroduce onshore wind into the nsip regime we receive range of response from different group of people most agree with our approach and the majority agree with the mw threshold indeed although we initially consult on the idea of high threshold of mw base on the analysis of those consultation response we conclude that mw threshold would be more appropriate and would reflect modern technology this instrument be another important step forward in deliver our clean power mission support the deployment of onshore wind and solar and establish the uk as clean energy superpower it support all our work as government on deliver an effective planning system one that ensure that application be process efficiently through an appropriate regime and that avoid distortionary effect on deployment the measure ultimately aim to support our future energy security and resilience alongside our goal and wide decarbonisation target commend the order to the house call the shadow minister in just four short week people across england will go to the poll to determine the future of their local community at that same time the labour party seek to impose on those very same community vast new energy infrastructure huge solar farm and wind turbine with blade height of metre to metre destroy swathe of england green and pleasant land and go against the wish of local people as ever only the conservative party be stand up for those community and only the conservative party believe that people in those community should have say over their local area labour would silence those community choose to impose rather than to seek consent in four week time voter across this country will have that choice before they the order provide route to approval for onshore wind that entirely bypass the consent of local community and empower the zealotry of the secretary of state to impose infrastructure irrespective of the concern of local people in my constituency of gordon and buchan the suie and correen hill be subject to planning application for new onshore wind farm there be also concern that because of that there will be new pop up infrastructure next to it whether substation or battery and so on one project lead to another and then to another it overtake local community it mean that local landscape and local business change and there be an impact on farming too do my hon friend agree that such project can not be look at in isolation this have to be about their holistic impact across the board not just about the individual scheme one at time could not agree more with my hon friend live as we do in the north east of scotland and see around we the huge increase in energy infrastructure plan for rural community over the next few year it be quite daunting it be therefore no surprise that there have be such vociferous campaigning against the plan whether those for wind turbine pylon energy substation or battery storage facility all of which be in the pipeline for our community that be why there be such pushback there and also such concern across many of the community that will be affect by the change in england over the next few year that be why we oppose the si before we in their first week in office the government approve three solar farm across lincolnshire cambridgeshire and rutland against the wish of the local community today the minister seek to go far still in increase the threshold for solar he push for the development of giant solar farm to be eligible for sign off by the secretary of state solar farm have to be mw in capacity currently the large shotwick solar park in flintshire be mw the change signal free for all for giant scale solar and the instrument bring onshore wind over mw capacity into the nsip scope in lancashire that mean scout moor ii be in the secretary of state gift to approve calderdale wind farm with turbine cover square mile be plan for yorkshire and will be build on grouse moorland and farmland in lincolnshire prime agricultural land the breadbasket of england this mean potential onslaught of proposal despite the county council opposition to large scale plan know how much this mean to local community my hon friend the member for gordon and buchan harriet cross have also make this point represent constituency that be be subject to vast swathe of energy infrastructure and over the next few year approval will be seek for whole host of new plan that will indelibly change landscape that people be proud and happy to live in right now do my hon friend agree that rather than make it easy for large scale solar and onshore wind application the government should be focus on fabric first and increase the energy efficiency of our housing stock thereby reduce energy demand rather than destroy our countryside absolutely would be keen to see exactly what the government be propose on that front their plan which be strip away the right of local community be do great damage to community across this country with shocking disregard if the shadow minister be so confident about conservative party policy will he come back to the house after may and tell we how the conservatives have perform in those local election would be delighted to come back and compare note on how our respective party have perform in the local election on may the choice before the people of england who be go to the poll on may be quite clear where they have conservative local authority they get well service and well value for money as be be demonstrate right now by the comparison between birmingham and bromsgrove there could not be well illustration of the difference between conservative party local delivery and labour party failure that be what be on the ballot paper on may and will debate the argument around that with the hon member any day of the week the labour government have make no secret of their plan to double onshore wind and treble solar to be achieve by empower themselves while disenfranchise local community in lincolnshire lancashire and yorkshire they be silence local opposition they risk alienate the british public in their costly rush to renewable base system without consultation and with no consent the race to clean power be be do at the expense of all else it be be do at the expense of our energy security our national security and our standard on ethical supply chain just last week in this very house labour whip its mps to vote in favour of allow great british energy to invest in supply chain despite evidence of modern slavery the labour party the week before the secretary of state be collaborate with the people republic of china sacrifice our national security and tacitly admit that his wrong head target be unachievable without import make with coal power perhaps the government receive advice on how to achieve community consent from president xi jinping understand that this particular sector be out of fashion with the government but one of the other sacrifice be likely to involve scotland and indeed england precious raptor population raptor often suffer as result of high density wind farm and be effectively mince as they fly through the air in california and elsewhere we see high number of bird death particularly bird of prey would the government not be well off in my hon friend opinion put their time and investment into low orbit solar in which the uk along with japan lead the world bow to my right hon friend expertise on raptor and on british bird life in general that sound like an entirely sensible suggestion the minister be take note and very much hope that he will take that suggestion back to the department in which he be lucky to serve the minister have tell we that onshore renewable infrastructure can unlock low bill and that it be the cheap energy source but that be not the case we have the second high on stream renewable in europe yet the uk domestic energy bill be among the high in europe we also know from the office for budget responsibility that the cost to business and household of subsidise renewable will increase from billion to billion by that be the true cost of the government rush to net zero we be very proud of what we achieve during our year in government build the first and fifth large offshore wind farm in the world which be generate power for great britain right now and halve our emission while grow the economy fast than any other develop economy but this government need to be honest with the british people about the cost of their arbitrary target the labour party make no attempt to account for the whole system cost associate with the renewable dominate system in fact the secretary of state cancel the analysis commission by his predecessor he do not want to know how much it cost and it be clear that the government do not want to know it be wilful ignorance drive purely by ideology at the election the labour party promise we off energy bill yesterday we see the price cap and bill go up on the opposition side of the house we stand with community seek to empower local people and understand their concern we oppose this instrument which enable the secretary of state to continue to ride roughshod over the concern of local community in vain pursuit of the government own legacy will the minister recommission the whole system cost analysis that his government scrap on day one and look at the fact can he tell we the cost of run the gas fire power station fleet for of our power in addition to the rise curtailment cost pay to turn off the grow number of wind turbine can he confirm that his propose community benefit package be significantly low than the scheme consider by the previous government what be his message to the resident of lincolnshire lancashire yorkshire cambridgeshire buckinghamshire and elsewhere as they make their decision on may rise order will now announce the result of today defer division on the draft ecodesign for energy relate products and energy information amendment northern ireland regulations the ayes be and the noes be so the ayes have it the division list be publish at the end of today debate we have four more speech thank the minister for expedite this important legislation to transform the energy landscape in the uk have long campaign for renewable energy measure to reduce our reliance on fossil fuel and to produce green power of our own the uk have suffer significantly like many other country from the cost of oil and gas skyrocketing due to the ongoing war between russia and ukraine the conservatives do nothing to help the situation they abandon much of the country energy storage leave we reliant on fossil fuel pump in under the channel and do not take energy security seriously they far compound the situation by scrap their net zero target and champion dirty pollute gas and oil last year the uk hit historic milestone with of energy come from renewable source include be generate by wind power as energy bill rise yet again it be clear that we need to break the shackle that hold we hostage to energy company charge extortionate rate just to keep the light on british people simply can not afford for the status quo to continue financially and environmentally be proud that this government be lead the way by set up great british energy to give we energy independence security and longevity but that need to be back up by plan infrastructure change that support our aim understand concern that our countryside and agricultural land could be at risk from the development of renewable power source and upgrade the grid but be confident that this government will ensure that infrastructure be always in the right place and do in the right way create the infrastructure be not the end of the story due to the lack of energy storage and grid capacity around terawatt hour about of the wind power be effectively lose even though national grid be work at speed to upgrade the network to ensure that not single watt hour be lose we need to do more two year ago my husband and retrofit and upgrade our home by remove the gas instal solar panel and an air source heat pump and fully insulate externally but we quickly realise the battery be not big enough to store all the energy we be produce and despite be able to sell some of it back to the grid it would have be well to be able to store more of it for rainy or rather snowy and icy day scale that up and it be the same for the whole country we need to harness that additional energy to help to reduce the need for fossil fuel hope this change will filter down into the house building industry it have long be bugbear of mine that developer be only require to install an electric vehicle charge point on new build home we need to mandate solar panel on every roof and proper insulation so that heat do not escape through the wall and ensure that home across the uk be fit for the future also take this opportunity to welcome the fund make available by west midlands mayor richard parker to help small business to make the transition to renewable energy small and medium sized enterprise have be hit hard by energy price rise and uncap tariff have cause bill to spiral to unsustainable level to drive growth we need energy security to make bill affordable for resident and business alike break down the barrier to tackle climate change and the energy crisis will help we to meet the government ambitious target for energy storage and grid reinforcement but we must move at pace to match the growth of renewable generation streamline planning process and investment in energy storage will help our country to transition to low cost green and clean power grid by we be live in the shadow of the former conservative government failure to invest in renewable energy and insulate our home those failure have contribute directly to an energy crisis that have leave household struggle with soar bill and business face crippling cost the majority of people poll in this country want to see more action on climate change and save our planet not less the liberal democrats be unwavere champion of renewable energy now more than ever we need to strengthen our home grow energy security and stop our dependency on despot such as putin we welcome the lifting of the effective moratorium on onshore wind which we have long call for that be an extremely short sighted and irresponsible conservative policy the planning change that they make in and introduce de facto ban in england result in loss to our manufacturing and local economy the project pipeline for onshore wind shrink by over and less than mw be consent to and become operational in the intervene period the supply chain be important for the roll out of onshore and offshore wind and the oil and gas sector supply chain will be crucial but it be be wear away by the rush to end our use of north sea oil and gas do the hon member agree that preserve that supply chain and ensure manage transition from north sea oil and gas will be vital to any roll out of onshore and offshore wind we be absolutely and critically supportive of just transition in the north sea to move off fossil fuel alongside and parallel to our increase use of renewable energy it be therefore right to reintroduce onshore wind into the nationally significant investment regime ensure that there be level playing field with other generate technology such as solar offshore wind and nuclear which be already assess under that regime the motion also raise the threshold for solar project deem nationally significant from mw to mw in one way that increase threshold will help to prevent poor land use give that the previous threshold incentivise developer to put in an artificial cap of mw which lead to of proposal come in at that level increase the threshold in local planning decision also mean that biodiversity net gain will be require of solar farm ensure that where they be approve they be nature friendly it will also give local voice great say in determine the location and suitability of large scale solar project up to mw that be important however local decision make about large scale solar can not happen in vacuum we need join up approach that balance the need for food security energy infrastructure new home and nature recovery that be why we welcome the government launch of consultation on both the land use framework and the strategic spatial energy plan which together should determine the most strategic energy mix how much solar we need at what scale and where good to locate it across the country the hon member be like cambridgeshire mp cambridgeshire have already have sunnica one of the large solar farm in the country at acre approve we have another acre project in my constituency as she well know and other be in the planning process do she agree that cambridgeshire resident should not have to bear the brunt of these project know that she be staunch advocate for the move towards solar but would she like stand up for her resident if someone be look to build nationally significant infrastructure project of that scale in her constituency that be exactly the point be make have be talk with my constituent particularly about the controversial new large scale kingsway solar farm in my constituency we need land use framework and strategic spatial energy plan that tell we and inform local planning and decision making about the scale of solar energy that we need across the whole country where it be well locate where it can fit in and feed in and the energy mix we need to consider that mix and the balance of food security energy infrastructure home and nature recovery equally we need genuinely significant community benefit scheme apply to large scale generation scheme similar to the community benefit approach apply in scotland we want to ensure that all national infrastructure project and major energy generation infrastructure not just transmission provide minimum level of community benefit invest at ward and parish level into community benefit fund and determine by the local community most affected we must take community with we and show that they be part of the energy transition and that it be do with they not to they we have deep reservation about the government approach overall to nationally significant infrastructure project in the planning and infrastructure bill which appear to be power grab strip away local voice and let developer off the hook for their impact on nature and wildlife nature be not blocker it be an enabler of good growth and wellbeing and while we climate proof our energy system we must also ensure that nature be part of future proof our economy we will always speak up for climate and nature combine approach although we be supportive of the motion ambition to streamline planning for major project such as onshore wind we register our concern about the government broad change to nsips and planning include the exemption of category person from compulsory purchase consultation and the implementation of several henry viii clause that hand sweep power to the secretary of state and undermine local government and local voice it be entirely possible to accelerate renewable energy deployment and uphold the community voice in planning decision while protect nature and that be what we need to see thank the minister for explain why this motion be so important and how it will unblock the system and unlock potential the move to clean home grow energy demand nationwide delivery of our critical infrastructure yet the current planning system be hold that back without home grow energy we will not have control over energy price in the uk and we need the infrastructure to deliver that there will always be degree of opposition to the development of wind farm that be democracy but it be how we respond to local concern that make difference bury our head in the sand as the conservatives choose to do for year be simply not an option it be important to share some experience of the development of wind farm from my constituency and to be clear that scotland be on different track as wind farm development fall under national planning framework want to share two lesson from my constituency people across the country understand and see the natural benefit that the infrastructure cover by motion will unblock those include local employment opportunity through construction and maintenance boost to the local economy increase local spending and of course legacy of endless clean energy however experience from my area show that those natural benefit should be top up by community benefit lesson no be that there be need for community benefit and fair and transparent model of distribute they the nine community council group in my constituency represent nine cumnock and doon valley community which manage and distribute community benefit from multiple wind farm development across the area they embody collaborative community approach to wind farm benefit and that must be the way forward for the country lesson no be to consider the impact of build this crucial infrastructure on other crucial infrastructure such as road by their very nature wind farm be often in rural area where transport link be already under resource in rural area people use road more to go to work to shop and for basic living build wind farm be great boost to the local economy but it can take its toll on the road that mean that we need to do more to support and invest in maintain good road link in those community those lesson be about take people with we when it come to the transition to clean energy ayrshire story be about make the move from coalfield to clean field it be one to be replicate but we must ensure that our community be onside in the process reiterate my opposition to the measure that this government wish to impose the slew of nationally significant infrastructure project approve by this government since july be the vanguard of many more in huntington the propose east park solar farm be set to be big than gatwick airport at acre span mile nearly of the agricultural land involve be grade as our good and most versatile land though the energy minister have previously state to that no nationally significant infrastructure project have be consent which will use great than good and most versatile agricultural land this government track record and ideological zealotry on this point strongly indicate that there be no upper limit on the quantity of agricultural land they be willing to develop last week during consideration of the planning and infrastructure bill the deputy prime minister say that she would protect our high quality agricultural land would be interested to hear from the government how exactly they plan to do that give their track record of build on it regularly speak to constituent who feel voiceless and ignore the secretary of state have show himself to prioritise ideology over listen to valid concern let alone pragmatic detail the government be willing to move the goalpost to reach their aim and it be my constituent who be pay the price without be hear they be receive nothing in the way of direct compensation and no firm commitment to cheap energy bill or to ensure that community benefit fund appropriately compensate local community clause of the planning and infrastructure bill even remove the requirement to consult category people who can make claim under the compulsory purchase act instead they will be inform that their land will be take only at the acceptance stage my online petition of resident in the village surround the solar farm receive more than signature that be the only time those resident feel they have be able to make their voice hear urge the government to listen to these people and thousand of other like they across our rural heartland the government take pride in announce with this statutory instrument that the solar nsip threshold have be raise from mw to mw the average megawatt output of solar farm application in be mw the average solar nsip application approve since this government come to power be mw to refer to my previous question to the minister by keep the threshold artificially low the government open the door to huge number of solar farm become nsip by the back door would welcome review on set that nsip threshold at much high level give the scale of current nationally significant infrastructure project have previously ask the minister about the quality of photovoltaic panel and the fact that they will create more and more energy go forwards we must also look at where the panel will be source the energy minister have previously confirm to that the government be determined to eradicate force labour in global supply chain include in the manufacture of solar panel yet they whip government members against conservative motion that would have prevent great british energy from buy solar panel when there be evidence of modern slavery in the supply process the government be more interested in score political point than in take the step to eradicate force labour the government have repeatedly demonstrate that they be prepared to ride roughshod over local wish in pursuit of their ideological goal with their manipulation of the system to force through ten of thousand of acre of solar panel much of they on our good and most versatile agricultural land and by make roll change to national policy statement while keep the solar nsip threshold artificially low the government show once again their contempt for our embattle rural community as well as the contempt be show for local community and consultation do my hon friend lament the lack of imagination there be plenty of place where many people would welcome solar farm such as on motorway and railway embankment they could easily be delineate for such development and it would not necessarily impact on our landscape there be also the continue lack of any compulsion for the inclusion of solar on warehouse roof we could probably create exactly the same amount of power as his constituency be likely to create by put solar panel on the roof of every warehouse in park royal to the west of london again and again we look to virgin land first rather than be imaginative about well solution my right hon friend make an excellent point with which wholeheartedly agree the government have target of build million sorry that be downgrade in the spring statement to million new home it would be sensible for they to implement some sort of legislation that would mean that those million new home have solar panel on their roof urge the minister to ask what assessment have be do on how much energy could be generate be we to do that at full scale instead of build solar farm on our good rural heartland will the hon member support the private member bill introduce by my hon friend the member for cheltenham max wilkinson aptly name the sunshine bill which would make solar panel mandatory on the roof of all new home will leave my decision until we have vote on that bill but will look at it in more detail with your leave madam deputy speaker will respond briefly to some of the point raise in the debate but will not detain the house long as know we be keen to progress through the order paper thank hon member for their contribution to this wide range debate the regulation lift the nonsensical ban on onshore wind in england that the conservatives drive through for year that ban have hold back energy security and economic development opportunity across the country the measure before we come to rational position on solar in the planning system will respond briefly to the point raise about nature and other issue the hon member for south cambridgeshire pippa heylings put it particularly well the public want we to take action on the climate crisis the conservative party might want to pretend that that do not exist any more but it do the great threat to nature in this country be climate change we will tackle that but in do so we will deliver energy security on the point make by the shadow minister the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie let say that neither of we scottish mps will have vote in the election in four week time but people will have the choice between the conservative party which have still not own up to any of the mistake that it make in year and the party that be try to fix the mess they can choose between party that be move forward to deliver economic growth and energy security and party that would rather hold we back and keep we on the rollercoaster of volatile fossil fuel today vote be chance for we to demonstrate that we want that economic opportunity and want to deliver energy security and climate leadership urge hon member on all side of the house to support we

jeremy wright james wild ben obese jecty the house divide ayes noes question accordingly agree to resolve that the draft infrastructure planning onshore wind and solar generation order which be lay before this house on march be approve drive licence zero emission vehicles beg to move that the draft motor vehicles driving licences amendment no regulations which be lay before this house on march be approve the aim of the regulation be to support the transition to zero emission vehicle to reduce the regulatory burden on business and to drive economic growth on our journey to become clean energy superpower business and family be choose to make the switch to clean green vehicle that be cheap to run and reduce noise and air pollution on our street the uk be the large electric car market in europe in and so far this year demand be up accord to industry figure however zero emission vehicle can be heavy than equivalent petrol and diesel vehicle because of the weight of their battery or power train which can push they into high driving licence category than their petrol or diesel equivalent regulation to partially solve the problem be pass in allow category licence holder to drive alternatively fuel vehicle weigh up to tonne if they fulfil additional requirement include receive five hour of additional training from an accredited instructor drive only for the purpose of transport good and have no ability to tow however follow the rapid growth of zero emission technology since the exist regulation represent an unnecessary barrier to switch to zero emission vehicle the cost of the training and of take driver off the road to complete it can be prohibitive and time consume for business these regulation will therefore enable the holder of standard category licence to drive fully electric or hydrogen power vehicle up to maximum weight of tonne without those additional requirement exist category rule on age and passenger number will apply category licence holder can also usually drive minibus weigh up to tonne if they fulfil additional requirement include the requirement for the driver to be over the age of the regulation apply the same additional requirement to zero emission minibus weigh up to tonne they also allow zero emission vehicle weigh up to tonne to tow trailer just as rule permit their petrol and diesel counterpart to provide that the total combine vehicle and trailer weight do not exceed tonne it be important that people with disability should have equitable drive licence flexibility to ensure that they be not exclude from the benefit of these regulation an eligible zero emission vehicle may weigh up to tonne if it be fit with specialist equipment for the carriage of disabled passenger that additional weight allowance also apply to minibus could the minister elaborate on the type of vehicle that will be cover by the provision for additional weight for disabled user the provision apply to electric vehicle not to gas or synthetically fuelled vehicle the fuel type in scope of these regulation be zero emission rather than alternative fuel the only vehicle not cover by these regulation but that be in scope of the old one be gas power vehicle the government estimate that there be few than on the road today and their technology do not require an additional weight allowance public consultation on these proposal be hold in and receive response which be largely supportive of the change though some concern be raise about safety follow detailed analysis the government be confident that these regulation pose an extremely low risk to road safety between and there be total of nine collision involve such vehicle and six of they be minor collision however we will closely monitor incident datum as it become available to protect the safety of all road user in the unlikely event that concern trend emerge swift action will be take to protect the public the department will publish detailed safety guidance which we be work with industry to disseminate in closing these regulation be common sense measure to equalise the drive licence rule for zero emission vehicle and their petrol and diesel counterpart commend this statutory instrument to the house call the shadow minister draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests particularly as it relate to the use of synthetic fuel donate for my summer surgery tour last august my concern about this statutory instrument unlike my concern about other recent piece of parliamentary business be narrow which mean this will be relief to member from across the house have no doubt that my remark will be brief hon member hear hear have never have such big cheer thank the government for bring forward sensible reform which will decrease the regulatory burden and provide more flexibility for category licence holder many of the reform be sensible step that be widely support in the consultation during the last parliament it be unfortunate but unsurprising that the government so call plan for change do not involve scrap the limitation in this statutory instrument narrow the scope of eligible vehicle from alternatively fuel vehicle to zero emission vehicle be mistake that can not be ignore as we transition to new technology we as country must be less prescriptive too often government want to tell industry and innovator what to do and be afraid that the restrictive nature of this measure risk hamper our country attempt to reduce emission let be clear my concern be not judgment on whether the government be right or wrong to suggest that zero emission vehicle will be most effective the issue be rather that limit the measure scope to small subset of non petrol and non diesel fuel make they far too narrow do my hon friend share my concern that the regulation could be of serious detriment to the uk synthetic biology research community significant effort be go into the creation of engineer bug that can turn renewable matter such as sugar cane into fuel for internal combustion engine in circular economy that would represent completely renewable source of energy that would be carbon neutral throughout its entire life cycle be grateful to my right hon friend for that point which have be make for many year certainly do so during my time on the transport committee in the previous parliament and outside this place as have engage with the classic car sector and all part of the industry he be right that there be big innovative drive for sustainable fuel if can call they that some of they derive from feedstock other from waste matter and they work in the internal combustion engine that we already have in jet engine as well as motor vehicle engine there be also entirely man make synthetic fuel that require no such feedstock they do not require food to be grow in order to be burn there be innovator on that in this country and all over the world for example zero petroleum just next door to my constituency just over the oxfordshire border at bicester heritage have develop fuel that work in every jet engine and every internal combustion engine that we enjoy today it be entirely man make it be literally make out of air and water it be mixture of green hydrogen with atmospheric carbon capture however the zev mandate and the approach that the government be take in this statutory instrument rule that technology out of order because there be still carbon at the tailpipe the regulation ignore the fact that the carbon at the tailpipe be the same volume of carbon that be capture out of the atmosphere to make the next lot of fuel in fact whole system analysis show that technology to be carbon neutral one volume of carbon be in perpetual cycle however no matter how much ministers and the government claim to be technologically neutral the test at the tailpipe and the test in this statutory instrument which explicitly refer to zero emission vehicle rather than alternatively fuelled vehicle do in fact mean that the government pick technological winner at every step rather than let our great innovator innovate be interested to hear about the hon gentleman knowledge and experience of alternative fuel he perhaps understand this statutory instrument well than do but understand that it be about the weight of vehicle and that an alternative fuel go through the internal combustion engine do not result in additional weight will any of the technology that he be describe result in additional weight and might they therefore fall foul of the limit in the regulation the hon gentleman be right that this be fundamentally about weight but on the point about synthetic fuel which my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse draw on to moment ago rarely need ask twice give the number of year have spend talk about this it be true that there would not be an addition of weight however there would be for some alternatively fuelled system for example in the case of hydrogen the fuel tank have to be much more robust they certainly be in hydrogen combustion vehicle of which there be very few as far as understand it it be only jcb that have develop the technology for construction plant but there could be an application to road vehicle in the future hydrogen run at about bar in the fuel tank so we obviously would not put it in an exist car fuel tank it simply could not take the pressure there would be weight implication for such system it be interesting when sit in the chamber to hear colleague expertise on subject that we do not know they have expertise in wish to draw my hon friend back to slightly different subject which he be begin to touch on electric vehicle which of course have battery tend to be far heavy than equivalent vehicle with an internal combustion engine some of the vehicle combination that the minister talk about for example he mention vehicle and trailer not exceed tonne gross vehicle weight would vary in weight depend on whether the car or van be electric that might affect person decision to change from vehicle with an internal combustion engine to an electric vehicle my hon friend make an accurate point in some way the statutory instrument seek to address that point however he be right that when real people out there in the country make choice on their vehicle they will make practical decision such as the one outline by my right hon friend the member for north west hampshire kit malthouse rather than look at some of the other thing the government from time to time wish they be think about when they make those choice to make rapid progress madam deputy speaker when the consultation be conduct of respondent accept that that be only quarter favour retain alternatively fuel vehicle on the basis of the extra flexibility offer by the current alternative fuel definition particularly for hard to transition use case that be small subset but we risk limit the capability of industry and technology if we close down the possibility of innovation there may be occasion when the additional weight would be beneficial to those alternative fuel however without flexibility we will not know the answer those will have to maintain the status quo however we believe we must let the technology decide not the government to ensure that those hard use case be not abandon for those who may not be aware the government have already withdraw this si to correct drafting error all the opposition be ask be for they to do exactly the same amend the error bring back the change and allow the reduction in regulation without the restriction on alternative fuel that be not only the right approach but the fair one rise to make one very brief point the regulation amend the motor vehicles driving licences regulations to get drive licence one have to pass driving test have have lot of complaint from constituent as be sure have many right hon and hon member about the increase wait time for drive test have have extensive correspondence with loveday ryder the chief executive of the driver and vehicle standards agency but some of the reply have be very unsatisfactory will the minister go back to the department and look at what we can do to speed up drive test in particular by combat the bot that capture the test and sell they on for profit we be pleased that the provision maintain the ability of those with category drive licence to drive zero emission vehicle up to certain weight threshold as have be note the si also reduce the scope of eligible vehicle from alternatively fuel to zero emission alternatively fuel vehicle produce less carbon dioxide than petrol and diesel vehicle but they still produce as the vehicle do not therefore meet the cross party consensus that all new car and van should be zero emission by we support the restriction to zero emission vehicle however we again remind the government that more need to be do to ensure that ev charging infrastructure be in place it be no good for people to be able to drive electric vehicle if they be unable to charge they in addition to improve our ev charging infrastructure we support other incentive such as restore the plug in grant however at this point we need convincing not that we might not be convince that remove the five hour training requirement which be also contain within the si be good idea incentive should not come at the cost of reduce safety and if five hour training requirement be think necessary in would like the minister to explain why it be no long require with the leave of the house will respond briefly to the point that have be raise thank hon member for their consideration the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith say that he would be brief and get cheer but then go on for just little while to talk about his favourite subject of synthetically fuelled car we know he have one that be brief laughter think churchill famously say from this dispatch box that fanatic be someone who can not change their mind and will not change the subject say that really be be gentle there the intention of the si be to support the transition to zero emission vehicle the drive licence flexibility be therefore design to account for the additional weight of heavy battery in fully electric vehicle and some implementation of hydrogen fuel cell technology vehicle power by natural gas or biogas be not net zero get what the hon member for mid buckinghamshire be say about the single life cycle of the carbon but they be not subject to the standard category licence requirement mean that they can be drive if they weigh up to tonne the government estimate that there be currently few than such vehicle on the road fuel and synthetic fuel which know be the hon gentleman area of expertise and interest be not disadvantage by the standard category requirement which apply to petrol and diesel vehicle and be therefore not include in the si as have say synthetic fuel be already treat no differently in the drive licence regulation to their petrol or diesel counterpart and do not require the additional weight to achieve payload parity the instrument seek only to achieve parity with zero emission vehicle be not sure about the issue with drive licence raise by the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois who be no long in his place will undertake to write to he in closing this instrument while technical in nature represent common sense step that will support industry to make the switch to zero emission and decarbonise our road transport as we make progress to net zero it will cut transport cost for business reduce our greenhouse gas emission and far accelerate our progress to become the clean energy superpower that we so hope to be trust that the house have find this debate informative and will join in support the legislation commend the regulation to the house question put diane abbott jack abbott debbie abrahams zubir ahmed luke akehurst dan

williamson sammy wilson mike wood jeremy wright ben obese jecty jerome mayhew the house divide ayes noes question accordingly agree to whiplash injury compensation beg to move that the draft whiplash injury amendment regulations which be lay before this house on march be approve this draft instrument amend the fix tariff for whiplash compensation set by the whiplash injury regulations by apply an inflationary uplift to the tariff value in do so the amendment give effect to recommendation make by the lord chancellor on november follow the completion of her statutory review of the regulation by adjust the whiplash tariff value to account for inflation the government will ensure that claimant can continue to receive proportionate compensation until the next review in the whiplash reform programme change the way claimant be award damage for low value whiplash injury follow road traffic accident the aim of the reform be to ensure an efficient proportionate and reliable system for both claimant and defendant involve in road traffic accident relate whiplash claim at their core the measure aim to reduce the number and cost of whiplash injury and deliver saving to consumer via reduce motor insurance premium element of the reform programme be deliver by the civil liability act which introduce several important change to the civil claim process alongside measure that introduce legal definition of what constitute whiplash injury and ban the settling of such claim without medical evidence the act empower the lord chancellor to set fix tariff of damage for road traffic accident relate whiplash injury last up to two year the act measure be support by additional secondary legislative change to increase the small claim track for road traffic relate personal injury claim from to and the introduction of new pre action protocol for personal injury claim below the small claim limit in road traffic accident at the same time the insurance industry own and develop official injury claim portal be launch to assist claimant affect by the reform the first whiplash tariff be set by the whiplash injury regulations which come into force on may the act require the lord chancellor to review the regulation and thereby the whiplash tariff within three year of its implementation and every three year thereafter in fulfilment of that statutory obligation the first review of the whiplash tariff be complete on may and the lord chancellor publish her report of the statutory review on november upon review the regulation the lord chancellor conclude that the structure and component part of the whiplash tariff be effective however she recommend that the tariff amount be uprated to account for consumer price index inflation between and and to incorporate three year buffer to account for expected inflation until she do not consider that any other change to the regulation be necessary in reach her conclusion and recommendation the lord chancellor take into consideration relevant industry and court datum as well as information from ministry of justice call for evidence which run from february to april in accordance with the review this statutory instrument increase the whiplash tariff damage value and subject to approval by both houses the new tariff will apply to all road traffic accident relate personal injury claim in england and wales from may believe that the house will find it helpful if provide some additional explanation of the increase that will be apply to the whiplash tariff by way of background should say that the whiplash tariff operate via rise scale of fix compensation payment determine by injury duration up to maximum of two year the payment in the original whiplash tariff set in range from for whiplash injury last three month or less to for whiplash injury last between and month there be separate slightly high tariff for case where any minor psychological injury such as low level travel anxiety be incur at the same time as the whiplash injury claim for whiplash injury that last long than two year fall outside the fix tariff when the tariff be first implement in the amount be set to include three year buffer the buffer be design to account for expected inflation accord to the available forecast at that time and to ensure that claimant be not under compensate in the year between the tariff implementation and the first statutory review in review the regulation the lord chancellor recognise the impact of inflation on the whiplash tariff amount note that inflation over the first three year period run at high than expect rate and as most respondent to the call for evidence have note the real value of the tariff have fall in the light of this she conclude that the tariff should be uprate by actual inflation between and and should again include buffer to account for the expected inflation until the next review in the whiplash tariff will therefore be increase by around for claim arise from road traffic accident occur on or after may as have mention this increase have be calculate use the consumer price index inflationary measure after careful consideration of the available datum and evidence the lord chancellor determine that cpi remain the most appropriate measure for uprate the tariff amount by inflation in contrast she consider that the alternative retail price index measure if apply would likely overstate inflation it be worth note that the use of cpi be in line with common practice across government as recommend by the office for national statistics in accounting for inflation the lord chancellor also decide that the whiplash tariff should continue to be future proof by apply cpi round over three year from to this approach be consistent with the method use to protect claimant from additional inflationary impact when the first whiplash tariff be set in while this three year buffer could lead to some over compensation in the short term not implement it would allow the real value of claimant damage to decrease and risk significant under compensation in the long term therefore this buffer protect access to justice and minimise the risk of claimant be under compensate in the year lead up to would though like to acknowledge that some respondent to the call for evidence express concern that the buffer would artificially increase the amount of compensation available and potentially undermine cost saving however the difference in the tariff level use the buffer be not substantial enough to significantly impact on saving the tariff amount be only be adjust to account for inflation and as such it be our view that this do not represent real term increase in claim value conversely be aware that other stakeholder suggest that the whiplash tariff should either be subject to an annual review or be index link to inflation to ensure annual increase as the lord chancellor make clear in her report these argument be not compelling three year review period as anticipate by the act strike the right balance between adequately compensate claimant and maintain stable system that be as simple to understand and administer as possible it be also worth note that the recent high inflationary cycle be drive by unique set of circumstance and be not regularly occur event therefore while it be appropriate that the whiplash tariff be regularly review against inflation three year be the appropriate length of time to hold such review other than uprate the whiplash tariff to account for actual and expected inflation as have explain no other amendment to the regulation be make by this instrument in accordance with her statutory obligation the lord chancellor have consult the lady chief justice before make this instrument the master of the rolls act on behalf of the lady chief justice express his endorsement of the proposal to uprate the whiplash tariff he also note that the judiciary would not welcome any further derogation from the principle that damage be assess and award by the court as we have see in accordance with the power confer on the lord chancellor by the act the instrument only adjust the level of damage for whiplash injury last up to two year the amendment that this instrument will make to the regulation represent balanced proportionate and practical approach to uprate the whiplash tariff ahead of the next review call the shadow minister as the minister explain the government have conduct their statutory review of the whiplash injury regulations and determine that while the exist tariff structure remain appropriate an inflationary uplift be require the propose amendment will increase compensation for whiplash injury occur on or after may by to across all tariff band that adjustment account for inflation since and provide an additional buffer for expected inflation until the next statutory review in the framework of the tariff remain unchanged include the two tier structure for whiplash only and whiplash with minor psychological injury the requirement for single medical report to support claim and the option for discretionary uplift of up to in exceptional case the review process highlight challenge in determine prognosis due to inconsistency in medical reporting the ministry of justice have commit to work with the pre action protocol medical report provider medco to improve the clarity and quality of medical report and we welcome that commitment understand that the treasury be due to report later this month on whether insurer have in fact pass saving from these reform on to policyholder the primary or certainly an important aim of the policy original intention it be important that motorist receive the anticipated low premium we look forward to the finding of the review and it would be helpful if the minister confirm that it be on track furthermore while the statutory instrument be limit to amend tariff amount it form part of wide framework of reform to be review post implementation review of the whiplash reform programme be due to take place in and we welcome the opportunity to assess its effectiveness in deliver fair compensation and maintain access to justice we support the regulation and recognise their role in ensure that claimant continue to receive fair and proportionate compensation we look forward to the continued monitoring of the system to ensure that it remain balanced and effective give the extensive and thorough review of the regulation provide by the minister do not seek to comment any far call the liberal democrat spokesperson the change today be simple the compensation tariff for pain suffering and loss of amenity in whiplash claim be be uplift by approximately to reflect inflation since the original figure be set with buffer to account for future inflation these update be welcome but also present we with an opportunity to reflect on the broad balance we strike between tackle fraud and protect the right of those with legitimate injury whiplash have long be contentious area of uk personal injury law we have one of the high rate of whiplash claim in the world which have undoubtedly contribute to the rise in motor insurance cost and whiplash claim have historically add billion of pound to insurance cost in my constituency of chichester the picture be particularly concern accord to study by the driving instructors association chichester be now the most accident prone city in the uk report accident per resident which be high than the national average even more alarmingly chichester have the high fatality rate of any city at fatal accident per resident these be not just statistic they be life lose and family change forever that underline the real world impact of road safety and why fair accessible compensation for those injure on our road be vital the reform that introduce fix tariff and mandatory medical assessment have have an impact and the number of whiplash claim have decline but whiplash still account for large share of personal injury claim and the need to ensure fairness in the system remain we must remember that behind every claim be person often in pain unable to work potentially scared to go back out on the road and navigate an unfamiliar legal system for they the process must be simple fair and accessible victim should never be discourage from seek rightful compensation because of excessive bureaucracy or overly rigid procedure that be why the liberal democrats have consistently advocate for balanced approach during debate on the civil liability act my colleague in the other place lord sharkey and lord marks of henley on thames work hard to push for strong safeguard they argue that the definition of whiplash injury should be write into primary legislation to allow full parliamentary scrutiny and they push for compensation to be base on judicial college guideline not simply on fix tariff to preserve judicial discretion and to reflect the severity of injury they also urge the previous government to ensure that any saving make from reduce fraudulent claim be pass on to consumer through low insurance premium promise that the insurance industry have be slow to honour and which be certainly not reflect in the consumer experience we also look forward to the finding of the review on whether those saving have be deliver to customer we continue to support system that be firm on fraud but fair to victim yes we need robust safeguard such as mandatory medical assessment and close co ordination between regulator insurer and law enforcement to root out dishonest claim but that must not come at the expense of those with genuine injury it be critical that review mechanism be in place not just to track inflation but to assess whether the tariff system continue to serve justice we believe that the government must do more to simplify the claim process particularly for those who do not have or can not access legal representation the update tariff be necessary correction for inflation but it must not be see as the end of the matter the long term success of the system depend on three thing maintain fairness for claimant preserve judicial discretion where need and ensure that promise saving be feel by customer we must remain focused on people not just on policy thank hon member for their contribution to the debate and for the support of the liberal democrats and the official opposition on the direction of travel be grateful to the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for chichester jess brown fuller for remind we that behind every claim be person and that this be about help real people and real life the official opposition spokesman the hon member for bexhill and battle dr mullan rightly mention the report on reduce insurance cost for consumer we share his and the liberal democrat spokesperson concern about that which think be feel across the house the report be publish on march and show that the whiplash reform have reduce insurance cost for customer it be produce by his majesty treasury which work with the financial conduct authority to fulfil its statutory obligation under section of the civil liability act although it be factual reporting of the information from insurer provide to hmt through the financial conduct authority it do not represent the government view so it be right and proper that separately from the report the ministry of justice will undertake post implementation review of the whiplash reform later this year thank hon member for their contribution be sure hear the minister ask for the leave of the house at the beginning of his remark question put and agree to business without debate delegated legislation local government motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the draft cornwall council adult education functions regulations which be lay before this house on february be jones question agree to motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the draft east midlands combined county authority adult education functions regulations which be lay before this house on february be jones question agree to motion make and question put forthwith standing order no that the draft york and north yorkshire combined authority adult education functions order which be lay before this house on february be jones question agree to petition protection of the ceremonial county of rutland rutland be proud and ancient county record in the domesday book and with lord lieutenant since we have strong connection to the monarchy symbolise by the statue of her late majesty the queen in oakham which be build last year the first in britain since her pass however without legislative change to the lieutenancies act rutland will lose its ceremonial county status do not believe that the government intend to put our ceremonial county status at risk but the consequence of their reform to local government have do exactly that no other county be in this position despite our small size people have sign the petition in the last six week that be over of rutland population and more than one in six rutlander it be one of the big wet petition to be deliver to parliament in the century and hope that demonstrate to the government how strong the feeling be in our community and county rutland motto be multum in parvo much in little and we be ask for just little which would mean so very much to we the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to take into account the concern of the petitioner and protect rutland status as ceremonial county regardless of the outcome of local government re organisation and devolution follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the constituency of rutland and stamford declares that the government proposal for local government re organisation and devolution risk the status of rutland as ceremonial county and far declare that the early record of lord lieutenant in rutland be and that regardless of the outcome of local government re organisation the petitioner urge the government to ensure the protection of rutland ceremonial county status with the continuation of lord lieutenants and high sheriffs to serve as the monarch representative in rutland exclusively thereby protect the identity and pride of our community in our home the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to take into account the concern of the petitioner and protect rutland status as ceremonial county regardless of the outcome of local government re organisation and devolution and the petitioner remain etc petition retrospective charge by yorkshire water rise to present petition about retrospective charge that yorkshire water have unfairly give resident across my constituency due to the water company own mistake that come on top of rise bill record profit and excessive executive pay urge yorkshire water to think again to be reasonable and for once to put my constituent first the petition have now receive more than signature in little over week and the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to take into account the concern of petitioner and take immediate action to stop yorkshire water retrospectively charge resident follow be the full text of the petition the petition of resident of the constituency of rother valley declare that yorkshire water should cancel their retrospective charge to resident of which be not include in their last annual bill for april march far that in mistakenly not include this charge yorkshire water have put resident under further stress during cost of living crisis far that such mistake be particularly frustrating for resident give yorkshire water failure to properly invest in upgrade infrastructure the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to take into account the concern of petitioner and take immediate action to stop yorkshire water retrospectively charge resident and the petitioner remain etc petition paignton post office rise to present petition from the resident of torbay in respect of protect and save paignton post office which be vital part of paignton town centre resident across the whole of torbay value this resource and it have massive impact on community engagement and through the simple face to face engagement that many people get when they use the service but also as financial hub in the busy small town of paignton the petitioner call on the house of commons

that this house do now jones may start by thank the secretary of state the public will not necessarily know that it be very unusual for the secretary of state to respond to an adjournment debate and his presence here demonstrate how important this be and how seriously he take the task it also bring back fond memory for but that be another matter hope that every member of parliament elect to this house believe that uphold justice should be our first priority as parliament the right to life be the first among the right we should uphold that justice and that right should be even hand and there should be no exception for agent of the state believe that and accordingly be fierce critic of the state in for example the unlawful killing of jean charles de menezes the torture of binyam mohamed and the failure to protect and provide justice for the six catholics who be murder at loughinisland in there be no general exception when the state get it wrong justice must by definition be fair and practical and be afraid the finding of the northern ireland coroner on the clonoe incident be neither to understand the significance of this inquest ruling we must consider the context operation banner be the british army long deployment span from to more than soldier serve sequentially in northern ireland and despite immense challenge the british army perform admirably they be not beyond reproach bloody sunday be striking example fear but the massive majority of our soldier act with professionalism and restraint in the face of danger the trouble lead to death and injury more than of they be cause or bring about by paramilitary the british army rule of engagement be clear govern by the yellow card which soldier carry at all time soldier be require to issue challenge before use force unless do so would put they or other in immediate danger the intent be clear to protect innocent life while allow the use of lethal force when it be necessary and reasonable some member of the security force die in those trouble they kill approximately terrorist those figure and that ratio reveal the discipline and restraint of our soldier and our policeman act under yellow card rule they also reflect the personal risk to the soldier and policeman of observe those rule unsurprisingly the ira member never carry yellow card they target civilian and commit murder without warn their method range from torture follow by bullet in the back of the head through to the mass murder of innocent civilian in atrocity such as the omagh claudy and ballykelly bombing and the utterly cold blooded kingsmill execution incidentally the ira be responsible for more catholic death during the trouble than any other group the ira member be terrorist but we should not forget that they be also criminal specialise in organised crime they make million or million year from protection racket smuggling extortion drug tax fraud state benefit fraud fraudulent front company illegal gambling theft and other crime throughout the island of ireland if colleague want evidence of that criminality in carry out an investigation of those activity which be write up on november of that year in the financial times the point be that the ira be both criminal gang and terrorist organisation now it be try to rewrite history first commend the right hon gentleman on secure this debate he have be stalwart supporter of the armed force on every occasion in the time that have be in this house he have be supporter of what be right and of justice and he set standard for we all to follow commend he for that and thank he also thank he for work alongside my party leader my right hon friend the member for belfast east gavin robinson and the shadow secretary of state the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart on these issue and for move thing forward with this adjournment debate do the right hon gentleman agree that the message send through this coroner report be massive overstepping of power it will have security implication for every branch of police and the armed force in the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and it must be strike down as not only ultra vis but factually incorrect those who carry out the attack on the royal ulster constabulary station do so with the intent to take life and they be rightly assess as do that and deal with in an appropriate manner this republican rewriting of the truth must end now in this chamber the hon member be exactly right and he preface what intend to say he repeat the point that his party leader make in the urgent question when he say that the judgment be ultra vis believe the right hon gentleman be right in that although leave that to the lawyer to answer the rest of the question from the hon member for strangford jim shannon we have to return to the actual fact of the clonoe incident the self style east tyrone brigade be one of the most active provisional ira unit in the late and early it undertake surge of activity pursue maoist style murder strategy think it be call lynagh strategy at the time in august eight soldier be kill by provisional ira bomb at ballygawley on march two protestants be shoot dead at garage in coagh former member of the ulster defence regiment derek ferguson be murder in also at coagh an attack against glenanne barrack on may leave three soldier dead it be also think that some of their member be involve in the derryard attack in notably use heavy machine gun probably the dshk we will see later in this story to kill two british soldier in february the ruc special branch find out that the ira be plan number of attack on and february it have information that an ira team arm with mm soviet dshk heavy machine gun and three kalashnikov rifle would attack the coalisland police station the intelligence indicate that the attack would be mount from the clonoe chapel car park so the sas commander plan be to arrest the terrorist as they form up at the car park prevent the attack on the police station altogether and seize the heavy machine gun the commander do not know how many terrorist vehicle or weapon would be involve but it be think that as many as ira member could be involve the troop sergeant assess the rather straggly hedge line adjacent to the car park to be the only suitable position where partial concealment be possible but it notably do not provide cover from gunfire the sas team carry the standard heckler koch rifle and one soldier have general purpose machine gun perhaps more notably in this context some have shotgun load with alternate round design to smash windscreen and deliver tear gas to immobilise the driver and stop the vehicle the soldier also carry caltrop to wreck the tyre of vehicle attempt to escape the armour pierce round that the judge refer to could penetrate body armour but their primary purpose in this context be to penetrate the engine block of the vehicle and stop they the equipment be all design to stop escape and allow arrest that be the key point the plan be to close in on the ira operative and to arrest they as they assemble and mount the heavy machine gun on to the vehicle in the chapel car park at pm on that dark february night member of the sas be in position on the boundary of the clonoe chapel car park behind the hedgerow the soldier observe the movement of five car in and out of the car park they be assume to be reconnaissance vehicle scout out the car park for the lorry to which the dshk be to be attach however the intelligence briefing be wrong an error that end up create chaos and extreme danger instead at around hour the lorry mount dshk be use to attack the coalisland police station sixty round be fire at close range from the dshk and from the kalashnikovs as the hon member for strangford jim shannon say the attacker intent be clear to kill police officer they be all would be murderer of that there can be no doubt the gunfire could clearly be hear and the tracer bullet be observe by the sas patrol in the car park at clonoe after minute or two the soldier hear another burst of gunfire the soldier of course do not know that that be simply bravado for all they and their commander know hide behind their hedge the murder gang be engage other soldier or other policeman within minute the lorry appear out of the darkness drive at breakneck speed lurch around corner and with its engine scream in too low gear as it drive into the car park the ira truck headlight illuminate the sas position behind the hedgerow at that point the soldier do not know whether they have be spot the soldier then stand up advance on the occupant of the lorry and three other vehicle in the car park with the lorry and open fire four ira member be shoot dead four be wound one of whom be arrest at the scene and notably give first aid by the soldier and other flee in car now we come forward to february when mr justice michael humphreys rule that the use of lethal force by the sas in this incident be unlawful the ruling be demonstrably wrong and ignore the plain fact of the case the sas soldier operate under the control of the police force and the operation be carry out with police officer in close proximity they face heavily armed terrorist who have just carry out an attack on police station lethally for all they know they do not know how many terrorist there be but they assume that there could be up to they do not know how many vehicle there be or how many weapon be in the other car that create number of problem for issue challenge which be the first option under the yellow card system while it may be reasonable to stand up and issue challenge to either one terrorist or small number of terrorist who could be see and cover while they respond the circumstance be completely different when there be an unknown number of antagonist in an unknown number of car with an unknown number of weapon the probability of one of let we say decide to fire on the soldier be much high particularly when that individual may be out of sight of the patrol that be doubly so when one remember that this band of killer have just attempt to murder many policeman and have return in high state of excitement pump up with adrenalin and fire their weapon in the air secondly the fact that the sas commander do not know where they all be mean that his issue challenge could expose his entire troop to lethal crossfire remember this be happen on dark february night at about pm issue challenge under those circumstance could have amount to collective suicide circumstance such as that be precisely why the yellow card rule allow soldier to fire without challenge when the danger be too great find it hard to imagine more clearcut case that allow fire without challenge but in his ruling the judge ignore several significant fact and appear to have be naive in his view of other his selection of fact appear to be extremely partial for example the judge make much of the sas use of armour pierce bullet but he make no mention of the fact that the anti aircraft gun the ira be use fire armour pierce incendiary round five time the size of any rifle bullet or the fact that they could be fire at rate of to round minute those bullet can pierce concrete wall or shoot down aircraft at mile range the machine gun have just be deploy and could have eliminate the entire sas patrol in matter of second it be terrible weapon and capture it before it could be use to kill more people be an important part of the sas task the judge accept assertion that the ira weapon all have their safety catch engage frankly if that be true there be no way at all for the sas commander or the troop to know that at the beginning of the fight in fact how likely be that let we take the dshk which the forensic examiner say have its work part forward with no round in the chamber the gun be mount on lorry that have just be drive back at breakneck speed from coalisland in few minute during the few minute of that journey back get the gun into the state describe would have require nine action some of which require two hand while hang on to the side of lurch truck be afraid it all sound just bit improbable the forensic specialist do not actually arrive until two hour and minute after the action at scene contaminate by fireman police soldier and other staff indeed she complain about that very contamination against the forensic specialist view we must take the observation of soldier on the ground and other evidence four soldier report see flash from the back of the lorry which they interpret as muzzle flash we be not talk about inexperienced soldier they would know what they be look at two soldier hear round strike the ground to their right near the hedgerow where the sas be hide the forensic examiner document bullet strike mark on the hedgerow one soldier receive bullet wound to the face that knock he to the ground without any forensic evidence it be attribute to ricochet which implausibly would have require the round to go through change of direction soldier hear the exchange of gunfire and see soldier go down which confirm my belief that the terrorist be shoot at we there be also an interview take by the garda in the republic of ireland of one of the ira driver who say he could not understand why his colleague have open fire he have be in position in which he be able to judge where the fire be come from and obviously believe that it be from his own side he refuse to sign the interview note presumably when he consider the consequence for he back home of give away such critical datum all of this be counter by the claim that no bullet casing be find on the ground in the car park but number be find in the lorry and one of the car present appear to have have general purpose machine gun and an akm on board if those weapon be fire from inside car there would of course have be no casing on the ground in the car park instead gpmg live ammunition and disintegrate link be find in that car as well as an akm case from rifle other than those recover imply that fourth akm have be fire from the car the car have all its seat other than the driver lay flat which be standard practice for the ira when use hatchback as weapon platform the car escape and be then set on fire and the fire service be keep away from it while it burn out another standard ira tactic to destroy forensic evidence be afraid that this ruling expose the double standard that have plague the legacy of the trouble my right hon friend be give an important and tell speech on very important topic as he rightly say these soldier be subject to well define rule of engagement he have describe the ira as terrorist organisation but what he have not say be that at the time it be the most sophisticated terrorist organisation in the world the soldier he talk about be operate under order in chain of command and on the queen business and could not respond do my right hon friend agree that there be grotesque double standard here and that not only be this an injustice but the government position be potentially deeply corrosive of morale as well as deeply unjust to the veteran my right hon friend make very good point of course he be the member for hereford so many of the people who have retire and will face these threat will be his constituent he and be long stand supporter of human right in this country and have both defend article for example but this case be misuse of article the people who write the european convention on human right be recently out of the second world war they do not write it to be interpret in this way he have make double point return to my right hon friend point about the ira since the event in question the good friday agreement have allow for the release of convict terrorist in order to achieve an end to the bloodshed guess we all agree with that yet we continue to persecute those who fight against the terrorist these persecution be conduct decade after the fact without any new evidence be present to give reason for the reopening of case after the action everybody involve be question thoroughly to establish the fact what the intelligence be what the arrest plan be and what happen on the basis of that questioning on october with the evidence close to hand and the event fresh in the witness mind and when investigation of everything be possible the police and the director of public prosecutions for northern ireland conclude that there should be no prosecution of the soldier there be no case to answer be grateful to my right hon friend for bring this debate before the house and for the quality of his exposition do he agree that this case highlight the single big problem that we face which be that the ira keep no record at all and if it do have any it destroy they many ira member get letter of comfort from the then government quietly and secretly which end up kill any chance of prosecution soldier who serve have none of that they be leave out in the open and can be prosecute while many ira member have disappear and can live life without further charge my right hon and gallant friend make the central point of the argument perfectly here we be year later with northern ireland coroner judge event in retrospect without any new evidence and find that soldier act unlawfully that be entirely at odd with the result of the legal investigation immediately after the operation in believe in process of peace and reconciliation that allow closure for all the relative of the dead but he make good point there be no record and that go for the vast majority of the people who die in the trouble that make this process not of peace and reconciliation but of vindictiveness and vengeance it be an attempt to rewrite history not find the truth there have be countless attempt to take british soldier to court for their action during the trouble but how many ex ira combatant have face the same thing not one not single ira member have be pursue over the death all murder for which the ira be responsible our veteran be be punish in their retirement year for decision they make when serve their country the psychological impact on they and on soldier serve today be enormous the ruling also undermine the integrity of present and future operation we can not send soldier into high risk environment ask they to undertake brutal training and expect they to operate with confidence if they fear be condemn decade later the ruling on the clonoe incident risk further persecution of the british soldier who serve during the trouble the government must ensure that those who serve our country today be protect from such partisan distortion of justice our soldier deserve well what we be see with the clonoe ruling be historical revisionism that seek to punish those who serve our country in the most difficult and dangerous circumstance the law must be apply fairly and we must not allow politic to undermine the legacy of those who fight to protect our freedom the government say this directly to the secretary of state give notice at the time of the election that they intend to remove the element of the northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act that protect soldier and police who serve during the trouble from prosecution the judgment from the northern ireland coroner on the clonoe incident expose number of soldier to potential prosecution the ministry of defence be quite properly seek judicial review of this inquiry but even if it win we must put in place statutory protection for our soldier now and in the future from this persecution these be man who serve their country with honour heroism and skill sometimes in the face of the most incredible danger they be now no doubt hop for well earn peaceful retirement not future of endless stress and psychological torture if the government leave they open to persecution it will be shameful and will serve only to further the ira attempt to rewrite the history of northern ireland many member may have receive letter on this issue from retired special air service soldier most of they say in those letter that they support human right but they do more than that they guarantee those right for the rest of we let end by quote the word of charles province the american soldier and poet it be the soldier not the reporter who have give we the freedom of the press it be the soldier not the poet who have give we the freedom of speech it be the soldier not the peace camp organiser who have give we the freedom to demonstrate it be the soldier who serve beneath the flag whose coffin be drape by the flag who allow the protestor to burn the flag it be the soldier not the politician who have give these freedom these soldier be the guarantor of our security our freedom and our justice say to the secretary of state surely we owe they no less than security freedom and justice in return as we have little more time than expect want to say few word in support of my right hon friend the member for goole and pocklington david davis serve in northern ireland as many other do during the trouble we do not ask to go there we be send there and we be give real restriction through the yellow card on how we be allow to behave in fact all the soldier with whom serve be so fearful of loose off their rifle at any stage that they would probably have err on the side of bring themselves into danger because they be so certain that they must not make mistake not single soldier ever meet think that this be some kind of game to be play it be life and death issue and all those whom my right hon friend have describe be fully aware of what be require of they under the yellow card provision they would not have loose off their weapon have they not genuinely fear for their life give the case that have go before and the death that happen the ira do not give any warning before they fire those issue be critical in all this and when we sit in judgment over what happen then all these year later it be not justice it become pursuit by those who as my right hon friend say want to change the history we give away lot in the good friday agreement and many of those who lose family member we will all remember various individual have to put up with this requirement so that we could get peace it take lot to get peace and it take lot of suffering thereafter to find out what happen in many case in which soldier serve bravely and die there be question to be answer about the manner of their death think of robert nairac and make no apology for raise his name again he be capture by the ira torture beat and kill no one know where his body lie his parent die not know what happen to he we do not know whether he have proper burial we certainly know that his parent be dead but we will never find out what happen to he and many other like he they serve their country because they believe as my right hon friend say in uphold justice and freedom put it to the secretary of state that the key to this whole debate be our duty to protect those who put their life on the line to protect our freedom and our justice and our duty to make sure that thing be fair if we forget about they for just one moment we be not worthy of be here for they do not have voice and can not say no when they be order into situation where they could die only the british army could have do what we do in northern ireland we put up with so much and restrain ourselves with such dignity urge the minister to listen carefully to my right hon friend and to ensure justice for those who fear pursuit for only one reason political purpose it be time to end this really welcome the opportunity that the right hon member for goole and pocklington david davis have give and the house to listen to this debate and welcome the opportunity to respond congratulate he on secure it listen very carefully to everything that he say as he will know on february he ask an urgent question about the finding of the coroner in the clonoe inquest in answer to that question tell he and the house that the ministry of defence be consider the coroner finding carefully before turn to the outcome of those consideration it be worth remind the house of the fact of the case which we have hear lot about already on february there be an attack on coalisland police station by unit of the provisional irish republican army arm with lot of weaponry include heavy machine gun approximately round be fire but thankfully no one be injure follow its departure and subsequent arrival at the clonoe church car park the unit be engage by member of the army specialist military unit result in four pira gunman be shoot and kill as we know the inquest into their death begin in on february this year the coroner find that the use of lethal force by the soldier be unjustified and that the operation be not plan and control in such way as to minimise to the great extent possible the need for recourse to lethal force listen very carefully to what the house say when answer the urgent question follow careful consideration the ministry of defence have write to the coroner to outline its intention of apply for judicial review in its view the finding of the coroner do not properly reflect the context of the incident listen very carefully to what the right hon gentleman say about what happen or the challenging circumstance in which member of the armed force serve in northern ireland the ministry of defence have also confirm that it be fund the veteran in question to seek judicial review and it be continue to provide they with welfare support the independence of the judiciary be fundamental democratic principle and it be crucial to uphold the rule of law in the united kingdom one important element of that principle be the right to legally challenge the finding of judicial decision maker where it be believe that an error have be make and the government have determine on this occasion that that be indeed the most appropriate course of action it be now important as think the house will recognise give the confirmation by the ministry of defence that it intend to seek judicial review of the finding of the inquest that these proceeding be allow to run their course this government have long stand commitment to repeal and replace the almost universally opposed northern ireland troubles legacy and reconciliation act think it be fair to say that among the political party in northern ireland it be universally opposed the act have be find by the domestic court to be unlawful in number of respect and we should not forget that the legislation in question make provision to grant those responsible for terrible terrorist crime immunity from prosecution that be what the act do as part of our commitment to repeal and replace the act the government be commit to propose measure to allow inquest previously halt by that legislation to proceed set out this position in my write ministerial statement of july and october and in my oral statement to the house on december the government recognise that the clonoe finding have cause great concern among many of those who serve in northern ireland during operation banner and we have hear tonight from some who have give distinguished service to the armed force and also to this house the veteran have meet include group meet this afternoon have also express strong view that the way in which we collectively address the legacy of the trouble have to be fair balanced and proportionate could the secretary of state not simply say now to the house that he have deep understanding and awareness of the trauma that have be cause and that he take the side not judicially but politically in his own mind as matter of human sympathy with the poor people affect by these decision and how they be play out in the public realm could he not say that now so that veteran and their family understand that government minister in senior position get it and be on their side in his own mind even if not judicially express that view to the veteran meet this afternoon when thank they for their service in the most difficult and dangerous circumstance the right hon member invite to do that this evening and readily do it because they be seek to protect the citizen of the united kingdom include of northern ireland in the face of terrorism and terrorist as the right hon member for goole and pocklington point out in his speech the terrorist be responsible for the vast majority of death however would add that many of they be prosecute and convict paramilitary on the republican side and also those on the loyalist side who be also guilty of the most appalling crime as be point out part of the price in my view rightly pay to enable the good friday agreement to succeed and to bring the extraordinary peace and prosperity northern ireland have see in the almost year since be the release of prisoner which be really really difficult for many family to accept to understand and to cope with would also point out that in recent year number of republicans have indeed be prosecute in fact more republican have be think be right in say that there have be one conviction in the last year of soldier who serve there and that be suspend sentence the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith mention the case of robert nairac the right hon gentleman will be aware that the independent commission for the location of victims remain which do such an important job to try to reunite the remain of love one who be murder by the provisional ira with their family although robert nairac parent be dead think he have other live relative have make two recent attempt to find his remain on the basis of information it have receive be very sad to say that so far that have not prove possible but hope that those who have information and who have enable the iclvr to find the remain of number of people and return they to their family will continue to provide information to that body so that it be able to recover those remain as the secretary of state it be my job to ensure that these concern and perspective be hear alongside other view express by range of party who also want to see in their own way resolution to the complex trouble that happen and the issue that remain outstanding be think in particular of the many family have meet since take up the post who have say to we still do not know decade later what happen to our love one who be kill they carry that trauma with they to this day therefore the government be absolutely committed to try to develop legacy mechanism that be compliant with human right stand with the right hon member for goole and pocklington in my support and the government support for the european convention on human right and that can command degree of public confidence across community in northern ireland and great britain will just say this about the approach the previous government take it cause self evidently immense difficulty include numerous finding of human right incompatibility and therefore an erosion of trust in the government ability to address these issue fairly may remind the secretary of state that at hearing in the defence committee take evidence from four distinguished professor of law include philippe sands with whose work he be no doubt very familiar and they make it very clear to we that in principle there be nothing illegal about have statute of limitation provide that it be accompany by truth recovery process that meet the requirement of avoid the otherwise illegal act of give impunity for crime commit the secretary of state say that there be technical problem with the previous legislation that render it in some respect illegal but will he not accept that the persecution of elderly veteran which can not in the end lead to anyone spend more than two year in prison anyway give the northern ireland sentences act will continue unless and until some form of legislation be put back in place to draw line under prosecution and to fulfil the other part of the requirement by truth recovery process whatever he think about the specific legislation they be repeal will he not accept the principle that that be the only way to protect people against this form of legalistic persecution would say to the right hon gentleman first of all that there be not technical problem with the legacy act there be many legal problem with the legacy act it be the government position and think it be the position of the right hon member for goole and pocklington that we uphold the european convention on human right have say from the beginning that be determined to ensure that the legacy mechanism in the form that they be bring before the house be compliant with the european convention on human right there be plenty of example of other people in other country who do not abide by the european convention in my view it be very important foundation of our liberty and our protection there be legal problem with the legacy act not technicality if may say so also point out to the right hon gentleman that the idea of immunity from prosecution be also opposed have meet one family of soldier who be murder by the ira who be outrage by the idea that his killer should get immunity under the legislation the previous government pass be very sorry but that answer do not address the question of principle the fact be that unless the secretary of state chum professor sands and three other equally distinguished professor of law be mistaken there be no reason in principle regardless of how flawed he and the court even may think the previous legislation be that we can not have statute of limitation to put an end to these prosecution couple with truth recovery process of course it will always be possible to find someone who want the other lot prosecute but not their lot but it be the job of government to cut through that and do the right thing as nelson mandela do so effectively in south africa be not familiar with that particular bit of evidence the right hon gentleman cite one group of lawyer who hold one view but it will not surprise the house if say that it would be possible to find another group of lawyer who hold different view the purpose of the court be to adjudicate between the various argument that be put and reach decision and we respect the judgment of the court it be not possible to have legal system or coronial system where we get all the verdict we like and we be guarantee to never get verdict we do not like the fact be interruption we have appeal some aspect of the judgment the government come into office commit to remove conditional immunity because we think it be wrong to give terrorist immunity from prosecution for the crime they have commit would also say to the right hon gentleman that the truth be that the prospect of prosecution be diminish with each pass year many of the family that have meet recognise that no one be go to be hold to account for what happen to their love one they just want to find the answer one point the secretary of state have not yet come to be that there be an excruciating element of double jeopardy here every single case we be talk about be investigate carefully by the police at the time the soldier and the commander involve be interrogate as to the intelligence the plan and the outcome at the time with all the information available what we be see here be that soldier be effectively find innocent year ago only for we to come back and do it all over again to get another answer that we want he must understand that the soldier see this as terrible double jeopardy may bring the secretary of state to the underlie principle of the point make by my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis what we be all after be mechanism however that be find through the law that will allow we to release these soldier from lifetime sentence of be pursue by the court under what be in my view frankly misuse of article if it be true that as my right hon friend say people like philippe sands hardly hard line right winger think that we can do this will the secretary of state give the house an undertaking that he will make every effort to deliver on that aim would like to give the right hon gentleman an assurance that when parliamentary time allow plan to bring forward legislation to try to find way forward the house will be the judge when the legislation be publish be consult widely on it and will continue to do so include with veteran and other be not naive about the prospect of come up with proposal that command widespread support but would simply observe that the last set of proposal signally fail to command support among the political party and many people in northern ireland that be why be have to deal with the consequence of repeat finding of incompatibility because of that legacy legislation with the european convention on human right when last stand at the dispatch box to address this question say that we owe great debt of attitude to those who serve in operation banner with such distinction wish to repeat that statement tonight the true legacy of those who serve during that awful period be to be find in the peace that the people of northern ireland now enjoy if we be be honest the armed force do their job the good friday agreement be itself not able to get to grip with exactly how legacy would be deal with those involve have enough on their plate to secure that extraordinary agreement on that miraculous good friday we as elect representative have to recognise that since the signing of the good friday agreement we have not be able to agree and implement measure that effectively address the legacy of the past in way that be balanced proportionate transparent fair and equitable and that have chance of command measure of public support that be the objective of the government will do my good to achieve it but the house will be the judge question put and agree to house adjourn deferred division energy conservation that the draft ecodesign for energy relate products and energy information amendment northern ireland regulations which be lay before this house on march be approve jack abbott zubir ahmed luke akehurst
