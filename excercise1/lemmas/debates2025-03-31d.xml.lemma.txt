proposition that the hon member have make all ministers of course include the prime minister take these matter incredibly seriously and we always engage in the most responsible way when the defend democracy taskforce be establish it be proclaim that its primary focus be to protect the democratic integrity of the united kingdom what work therefore have it do on the fact that there be part of this united kingdom namely northern ireland where the democratic integrity of the united kingdom have be upend by the fact that in area of law our law be make not by this parliament and not by the stormont assembly but by foreign parliament the european union what work have be do to restore democratic integrity to the united kingdom in respect of northern ireland give the hon and learn member an absolute assurance that we work closely with all the devolve government on this matter in fact be in northern ireland just recently to discuss this with the justice minister the work that we be conduct as part of the taskforce be cross party and design to ensure that we do everything we possibly can to prevent interference in our democratic process we take the matter seriously and we will work with other on it call the shadow minister realise that my hon friend the member for west suffolk nick timothy be unable to get meaningful answer but with islamist extremism behind three quarter of caseload it be essential to shield our democracy from its pressure the minister have repeatedly reiterate the government non engagement policy with the muslim council of britain despite government minister attend its annual dinner more recently there have be concern about attendee at government event who have publicly express some frightening view will the minister assure the house that the

that we will tackle extremism wherever we find it the government take these matter incredibly seriously we will never allow they to be use as political football we will address these matter and tackle they head on shoplift what step her department be take to tackle shoplifting what step her department be take to tackle shoplifting in the last year of the previous government shop theft reach record high with devastating consequence for our high street and town centre the conservative party write that off as low level crime but the labour government be determined to take back our street from thug and thief that be why we be end the effective immunity for shop theft of good under introduce new offence of assault shop worker and deliver new neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer in community across the country many retailer in bournemouth town centre and across my constituency have tell that the same people over and over again be responsible for shoplift and put their staff safety at risk good progress have be make locally with dorset police operation shopkeeper and the town centre business improvement district use of the uk partner against crime system but what more can be do to tackle repeat offender and to learn the lesson from successful initiative such as those in my constituency thank my hon friend for bring to the house attention the excellent initiative take place in bournemouth it be real example of the result that can be achieve when we get local authority business and law enforcement all come together be keen to look carefully at example such as that of bournemouth and what be happen in the town centre to see how we can learn from such good practice and they can be disseminate may thank the minister for her early answer across my constituency from the co op in dartford to the subway on the high street and pet garden supplies on colney road hear the same frustrating tale from business owner and shopworker about how powerless they feel to tackle shoplift the measure contain in the crime and policing bill to tackle that problem have just be set out and they can not come soon enough will the minister bring hope to people across the dartford constituency that we will turn the tide on shoplifting after it be clearly deprioritise by the conservative party again my hon friend be absolutely right when the conservative party leave office shop theft be at record level up in the space of two year the shadow home secretary the right hon member for croydon south chris philp now say zero tolerance on shop theft even in case where less than worth of good have be steal yet in the two year that he be the police and crime minister he leave that limit in place allow thief to escape with impunity and in the absence of any police say that people should make their own citizen arrest while shop theft soar all he have to say to the public be basically that they be on their own and should sort it out themselves many of my constituent be exasperate by the fact that the police be unable to turn up when there be shoplift or burglary yet they be able to send six officer to get themselves involve in dispute with local school and to warn off local elect representative from get involve sadly that misallocation of resource and unwarranted police overreach be not an isolated example may urge the minister to avoid engage in political point scoring and instead join in send very clear message from both side of this house that our expectation be that the police should be focus on solve real crime and stay out of legitimate free expression and democratic debate think it be fair to say that the prime minister and the home secretary have be very clear about the priority of this government for tackle crime through our safe street mission we want to halve violence against woman and girl over the course of the next decade we want to halve knife crime over the course of the next decade we will deliver the neighbourhood police officer back into our community that be decimate under the previous government the priority of this government be very clear in tackle crime and policing my constituent live just metre from the tesco express store in eastbourne where she work she do not feel safe leaving as result of the retail crime there and so get taxi back home in the evening will the minister explain not just what the government can do to help protect shop worker like my constituent but what can big business such as tesco do to well protect the employee who do such an important role for they and for their community the hon gentleman make an important point clearly legislation have be bring forward to protect retail worker from assault however good employer will want to ensure their staff be well look after if there be issue about leave work and need to take taxi be sure that good employer would want to address that and support those retail worker call the shadow minister as my right hon friend the member for hertsmere sir oliver dowden have outline this weekend we hear the shocking report that the parent of nine year old girl be arrest by six hertfordshire police officer and place in cell for hour because they complain about their daughter primary school on whatsapp at the same time shoplifting case have be close without suspect be identify do the minister agree that the police should be able to get on with the job of tackle crime on our street can she comment on whether they be get their priority right in that case as the shadow minister will know this be an operational matter for police and it be quite clear that the chief constable and the police and crime commissioner have set out that there will be review of what happen in that particular case violence against shop workers what step her department be take to tackle violence against shop worker to repeat what be say under the previous government violence and abuse towards retail worker increase to unacceptable level everyone have right to feel safe at their place of work alongside the union of shop distributive and allied workers and the co op who have long campaign for strong protection for retail worker we be bring in through the crime and policing bill new offence of assault retail worker to protect those hard work and dedicated staff who work in store and to send really strong message that violence against retail worker will not be tolerate on friday visit the central co op in ashbourne which recently experience an armed robbery elizabeth and georgia be work there when the robbery take place and be still deeply affect several month later what action be the government take to stop violence against shop worker especially in rural area where the geographical distance involve often mean that the police take long to respond thank my hon friend for bring that shocking case to the attention of the house all our thought will be with elizabeth and georgia after what they have be through also want to applaud the co op for the lead role that it have play in help we to develop this new offence of assault against shop worker to ensure that it be not just armed robbery against its staff that will be punish but the act of violence and intimidation that far too many shop worker find happen on daily basis on the issue of serious crime in rural area our neighbourhood policing guarantee will deliver thousand of neighbourhood police community support officer across england and wales include in rural area to speed up response time build up public confidence and ensure that for those violent criminal who commit act such as armed robbery there will be no hiding place from the law in ashford and staines in my constituency we have real plague of shoplifting and antisocial behaviour inspector matthew walton of the north division be do great job with his team to tackle it in combination with the community and the retailer but still the problem be get bad after the success of the facial recognition software roll out in croydon will minister please consider extend it to spelthorne because it would be welcome addition to police in my area as an operational matter live facial recognition be something for the police to use as they deem fit but from my experience of it be use in croydon can see the benefit to police it seem to be very effective tool that police force should have in their armoury off road bike what step her department be take to tackle the antisocial use of off road bike many of we will know from our constituency the havoc that can be cause in community by the dangerous and deafen antisocial use of off road bike that be why this government be give the police strong power to swiftly seize those bike and other vehicle where they be be drive antisocially through local estate and town centre as part of our mission to crack down on antisocial behaviour and make our street safe people across lichfield burntwood and the surround village in my constituency and be sure across the country be sick and tired of off road bike be use inappropriately antisocially and dangerously on our street the bad example have see be somebody do wheelie on quad bike at mph on eastern avenue in lichfield report that to the police and they be follow it up as well they can but they tell that they need the new power in the bill can the secretary of state reassure my constituent and the rest of the country that this government will continue to crack down on this problem and will not rest until our street be safe for all road user agree with my hon friend and be sorry to hear about the appalling incident he describe this be challenge for we in many of our constituency my constituent in airedale and chequerfield see the total nightmare of off road bike be drive deliberately to harass people if we have to wait for the police to give multiple warning they can not take the swift action need which be why we need the change in the bill my constituent peter from corfe mullen have have numerous run in with scooter and off road bike what consideration be the home secretary give to the redefinition of electric bike so that it be genuinely an electric bike the hon member be right that there be many different form and change to the kind of vehicle bike and scooter be use the legislation apply not just to off road bike but more widely to vehicle be use antisocially that be important because the police need to be able to act swiftly and not end up have to try to chase and catch the same people again and again to take action antisocial behaviour be significant concern to my constituent especially the nuisance cause by off road bike and scooter last friday local officer specifically tell that they do not feel they have the power to pursue the rider of these bike when they be in their patrol car with rider often taunt and even laugh at they because they know they can not easily be catch what step be the government take to ensure that my local officer in mansfield have the specific power they need to stop those bike and bring those terrorise our community to justice my hon friend be right and people in mansfield should not be terrorise by deliberate harassment by people on off road bike that be why we be strengthen the law through the crime and policing bill but it be also why we support the work that some police force be do for example the work have see in staffordshire where they be use drone to follow those on off road bike and make swift seizure or arrest at the weekend be speak to resident of braunstone town and many particularly the elderly be frighten by the use of off road bike and similar vehicle give the noise they make and the risk to pedestrian will the secretary of state assure that the government be take the matter seriously and that they will empower local police force to bring those drive the bike to justice the hon member make an important point often particularly for old people the way in which the bike be use be just dangerous the deliberate ramp up of the noise to intimidate and scare people be disgraceful antisocial behaviour that be why we be increase police power and why we want to work with police on thing like the drone use and other measure to tackle antisocial behaviour mobile phone theft what step her department be take to tackle mobile phone theft street theft increase by more than in the last year of the previous government largely due to soar rate of snatch theft involve mobile phone there be clear evidence of organise criminality in those crime this be not just about petty criminal and opportunist that be why the home secretary recently convene mobile phone theft summit with tech company police leader and the national crime agency and why our crime and policing bill include new power enable police to enter premise identify by electronic mapping if steal item be believe to be there mobile phone theft be widespread concern in my constituency between and the spate of mobile phone theft have rise by can my hon friend reassure my constituent that this government will take all step to ensure their safety can give my hon friend that reassurance our recent mobile phone theft summit result in clear commitment from attendee to work in collaboration to tackle mobile phone theft and the organise criminality drive it that be also why our crime and policing bill will give police the power where it be not practical to wait for warrant to enter and search premise where steal mobile phone be believe to be the rise number of mobile phone theft have cause great concern among many of my constituent by the way be not technically minded know very little about how my mobile phone work but many people have everything on their phone their bank detail be on that phone their life be on that phone if their phone be steal they be in big trouble how will we restore confidence in the general public on mobile phone and have all our detail on they think it be worth reflect on the impressive result we have see in recent month from the metropolitan police in their work to intensify action on mobile phone theft the hon gentleman be right this be an important subject and we need to see that kind of activity around the country include in northern ireland rural crime what step she be take to help tackle rural crime the government be commit to tackle rural crime and safeguard rural area through tough measure to clamp down on antisocial behaviour fly tipping and the theft of agricultural equipment alongside our neighbourhood policing guarantee we be also provide funding to the national rural and wildlife crime unit to ensure their valuable work can continue crime rate in rural area have surge by since compare with for urban area with total rise of almost report offence rural crime in my constituency include theft of agricultural machinery livestock and fuel the area remote location make it vulnerable to such crime which impact on local farmer and resident what be the government do to ensure that rural crime get the attention that it deserve thank my hon friend for raise that vital issue just last month hold rural crime roundtable in north yorkshire and meet local resident and farmer to discuss this important topic last week in recognition of the success of the national rural and wildlife crime unit announce additional funding for both in the next financial year so that they can continue to support the police in rural area we be also work with the national police chiefs council on the next iteration of the rural and wildlife crime strategy later this year we will implement the equipment theft prevention act and put the necessary secondary legislation in place ahead of that we will publish the government response to the call for evidence on the scope of that legislation one of the less widely recognise rural crime be the use of catapult to maim and kill wildlife those weapon be also use in urban setting know that the home office take the view that the wildlife protection legislation and the police power ought to be adequate to deal with that but at the moment they patently be not will the minister consider review that and possibly amend the crime and policing bill to take account of it be always happy to review legislation and ensure that it be fit for purpose would be very happy to discuss that far with the right hon gentleman live facial recognition what her policy be on the use of live facial recognition technology by police force thank the right hon member for his interest in this subject and for the westminster hall debate that he secure last year want to support the police to use live facial recognition safely while balance public safety and safeguard individual right the home office invest over million in to develop small national live facial recognition capability by purchase and equip mobile lfr unit for deployment later this year have be listen to stakeholder and will outline our plan in the come month although recognise that the use of facial recognition technology can lead to more offender be catch do the minister accept that deployment of permanent network of fix camera across croydon represent significant escalation in their use which make it all the more important that clear legislative framework govern their use be debate and approve by parliament fully accept that there be need to consider live facial recognition at the moment the law govern the use of that technology come from various different thing human right and equality legislation and other measure and we want to see whether that should be bring together that be why have be have series of meeting over the last few month as say we will set out our plan for live facial recognition in the come month harlow police department recent successful trial of facial recognition have lead to some arrest do the minister agree that technology can play vital part in tackle crime but can not be substitute for neighbourhood police yes agree with my hon friend that be why we have commit to neighbourhood policing and additional police officer and pcso on all our high street and in community up and down the land asylum policy refugee convention whether she have receive legal advice on the compatibility of recent change to her department guidance entitle good character caseworker guidance update on february with the refugee convention the hon member will know that we take our international obligation very seriously we be satisfied that the good character policy be compliant with those obligation we have strengthen our policy to make it clear that anyone who enter the uk illegally include small boat arrival will normally be refuse british citizenship the good character assessment have be feature of uk immigration law since and there have never be any suggestion either now or in the past that it be inconsistent with our obligation under the refugee convention or any other treaty one of the most shocking and egregious thing this government have do be impose blanket ban on british citizenship for all individual who have enter the uk irregularly without any parliamentary scrutiny or public consultation effectively disenfranchise all asylum seeker and refugee include those who have make this country their home for year the refugee council estimate that up to refugee who have already be grant asylum could now be block from secure naturalisation the minister know that there be no safe route to get to the uk so nearly all asylum seeker have to arrive irregularly surely the policy clearly breach article of the refugee convention which prohibit penalise those seek protection for their mode of entry interruption order all member should be respectful and mindful of their language at all time now we need to hear the minister respond thank the hon member for his question he will know that we explain when make the change that each citizenship application will continue to be consider on case by case basis and that the secretary of state may choose to apply discretion to grant citizenship on an exceptional basis where there have be particularly exceptional or mitigate circumstance such as modern slavery people smuggle what step she be take to help tackle people smuggle the government be today play host to law enforcement counterpart from across the globe to discuss our joint response to organise immigration crime the uk be not only host that summit but lead the way in its response to this appalling evil trade include through new power introduce in the border security asylum and immigration bill which note the conservative party vote against thank the minister for that response and welcome the increase co operation with ally on this vital issue it be critical that we stop the dangerous crossing but without tackle the problem at its source with aid to tackle famine and conflict and by provide safe legal route do we not risk the crisis continue how will the minister work with colleague across government to address those factor to ensure that we tackle the crisis fully the summit be deal with source country we be look at how we can co operate with country all the way along the route use by smuggle gang to ensure that the right message rather than very slick organise immigration gang advertising be convey people smuggler do not just put the immigration system in jeopardy they exploit the vulnerable and they put life in danger there be nothing progressive about allow the vulnerable to be exploit by these smuggler do the minister agree that we should be strain every sinew to crack down on these gang and can she update we on her meeting today on this topic agree strongly with my hon friend and that be why today immigration summit where country will be co operate and attend be such an important event today we also announce that since we come into government we have return more than people who have no right to be here we have also tighten up the illegal working regulation to make certain that they apply across the board to the gig economy and to casual worker too since the labour government come to power more than people have enter our country illegally the prime minister say he be very angry about that but he be not as angry as the british taxpayer who have to fork out billion year to keep those illegal invader in our country do the minister agree that anybody arrive here illegally should be detain and deport we have duty to ensure that those arrive on our shore who claim asylum be properly process the conservatives prevent themselves from do that by become obsess with the rwanda scheme and they leave we with huge backlog we will speed up immigration processing so that we can deal with those people protect those who have right to be here and send back those who have fail hope that the hon gentleman will welcome the steep increase in return and removal that have just announce do my hon friend agree that it be not gimmick such as rwanda but international co operation that will fundamentally deal with the illegal gang who be facilitate crossing be that not why we should welcome today summit at which people be come together to co operate and to tackle those gang my hon friend be exactly right these criminal be cross national very sophisticated and operate across border in order to respond properly we have to do the same and that be what today summit be help we to co ordinate police forces gloucestershire what step her department be take to support police force in gloucestershire total funding for gloucestershire police for will be up to million which be an increase of up to million on last year and include million to kick start the recruitment of additional neighbourhood police officer and police community support officer in gloucestershire to get those bobby back on the beat in our local community thank the minister for her response in baroness may of maidenhead the then home secretary accuse police force of cry wolf over funding cut in the decade since police service across the country such as mine in gloucestershire have never truly recover from her scandalous cut to their number gloucestershire constabulary be one of the worst fund in the country the victim of an unfit for purpose funding formula last week the chief constable announce staff cut as she battle with million deficit will the minister meet and my chief constable to discuss those challenge yes of course will call the liberal democrat spokesperson as the minister have say get more bobby on the beat in gloucestershire and across the country be crucial to deliver the frontline police that our community deserve but recent freedom of information

their mental health but too many report be leave without enough support what plan do the minister have to ensure that mental health support be good enough in the police that be one of the way to get officer fit for return to work more quickly to be part of restore the proper community police that our community deserve the hon lady raise very important point about the wellbeing of police officer

favour and they respond to the crime they face across the country and to the perpetrator of those crime whosoever they should be and wheresoever they be that be the right approach for the police to take whether they be deal with the most serious violence which we have prioritise or with neighbourhood crime in community as the shadow home secretary will know from the approach we be take to the sentencing council and the importance of we bring forward rapid emergency legislation in that area we be very clear that there can be no preferential treatment for anyone in the criminal justice

exactly the same regardless of their race or identity agree with the home secretary about all of that but unfortunately the anti racism commitment publish last week do not say that in fact it say the

certainly willing to hear representation on that follow the grip storyline of adolescence and the rise of incel culture contribute to youth crime what specific measure be the home office implement to address the root cause and create safe and more supportive environment for our young people my hon friend be right to mention the television programme adolescence which many people will have see and the issue of rise violence among teenager we see this in number of area the issue range from knife crime to extremism and violence fixation importantly we have the strong measure in the online safety act to protect young people from see extreme violence and inappropriate material online but it be also important for we to work with school to prevent violence among young people include violence in relationship yesterday report on the leaking of report from the national police chiefs council on the leicester riot of the report blame hindu extremism however during the riot hindu home be attack but no muslim home and two hindu temple be attack but no mosque will the minister ensure that the report be publish so that we can scrutinise it and ensure that the blame be put where it should be we

sting operation that have result in the arrest of prominent individual involve in people smuggle gang do the minister agree that this highlight the crucial importance of international co operation and signal that labour plan to smash the gang be work hard tough cross border policing take time interruption conservative members may laugh but on recent joint action day lead by german and belgian authority german officer arrest target and seize dozen of boat and engine include some in warehouse target by the national crime agency on joint action day lead by german police early this month there be seven arrest in eight raid location and dangerous life jacket be seize that demonstrate momentum in joint working that will put pressure on the criminal gang in the south west last year police community support officer be take off our street my local avon and somerset force account for of they it say that the change be direct result of lack of funding will the home secretary agree to raise the matter with the chancellor as matter of urgency so that we can put more money back into frontline policing an extra billion be go into police for the financial year start tomorrow obviously past government must account for their failure to fund the police adequately when the home secretary visit nuneaton to speak to local business owner she hear from they directly about the problem of retail crime there be glimmer of hope because our town centre officer be have big impact but that role be now vacant shop and other business say that retail crime be at an all time high with increase since january now that labour be put more money into people pocket what more can be do to ensure that it be safe for it to be spend in town centre my hon friend be right to raise the issue of town centre crime we be invest additional fund of more than billion in police next year and be provide an additional million for neighbourhood policing which be cut so heavily under the conservative government so that we can bring it back to our town centre we be strengthen the power of police officer and pcso to tackle street and shop theft crime that have soar in recent year because the conservative government turn their back on it during the border security asylum and immigration bill committee we conservatives propose new clause that would provide mechanism for bind annual cap on the number of non visitor visa issue by the uk that would have introduce accountability and transparency but it be vote down decisively by labour members the government talk tough but do the home secretary not believe that the british public deserve transparent and honest answer to the question of what the level of migration will be under this government rather than the government just blame we or say low number on every occasion be stagger by that question because net migration reach record high under the conservatives watch we be the one with plan to bring it down quite frankly the hon lady should support that mohamed wait nearly three year for decision on his asylum application period that be extend by the pause in process syrian asylum case if the minister will not end the pause what interim step will she take to far support host community such as falkirk as say early we be keep under close review the pause in syrian asylum application we can not decide asylum application against country policy that be no long relevant because of the rapid change in that country we will resume those decision as soon as we can report about the met police raid and arrest at the quaker meeting house in

freedom of assembly freedom of expression and the right to peaceful protest what explanation have the met police give the minister for their action that night as the hon gentleman will realise this be an operational matter for the metropolitan police and be sure that they will provide further commentary at some point will my right hon friend join in congratulate dawn thurkettle and the rugby street

work in keep people safe and secure on night out the final question go to the father of the house will the home secretary consider raise an obvious lacuna in the law in the committee of ministers at the council of europe under the refugee convention we can automatically deport foreign criminal who enter this country illegally but under the convention on human right we can not surely we can address that in partnership with other member of the council of europe the right hon member will know that we have increase the return and removal of foreign national offender significantly since the election deportation return and removal have plummet under the previous government we be increase they and believe it be right to do so by work internationally we have secure new agreement with germany which will now go after the trafficking and smuggler gang and the illegal warehouse in that country but we need to ensure that we take action against dangerous foreign criminal point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker want to make it clear that in the first question ask the number intend to ask about be the people who have illegally cross the channel since the last election

need their political leader to focus on pass reform and build an inclusive future rather than exacerbate tension and amplifying secessionist rhetoric thank the minister for his remark attempt to undermine bosnia and herzegovina sovereignty and territorial integrity and by extension the dayton peace agreement be deeply troubling over many year the uk have be reliable supporter of bosnia and herzegovina democratic and pluralistic journey and trust promoter when it come to the security of the western balkans we be proud when in government to have appoint lord peach as the special envoy to the western balkans his work be incredibly solid and robust and we welcome the fact that the government have maintain that position with the appointment of dame karen pierce we too look forward to

of the very issue that the shadow foreign secretary have outline the right hon lady ask what we be do have be very clear about the diplomatic effort that we be take across the region work with partner and ally include the united states the european union and member of the quint we continue to work with partner and engage with regional partner who be absolutely crucial to that stability the foreign

important role of nato alongside eufor have refer to eufor already we continue to support bosnia and herzegovina aspiration for euro atlantic integration include nato membership through joint training of uk and bosnia and herzegovina armed force and our support for reform we be help it strengthen capability and enable alignment with nato standard we be work to invest in and strengthen the capability of the bosnia and herzegovinian armed force for peacekeeping operation country that export security be also more secure themselves we maintain office at the nato headquarters in sarajevo call the chair of the foreign affairs committee what we have see from russia in georgia moldova romania the baltic state and now play out in the western balkans be nothing less than hybrid warfare democracy be work hard together to stand strong and support ukraine but do the minister agree that we need to put more effort into work with our ally in support of eastern europe and the western balkans which be very much on the frontline my right hon friend the chair of the select committee rightly raise russia malign action not only in relation to its illegal and barbarous war in ukraine but across the whole of europe and globally we continue to see pattern of behaviour intend to hamper euro atlantic aspiration and exploit instability and division recent attempt by russia to divide the international community at the united nations security council and in the osce have only far demonstrate the resoluteness of partner to work together to protect the territorial integrity of bosnia and herzegovina my right hon friend work in the committee on these issue be crucial we be also work closely with our ally and the european union on these matter in relation to not just the balkans but location such as moldova call the liberal democrat spokesperson my former party leader the late lord ashdown regularly express his grave concern about the fragility of the situation in bosnia and herzegovina draw on his own experience as the country former high representative despite repeat warning the uk ignore the threat pose to peace in bosnia by milorad dodik his entourage and his supporter in the kremlin dodik late defiance of international authority reject the legal order of the international peace envoy be only the late act in his concerted work to undermine the dayton agreement and regional stability in the balkans it be clear that the uk have take its eye off the ball in bosnia the conservatives short sighted decision in to withdraw our troop from the eufor althea peacekeeping operation send entirely the wrong signal about our commitment to the region do the minister agree that the uk should recommit to the eufor mission so we can work in lockstep with our international partner to prevent further deterioration of the situation in the balkans madam deputy speaker you will understand that can not comment on the previous government but know there be strong support across the house for peace and stability across the balkans and that we be all engage in that effort assure the hon gentleman that we absolutely have not take our eye off the ball this region be one of the most important to the foreign secretary and myself not least because of our long history of engagement in the region it be why we have now put in place one of our most senior diplomat to act as special envoy and why we have be engage in the diplomatic conversation mention on the role of the high representative we be clear that the political crisis be cause by republika srpska president dodik and his supporter we support the high representative role and we support the use of his power if necessary his role remain vital for bosnia and herzegovina future prosperity and stability and we continue to work alongside eufor and indeed with the nato presence we have there too we all know that dodik have continually deny that genocide occur at srebrenica be absolutely appalled to see that after his conviction he be invite by the israeli minister for antisemitism to go to jerusalem to address an antisemitism conference hope that the minister can restate the uk strong belief that genocide occur at srebrenica and that other country should not be invite dodik to address conference particularly on the subject of genocide obviously can not comment on mr dodik travel but can say that we be absolutely clear on what happen at srebrenica my hon friend will know that have visit srebrenica and that we have do important work with remembering srebrenica again there be cross party attitude on this issue across the house we be in year of very important and solemn anniversary and it be crucial that leader refrain from inflammatory rhetoric and action and instead focus on build trust between community across the western balkans and particularly in bosnia and herzegovina president dodik language and action be both reckless and dangerous give that the minister have just admit to there be russian meddling in the region as we know it have be go on for many year can ask what conversation he have have with the americans to ensure that they continue to have command of the nato headquarters in sarajevo to the point make by the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for lewes james maccleary can the minister say whether the uk could play bit more of role in eufor and from his discussion with the french minister whether there be likely to be an extension of that mandate as say meet one of the american representative on friday with other quint member and there be unity across the quint on these issue we will continue to work closely with the united states and other partner on this matter eufor be vital for maintain peace and security in bosnia and herzegovina and for uphold the military aspect of the dayton peace agreement and we regularly engage with both eufor directly and the eu delegation as the right hon gentleman know we do not currently participate in eu common security and defence policy mission of course we be open to future opportunity for co operation and we have identify the western balkans and indeed hybrid activity as one of the area where we need to see close co operation the subject be discuss by the foreign secretary and the eu at the foreign affairs council in luxembourg few month ago do the minister agree that we need leader in the west balkans region who be focus on build stable and inclusive future for all the people of the region instead of escalate tension with reckless rhetoric could not agree more sincerely hope that all include leader in republika srpska will focus on deliver the reform and progress necessary for their citizen instead of use inflammatory rhetoric and divisive language which seek only to break down community and unity rather than build up the trust between community that be so needed in the germany take the very important step of show programme about what have happen in the second world war with the holocaust the exact opposite have be happen in republika srpska and area of bosnia and herzegovina where textbook be be rewrite to actually increase that hatred will the minister say what plan the government have and what intervention they can make to try to get the truth of what happen during that war out to people so that those country do not just generate another generation of hatred completely agree with the broad thrust of the right hon gentleman comment ensure that we understand what happen in the past and do not attempt to deny what happen be obviously crucial for all community build trust between community be also crucial he will understand that we have fund number of programme as do the previous government include to support those who suffer sexual violence in the conflict in the as well as provide extensive support to the international commission on missing persons which have help to account for more than of the people miss from the conflict of the those sort of action be crucial to rebuild trust and deal with the legacy of the past volunteer with the osce to ensure free and fair election in bosnia and herzegovina in follow the dayton peace agreement therefore have huge concern about the escalate tension welcome the diplomatic effort we be undertake to support stability on which the minister have update we but can he confirm that he be work closely with european civil society partner such as the osce to secure peace and stable democracy in the region we continue to work with all organisation that seek to promote peace and stability in the region my hon friend rightly mention the osce which be crucial know that the issue be of keen interest to member of the osce parliamentary assembly in this place we will continue to work with they with the council of europe and with other include our partner in the eu the us and beyond civil society organisation be crucial to that work many example of the work that we have do in the past to build trust between community and on peacebuilde have be achieve through civil society organisation be the minister aware of report that russia today and sputnik be increase their dissemination of disinformation in bosnia and herzegovina at the same time as the widely respected bosnian service of voice of america face closure will he see what more we can do to counter russian disinformation in the region perhaps by increase broadcasting by the bbc world service the right hon gentleman be right to highlight the destabilising hybrid activity of russia not just in bosnia but across the region he know the step that have be take in this country against rt and other russian outlet indeed we have call they out across europe and have work with partner on that he be absolutely right that free fair truthful and legitimate medium be need to ensure that citizen have the truth about what be happen not the kind of lie that be peddle from the kremlin can not make specific promise but he know that we treat the bbc world service very seriously the under secretary of state my hon friend the member for hornsey and friern barnet catherine west be here with and will have hear his comment closely as have be note the action of milorad dodik over the past few week and month have seriously undermine the stability of bosnia and herzegovina and have undermine the dayton peace agreement which end the country war in the aftermath of the horrific genocide that take place in srebrenica what step be the government take to work with partner such as the us the eu and other western balkan country to ensure that the territorial integrity of bosnia be uphold during this fragile period my hon friend be right to highlight the need to work with our partner my french counterpart minister haddad and convene our quint partner and the eu institution on friday for joint meeting minister haddad be visit london and we take the initiative to meet our partner because we be deeply concerned about the situation in bosnia we have also be engage with those in the region include serbia and croatia along with the special envoy the foreign secretary and other will continue to do so one detect the hand of russia here much as one do across the entire periphery of europe from the high north ukraine the balkans and the caucasus which the chair of the foreign affairs committee mention to the sahel the maghreb and libya right over to the greenland iceland uk gap will the minister describe the british strategy for roll back russian destabilisation across the entire periphery of europe in second to do so in few second would be challenge but assure the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin that in all those region we be not only conscious of what russia be do but actively work with partner to push back that be why it have be identify as an area for close co operation with the eu it be why we work closely with the united states and other and it be why we work closely with individual partner in specific context include in moldova in response to russian attempt there the balkans moldova the caucasus and elsewhere be all area in which we see russia spread misinformation lie and bad dodik reckless rhetoric have be note many time in the house this afternoon can the minister assure that work be be do with partner in the region to ensure that there be no contagion be think in particular of kosovo my hon friend rightly raise kosovo country that have visit on several occasion and which we continue to support we also continue to support the important dialogue between belgrade and pristina and to work with eu and other counterpart on this crucial issue we play crucial role in kfor in kosovo in promote peace and stability it be important as my hon friend say to understand the wide regional implication and to continue to work with all partner to promote peace and stability whether that be in bosnia and herzegovina in kosovo or in respond to russian hybrid activity give the recent love in between washington and moscow it be hardly surprising that the killer in the kremlin be encourage all his sidekick to stir up trouble in area such as bosnia and herzegovina be the government aware of and keep under very close scrutiny other potential area where ally of mr putin can be expect to start to stir up trouble and destabilise thing as part of his move now that he be on the front foot in ukraine would not agree entirely with the right hon member characterisation one only have to look at what president trump have say in the last hour on these matter to see that we be unite in try to not only find sustainable peace in ukraine but call out russia on its action and take the necessary action when it come to russia activity elsewhere as say there be very strong quint unity on this issue and it be real pleasure to be alongside american and european counterpart with strong united approach it be crucial that there be strong transatlantic unity on these issue and we will continue to work for that with european and american partner the sarajevo security conference be in couple of month and there will be session on defence technology have be ask along to speak about it nato country in europe be rearm and spend increase defence budget on invest in and develop defence technology what step be the minister take to ensure that our friend in bosnia and herzegovina be also update their capability what message can take to that conference be glad to hear that my hon friend have be invite to that conference it be important that we have link at parliamentary level with country in the western balkans particularly on these important matter mention early that we be work include through our presence at the nato headquarters in sarajevo on invest in and strengthen the capability of bosnia and herzegovina armed force and consider how they might be deploy internationally too that be very important we will continue to work with european partner both inside and outside nato to ensure that we can all collectively contribute to european defence particularly in response to the hybrid activity and new advance in warfare we see whether it be cyber or drone technology draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests last november visit the srebrenica memorial centre and be sure the minister will share my revulsion at the fact that it have to close its door for short period just few week ago due to the political situation there before he do so can he elaborate on the position that the united states of america have adopt in respect of bosnia and herzegovina and whether he view the us as stable ally that recognise that the western balkans be crucial to the security of europe as whole we and the united states play crucial role in the western balkans particularly in achieve the dayton peace agreement itself we continue to be commit to that as say there have be strong unity among the quint and it be important that the united states and europe work together on these issue there have be legacy of year of relative stability say relative because there have be deep threat to it at different point and we need that to continue for the people of bosnia and herzegovina be sure we be all committed to that far to the question from my right hon friend the member for maldon sir john whittingdale and know how much the minister value soft power can he reassure the house that there will be no further cut to the british council or the world service in the balkans on his watch will come back to the hon lady on her specific point about british council and the bbc world service funding but have mention our wide development spending in the region while we be have to make very difficult decision at the moment it be worth reflect on the fact that through around million this year from the integrate security fund and foreign commonwealth and development office official development assistance we have continue to empower woman and girl strengthen democracy build resilience to domestic and state threat and promote peacebuilding and transitional justice we have be engage across range of different area in the development and soft power space to contribute to peace and stability in the western balkans and in bosnia and herzegovina specifically associate myself with the comment make about the british council and the bbc world service few week ago have the privilege of visit brigade the anti russian disinformation brigade base at newbury have an assessment be make of the rise of russian misinformation and disinformation in the republika srpska theatre in recent month we hear during that meeting that russia be increasingly use misinformation and disinformation across ukraine eastern europe and indeed the balkans we be clear that russia continue to spread lie and disinformation and misinformation not only in the western balkans but in many other location across europe we continue to work with ally and partner the eu and other to challenge that there be particular challenge in the western balkans which be why we also support effort there to strengthen free medium journalism and civil society organisation in my previous role as trade envoy to the western balkans visit bosnia and herzegovina on number of occasion and it be evident that though the entrepreneurial spirit be alive and well business leader be frustrate by the deadlocked structure that they must work in our embassy be do what it can but can the government take any further initiative that could increase economic activity and trade between our two nation the hon member raise an important point and pay tribute to he for his work he and travel together on number of visit to the region include to bosnia and kosovo so be well aware of his interest and engagement there there be many opportunity for increase economic linkage and trade with all the country in the region and we continue to promote those indeed discuss they on my recent visit to serbia and montenegro the hon member be absolutely right that this be fundamentally about leadership in the region as say the people of bosnia and herzegovina need political leader to focus on pass reform and build inclusive future rather than exacerbate tension as we be see with president dodik in republika srpska because that do not serve the people of republika srpska the minister have acknowledge that the secessionist move in republika srpska could have ramification for the western balkans more broadly one part of that be the north of kosovo where there be kosovo serb minority while the uk do not contribute to eufor and operation althea we do contribute to kfor in kosovo what

refugee what specific assessment have be make of their need in the light of this terrible tragedy will any of the million that have be announce go towards support for the rohingya or will there be an adaptation of exist programme to support they can the minister also update the house on whether any of the million be earmark for thailand or whether there be separate package of support for thailand it would be helpful for the house to understand whether formal request for assistance have be receive from any of the country affect by the earthquake and what the uk official response have be as well as whether ministers have have any discussion with counterpart affect in those country we will of course also look to the uk government to provide all the necessary support for british national who be

initial earthquake but give the shallow nature of it the assessment be that the aftershock in bangkok be currently the bad should hear more on that will update the right hon lady in relation to safeguard the aid the right hon lady make the important point that it would be easy for the military regime to divert the aid away from the frontline this be where the experience of our excellent

mandalay we have trust way of provide that aid without be concern that some of it might be divert into the military on the rohingya that be be see separately we will be work little later in the year on more support for the rohingya in the settlement of the myanmar question we hope that the rohingya will be able to return to their part of myanmar over the long term right now the immediate support that the government be able to provide be very much assist with central myanmar but can reassure she that we have different strategy for the rohingya which can write to she about on the separate package for thailand the current assessment be that the consular team have no extra concern regard people come across the border our consular team be work as usual and our excellent ambassador there have give we reassurance that the team in bangkok be operate as usual on our counterpart due to the long stand nature of the development work in myanmar we work closely with colleague across the

this earthquake that include singapore india and other neighbouring country the right hon lady also ask about the british consular assistance we have an update that there be no concern regard miss british traveller either in myanmar or thailand but will continue to update she should that change the terrible loss of life and destruction cause by the earthquake in myanmar be heap far suffering on

humanitarian personnel all party to the conflict must ensure full unhindered humanitarian access to the most vulnerable and ensure the safety of those facilitate it call the liberal democrat spokesperson share the grief express by the whole house for the people of myanmar it be heartbreake that country that have already suffer four year of brutal civil war now face further devastation wholeheartedly welcome the government announcement of million to support the emergency response it be vital that these fund reach those most severely impact by the disaster as quickly as possible can the minister confirm how much funding have be dispense so far and outline the step her department be take to translate fund into lifesave aid as quickly as possible as the death toll continue to rise and the ultimate scale of the disaster become clear will the minister confirm that the government will continue to increase our humanitarian support to match the need on the ground in the spring statement we see that the uk development spending face cliff edge in with almost billion in cut anticipate by that time that will reduce the uk ability to respond to disaster and provide the long term consistent support that rebuild myanmar and its economy will require will the minister confirm that bilateral aid to myanmar will remain priority the military junta in myanmar have long block aid access for civilian in opposition control area aid worker have be attack and we hear report that aid worker respond to the earthquake fear junta arrest and interference what be the government do to ensure that humanitarian aid be get through and that responder on the ground can work free from repression will the minister outline the government diplomatic response to the wide conflict and their response to what the un be call report of human right violation myanmar need our support in the aftermath of this tragedy as the world spotlight turn to it urge the government to take this opportunity to use every lever they can to push for an end to conflict and for future democracy on the question of how much of the million have be spend it have only just be allocate within the hour so it be still build on that firm base we already have we have be donor country to myanmar for many year and so be build on solid base the million will be spend rapidly on the emergency response the hon member ask about the impact of uk oda cut on the response to the earthquake we know that the extra million that the foreign secretary announce be on top of the original allocation the hon member share her worry about the future impact give our announcement that gross national income spend on oda will drop to can confirm that the international development minister set out to the international development committee that the initial bilateral oda allocation for be set at the level of live contractual arrangement with partner unlike in the previous reduction of aid where there be in year reduction and programme stop from one day to the next that be not how this government will look at the aid budget the minister for development will lay out to parliament how she intend to conduct the comprehensive spending review post and how she will bring that the percentage down to but it be immaterial how that relate to the question of funding in response to the earthquake because of the extra million we will continue to monitor that funding and should it need topping up we could do so but our assessment at the moment be that it be about right give how many different partner be come forward our heart go out to all those affect by the tragic loss of life and devastation in myanmar and thailand the disasters emergency committee say that it be monitor the situation and be consider launch an appeal as it have do for previous tragedy of this scale what discussion have the minister have with the disasters emergency committee and its lead group on its ability to operate in myanmar and on whether it will launch an appeal if it do so will the uk government use uk aid match to match the generosity that be sure the british public will show in order to ensure that as much money as possible reach the frontline in myanmar and thailand thank my hon friend for his question and for his knowledge in these area of policy ask he to allow four or five day so that the various international partner that make up the disasters emergency committee have time to deliberate as he be aware we have generous civil society in the uk as soon as there be information to bring forward we will make public statement thank the hon lady for her statement to the house for those of we who have be closely involve on issue to do with burma myanmar for decade now the severity of the disaster be show by the fact that unusually the regime have call for international support however it be mark of the barbarity of that illegal and corrupt junta that it conduct airstrike against its own people after the earthquake take place which be undoubtedly war crime we have long history of engagement with burma some million child be absolutely dependent on assistance it will be very difficult to sustain the necessary level of support in future follow labour dreadful cut to the international development programme what discussion have the minister have with her american counterpart to ensure that we drive the uk and us joint spending and get great value for money thank the right hon gentleman for his contribution and for his knowledge of myanmar burma and of the situation could not agree more with he in his description of the tatmadaw and its approach over the year absolutely ruthless and brutal to its own people he talk about the child who be affect he will be aware that between million and million child be out of school even before the earthquake so there be strong sense that this could not have happen to more vulnerable country he ask about the role of the usa as he be aware us aid have be pause internationally but be delighted to see at the weekend that the us government have say that they will contribute million immediately we will seek to work with us partner who know the area as well so that we can join up our effort associate myself with the minister word about what be go on in myanmar and thailand in my former role as the prime minister envoy to thailand and myanmar have the opportunity to see the extraordinary work that british business do in both country fully understand that the british mission in thailand be support all such business there as it have do for many year in myanmar the situation be far more complicated yet there be still number of british business from big conglomerate down to entrepreneur try to cut furrow in that country and they employ burmese national who would otherwise be starve give the complex political situation there may urge the minister to work with the department for business and trade to see how we can support british business in and around yangon that be otherwise not be support because of the situation with the junta thank the hon gentleman for all his work on behalf of the government on understand the trade picture and get to know the business he be right that there be number of business for which it be safe to undertake business activity and where there be good practice they have support the workforce through thick and thin not just of course in myanmar but in bangladesh which be go through difficult time and in thailand will certainly take his message of support to our mission in yangon and bangkok so that all our partner there can be aware of the support here in the house for that ongoing work thank the minister for her statement today this be so much more than humanitarian crisis it be double disaster humanitarian crisis on the back of civil war and further military attack on the domestic population of myanmar give the united states withdrawal of usaid and the withdrawal of voice of america and radio free asia what be be do to support the bbc world service burmese service in an environment where information will be absolutely vital to the maintenance of service and the saving of life thank the hon gentleman for that suggestion he be correct that usaid have be freeze but it be encouraging to see over the weekend an announcement by the us government that million will immediately be put towards deal with this dreadful earthquake that be hopeful sign that we can work together on this emergency on the bbc world service the hon gentleman be right to say that often the radio be the only thing that people be able to access and it give they so much hope with his permission will write to he specifically on the exact position of the bbc world service in myanmar many many compassionate people across west worcestershire and the whole of the united kingdom will be want to know what they can do to help in this situation so will the minister give we some further information on how uk taxpayer may donate and whether there will be an aid match thank the hon lady for her suggestion she be right that so many people will be think how can do my bit for the people of myanmar as mention to my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel detail will be available as soon as the disasters emergency committee the joint appeal across all the different body come forward which will be within the week because of course the earthquake happen just on thursday night and friday morning want to say very clearly from the dispatch box that the dec be proper brand that can be trust by our constituent because it be very important that people do not give money online through facebook and other platform if they be not sure of they as soon as the announcement be ready we will work very carefully with international partner about where those donation can go thank the minister for her statement and for her compassionate word which encapsulate believe the opinion of all of we in this chamber the major earthquake in myanmar have cause over death and the collapse of numerous high rise building temple and house destroy family and livelihood and disperse family in all direction what discussion have the minister have with counterpart or official about ensure that everything be do to get child to place of safety with the necessary aid and

be affect by the earthquake we do not have an exact picture yet but we know that through the work that the uk have do over the year with the million to million child whether through vaccination and health programme or through our education programme we have very good and trust way of work at grassroots level to get to the hard to reach family to serve they and ensure that they have lifesave aid the regime use of its kremlin back military during humanitarian crisis to attack its own people be complete obscenity have the minister call in the myanmar ambassador so that he can offer an explanation thank the right hon gentleman for that suggestion along with he and the whole house condemn the action of the tatmadaw be sure he be aware that currently there be no ambassador as such but there be chargé we do not have formal relation with the chargé but agree with what the right hon gentleman have say the message from this house be very clear can the minister explain bit more about the mechanism by which any aid donate in this country will reach people on the ground in myanmar particularly give the airstrike we have hear about it be hard to imagine how such aid would get to area that be currently under attack by the regime thank the right hon member for raise that to be clear the usual procedure be for the disasters emergency committee which be make up of government plus large non governmental organisation and united nations agency to arrange mechanism for safely give donation we know that if people give donation to different group they may not go to the right place as soon as we have that information which will be within week of the event happen we will provide it but it require co ordination across number of government plus the un agency faith group and all the other group as soon as that be ready we will let the right hon gentleman have the detail the earthquake in myanmar could not have come at bad time give that million be already displace and need humanitarian assistance as result of the ongoing civil war since the military coup in welcome the minister condemnation of the multiple airstrike that have take place since the earthquake and the million of assistance that have be announce however numerous charity have come forward with emergency appeal to support those affect and have hear some warm word about how we can build on that will the uk government support those appeal as mention by other across this house we be speak with one voice through aid match so that for every pound donate by member of the public the government will contribute furth of uk aid can confirm that that suggestion be under active consideration birmingham city council with permission madam deputy speaker would like to update the house on the statutory intervention at birmingham city council and on the issue affect the waste service this government be elect on manifesto that pledge to fix the foundation of local government the public rightly expect and deserve well function local council that provide the essential statutory service that resident rely on local council must be fit legal and decent commissioner have be work with birmingham city council for the past month to support it in its recovery and today be publish their late report into the progress on that journey the report land at point of acute difficulty for resident in birmingham as the ongoing dispute in the waste service be result in rubbish pile up in the street will therefore take this opportunity to update the house on the status of that dispute to address the report first the council have take important initial step forward on its improvement journey and be work constructively with commissioner it have make significant progress on address historical equal pay issue and fix the foundation of governance the leader councillor cotton and his group be take the difficult decision to get the council back on track and the commissioner have recognise his calm leadership through stormy water the new manage director joanne roney cbe have bring steady hand and be begin to make permanent senior appointment that will contribute to much need stabilisation the council have also achieve breakthrough by reach an agreement to settle the outstanding claim and end the ongoing equal pay saga it be also set to re implement strategy for the oracle it system those improvement be encouraging but challenge remain in the short term commissioner oversight and close supervision will still be require to maintain momentum there be difficult road ahead on key aspect of the good value regime on governance and culture financial management and service delivery because substantial risk threaten the journey to reform and recovery as member will know there be live industrial action in waste service involve one of the three recognise trade union in that area the government will support the leader and his team in birmingham directly and through the commissioner to move the council on from these historical issue that support include an increase in core spending power for of up to or million that figure include million through the new one off recovery grant which illustrate this government commitment to correct the unfairness in the funding system we have also put in place an in principle agreement for exceptional financial support total billion turn to the waste dispute council deliver over vital service that make huge difference to million of people across the country however it be accept that for many the most visible and universal service be the collection and disposal of household waste member across the house will know that the current industrial action in the city be cause misery and disruption to local people and know that hon member whose constituent be affect will be acutely aware of that disruption from the outset want to be clear that the statutory intervention be lead by commissioner and ministers can not legally intervene in this industrial action however have be in regular contact with the leadership of the council throughout this as they have seek to find resolution in which the reform need to build sustainable council be still undertake and the waste collection service return to function normally in the way that members would expect this situation be cause public health risk to the city most vulnerable and deprived resident as result birmingham have today declare major incident so that it can use the mechanism that it need to well manage the impact on local resident support that decision and will back local leader in bring the situation under control in the week to come well establish arrangement be in place to enable local area to escalate issue when they need support and the government be monitor the situation closely this be local issue and it be right that the key public sector partner in birmingham lead on it if leader in birmingham feel that tackle these issue would require resource beyond those available to they and request national support we of course stand ready to respond to any such request this government will always back local leader and give they the support that they need not swoop in to criticise or take over from whitehall we will not hesitate to give support in any way that birmingham leader need as parliament would expect meeting will take place with the leadership of the council the commissioner and other key local partner to ensure that we be do everything we can to support and protect public health it be in the interest of all party and most importantly for the benefit of birmingham resident that this industrial action be bring to close in meaningful and sustainable way as soon as possible we encourage all party to redouble their effort to get around the table and find resolution any deal to end industrial action must maintain value for money and ensure fit for purpose waste collection service without create or store up liability for the future all party recognise that birmingham waste service have be in urgent need of modernisation and transformation for many year so any deal reach must not repeat the mistake of the past practice in the waste service have be the source of one of the large equal pay crisis in modern uk history result in cost of over billion to the resident of birmingham this situation simply can not continue support the council on its journey to create the sustainable fair and reliable waste service that resident in birmingham deserve we will support the council in resolve its historic issue and establish the leadership governance and culture that will drive good quality public service for the people of that city so that it can take its rightful place with confidence as one of our great uk city as the council move to the next stage of intervention will continue to work with the council commissioner and the wide local government sector to understand how we can well ensure that resident get what they need from their local council will monitor progress as have do since the general election to ensure that continuous improvement lead by the council can be secure as be sure the whole house would expect the commissioner arrangement will need to remain in place while the situation in birmingham be so fragile the commissioner have vital role to play in support birmingham transformation work hand in glove with local leader the government remain committed to work in genuine partnership with the city and its council and continue to encourage the council to strengthen its partnership with regional stakeholder include mayor parker in the west midlands combine authority to support economic growth and financial sustainability we be keen to promote growth and regeneration opportunity for birmingham and we be confident that as the council continue to work to fix the basic while make progress against the milestone local stakeholder will be encourage to work in partnership with the council to deliver clear vision for the future look forward to continue dialogue with commissioner the council and regional partnership include mayor parker on opportunity for growth in the region partnership approach with clear vision will increase birmingham capacity to achieve sustainable growth the people of birmingham deserve well run accountable and financially stable council with good public service not least waste collection service be encourage by the council leadership and commitment to the same and look forward to the council begin to demonstrate more ownership of its recovery and to see evidence that it can deliver the last improvement that be require will deposit in the house library copy of the commissioner report which be be publish today on call the shadow secretary of state thank the minister for advance sight of the statement be sure that the fact that both my right hon friend the member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell and table an urgent question on this issue play part in the minister come to the house today he have say nothing on this matter for the day in which it have be live issue it be shameful national embarrassment that one of our nation great city our second city find itself in such bleak situation as the minister admit the problem be of the council own making it be result of the flawed deal with unite back in which lead to legal action over equal pay but it be the people who pay the price we have have mountain of rubbish blight the street of birmingham for more than day and there be no end in sight to the dispute with labour union paymaster unite almost every area be plague by overflow bin rat the size of cat and opportunistic fly tipper exploit the chaos to turn open space into dumping ground that be the reality of labour in local government from edgbaston to sutton coldfield from yardley to erdington and from balsall heath to sparkhill the pile of waste grow even high this be public health emergency as the hon member for birmingham edgbaston preet kaur gill have concede even the labour mayor of the west midlands have say that he be feed up with waste pile up and the street be filthy that be why we call for cobra lead response this issue demand co ordinate effort across local and national government harness the expertise of public health official civil contingency professional and emergency service we call on the government to cut councillor allowance for the cabinet member who get birmingham into this mess and we urge the government to appoint binman from the private sector to clear up labour mess where be labour mps today can only see one on the government benches interruption okay there be two here out of while they have be campaign for an airport in kashmir we be propose workable solution the minister talk about the calm leadership of councillor cotton what local resident need be action not buzzword both from the local leadership and from central government he say that ministers can not legally intervene in this industrial action be he honestly say that he have no influence with the union involve unite which be complicitly hold the city hostage and which contribute to the deputy prime minister election war chest surely she be now duty bind to pick up the phone and speak truth to the real power behind the labour throne the union incredibly unite be call on central government not to live within its mean but to make hundred of million of pound available to the council be that something that the minister be consider he talk about an increase of or million in the council core spending power for the forthcoming year will he confirm that significant part of that be be raise by mean of council tax increase of and that that be clear breach of the prime minister pledge to freeze council tax this year pay particular tribute to councillor bobby alden and the birmingham conservatives who alongside my hon friend the member for sutton coalfield have be doggedly hold the council incompetent leadership to account they have clear solution to this crisis now that birmingham have today declare major incident lead to the availability of new mechanism can the minister confirm that he will meet they to ensure that those mechanism be consider find it extraordinary that the minister should say that birmingham city council have not yet request national support will he not insist that it do so immediately he also say that he would meet local leader and commissioner give that this crisis have be ongoing for day and counting why have he not already meet those local leader and when will he do so will it be this very week well well no one listen to that response would think that the conservative government have be in government for year and be in office when birmingham have to come to they for financial support but birmingham be not alone be it council be fall like domino because of the last government chronic underfunding the conservatives talk about kashmir they leave cash crisis that affect every council every single council whether it be labour conservative or liberal democrat be let down by the conservative government the conservatives can not even look their own council in the eye when it come to reorganisation local leader who be do what be need for their area and show local leadership have be be undermine by the national leadership they be lion lead by donkey beyond the party political nonsense that have be deploy surely we can all agree that we care about the people of birmingham and want this vital public service restore surely we all agree that give the last government intervention in birmingham the journey of improvement be fragile yes improvement have be make but we have to maintain our course the conservatives must also accept that one of the big barrier to settle the council and give it long term stability be the storing up of equal pay liability resolve this issue be critical not just for the council but for the people of birmingham can assure the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake that regular conversation have be take place that include meeting with the council leader couple of week ago and there will be further meeting this week we have say that we will do what be need to help the council achieve what it need to achieve and to get the service back on track be sure that the hon gentleman will agree that that be the right approach with local leader show local leadership and national government provide the support that be need bizarrely the hon gentleman refer to council tax increase the council tax increase in birmingham last year under the last government be high than this year increase why because this government have clear eye on look after taxpayer and ensure that any increase be contain how do we do that we do not do what the last government would have do we do not say just go to the wall and see what happen it be this government who provide nearly million of new money through the recovery grant for birmingham to ensure that it do not have to pass that increase on to local taxpayer that be genuine partnership with national government and local government work hand in hand be it not time that the previous government accept their failing over year in office and accept that the foundation of local government be leave weak not strong when they leave office will they now start put the interest of the people of this country ahead of political interest this bin dispute be cause chaos in the city include in birmingham erdington what discussion have the government have with birmingham city council regard not just the bin collection but the impact on public health and the environment it be so important that we look at the health and safety of local resident in birmingham that be the crux of where we be because the bin dispute have be go on for so long the scale of uncollected rubbish be leave in the street be now pose public health concern which be why the council have declare major incident today it be show local leadership it recognise the public health implication and it be work with local public sector provider as have already say will make sure that the government stand absolutely ready to work with the council and to provide any support that it need as part of genuine partnership order before call the liberal democrat spokesperson remind member that if they be seek to contribute in statement they must arrive on time it be extremely discourteous to the minister and indeed to the house to be late apologise madam deputy speaker run all the way from the top floor of derby gate but be not fast enough refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests be an elect member of bournemouth christchurch and poole council the people of birmingham have right to receive decent service and it be critical that the ongoing dispute be resolve as quickly as possible like the hon member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton we be concerned about the impact on public health and the environment and urge the government to confirm that when waste collection resume it will be safely dispose of and recycle where possible and not just give to the cheap bidder fundamentally the conservative government slash funding to local authority year on year force council to do more with less and plunge so many of all political stripe into financial crisis however we be disappointed that the government have not yet address some of the financial crisis particularly around confirmation of the special educational need override which know council across the nation be really worried about and which be make it more difficult for they to make decision about their future plan we welcome the multi year settlement which be sure the minister will refer to but we remain concerned about how effective they will be two recent example give we cause for concern the road funding which appear to give local authority more money actually cut england road repair budget by and the employer national insurance change which promise to cover council cost for direct staffing in full do not do so in some case include for bournemouth christchurch and poole council all that be underpin by break council tax system that be regressive in some area the council tax base be totally inadequate to provide for the grow list of service and the lib dems want to see radical overhaul birmingham should serve as lesson for the government because this matter be result of the long run equal pay crisis what learning be they take from the situation in birmingham and what extra measure be the minister introduce to prevent public health and community safety issue be pleased to say that we be make sure that we deal with the waste pile up in the street and that the council get the support it need but the hon lady be right to say that there be an interrelationship this dispute do not sit in isolation it be part of wide consideration on equal pay and we have to bear in mind that the cost of meet the equal pay liability for the people of birmingham be billion there can be no step forward in this dispute that double down on the inherent problem that lead to the equal pay crisis that the city have face these be sensitive negotiation but it be important that the council continue to negotiate and that people get around the table to find way through the hon lady talk about the multi year settlement that be be prepare for and the simplification of the funding mechanism but she also mention redistribution birmingham and council like it have not find themselves in this situation in vacuum it have be partly drive by central government not distribute money in fair way to deal with service need and deprivation and it be very important that we get the money to where that deprivation exist even under the current one year settlement birmingham have have increase in cash that be million welcome the minister statement the birmingham bin strike mean that many of my constituent have not have their bin collect in week and this week constituent write to to say that they have be bite by rat have be raise the public health situation and call for the council to take emergency measure so do welcome the fact that it have declare critical incident today do the minister agree with that it be unacceptable that unite picket have be frustrating the council contingency plan by block depot and that it be time for unite to accept the fair deal on the table seventeen people can not hold million birmingham resident to ransom my hon friend be right to say that the vast majority of the workforce of the service have agree way forward by one route or another whether by take voluntary redundancy or accept new way of working and that this come down now to small number of people who have not accept that in the end that be where the dispute lie do agree that city can not almost grind to halt because of such circumstance in its waste collection service encourage all party the local authority as the employer and the trade union to get around the table and focus on the big prize here after almost decade of uncertainty on equal pay the council and the trade union have agree position from which they can move forward together that be significant moment in which think all party should take some pride let we not spoil it by the action today that could undermine the equal pay negotiation that have be so successful the minister really can not get away with blame the last conservative government for this situation labour own campaign improvement board say budget cut and the size of the city be use as reason to explain the situation however this do not hold up to scrutiny my constituent in the royal town of sutton coldfield which be part of birmingham if only for local government purpose be absolutely furious at this late evidence of paralysis and incompetence under labour it follow labour bankrupt the city rocket our council tax seek to close our library and try to charge we for parking in our own park do the minister not think that we now need judge lead inquiry into the cause of the equal pay crisis birmingham bankruptcy and this dreadful bin strike surely the people of birmingham britain second city deserve well from the labour party be afraid that the picture that the right hon member paint of increase charge at local level whether for car parking or other type of charge or the council tax go up in way that some household will find difficult be the story of english local government for the last decade and birmingham do not sit in isolation in many way the size of the local authority the fact that it be the large local authority in europe not just in this country go some way to explain how ripple in one council of much small size in birmingham have much big implication the right hon member talk about judge lead process this situation do not need judge it need judgment the judgment be that after so much progress have be make on equal pay now be the time to resolve the dispute settle it and allow the workforce to move on with fair pay for man and woman in equivalent role across the local authority be sure he agree with that that be the way forward my resident and constituent deserve well than the current scene in birmingham bin be not be collect and the council be lose future revenue because commercial contract be be cancel the reality be that bin service be not good enough even before the strike when the strike end and it will end what assurance can the minister give my resident that refuse and health service in birmingham will be decent and fit for purpose may respond to the comment of the right hon member for sutton coldfield mr mitchell whom respect he seek to deny share of the blame for his party but will the minister confirm that last year council tax increase be sign off in no and the treasury at the time and that under the previous government birmingham lose in the pound with the sharp cut of any unitary authority my hon friend rightly set out how difficult the operating environment have be for local government and in particular for birmingham it be the previous government who introduce the commissioner process the previous government who start the exceptional financial support process and the previous government who introduce the council tax increase in birmingham when we come into office we be determine not to let birmingham stand by itself and that we have role to play the recovery grant be our contribution to that the benefit for local people be that we be now able to manage the impact on council tax payer at local level in way that frankly the previous government do not seem to care too much for how we move on from this point be what think people in birmingham want to know how can we clear up the mess that have be leave on the street how can we restore waste collection service that deliver for the people of that great city how can we have an equal pay agreement that really hold and be not unpick by short term agreement just on the current crisis as say think the council have do good job in navigate very choppy water but it be not at the other end of they yet the improvement journey for birmingham will take some time it require clear eye on the end that everyone be try to work towards when the minister describe this as local matter it be clear to that his government be wash their hand of the problem that be not good enough the resident of aldridge brownhills which be on the edge of birmingham see and hear what be go on and we do not want the problem come over to we we do not want the squeaky blinder in aldridge brownhills what we do want be the minister to get this problem sort out and get those bin empty for resident it be quite simple say that this be partnership of course birmingham city council as the employer in this trade union dispute have to negotiate with the trade union and the workforce to get those service back that be statement of fact not an opinion the question be then what can we do as national government to support local government to achieve that we have maintain support the commissioner appoint by the previous government be in place we have provide additional financial support not just to birmingham with billion of new investment in local government bring the total settlement to billion as say before million alone be for the recovery grant for birmingham so feel the government be do as much as we can but we always stand ready to do more if need over year birmingham city council lose million of funding under the previous conservative government do the minister agree that that be big recipe for the situation we be in now do he agree that both side the council leadership and the trade union need to put public rhetoric to one side get around the table and sort this dispute out if we look at the progress make on equal pay the trade union and the local authority work in partnership to agree way forward in the end they recognise that they all care about the same thing they care about the people of birmingham about the workforce and about the long term viability of the local authority when common interest be apply people can find way through hope go forward that all interested party can get around the table find way through and get the bin empty resident of birmingham will have hear the minister talk about monitoring oversee and review what be happen what they want to hear be what the minister be go to do can he make it clear that if the talk be not agree there be no return back to work and the bin be not empty he will intervene and throw all the resource that be require to break the strike and ensure the bin be again empty in birmingham there be difference in tone between resolve the strike and break the strike we absolutely stand ready to support the council and the workforce more generally who do want the situation resolve as many who work for the council also work in the city they take pride in be local public servant and they want the city to be proud of the council in return for many that be be test we absolutely stand ready to work with the council and find way through this issue the council be work hard to resolve it it understand that people be angry and frustrated and that from public health point of view it just can not continue chelworth road in my constituency be road of two half on one half of the road which be in the wythall division of worcestershire the rubbish be collect on the other side which fall under labour lead birmingham city council the rubbish be pile high council tax be go up by and major incident be be declare labour be deliver rubbish while the liberal democrats be prance around on their hobby horse on social medium the minister talk about priority include put resident first and deliver value for money but surely this be further proof that only conservative council will deliver on those priority will the minister tell we at what point he will step in to get those bin collect the hon gentleman be try to set up the good council and the bad council by party politic but be afraid that have be exhaust the previous government do this all the time they would parade council of different colour around for sham whatever the issue while for one of their own they would just hope that everything would move on and that nobody would notice we be not interested in do that this be about new partnership where national government and local government work together to resolve these issue if conservative council find itself in trouble there have be some should say and there may be more in the future be not go to name and shame it and parade it around in the way the hon gentleman be try to do today we stand ready to work with council of all political party in the interest of the people at local level because that be what matter may give the minister some friendly advice and suggest that he do not try to write this off as little local difficulty be half expect to hear he use the phrase crisis what crisis he can not be blame for not remember the winter of discontent use the wonder of wikipedia see that it happen year before he be bear but can assure he that the callaghan government and the labour party never shake off the pungent smell of the rubbish piling in the street on their watch he really do not want to have the same thing happen to he will tell the right hon gentleman what stink hear conservative mp line up as if they be not in government for year and create the condition for this to happen while the foundation of local government be erode with that record would honestly keep the advice to myself if be he we have birmingham labour mps campaign for new airport in pakistan meanwhile we have rat the size of cat feast on month of rubbish in birmingham courtesy of labour trade union friend my simple question to the minister be this when will this rubbish be clear we both share the intention and ambition that it will be clear as soon as possible there should not be any further delay in reach an agreement when it be quite clear that the volume of waste to be collect be prove to be waste hazard with his background as councillor the hon gentleman will know that it be for the council as local employer to resolve this matter with the trade union by agreement that be what we want non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill consideration of lords message must draw the house attention to the fact that financial privilege be engage by lords amendment and and by lords amendment and to the word restore to the bill by the lords non insistence on their amendment if any of those lords amendment be agree to will cause the customary entry waive commons financial privilege to be enter in the journal clause determination of additional multiplier beg to move that this house disagree with lords amendment with this it will be convenient to discuss lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment and government motion to disagree lord amendment to and government motion to disagree to the word restore to the bill by the lords non insistence on their amendment be grateful for the opportunity to consider the lords amendment table in lieu of those to which this house disagree reiterate my thank to member of both houses for their continue diligence in the scrutiny of these measure the bill make provision to enable the introduction of permanent low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure business from april end the uncertainty of the temporary rhl relief the rhl relief stopgap measure create uncertainty for business as well as significant fiscal pressure on the government this government be commit to address that in the bill the government face the significant challenge that we must balance the book so we can not and should not make tax cut without ensure that those tax cut be fund the bill therefore make provision to enable the introduction of high multipli for all property with rateable value at or above ensure that the permanent tax cut from rhl property be sustainably fund from within the business rate system the bill will also help to deliver another of the mission set out in the government manifesto break down barrier to opportunity it will remove eligibility for charitable rate relief from private school that be charity in england as have say before in this house the government believe in parental choice but be also determined to fulfil the aspiration of every parent to get the good education for their child to eliminate the barrier to opportunity we need to concentrate on the broad picture towards the state sector where let we remember over of child be educate the revenue raise through the removal of charitable relief will help to deliver our commitment to education and young people and will help we to meet our overarching mission of break down barrier to opportunity for all lord amendment and seek to allow the treasury to exclude healthcare hereditament from the high multipli through regulation lord amendment and seek to allow the treasury to exclude anchor store from the high multipli through regulation the amendment be unnecessary because the power that they seek already exist in the bill let be clear the power in the bill will already allow the government should they so choose to exclude certain property from the high multipli this be not the intention that have set out the government intention be that the high multipli will apply to all property at or above the threshold to ensure that local multiplier can be adequately fund urge the house to reject the amendment because they be not require and they duplicate power that already exist in the bill lord amendment table by lord thurlow would require the government to undertake review of how the provision in this act may affect business whose rateable value be close to the amendment would require the review to be lay before parliament within six month of the day on which the bill be pass it also specify that the review must consider the merit of separate use class and associate multiplier for retail service provide by fulfilment warehouse that do not have material presence on local high street to apply in england we have previously consider two similar lords amendment and our position have not change the amendment be unnecessary the transforming business rates work that be under way recognise the cliff edge in the business rate system and recognise that it may act as disincentive to expand reiterate the assurance that have previously provide to the house the government be already look at this precise issue the second part of lords amendment would require the government to undertake review examine the merit of separate use class in business rate and an associated multipli for warehouse that cater for retailer without material presence on the high street as have be set out the government be already explore that objective through the project that have be mention the digitalising business rates project will allow we to match property level datum with the business level datum hold by hm revenue and customs this will improve the way in which we target business rate the government therefore remain of the view that the amendment be not require urge hon member to disagree to it the government be fully commit to transform the business rate system this be simply the first step in wide programme of change in system that be long overdue for reform as the chancellor set out in the spring statement last week the government will publish an interim report set clear direction of travel for reform with further policy detail to follow at the autumn budget reform to the business rate system will be phase in over the parliament finally amendment to seek to move the measure to remove the charitable rate relief from private school from one that be be make by parliament through this bill to one that the secretary of state would make through regulation subject to the affirmative resolution procedure for that statutory instrument the government be commit to deliver on our manifesto commitment and part of that be remove the charitable rate relief from private school to raise revenue to help deliver on our commitment to young people and education include the in state sector where as say most child be educate the government view be that this be matter for parliament to decide which be why we have invite parliament to do so through this bill therefore the amendment be unnecessary the government can not accept they and we ask the house to disagree to they call the shadow secretary of state thank their noble lordship for their diligent further consideration of the non domestic rating multipliers and private schools bill and for the new amendment they have pass to address their concern with the legislation these change shine spotlight on labour muddle priority expose an approach that punish aspiration squeeze business and increase the cost of live for consumer and the cost of do business this very week we will see the new job tax introduce and business rate hike the employment rights bill be come down the line which be of great concern to many private sector business and consumer will consequently see high price and low wage tomorrow we will also see hike in council tax energy price water bill broadband and the bbc licence fee will address the four primary group of amendment in turn first lords amendment and tackle the proposal to levy high multipli on medical dental and other healthcare setting the amendment would prudently protect all healthcare premise occupy or vacant from the high multipli address glare flaw in labour bill for too long we have caution against their detachment from practical governance but now it be undeniable rather than target the untaxed profit of internet giant as pledge they be heap cost on to hospital and gp surgery it be baffle that labour so call reform of the rating system would burden healthcare at all let alone do so while they plan to hike national insurance on job tomorrow to fund the nhs only to claw it back today by tax those same health service just yesterday the government pledge to funnel more cash into the nhs by tax job through national insurance hike yet today they turn around and tax the nhs itself via business rate it be fiscal farce two faced assault on healthcare that undermine their own rhetoric as conservative members have mention in recent debate labour obsession with revenue grab over sensible relief be choke the sector we need most do the shadow secretary of state agree that there seem to be disjointed approach where the health secretary be ask for more healthcare in the community whereas we will be ask anybody who move from central location into the community to pay these additional taxis and rate the hon member be right there be no logic to the government approach they be give with one hand and take with the other and they be make the kind of decision he talk about ever more difficult lord amendment and address the rating regime for anchor store on our beleaguered high street we echo the word of the john lewis chief executive nish kankiwala who warn that labour budget be two handed grab at retailer that pile on national insurance increase while refuse to reform business rate as it promise to do retailer face billion hit from these policy with consumer brace for high price as result these amendment exempt anchor store the vital engine of our town centre from the high multipli it be lifeline that labour seem determined to withhold unoccupied anchor store would also escape this punishing rate prevent empty shopfront from become permanent scar on our highstreet set the threshold for the high multipli at be blunt instrument as the minister concede can assure the government that this will have consequence for business that be not big tech giant it will hit large supermarket supermarket delivery and large department store show that the labour government have not think it through conservative members have rightly decry labour neglect of retail and they be right the leader of the opposition have rightly highlight that labour rate multipli fiasco be kill off the high street while real reform be dodged business face double whammy of high taxis and no certainty thank to government who be more interested in punish aspiration than power growth labour failure to shield those business betray the shopkeeper the worker and the family who depend on thrive high street not ghost town labour be put both those cost on retailer on the high street exempt anchor store from the high multipli would help support our high street be unoccupied anchor store not subject to the high multipli those business would have less of strain on they when it come to make decision on what they be to do with their premise support business ability to plan for the long term be something that we must consider in all legislation and policy our concern about the bill be share by kpmg which describe the government plan to change the business rate system as set out in the bill as create uncertainty for business when consider the liability that they will need to factor in to forward planning turn to lords amendment we confront yet another symptom of labour ill conceive assault on business picture this thriving firm with premise value at dare to invest in its future with perhaps modest expansion new equipment or refit to stay competitive and that ambition tip its rateable value just over the threshold what be the reward under the bill staggering jump in business rate from roughly to near doubling of its tax burden overnight that be not fairness it be trap and punitive cliff edge that snare the aspirational and mock the very notion of fairness there must be great accountability for these new multiplier and tier which threaten to crush business under arbitrary threshold the lords be absolutely right to demand review by the secretary of state to probe the real world impact of the change especially on firm teeter near that mark business that employ our constituent anchor our community and drive our economy by mandate consultation with sector expert the lords amendment would ensure that future decision on business rate be root in evidence not ideology offer parliament and government chance to course correct before more livelihood be sacrifice to labour reckless tax experiment the final group lords amendment to relate to perhaps the most objectionable part of the bill the levying of business rate on independent school let reiterate the opposition view that education should never be tax over the weekend the times publish number of alarming story outline the impact that vat on school fee have have on family it tell the story of leanne self employ accountant who work between am and midnight seven day week to pay for the increase in cost to her disabled son education that have come as result of level vat on school fee which be exacerbate by business rate on independent school the same article highlight study that have show that one in five family with child with special educational need and disability who attend private school have already remortgage their home one in eight have sell their home altogether that be before business rate have be levy as have already highlight the bill will also levy business rate on nursery school and sport facility on the site of private school that be use by the general public this measure be simply wrong and agree with the other place that the statutory instrument require to bring in the regulation should be vote on by both house before such measure can be introduce call the liberal democrat spokesperson here we go again this be very similar to what we speak about last week so will again put on record my thank to the noble lords for their work in push forward the amendment from the other place we welcome the business rate reform and look forward to far more substantial overhaul of the system however we be deeply concerned about the proposal for hospital lord amendment seek to exclude hospital and it be so disappointing that that be not accept in my area in dorset both poole and royal bournemouth hospital would be catch by the rateable value rule poole hospital have rateable value of million and bournemouth be million world famous hospital include great ormond street the royal marsden and england old hospital barts would all be catch up the government have rightly be proud of the early delivery of extra nhs appointment but keep hospital in the bill risk real problem for local council which might find themselves have to take difficult decision to take the hit and not charge their hospital the high amount to take away the discretion altogether ask ministers please to remove the provision from the bill so that hospital do not pay twice share the concern of the shadow minister regard the business that be on the cusp of the threshold the impact of flip just over from the low to the high multipli could be profound so many business be already on the cusp give the national insurance increase the living wage and the impact of the employment rights bill the additional worry about tip over into the high threshold could see many fail to invest in their business for the future will keep this brief because we know where we be we too do not agree with the taxation of education and we continue to support the lords amendment to remove private school from the legislation the main reason that we feel that way be that we know that many parent of child who have additional need choose the private sector because it be so difficult to get what they need in overcrowded school that be fall apart at the seam we therefore fundamentally disagree with the principle of tax education the government have make good start on the bill we want to see much more fundamental review of business rate there be long way to go but we think that the amendment if accept would demonstrate government who be listen at time when trust in the government need to be build government who listen to sensible amendment would be most welcome thank the government for bring the bill forward but have to put on record some of my concern the minister will not be surprised he know that it be never mean in an aggressive way put thing forward in this way because it be important that my constituent have chance to express themselves through in this chamber first echo the concern of the shadow minister and the liberal democrats spokesperson in relation to hospital and medical and dental school have some concern over how that will trickle down as it will inevitably and put pressure on sector where it do not need to be the job of those three area be to ensure that our hospital can deliver the care and our medical and dental school can produce the student with the expertise and knowledge to be the next generation of those who look after we my major concern however be about private school know the point have be echo many time but can not let this occasion go without make my remark on which have seek the direction of madam deputy speaker and other party member will be aware of the issue with private school and have speak about it on numerous time to put forward the argument for the faith school in my constituency parent scrimp and save to ensure that their child can go to those school and have the standard of education that they wish for they and they have ask to put that on record the reason persist in raise the issue be that truly believe that some people of faith will be far disadvantage when the bill go through know that that be not the government intention but it will be the reality and for that reason must put it on record although the rating provision will not apply in northern ireland per se the disadvantage to our sector remain in the removal of the tax consideration which will affect school in northern ireland that be where the issue be for the mainland the effect be quite clear but school in northern ireland will be affect as well wish to be clear that oppose these provision on behalf of faith base school on the mainland as well because parent of child at those school want the same as those who speak to be very proud member of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief and believe that that extend to parent freedom to educate their child with view to how their faith be work into that education lord amendment have be refer to by the shadow minister and by the hon member for mid dorset and north poole vikki slade for many parent confidence that their faith will not be dismantle in the classroom be worth the financial burden of pay into their child education but that be be deny by this legislation believe that they all deserve the opportunity to educate their child in way that they wish for which they will probably pay handsomely but these proposal will adversely affect parent freedom to educate their child in their religious belief the option to home school be one that parent may not have consider previously yet may now feel be the only financial option available for they those parent may not feel qualified or equip to deal with the skill that be vital to home schooling yet believe there to be no option as they simply can not afford to pay the uplifted fee that be the unfair burden that fall on the shoulder of those parent firmly believe that the government disagree with almost every lords amendment because the lords amendment interfere with the public revenue and affect the levy and the application of local revenue the commons do not offer any further reason trust that this reason may be deem sufficient basically that mean we need the money have be member of this house for almost year and an elect representative for some year as councillor and member of the assembly and never ever have believe that money be the bottom line and do not believe that many right hon and hon member believe that we can not take faith base education out of the hand of certain class of people to punish those high class school with swimming pool let assure the house that bangor independent christian school with its sunbeams nursery school have no pool regent house prep in my constituency have no swimming pool either there be small primary school that will have difficulty operate when these regulation come into force and that be simply not right know that the strength of the labour government mean that this bill will pass but be urge individual mp across the house to consider who will be punish and to urge the government to review this tax raid on education even at this late hour we believe in the right to live one faith and we can not tax that right out of reach that be where this bill have go wrong and have divorce itself from the reality of the people that represent think address the majority of the point in my opening speech that have be raise subsequently but thank member for their contribution we have hear the opposition concern that the multiplier do not deliver on the state intention of the policy as announce in the budget we clearly do not agree with that position at the budget the government announce their intention to introduce two low multiplier for qualify retail hospitality and leisure property to end the uncertainty of the annual retail hospitality and leisure relief also as set out in my opening speech the relief be temporary stopgap measure of course it have be extend year on year but it do not provide the certainty that business require it have create cliff edge during our last session can not remember when it be it feel like it be yesterday the hon member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake seem to acknowledge that the cliff edge that be build in the previous system be provide uncertainty to business and their ability to plan ahead he must surely welcome the fact that this new lower multipli this permanent relief give all business whether they be retail hospitality or leisure the long term security that they have be ask for and importantly in way that be sustainable and self financing through the business rate system through the bill the government be take step to address all the issue that have be outline the choose approach be both appropriate and prudent and the challenging fiscal environment that the government face require it any tax cut must be appropriately fund under our commitment to sound financial management so the government intend to introduce high multipli for all property with rateable value of and above it be important to say this to settle some of the argument that will affect less than of property in england less than will pay more but that will fund the low multipli as we all recognise that will help our town centre and our high street and it be what we need to do this approach deliver on the policy set out in the budget and on our manifesto commitment to transform the business rate system to make it fair and fit for the century and to protect the high street on the comment about the multiplier for the healthcare sector of course health provider be subject to the same business rate regime that have be the case for year since the crown estate end its exemption member will know that they will also know that the financial support give to the national health service this year be record billion so that it could deal with the legacy that this government be leave which be importantly hold the country back that billion be go where it be need and of course any decision about future financing be matter for the treasury at the appropriate point on the review of the threshold we have already say that there be provision in the bill to address that the minister say that the solution that he have alight on meet his manifesto commitment but his manifesto say this new system will level the play field between the high street and online giant that be not what the provision do not exclusively he know that it levy extra taxis extra business rate on high street store large department store supermarket football stadium and many other they be not online giant the rating system adequately reflect the scale of property less than of property in the business rate system will use the high multipli that will fund the tax break for those on the high street that will use the low multiplier in the evidence session the hon gentleman be there we hear retailer say of course that will have an impact on our distribution centre but we have so many store that be below the threshold that allow national retailer with multiple location to benefit in the round they find themselves well off as result of this policy as for rebalance the situation for online retailer and those on our high street that be exactly what this measure do big distribution centre will pay for that relief once again thank hon member for their contribution but for the reason set out respectfully ask this house to disagree with the amendment before we question put that this house disagree with lords amendment the house proceed to division order as the escalator in portcullis house be still not work

page line at end insert the impact of the exercise of the relevant function on the provision of level apprenticeship in england amendment in clause page line leave out subsection and and insert this act come into force at the end of the period of one year begin on the day on which skills england be create in consider the transfer of function from the institute for apprenticeships and technical education we face fundamental question about the government accountability and the future structure of our skill system while modest in size the bill have far reach implication for that system and for million of learner and apprentice it represent significant centralising of power in the hand of the secretary of state without provide proper mechanism for parliamentary oversight or accountability have sit through many hour of debate on the bill during which labour member have extoll the virtue of skills england but let emphasise again that the bill do not actually establish that body as many assume that it would it simply abolish ifate and transfer its function to the secretary of state an approach that risk create governance vacuum in which there be no proper scrutiny or independent oversight it be clear from the evidence receive by the bill committee that be not alone in have those concern the association of colleges the royal society of chemistry the university of winchester and the institute of the motor industry all raise similar issue relate to governance and accountability in their write evidence submission to the committee as be note by many on second reading skill policy in this country have suffer from constant reorganisation and restructuring the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds have remind we several time that skills england will be the skill body to be establish in year give that history employer provider and learner desperately need stability and clarity in its evidence the university of winchester warn the transfer of power from ifate to the secretary of state for education raise question about the independence of the propose skills england regulatory body it also observe that in ifate at present employer and academic come together to ensure that the standard be industry relevant current and academically rigorous the skills federation raise similar concern the clause in the bill which transfer power from ifate to the secretary of state risk shift the development of standard far away from employer demand it also say too much centralisation lead to lack of focus on sector need do my hon friend agree that the new clause would help college such as bridgwater and taunton college the big provider of apprenticeship in england will he join and other member in encourage those college on their path towards award their own degree entirely endorse what my hon friend have say and certainly encourage those college on their path as will explain my new clause will enable skills england to support they more fully equally concern be the need for effective cross departmental co ordination skill policy do not exist in isolation skill england need to work with among other the industrial strategy advisory council on future workforce need the migration advisory committee on reduce reliance on overseas worker the department for energy security and net zero on green skill the department for work and pensions on employment programme the department for science innovation and technology on priority sector the department of health and social care on workforce planning and follow the chancellor spring statement last week the new defence growth board on critical skill for our defence industry in the past the hon gentleman have mention the construction sector we welcome the news that the government will build million house but that require builder plumber carpenter electrician and plasterer and they must be train so that they can do that job well do he feel that his new clause will enable the building of those million house would hope that well scrutiny and accountability in parliament would help with deliver what be require and hold the government to account when it come to keep their promise on the cross departmental work that mention the lack of publish framework for skills england as we consider the bill be deeply concern and what we have see so far suggest structure that be heavily department for education centric without statutory independence and appropriate seniority skills england will struggle to drive the cross departmental co ordination that member on both side of the house agree our skill system need be listen carefully to what the hon gentleman say he be of course right that the measure would represent considerable centralisation if it be not for the creation of skills england he have mention number of government departments do he think that ifate non governmental body have be successful in bring all their work together and that government body will not be or be he argue for something different will come to my preference for an executive agency that fit what the government want to do that be the reason for my new clause and do not think that it need delay effort ultimately statutory departmental body would have more clout on the basis of what we understand at least think that the remit for skills england be very different from the remit for ifate when it come to that cross departmental working this government have just take bold action by abolish nhs england the large quango in the world part of the motivation for do so be the need to ensure that when something be not go right in the nhs the buck do not stop with quango that we back bench mps can not question directly but with ministers that be well for governance and for scrutiny it mean that when the health secretary say that something be not go well enough we can question he robustly and challenge he to improve surely the hon gentleman see that the way to push skills england to be as robust as possible be by have strong governance there be different option and will come to this issue later give the scale of cross departmental working require have skills england sit outside single government department be probably more effective moreover such body can be hold accountable effectively by parliament as we have see with some other quango indeed believe the industrial strategy advisory council will be set up as statutory independent body when time allow and suggest that skills england be of the same order of magnitude beyond the concern about accountability and cross government authority there be practical operational risk to the approach lay out in the bill the skills federation warn in its evidence that there be key risk that transfer of function from ifate will become the key focus for the set up of skills england and less attention and potentially resource place on achieve the overarching aim there be significant concern that the broad strategic purpose of skills england could be lose in the rush to transfer operational function that concern be echo by lord blunkett who suggest that there be real danger that ifate will swamp skills england at birth official report house of lords november vol the government impact assessment also acknowledge risk note that the transfer of function could potentially cause temporary slowdown in the growth rate of new apprenticeship and technical education course due to potential delay in the approval process which may disproportionately impact disadvantaged learner in committee the minister emphasise the urgent need to address skill shortage and say that delay be not an option although we share the government commitment to address skill shortage urgently respectfully suggest that there be wisdom in heed the warning that the university of warwick give in its evidence get the foundation right be more important than hasty construction in light of those concern table new clause which propose in committee it provide constructive solution to many of the issue that have outline and propose clear pathway for establish skills england as dedicated executive agency within the department for education as say my party ultimately believe that fully independent statutory body with cross departmental authority be the optimal approach but we recognise the government preference for the executive agency model so new clause work within that structure but provide essential safeguard under the new clause the secretary of state would produce draft proposal for establish skills england within six month lie the proposal before both house secure parliamentary approval before establish the agency provide annual statement on the agency work and evaluate its effectiveness month after establishment this approach strike the right balance between allow the government to implement policy at their desire speed and ensure proper parliamentary scrutiny and meaningful stakeholder engagement as say table new clause in committee because believe that parliamentary scrutiny be essential for an organisation with such far reach responsibility the minister argue that the standard accountability mechanism for executive agency be sufficient however contend that skills england be not just another executive agency it be central to the government economic growth mission and to create opportunity for million of people standard executive agency protocol be build for business as usual function not for what should be transformative body at the heart of the government economic strategy have properly accountable skills england even as an executive agency would ensure that employer voice remain central to standard development rather than be merely consultative that technical expertise be maintain and develop across economic cycle that parliament maintain appropriate oversight for this critical area of policy and crucially that political short termism do not override long term skill plan in committee the minister argue against new clause on several ground first she suggest that it would cause unnecessary delay in address urgent skill challenge secondly she point to the exist accountability mechanism for executive agency include framework document and reporting requirement thirdly she emphasise that skills england be already operate in shadow form and be poise to take these function when the bill pass let address those concern on the issue of delay new clause would require reporting and parliamentary approval within six month reasonable timeframe that would not significantly impede progress as the skills federation note proper planning for the transfer of function be essential for success and parliamentary scrutiny would reinforce rather than impede the effective delivery of skills england the exist accountability mechanism be indeed important but they be surely insufficient for an organisation of skills england significance as the university of winchester argue in its evidence to the public bill committee skills england should be structure to ensure and protect its regulatory independence from government and other agency the framework document and annual report be important tool but they be prepare by the executive without any meaningful parliamentary input skills england current shadow operation be welcome preparation but operate in shadow form without parliamentary scrutiny or approval only underscore the need for new clause important decision about structure governance and priority be be make right now without any oversight in this place the secretary of state indicate on second reading that the government may review skills england status in to month to consider whether it need to be an independent statutory body and the minister confirm that timetable in committee but why wait why create uncertainty about the future status of an organisation that need to establish credibility with employer now it be worth note as the shadow minister the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston neil do in committee that the government plan to put the industrial strategy advisory council on statutory footing when parliamentary time allow accord to their own documentation this suggest that they recognise the value of key strategic body statutory independence so why should skills england be treat differently new clause offer constructive path forward build on the debate we have already have personally be disappoint that the government oppose it in committee but believe that the case for proper parliamentary scrutiny remain compelling although my liberal democrat colleague and ultimately believe that fully independent statutory body would be the ideal model for skills england new clause would work within the government executive agency framework to add essential parliamentary scrutiny and accountability the minister assure we in committee that skills england will have robust governance arrangement and clear line of accountability if the government truly believe in those principle they should welcome rather than resist proper parliamentary oversight if skills england be to be the cornerstone of our skill system for year to come even as an executive agency with the department for education we must ensure that it have the transparency accountability and parliamentary oversight to withstand change in political priority and economic circumstance urge member across the house to support new clause which would strengthen the bill and help ensure that the transfer of function lead to well outcome for apprentice student employer and the economy as whole call pam cox happy birthday interruption do you wish to contribute or be you go to celebrate your birthday on the back benches sorry madam deputy speaker be rather blow away by that my birthday be actually on saturday but thank you so much it be pleasure to speak in favour of this bill as member of the public bill committee and of the all party parliamentary group on apprenticeship the bill be vital because it pave the way for the creation of skills england new and ambitious body that will bring fresh urgency to the task of upskille our young people and there be an urgency about this as the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom say skills england will build on the extremely valuable work of the institute for apprenticeships and technical education and would like to pay tribute order could you be seat for moment we be talk about the amendment to the bill not the overall bill the idea be to discuss the amendment and whether you disagree with they but you need to bring your contribution in line with the debate this evening thank you madam deputy speaker the issue be whether we should delay the introduction of this measure to allow more time to set up skills england lot of preparatory work have already be do to set up skills england as we discuss quite fully in committee and we should get go on training up the carpenter plumber electrician and other apprentice that we all know we need derby be see fresh boost to its city centre with new performance venue restore marketplace and the friar gate good yard which have stand derelict for year but be now be transform into new home what we do not want be for our ambition for our city to be hold back by skill shortage do my hon friend agree that rather than the dither and delay propose by conservative members we need to get on with this legislation so that we can train the next generation of bricklayer roofer plasterer scaffolder and electrician that our country so desperately need thank my hon friend for her intervention and agree this morning before travel to westminster from colchester visit jtl national organisation with base in our city that train thousand of apprentice electrician and plumber and have similar exchange with they so very much agree because the urgency have mention be about their future secure their future we debate this in some detail in committee and the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire have outline the minister response to my mind those response stand be satisfied that we should not delay in set up skills england because the young people of colchester and indeed of derby and elsewhere simply do not have the time to wait on that note last week the government announce plan to train new construction worker to help build the million home we will see go up in the course of this parliament move such as that and many other show that we be work at pace to reverse the many year of stagnation will the hon lady give way will not give way if the hon member do not mind hope we can work at pace today to pass this bill rise order be the hon lady take an intervention be sit down have the hon lady conclude her speech or be she take an intervention have conclude want to make short contribution to this report stage debate particularly in favour of new clause and amendment on the train come up to westminster type into my tablet short ifate speech and every time do so it keep change it to short irate speech unfortunately be not very good at irate speech it be not really my thing so will make slightly disappointed speech but with hint of optimism because hope this minister may take this opportunity to do something of significant benefit for the technical and vocational education and training system in this country know why the government come forward with the idea of new quango it be not even quango but sort of semi quango call skills england they do that because they be go to have to talk to british industry about lot of other thing they know deep down that they would be do thing that be really very unpopular such as the employment rights bill and the massive hike in national insurance contribution and business rate and that aspect of those thing be bad for employment and unpopular with employer with skills england ministers then campaigner but now ministers have come up with something they think business would really like and want in truth however if the government be go to fix the two big underlying issue in our system the productivity gap we have in this country compare with france the united states and germany and the parity of esteem we all say we want and that the conservatives do want between academic learning and vocational learning we need to make technical and vocational education well we also need to make it simple and more appealing but above all it need to be make well that be entirely what the sainsbury review spearhead by the noble lord sainsbury labour lord be all about it be about give we simple more appealing system lead by business which would deliver the high quality of technical education take the right hon gentleman point about create parity between academic and technical education would useful step in the direction of attract people into the apprenticeship scheme be to ensure that they be pay the national minimum wage in line with their age group the truth be that there be always balance about apprenticeship of course there can be abuse in the past there be abuse of the apprenticeship system with the low rate that could be pay although many employer pay the full rate to people of whatever age who be do apprenticeship however it be also true that provider be get four day week not five of work from somebody and form of learning be involve it be the same with the opposite proportion when someone be do level which be partly do at college and partly on an employer premise there be always risk that if we make that gap too narrow few people may be afford that opportunity in the first place that balance have to be get right but take my hat off to all the many employer who have invest very strongly in their young people particularly in the way the hon member outline clearly quality can not be guarantee just by the structure of the government department or executive agency that oversee it but quality be less likely if we get that structure wrong the two key thing with ifate key to this debate and for the amendment we be consider be first its independence from the government and secondly that there be the guarantee business voice be talk in the past tense already but mean that it be independent and there be guarantee business voice which minister be not go to say we listen to business of course ministers will say we listen to business we want business to be at the heart of our plan and design they they will say that but it be not guarantee in what the government plan to set up and just say they will listen be not enough such independence give people mean the employer the young learner and everybody else the confidence of know that the government and it might not be this government could not erode the standard because they want to artificially increase the volume of people on those course it have be feature of the broad debate to have labour colleague say we go to get the number of people get apprenticeship up well wahey of course they be go to get the number up that much be blindingly obvious be remind of time in the past when many apprentice do not know they be on an apprenticeship so loose be the requirement the conservative government raise the minimum length of time for an apprenticeship and raise the minimum amount of time in off the job training in college base education the sainsbury review report that in many case qualification have become divorced from the occupation and sector they be there to serve we be already see with the change in the minimum length of apprenticeship from month to eight month the rowing back or erosion of that standard there be plenty of training in industry that do not require month minimum and there always have be but if somewhere be go to have short course just do not call it an apprenticeship that training be very worth while but that do not mean it be the same thing in germany which be the country people usually look to as the international standard on these matter an apprenticeship typically last for two or three year with two day week not one day week in college in those two day week young people typically do full timetable of what we in this country call general education or academic subject as well as vocational education in germany people can do an apprenticeship to become food and beverage manager but if they want to be bartender there be not an apprenticeship for that role because it do not take that long to train to be bartender they do another kind of training in this country we have come to strange position with the apprenticeship levy there be lot of lobby to count more and more thing as an apprenticeship so they can be pay for out of the apprenticeship levy that be not the right way around already we ask the word apprenticeship to do lot in most country it mean young people age or will the right hon gentleman give way could not resist the hon gentleman thank you very much that be niche view the right hon gentleman be talk about how the apprenticeship levy create straitjacket whereby there be real value to what be be offer but it perhaps should not fit into an apprenticeship be that not precisely the aim of the government approach be he not advocate for precisely what the government be suggest which be let make it more flexible let say it do have to be year there be value to investment of different kind to an apprenticeship be he not argue in favour of what the government be propose he be not no he be say something different of course there be value in all sort of training in my working career do various stint of training but they be not call an apprenticeship we do not have to call something an apprenticeship for it to be worthwhile piece of training already we ask the word apprenticeship to cover lot of thing as be say in most country it typically mean young people start their career here it cover career starter career developer and career changer if anything we ought to be think about how we can refocus and differentiate between the requirement that people have at different time of their career and the requirement their employer have as well the bill be not about to fix that or address that but be hopeful this be where start that the government have indicate that they have hear the message on the two key element need when certify and specify qualification independence and guarantee business voice new clause would create precisely that independence new clause which be move by the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom have lot of merit he put great deal of thought into it in committee but the additional point about statutory independence be fundamental if the minister be minded to accept just one amendment hope she will accept two what do we should be new clause think everybody in this house want skills england to succeed as with so many matter we debate we all broadly want the same end goal amendment be what would call breathing space amendment to make that success more likely it would reinstate the one year that their noble lordship put into the bill as it go through the other place mean that skills england would be operational for year before it have to absorb ifate function the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire go through some of the reason why absorbing ifate function be an enormous undertaking think the noble lord blunkett estimate that close to people would come into the organisation in his word from that debate which we have already hear ifate could swamp skills england at birth official report house of lords november vol skills england have much broad function than ifate its broad strategic function be incredibly important and it be not small they be different shape and size if you like skills england will initially prioritise sector the eight growth drive sector in the industrial strategy as well as construction and health and social care which be also list as essential to the government mission so there be sector to feed into the industrial strategy planning process the noble baroness smith of malvern have say that work be under way on eight of those which beg the question what about the other two on big level what about two of the three big volume employment sector hospitality and retail which for broad labour market strategy that include the skill we want in they be essential my right hon friend make an important point about the exclusion of number of sector there be danger that skills england will be very much tilt towards london and the south east ignore large area such as the midland and the north of england which will suffer as result of its very prescribed focus my right hon friend make very important point which stand on its own merit to refer back to the previous intervention as the mp for bournemouth east in the south west can assure the house that we be very excited about the prospect of extra construction come to our area in fact bournemouth and poole college tell that it have construction apprentice on its book but that it be have to turn away hundred more those be opportunity be lose the college welcome the abolition of ifate and the speedy transfer of responsibility to skills england do the right hon gentleman not agree that we should listen to college such as bournemouth and poole college of course we should be listen to college such as bournemouth and poole college we hear the government announce early that thousand of people be go to go into construction but then say that they could not do anything until they create this body and subsume the function of ifate into it do not see how all those thing fit together yes we want more people go into construction and long list of other sector too but that do not necessarily mean an apprenticeship in every case there be whole suite of exist technical and vocational course and level be still ramp up as well on breadth versus depth ifate have huge range with more than occupational standard for apprenticeship level and high technical qualification skill england be initially look at narrow set of sector but have much broad remit for they so it do more than ifate there be three big thing on its list the first be to identify where skill gap exist which be itself very significant task it may at first glance sound obvious but it really be not first there be question of what time horizon we be talk about be we talk about today or plan five or more year into the future more significantly be sure people would generally say that we could train more people to go into the social care sector the issue be not so much whether we have the training course available but whether people be willing and happy to go into the sector that be broad question secondly skills england have to work across government with the industrial strategy advisory council and the migration advisory committee as well of course as with the labour market advisory board under the dwp the mac be well establish body have be around for number of year that have remit on immigration it will not necessarily have the same perspective as skills england as the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire rightly say the isac be go to be give its own statutory footing which beg the question of where in the hierarchy skills england will be we want this to be body that be able to speak authoritatively right across government thirdly skills england be go to identify the training that should be accessible via the growth and skill levy that again be huge task what can be fund from the levy be huge strategic question what specific skill should we rightly expect firm to provide and what should be generalisable skill for the economy even after all that there be still the big question about supply and demand at college level this may come back to the point the hon member for bournemouth east tom hayes make about listen to college on which he be absolutely right we do not currently stop people do course because there be surplus of people in such and such sector and shortage somewhere else but some hard question be go to come up around the funding formulae for these thing to ensure that we do have enough people go into construction social care and so on my contention be that each of those function be enormous amendment would therefore perform useful role it be not about dither and delay but about allow skills england to establish itself and to carry out those key strategic function that it be there to do and then to be able to subsume the function from ifate it be pleasure to follow the contribution of the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds and the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom who speak powerfully to their amendment it may disappoint they to know that will be speak against both new clause as they risk undermine the speed with which we need to effect change in the sector it be privilege to speak in this debate on subject about which be very passionate and as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on apprenticeship the transfer of function to the secretary of state and the creation of skills england be one of the most critical reform this government be due to bring about it address one of the most damaging legacy of the previous government the fall in apprenticeship this matter when we look at the structure of the bill which be why be concerned about new clause and in particular it also matter in constituency like mine in peterborough and in neighbour st neots and mid cambridgeshire where we have see fall apprenticeship start fall training and rise unemployment peterborough be city with one of the high level of young people not in education employment or training this be not just the folly of opportunity lose and young people let down but the story of fail economy take the opposite view to that express by the right hon member for east hampshire who seem to elevate the independence of skills england as virtue in respect of what it could deliver see the independence of ifate as one of the tool that lead to its failure the fact of its independence remove it from economic need make it bureaucratic and mean it fail to address the need of business and other provider to get the flexibility and delivery of skill that we need independence do not always guarantee success or the thing that we need would the hon gentleman extend that principle to the academic route have ask the minister this question number of time now do not think we would stand for anyone say that the standard and specification for level should be set in sanctuary buildings by the department for education if we would not do it for level why would we think it be right for level what be the answer to that think we need mixed economy in this area the principle elevate in this debate be speed substance and bring business around the table alongside provider and college such as my excellent provider in peterborough aru peterborough with its new university campus to deliver the good and get the job do my concern with new clause and and amendment be that they elevate level of independence that do not address the overall issue in fact many of the issue the right hon member for east hampshire describe in his speech be actually around delivery and political choice have the secretary of state and the department establish skills england will make it much more likely in my view that we deliver at speed on those challenge however be sure scrutiny will come from all party of this house if that be not the case our no mission be economic growth spread across all part of the uk and build on diverse base of industry and service the government have already make powerful start which could be undermine by these amendment if they cause further delay with early work on the growth and skill levy to drive up standard and place the move to functional english and math foundation apprenticeship provide flexibility and route in and million investment in construction skill particularly welcome the reply from my right hon friend the minister for skills who have acknowledge in write answer the need for social mobility to be factor that skills england will consider so that we can actually change people life opportunity this be something be passionate about and which the co operative group and other employer have talk to consider to be very important this mission will fail without the urgency need to get the bill pass and to get skills england up and run skills england have already be set up in shadow form give the urgency of the task it provide the good of external industry leadership in its skills england shadow board which will move to full board it provide independence for the voice around the table and therefore already meet the need that new clause and seek to address it also focus on delivery and the speed with which we can get go to bring job and opportunity to all part of the country the government have already be clear before these new clause and amendment be table that the transfer of the institute statutory function to the secretary of state will introduce more flexibility to the skill system which wholeheartedly endorse it will allow we to be more responsive to the need of employer learner and the economy which also endorse the secretary of state will delegate these power to skills england think new clause and risk delaying and create confusion rather than aid purpose and delivery of what we need therefore oppose the move to create separate executive agency or to bind skills england before it be even create we need to get go this be not just political slogan or the subject of debate in this house but the message hear from business provider and school in peterborough we need genuine partnership in place such as my community between college and employer to ensure that we be provide leadership at all level we need practical action and leadership work together to improve life and our economy the independence of ifate as say early elevate it to level that risk undermine the ability to get go quickly let provide an example few week ago meet mds not for profit membership organisation in my constituency that be pioneer in flexi job apprenticeship and training in the food supply chain work with some of the big name in the food sector to create workforce for tomorrow it be look to skills england and this bill to create the flexibility and opportunity that business and learner need it would be sorry to see any delay or confusion over structure when it know what need to be do to get the job it want this bill can the minister say what additional funding and resource be available to help business to provide pre apprenticeship training for individual who have be unemployed long term business want the government and skills england to do that quickly they want to understand how with sme and other the government be support the growth of flexi job apprenticeship to help industry to attract new talent into the food and fresh produce industry that be direct criticism of ifate and the structure we already have and there be concern that delay through new clause and will make it more difficult as we have hear skills england will identify the skill gap in our economy and work with the industrial strategy advisory council and the migration advisory committee to plug they the direct link between the industry the mac and the industrial strategy advisory council will address our industrial need and purpose at the necessary speed the new clause be not necessary this be bill about skill and about address our skill shortage and it need to get go support the bill and oppose new clause and and amendment during their time in government the conservatives break our apprenticeship system and betray young people the liberal democrats be thus call on the government if they be serious about growth to fix the apprenticeship sector by invest in education and training include by increase the availability of apprenticeship and career advice for young people wish to speak in support of new clause table by my hon friend the member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom which would require the secretary of state to bring forward proposal for the executive agency to be know as skills england there should be great emphasis on develop sector specific skill that support the natural ability and interest of each student believe that we should focus on strengthen career advice and link with employer in school and college to allow student clear alternative step into career that do not require they to go to university if that be not the good option any business will tell we that the apprenticeship levy do not work business can not get the funding that they need to train staff so hundred of million of pound worth of funding be return unspent only to disappear into the treasury if that money be ringfence to boost the further education budget it would at least benefit the employer that contribute but it do not be glad that the government be reform the current system but urge they to accept my hon friend amendment which would require clear plan for their new proposal we must improve not only the quality of vocational education include skill for entrepreneurship and self employment but pupil awareness of such skill as they make initial decision about their further education and career have speak to young people in my constituency who be undertake apprenticeship in the hospitality industry they have speak positively about the opportunity to develop their skill while earn wage however have also hear that many apprenticeship job do not pay enough for people to meet their living expense it be extremely important that young people be provide with footing solid enough not to discourage they from pursue apprenticeship in their field of interest believe that the low minimum wage for apprentice should be scrap we should ensure that apprentice be pay at least the same minimum wage as other employee their age constantly hear from small and medium sized business across my constituency who be struggle with workforce shortage we need to build capacity in the workforce and within the economy to drive growth and ensure that british business can hire people with the correct skill to allow industry to thrive apprenticeship have huge role to play in upskilling although be glad that the government be take action to reform the current system urge they to accept new clause which would give we proper detail on what the new system will look like apprenticeship could play crucial part in address many of the staff shortage that business face by equip people across the country with the skill that they need to thrive the liberal democrats have call on the government to truly invest in skill urge the minister to accept the new clause it be great pleasure to speak in this debate on new clause there be merit in the point that the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom raise there be legitimate question about the basis on which skills england operate many people want to see it be take seriously but whether it will be take more seriously as an independent body or as part of the government be big question on which there be different opinion the hon member for richmond park sarah olney say that the government need to get serious but adopt new clause or not adopt it will not in any serious sense make the difference to whether the bill be transformational one the new clause would make very small amendment to bill that be fairly limited in scope so we should be realistic about how much of difference we be debate there be some merit in the government argument that the drafting of the amendment would cause additional delay and would prevent skills england which already exist from get on with take the necessary power the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds make some interesting point it be always important to take seriously what he say he be former education secretary and serious man have listen carefully have to say that many of the complaint that he rightly make about our fragmented and complicated skill system and the extent to which many employer have feel distance from it be entirely legitimate criticism but be largely commentary on the system bequeath to we by year of the previous government the right hon gentleman consider it criticism of this government that they have policy that they think will be popular with business but see it as virtue as co chair alongside my excellent hon friend the member for peterborough andrew pakes of the all party group on apprenticeship have hear from business how much they welcome the great flexibility that the government propose it will be important to understand how skills england will seek to ensure that great flexibility there be real merit in degree apprenticeship which my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell raise but also hope that skills england will ensure far great provision at the bottom end of the scale not just at level and where take up have fall dramatically since the introduction of the apprenticeship levy but at level would like to see the apprenticeship levy be use to support people who have come out of our school system with very few qualification possibly have have an education health and care plan they be able to access work but will need long to get up to speed in job there be tremendous opportunity for level apprenticeship to support people with special need from traineeship into the world of work so hope that the government will consider they the right hon member for east hampshire describe the merit of the german skill system which be admire across the world but it be important to say that it involve far great cultural understanding one of the way in which the germans understand themselves be about their skill system and the value that they put into craft or trade achieve that be not just about the structure of our skill system it would require complete reversal of our understanding in this country over the past or year there be huge merit in much of the german system but we can not simply adopt it and imagine that we will somehow achieve cultural change it need to be wrap up in the industrial strategy that the government must continue to develop the right hon gentleman be absolutely right that the government envisage skills england have far wide scope than ifate welcome that because one of the great failure of the system under the previous government be that there be an array of unconnected body and initiative float around he refer to the skill system but right now do not believe that this country have skill system what we have be an array of initiative without any coherence very much hope that in skills england we have body that will start the task of bring our very complicated and fragmented system together have no idea whether skills england will be success but be confident that it could be the direction in which the government be attempt to go if they have the courage to follow it all the way have the potential to bring about the change that we desperately need we have basic understanding of level and apprenticeship in this country but we need much more coherent pathway through level and the previous government do tremendous amount to promote level apprenticeship which be popular in some trade but they mean get degree six or seven year down the line which be hell of long time many thing could go wrong in someone employment in that time they might lose their job or the company might cease to exist and in any case they might not want to commit to six or seven year have stop off point at level and so business understand that there be something beyond level that do not necessarily look like degree would be tremendously valuable hope that the government will look to do that of course it be fundamental that we listen to employer whether they be business or public sector employer and that all of they feel that they have stake in the skill system do not for minute believe that the government or skills england will not want to listen to employer who be entirely the arbiter of whether we have successful skill system but do not think that body have to be independent to listen to employer there be potential argument that body within government would be well place to take much more strategic approach than the independent ifate ever could it will be useful to hear how the minister anticipate skills england reach out and listen to employer and business particularly about which course will be appropriate for the growth and skill levy they might not look like apprenticeship but they will be crucial qualification that people will be able to work towards welcome the government decision to take forward many of the construction skill bootcamp the government quite understandably have question about the value of bootcamp huge amount of the previous government adult education budget go in that direction within the construction sector there be real value to they and be pleased to hear from training provider in my constituency that they have be tell that the construction bootcamp will carry on we often speak about the skill environment as though it be purely outside of here but we member of parliament be all employer and we be all involve in skille up our staff be very pleased to say that my apprentice ellie chapman recently successfully complete her level apprenticeship she be not an apprentice mp but an apprentice office support worker and she have do tremendous amount in my office over the last month she be also top in her class at chesterfield college hon member hear hear thank you very much and well do ellie it be important that we walk the walk as well as talk the talk encourage other member of parliament to consider whether they have role for an apprentice in their office on that happy note encourage the government to keep go and to listen to employer it be really important that we get this right because there be nothing more important for the success of our economy than have more coherent skill system that enable we to make the very good of all our people it be pleasure to speak in this debate and to follow my hon friend welcome this bill and the establishment of skills england oppose new clause and and amendment do not agree with the amendment to delay because we need action now the bill be crucial step forward in addressing challenge feel across the country particularly in south east cornwall we need access to well pay stable employment close to home so that people do not have to leave their community or take on debt just to access high skill and wage in my area transport connectivity be barrier to employment cornwall and the south west have be overlook and underfunde the bill represent labour focus on crack on and deliver real change for people who really need it want to ensure that the bill deliver for south east cornwall and across the duchy and the south west there be already great apprenticeship scheme establish but we must make sure that more of they be viable and accessible that be what the bill deliver in the most recent full academic year of there be apprenticeship start in south east cornwall but only people successfully achieve their apprenticeship standard of those who start the majority be age or old and the most common level of study be intermediate be very proud of those who achieve their apprenticeship standard and know there will be many more to come however be concerned that our young people have not be able to access these opportunity as readily as should have be possible and that those who take up apprenticeship under the previous government do not always progress to high level the apprenticeship start represent significant drop from when apprenticeship scheme be start south east cornwall the number continue to decline over the five year before the labour government take office represent decrease in apprenticeship start over five year the bill be vital opportunity to reverse this decline which be feel really strongly in south east cornwall and to bring much need improvement to our workplace our economy and local skill we need to remove unnecessary barrier and blockage in the skill system so that we can respond more quickly to the need of apprentice their employer and the economy skills england already exist in shadow form and it be time to bring it directly out into the light and make it work for those who need it most know that local resident and business in south east cornwall be concerned about stability and future opportunity the bill with its establishment of skills england be an opportunity to deliver the stability that business need to plan their workforce invest in skill development and create quality job for local people close to home by make the apprenticeship levy more flexible we can ensure that fund be use effectively support lifelong learning and provide structured training opportunity through the alignment of skills england with our national industrial strategy we can promote co ordinate skill plan across the country while the focus on devolution mean that local solution can be tailor to local need this be vital for cornwall

tangible benefit to south east cornwall so that we have the skill and opportunity to thrive look forward to work with the government to ensure that the bill deliver on its promise will aim to keep my remark brief have speak on second reading and serve on the bill committee before speak about why we should not amend the bill to include new clause and and amendment will set the scene madam deputy speaker you will be unsurprise to hear that warmly welcome the role that the bill will play in pave the way for skills england it be right that we crack on and allow the secretary of state to transfer to skills england the tool to find and fill the skill gap across the country so that the workforce be equip with the skill to power economic growth my constituency sit just next to stansted airport and we have many young people undergo course at the stansted airport college which be privileged to visit last friday do not take whirl on the simulator to learn how to fly plane save that for future visit be delighted to find out how the college use our local talent in hertford and stortford to fill the critical grow skill gap in the aviation and aerospace sector and to see the career focus course that be give young people skill for work and life just this morning be proud to welcome the minister for school standards to manor fields primary school in bishop stortford where we hear about the impact of the teaching assistant apprenticeship for local support staff and meet the fantastic provider of those course it be really move to hear the apprentice talk about how their confidence have be build by take those course for young person the opportunity to find and develop skill or something they be passionate about do not just get they into the workforce it build their confidence and help they to find the path that be right for they that be why it be so important that we get skills england set up and do not delay get the bill through know about this from personal experience have leave school at do not follow the path of an apprenticeship do not know what the direction be for apprenticeship be so important for young people who need to find path and need the certainty of career at the end of it but perhaps do not want to stay in traditional education it build their confidence and help they find their place in the world this be work that we simply can not delay young people be be let down by skill system that be not work for they one in eight young people be not in education employment or training which be hold they back and the economy back too in more than third of uk vacancy be due to skill shortage we need urgent reform we can not afford to delay urge hon member to pass the bill unamende this evening so that the government can get on with reform the skill system and deliver skills england to create the opportunity for young people in hertford and stortford and across the country that will build their confidence help they find path that be right for they and make difference to their life be proud to serve on the bill committee for this vital legislation it be small bill but by goodness it be mighty rise to speak against amendment in do so will highlight local success story in recognition of the third national supported internship day it take place on march which also happen to be my birthday for year bracknell and wokingham college my local college and activate learning have be work together with over employer to offer support internship placement for learner with special educational need the scheme offer invaluable opportunity and provide the skill confidence and qualification necessary to thrive in the workplace their partner include the national grid the royal berkshire hospital johnson johnson and sodexo it be an excellent example of local college work with big player in the energy medical and food industry to provide high quality scheme for stable well pay employment it be proof that young people with special educational need can thrive with the right support we face one in eight young people be not in education employment or training the number be at an year high after year of the tories and we need more support internship to address the challenge skills england will deliver opportunity across the country in key industry include green energy construction and healthcare that be vital for the government five mission and for community like bracknell it be step towards end fragmentation less complex more flexible skill system will deliver for young people especially those with special educational need by bring together the constituent part of the skill architecture skills england will create system that be fit for purpose responsive to the need of employer and business and capable of drive economic growth in the year to come it will lay the ground for well system there be need to move fast as the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds point out the uk productivity be almost below that of the us and below that of other major economy such as france and germany major reason for that be lack of appropriate skill so the conservatives amendment which would delay the creation of skills england by year be nothing short of irresponsible we need to work fast not more slowly the amendment be indicative of their approach to government where there be challenge they duck it where decision be need they put it off and when broken system need fixing they leave it for the next lot well the next lot be now in government and will not put off for tomorrow what need to be do today we know that skill be crucial driver of economic growth and the key to tackle productivity gap but our economy be change rapidly in way we can not fully anticipate so it be crucial that our education system equip young people with broad range of the skill necessary for success in the job market of tomorrow that be exactly what the bill and skills england will deliver on the face of it this be technical bill but the benefit and opportunity that the transition to skills england can create across the country include in community such as birmingham northfield be real and tangible the amendment would have similar effect in term of timing while new clause would delay the establishment of skills england by six month new clause and amendment would delay it by year there be risk that by accept such amendment we would recreate ifate under the name of skills england as my hon friend have say we can not wait that long new approach be need as the first skills england report which be publish last september identify there have be steady decline in employer investment in training during the past decade investment in real term have fall by about even though of the role in critical demand across the economy require training or education in my constituency apprenticeship start fall by during the last parliament more than double the national rate this be social issue as well because more than half the young people not in education employment or training in northfield be class as vulnerable and adult skill fund education be access particularly in the area of my constituency with some of the high level of social need include longbridge and west heath weoley and the three estate in king norton be sure the situation be similar for other hon member accord to response to freedom of information request in some billion year nationally in apprenticeship levy funding be unspent at the same time major local employer have express their frustration to about skill shortage in area from construction and home upgrade to computer science have see some of the good work already do locally to provide apprenticeship and other form of technical education next month we will witness the anniversary of the closure of mg rover in my constituency today south and city college birmingham which be partly build on the old austin site be one of the large training provider in the west midland number of hon member have pay tribute to their local college and would like to do the same that college offer impressive programme develop the technical and soft skill of student in multitude of industry include catering automotive and advanced manufacturing as manufacture job start to return to longbridge these facility and the experienced staff who work there will be vital to deliver economic growth and opportunity for young people but they be attempt to fit into system that be not fit for purpose and be not work in other word skill policy be essential for the government plan for economic recovery and industrial strategy and it be appropriate to place accountability for the new development directly with ministers for this period we hear lot on the bill committee as well as elsewhere about whether skills england should be create as stand alone agency at arm length from the core department as we hear on second reading the government may review skills england status after month to two year which seem like sensible way forward that be legitimate debate but we should not agree tonight to delay skills england creation it be important to say that ifate have not live up to expectation and that the status quo be barrier to the government objective nine year ago the then minister for skill nick boles tell the house education skills and the economy sub committee that ifate would be much more akin to the bank of england in term of its independence compare with traditional arm length organisation think most hon member would agree that that have not be bear out during the last parliament attend meeting of the uk shipbuilding skill taskforce where there be common agreement between employer and employee representative organisation that the gcse entry level requirement be barrier for employer take on the young people who be well equip for those apprenticeship however that recommendation be block by dfe ministers we be give to understand from the final report similarly employer and people with direct knowledge of the skill system have talk to over the last few week have stress some of the frustration that exist in the trailblazer employer organisation within the bureaucracy of ifate some recommendation and expertise would be either delay or disregard by the route panel some of which be make up of employer who do not necessarily have expertise in particular industry it be important to reduce some of that bureaucracy so the bill effect of remove requirement for regular review of an apprenticeship standard in practice every few year be sensible change there be at the last count live apprenticeship list on the ifate website that imply review every year or four week think we be entitle to question how effective those review can be give ifate current resource if may will list one more example of where the current system be go wrong the special educational need and disability teach assistant apprenticeship standard which be discuss during the last parliament and then formally create during this one list very large number of organisation that contribute to its design the overwhelming majority be employer who of course need to be represent only one trade union be represent and question why that be the case however not single send parent organisation or other group that represent the need of those young people be draw into the creation of that standard think we be entitle to ask whether that be the right approach the discussion that lead up to the creation of the standard in practice be heavily dfe guide so think we be entitle to question the independence of the current system as it exist we speak at length in committee or at least the right hon member for east hampshire damian hinds do think we all enjoy it about the history of skill education in this country there have be number of attempt to create skill body to serve government policy in preparation for this debate be interested to note that when the conservative secretary of state for employment maurice macmillan announce in the creation of one of the forerunner of the body the manpower services commission he say that skill training body ought to have direct responsibility to the minister and the department of the day another point be relevant to policy development in this area in establish that body he seek the input and representation of employee as well as employer through the process at this point for the avoidance of doubt draw attention to my declaration in the register of members financial interests and my membership of the gmb and unite construction trade union because want to return to clarification and reassurance that the minister make in letter to the public bill committee member in respect of the implication of clause she clarify that nothing in those power could override the constitution of the construction industry training board and the engineering construction industry training board the industry training board have long history in skill training which hope will be revisit by this government as they address some of the very challenging skill programme that will be need to deliver the energy transition arguably the most successful skill mass training programme in this country be the one that underpin the transition from town gas to natural gas in the and oversee by the gas industry training board perhaps we could do with that body be recreate one of the very important point about that programme which survive multiple change of government and deliver that transition before time and under budget be that the trade union have very heavy involvement they include the general and municipal workers union the forerunner of today gmb which have formal consultative role on the curriculum that be oversee by that body over time the trade union have be squeeze off the board of both the citb and the ecitb the remain industrial training board which be contrary to the original intention of parliament in the legislation that underpin those body therefore hope that in the course of continue policy development in this area this government will look at that issue because as minister have rightly assure we employee voice will be represent through skills england hope that that can be the case for the remain training board as well it be vital that the next generation of worker have the necessary skill to meet the industrial challenge we face whether it be construct new home develop our infrastructure or meet our environmental target most importantly however we must ensure that the next generation of young people be provide with the skill and opportunity to develop their potential and pursue their ambition will be glad to join my colleague in vote against the amendment in front of we tonight if may will start by join my colleague on the government benches in my opposition to new clause new clause and amendment well mean they may be but be impatient for change stoke on trent have one of the high rate of youth disengagement in education employment or training in the country as always when we look at those heat map we see the big yellow splodge in the middle of the midland which be stoke on trent show that we have one of the high number of worker in the country with no form of formal qualification whatever our young people tend to find themselves unable to access any form of training or support that they need to make future career for themselves declare my interest as governor of the city of stoke on trent sixth form college as we offer level even though do not have an apprentice in my office like my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins as of next week level student will be in placement there for the next month to help their advancement my impatience stem from the necessity of identify the skill that we need in the city represent and of make sure that the next generation of young people come through education have they that be the only way can see for we to fulfil our desire and ambition to rebuild our economy and attract those high quality well pay and long term job into the city that will mean high wage and the ability to dig ourselves out of our city economic trouble do not expect or hope any government to come over the hill like cavalry with big sack of cash say here you go here be what you need it be partly on we to do that by match up the skill that we have and the skill that we need in the city to do the job of today and the future job of tomorrow that be really important the local skill improvement plan put together by our chamber of commerce and college have go some way to achieve that however as always it be bit like wad through treacle because we get to where we think we be go to be and all of sudden something appear that make it more difficult then the people who struggle with that be the young people be afraid that anything that seek to delay the advancement of this bill such as new clause new clause and amendment will not get my support this evening do however wish to spend few minute on my own new clause which be probe amendment it be not intend to cause any frustration or divisions say to the whip that be not seek to test the house opinion on it however when we consider what apprenticeship will look like in the future and what they mean for city such as stoke on trent it be important to understand that level apprenticeship fund by the apprenticeship levy be genuinely important part of the educational offer available to young people in my constituency the week before last visit djh accountant in stoke on trent which be significant regional player that be train its own generation of charter accountant at level use the apprenticeship levy that would otherwise just disappear into the treasury people there explain to quite succinctly and agree that through their own mean they simply would not have the available capital or cash to fund the quantity of training course that they run the apprenticeship levy allow they to grow group of young people into charter accountant the people meet be all young they be not at the mid or tail end of their career look for final bump before they get to their pension they be young people who have come in after gcse do their basic accountancy skill and have their eye firmly set on charter accountancy qualification the levy be allow they to do that ask the young people where they be all from expect they to be from the city which they be then ask they where they want to work once they have their charter accountancy status and wonderfully they all want to stay in stoke on trent and practise the craft that they have be learn the economic benefit of that to my city be that if it be not for the ability of that company to train to level use the apprenticeship levy it would have to import that labour from neighbouring area so somebody who already have the level qualification or have be train somewhere else through company that could afford it would come into stoke do the level job attract that level equivalent salary and take it back to where they actually live that would mean that the level salary those young people be go to earn and spend in stoke on trent would end up migrating to other slightly more affluent place in the midland and candidly there be many more affluent place in the midland than stoke on trent the economic damage do by turn off the apprenticeship levy or even the skill and growth levy from level apprenticeship could mean that the place such as stoke on trent that already suffer from ingrained regional inequality see it far ingrain into their local economy because the people who have those skill travel in to do the work or work from home and the money flow out of the city and be spend in those other local community there be also the message that we be send to young people in the city if level qualification be not available to they they will be unlikely to have the mean to pay for level qualification themselves have level qualification in stoke on trent be quite rarity you be more likely to find somebody with no qualification than with master level qualification new clause be hook to allow the minister to go away and consider this do not believe for one second that it be the determination of the government to artificially stymie or cap the aspiration of young people in stoke on trent by suggest to they that those level qualification be not available to they appreciate that there be concern in the system about the levy not be use for its intended purpose but to take people through high level qualification who already have career behind they there be obviously organisation and company that have do that because rather than send that money to the treasury they have seek to upskill their own worker understand why the government want to get tough on that because it be not what the levy be intend for but the level learner that have meet be all young they be people who have clear idea of the path and trajectory of the career they want to take and the levy simply make that more viable and likely to be achieve in an economically depressed and deprive place such as stoke on trent the other side of the issue be that of the apprenticeship at the university of staffordshire be at level and be at level it provide level training for the ministry of defence and number of public service some of that be fund by the apprenticeship levy that be an invaluable income stream for the university to deliver that training for people who then go back into the public sector to make it more efficient to crack down on waste and to deliver those skill that we as nation determine that we need that will undoubtedly need to be look at as we have more defence spending because we will need people with those level qualification in the defence sector in the manufacture company and in the electrical and chemical engineering company ordinarily company in place such as stoke on trent will simply not have the capital or the cash to provide that only by draw down from the apprenticeship levy will they be able to train people locally to do those job if we be not train people to do those job the opportunity that come from that government investment simply will not be feel in place such as stoke on trent and the regional inequality that be already quite clear in my city will become more entrenched my hon friend the member for hertford and stortford josh dean talk about find people find career and that be what all of we want for the young people in our community it be certainly what want for the learner in my city but that career should take they as far as they want to go that career should take they if they want up to level qualification that allow they to build life and career that they enjoy and be happy do my concern be that the unintended consequence of the government decision that level qualification will no long be available from the apprenticeship levy will be that in city such as mine aspiration and ambition will be cap because the cash and the capital be simply not there to meet those young people demand have no truck with or support for the delay amendment of the opposition and have no intention of do anything with my new clause other than sit down in moment hope that the minister will take back the concern that have raise this evening and see whether there be way maybe through devolution deal through reorganisation or through the mayoral strategic authority in which certain area could be able to continue with the levy funding for level qualification that we so desperately need rise to speak against new clause and and amendment the simple truth be that we can not have any more dither and delay our starting point in this debate must be the fact that we be in skill crisis and one that lie at the foot of the conservatives twenty six year ago work on the new deal taskforce for the labour government of the time clear up the mess that the major government have leave in the skill system fast forward over quarter of century and once again we find the labour government have to clear up the mess in skill leave by conservative the fact be stark today only of all adult hold level or qualification versus in germany and in canada some of our workforce be underqualifie for their job versus the oecd average of what be more the uk have high skill inequality than other equivalent country adult in the west midland be three time more likely to lack basic qualification at gcse level than those in london if we reach german level an extra people in the west midland would have high level qualification while of londoners look set to have high education by the figure for hull be only the system be not just struggle to provide our people with the skill they need it be fail to provide employer with the skill they need to drive growth one third of uk vacancy in be down to skill shortage for instance of employer cite digital skill as key for their business yet million working age adult lack they the skill system that the conservatives leave behind be let down our people and hold back our economy conservative members have talk about what be need let tell they what be need we need more strategic approach one that identify skill gap and flexibly co ordinate the government response to address they it need to be integrate and it need to take more strategic view that be exactly what skills england do skills england have already start its work and publish its first report and it will issue analysis later this year on sector to support the industrial strategy it will act as key ingredient in deliver that strategy and it will unlock the skill that employer need it already exist in shadow form skills england be ready to go and business be cry out for it yet what we have hear today be two suggestion the first be that despite that we should delay far for six month in the case of new clause and for year if not long in the case of new clause and amendment to those who propose this say simply this enough debate we need to get on with the job what they be propose be not constructive and would simply slow down the process of turn this country skill gap around the second thing we have hear be that skills england and ifate should run together for at least year despite their separate and in some case conflict remit let we be clear this would only create chaos with the different organisation step on each other foot the different remit would if anything dilute the impact of an industrial strategy the risk be that all the proposal make by the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston neil would lead to the recreation of the fail organisation by the back door it be time to put an end to this blocking and fiddling skills england be in the government manifesto the public vote for change and skills england be key part of deliver it let we end the delay defeat these amendment get skills england set up and get on with the task of deliver for the british people call the shadow minister find myself in complete agreement with the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom and our amendment new clause and amendment be suggest in the same spirit there be good reason why standard setting be put at arm length and close to employer but now the government be bring it into the department alongside other change such as shortening apprenticeship and ax high apprenticeship that risk damage the status of these qualification which we have be work to build up the budget be bad for employment and it will make it less likely that business will take on apprentice rather than address the problem that they be create the government be reorganise it be the umpteenth reorganisation in recent decade the government own recent impact assessment say that the reorganisation will lead to delay and drop in apprenticeship hence our amendment for decade politician have say that they want to make apprenticeship more prestigious on average twice as many people start apprenticeship each year under the last government as under the previous labour government but high apprenticeship grow fast of all the number of people on high apprenticeship go from just in to last year huge increase we increase the quality of apprenticeship too which be much need as have already be allude to by my right hon friend the member for east hampshire damian hinds in devastating ofsted report find that some apprentice who have be on an apprenticeship for more than year be not even aware that they be on an apprenticeship and the skill they be learn be thing like make cup of coffee which be not life change skill thing be be fund that do not benefit young people but do allow employer to pay low wage whereas we lengthen apprenticeship this government have cut the length of apprenticeship to eight month by abolish ifate and bring it in house at the dfe they be erode that employer ownership that we work to build up whereas we grow high apprenticeship they be about to abolish most level apprenticeship that be taste of what be to come if our amendment be not accept the government be do this because in opposition they promise that employer could take of their levy fund and spend they on other thing on november the parliamentary under secretary of state who will respond to this debate say that this commitment be currently be review but just week later on december the secretary of state say the government be still fully commit to flexibility for employer when ask the minister in committee whether that be still the policy she say that she would have to get back to as the skills minister say in the financial times far from the be promise as employer be lead to believe it will in fact all depend on the outcome of the spending review business be start to raise the alarm the british chambers of commerce have say that lack of clarity about the levy be create fresh uncertainty among business and be worrying and destabilising employer say that this be lead to firm pause hiring of apprentice since the levy be introduce in real term spend on apprenticeship and work base training have increase by about quarter from billion to billion move of all that money out of apprenticeship would obviously lead to substantial drop in the number of apprenticeship in write answer to ministers have confirm that the department have an internal forecast for the number of apprenticeship start but they have also say that they will not publish it think we all know why that be the previous government move to make it more attractive for small and medium sized enterprise to take on young people since april to year old have have funding rather than require the employer contribution we need to build on that and cut bureaucracy for small business but the government answer be different they plan to abolish the high level apprenticeship and redistribute the money think the brilliant speech by the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell on his amendment be so right will not be as articulate as he but will try to add to the point he make and hope the minister will listen to her wise colleague employer and educator can see that this be trial run of what it will be like as minister take more control with this bill and they be warn that it be big mistake dan lally at sheffield hallam university say that level cut will disproportionately impact on public service we be meet vital skill gap in discipline such as advanced clinical practitioner these be nhs worker civil servant and local authority employee high number of our level apprentice come from the area of high deprivation for example level apprenticeship be absolutely central to the nhs long term workforce plan last year we see the government disappointing decision to cancel the level doctor apprenticeship that mean there will be shortfall of about medical place year student who have already start on the medical doctor apprenticeship have sadly be leave in limbo and be concern the government will do something similar to nurse as part of the level cut the nhs workforce plan propose an extra nurse come through the apprentice route around quarter of they tend to be on an agenda for change band which typically require master equivalent so we would expect about of those nurse to be come via level apprenticeship if the government get rid of they that be huge hole in the nhs plan as well as the nhs local government make huge use of level apprenticeship include the extra town planner that the government say be need to deliver on housing target deborah johnston at london south bank university say over half of the employer we work with on level apprenticeship be local authority our apprentice enable council to deliver project in the wake of reintroduce mandatory housing target the suggestion that as employer local authority should step in and pay for the level apprenticeship themselves be fanciful the profession be also worried the institute of chartered accountants have say that ax level apprenticeship will lead to work leave the uk it say remove level apprenticeship funding will mean that few uk training role be create instead organisation be likely to turn to offshore to replace uk training role the hon member for stoke on trent central rightly say that it would lead to people be outside stoke on trent but in some case it would lead to they be outside this country altogether that be why the campaign for learning have call for skill immigration worker test before defunde level apprenticeship so that we do not simply go from invest in british worker to import worker from other country likewise the chartered management institute have say cut funding for level apprenticeship would risk create gap in leadership at time when business and the public sector need they most have be contact by several firm worry about the abolition of the solicitor apprenticeship way into the law for people from less privileged background attwell solicitors for example say reduce funding to level apprentice run the risk of remove opportunity into profession and that apprenticeship help break down barrier into not only law but all career path which could be inaccessible to young people without they as well as hit employer on the other side of the ledger this be why our amendment be important ax level will be destabilising for university provider it will particularly hurt those institution that have try to do the right thing for those who traditionally do not go to university sixty six university deliver level apprenticeship and prestigious institution such as cranfield university which be postgraduate only institution with deep industry link will be hugely expose if the government wield the axe in the way they plan york st john university have something like level apprentice other institution such as the open university manchester met and the university of west london be all expose too cull level be big mistake these apprenticeship be vital across the public sector and be way into the profession for people who might otherwise struggle to enter they above all they be the capstone of drive to make the apprenticeship system more prestigious british airways carry on run the concorde even though it be small part of its business because of what it call the halo effect it know that it change the way the organisation be see by create the top of that pyramid the very top of the ladder people can go all the way level apprenticeship create halo effect around apprenticeship and that be vital part of why we should not get rid of they worse still it be crystal clear from the minister reply in the bill committee that the government be keep open the option to move on and take an axe to level apprenticeship too which would make that mistake even big and will not in fact drive money towards and the other day we learn that the dfe be to cut the adult skill budget by for which ministers criticise the previous government but be now do themselves ironically that come out at the same time as and be overshadow by the welfare reform green paper which mention train time in committee the minister refuse to confirm whether the government would continue to provide the extra funding to get level go even though provider be cry out for clarity on that it be no wonder that many employer would like the certainty that come with degree of independence from politic wise people on the labour benches want that too lord blunkett say in the other place when two year ago lead on the learning and skill document that be precursor to skills england we never envisage that an agency inside government would have to take on the assurance and accreditation of the relevant sector standard he note skills england that have no legislative backing and no parliamentary reference but be down merely to the change face of ministerial and departmental appointment be in danger of lose its birthright before it have get off the ground official report house of lords november vol even those on the labour side who be involve in dream up skills england have argue for its independence likewise various employer body include the institute of the motor industry the skills federation and the construction industry training board have argue that it should be more independent as labour peer lord knight have point out the problem that some of we have with the bill be that it feel as if the second half be miss and that second half be the establishment of skills england as statutory body the original draft of the bill do not even mention skills england as baroness blower another labour peer have point out the appropriate move from where we be now would be to make it statutory body that be why our amendment would make the bill do what the government be pretend it do by actually set up skills england which be clearly the intent of many on the labour benches give all the problem that the government be create the very act of further reorganisation be likely to compound the effect of the budget the impact assessment state the transfer of function from ifate to the dfe could potentially cause temporary slowdown in the growth rate of new apprenticeship and technical education course due to potential delay in the approval process result from the bill this may disproportionately impact disadvantaged learner who rely more heavily on these pathway so there you have it madam deputy speaker employer and educator be criticise the uncertainty that the government be create labour peer be argue that skills england should be make independent but the government be ignore those on their own side with experience and employer be warn against ax valuable qualification but the skills minister be determined to end they yet another reorganisation yet more centralisation no clear vision it be another big mess thank hon member for their constructive engagement throughout the debate however from listen to the shadow minister the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston neil one would think that this be all doom and gloom when it be actually new season of growth and skill we be spring into action and encourage he not to be stick in the past as have say before include when we discuss the bill in detail in committee it be wonderful to hear the passion that member from across the house have for improve our skill system it be clear that we all share desire to well meet the skill need of employer and learner the government be determined to unlock growth and spread opportunity and the bill will help we to deliver the change that we absolutely need will start by speak to new clause before touch on the other new clause and amendment can the minister explain in answer to the point make by the hon member for stoke on trent central gareth snell and other the rationale behind eliminate level apprenticeship information on that will come out in due course but if the right hon member give little more time will be able to elaborate and respond to member as go new clause and relate to the creation of skills england and its legal status new clause table by the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom would require the secretary of state to lay draft proposal for new executive agency to be know as skills england within six month of royal assent new clause table by the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston would require the secretary of state to establish skills england as statutory body our position that we establish skills england as an executive agency remain extremely clear and be entirely in keep with the usual process for establish arm length body the department be comply with the robust and vigorous process for establish executive agency which apply across government the executive agency model balance operational independence with proximity to government that be need to inform policy and support delivery of the government mission that model enable we to move quickly which be vital give the scale and urgency of the skill challenge that we face the government have commit to review skills england between and month after it be set up that will include an assessment of whether the executive agency model be enable skills england to deliver its objective that be consistent with good practice skill will power this mission drive government and our plan for change our approach mean that we can get on with the job at hand fix the skill system and help more people to get the training they need to build our home power our town and city with clean energy and master new digital technology thank the minister for visit the good town in england harlow last week do she agree that this bill will help benefit young people in my constituency and give they the skill that they need absolutely agree with my hon friend that the bill will help young people to gain the skill that they need in his wonderful constituency and in many other wonderful constituency as well amendment table by the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston would frustrate the complete establishment of skills england by delay the transfer for full year of the function as set out in the bill member have hear the government set out already that delay be not an option that have be repeatedly say they should not just take my word for it technology training provider qa have say that this be pivotal moment for shape the skill system to meet the uk industrial and economic need and it be right the complex and fragmented nature of the skill system be contribute to critical skill gap in our economy today opportunity be be miss today growth be be hold back by lack of skill today and we can not afford to be sluggish in our pursuit of more joined up data drive approach in the first set of apprenticeship statistic under the new labour government we see an increase in start participation and achievement compare with the same period under the tories in even in the constituency of the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston when the conservatives be in government start in his constituency fall by almost few people be start apprenticeship on their watch this government mark national apprenticeship week with set of reform go far and fast on growth whereas under his government third of vacancy be due to the lack of skill we will press on the british chambers of commerce have urge we to work at pace to establish skills england and we be do exactly that since be set up in shadow form skills england have get to work it have get to work by identify skill gap in the economy and building relationship with strategic authority employer and other group indeed skills england have work with mayoral strategic authority and other form of regional government as well as regional organisation to ensure that regional and national skill need be meet in line with the forthcoming industrial strategy skill england will work closely with the industrial strategy advisory council so that we have the skilled workforce need to deliver clear long term plan for the future economy and with the migration advisory committee to ensure that grow the domestic skill pipeline reduce our reliance on overseas worker our constituent will not thank we for stick in the slow lane there be no need to wait another year and we be ready to go now new clause and table by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell and the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston respectively would impose duty on the secretary of state to publish within one year of royal assent report on the impact of the act on level and high education member will be aware that we have already include in the bill duty for the secretary of state to report on function transfer from the institute for apprenticeships and technical education that will be exercise by skills england include their impact on technical education and apprenticeship this report will need to be publish not after year but after six month which be much soon we have therefore already make commitment to transparency in the bill and that be welcome by stakeholder include the association of colleges in its write evidence to the bill committee we all agree that level and high education be central to fix our skill challenge and as make clear in committee the skills england six month report will include necessary information on level as well as technical education and apprenticeship deliver in high education setting the conservative party have argue that we must avoid skills england be overlook and distract from its important work surely then we should avoid force it to spend its first year produce more and more report cover the same issue amendment and be table by my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central and by the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston respectively these amendment would also place additional reporting requirement on the secretary of state this time in relation to degree apprenticeship as with level and high education the report that the government have commit to provide after six month will necessarily include information on apprenticeship include degree apprenticeship amendment be about fund for those apprenticeship we be set skills england up to build the evidence and the partnership need to deliver change but policy and funding decision on skill provision will not sit with skills england they will continue to sit with the secretary of state that be entirely right and appropriate and nothing in the bill change that we will set out more information on level apprenticeship in due course if have hear the minister right the first report that will come out will include aspect of the implication for high degree apprenticeship but the funding decision will still sit with the department as they should will the report refer to the funding decision make by the secretary of state so that when it come to the impact of the decision make we can see correlation and causation absolutely hear my hon friend and his concern for level do not want to stray too far from the bill and what it seek to achieve but be very happy to look at that far with he and to get back to he on sunday it will be eight year since the levy be introduce and only now under labour government be employer get the flexibility they have be cry out for include on math and english and on the length of apprenticeship that be in response to industry need and recognise the need of job and the need to get young people foot in the door so that they can start good career after nine month in government this labour government have cut through red tape and be drive the skill that our employer need show that labour be the party of business we be reform apprenticeship tilt the system towards young people most in need of develop skill and ensure that young people get foot on the career ladder amendment and be again table by the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston they would create statutory duty on the secretary of state to have due regard to the reasonable requirement of employer and individual when consider whether to approve standard or assessment plan where it have be develop by group of person as make clear in my response to the hon member in committee the secretary of state be already subject to general public law duty that require they to take into account all relevant consideration when make decision relate to the function for which they be responsible there be therefore already requirement for the secretary of state to balance the need of user of the system when execute the function describe in the bill in fact the public law duty be broad than the factor list in the amendment and include for example consideration of value for money and quality turn lastly to amendment table by the hon member for harborough oadby and wigston it be critical that technical qualification and apprenticeship reflect the need of employer and that they have confidence in they employer tell we that speed and flexibility be crucial if we be to work together more effectively to plug skill gap the precise make up of group of person be not currently mandate in legislation flexibility be necessary to ensure that the membership of every group reflect the factor relevant to an occupation specify in the bill that group must always include particular voice would introduce new and unnecessary constraint on the structure of group to conclude this government be commit to transform the skill system so that it can deliver the highly skilled workforce that our country need skill will power this government relentless focus on deliver our mission that be why this government first piece of educational legislation pave the way for skills england to identify and fill skill gap question put that the clause

agree to committee with the leave of the house we will take motion and together administration ordered that gill furniss be discharge from the administration committee and bambos charalambous be add finance that matt bishop be discharge from the finance committee and paul davies be morden on behalf of the committee of selection croydon area remodelling funding brighton mainline motion make and question propose that this house do now dearden be grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue in the house at this time on monday night members may not find the prospect of discuss the croydon area remodelle scheme or cars the most exciting way to spend their time but can assure they that it be the scheme be not just about provide vital upgrade to two of busy train station in the country and bring much need investment into one of london most significant area of opportunity but about supercharge growth opportunity and transport link right across the south east cars be network rail plan to add capacity and ease congestion on the most complex part of britain rail network and to improve service on one of the country most critical rail line the brighton main line the lack of capacity at east croydon station and the complex series of junction north of croydon the selhurst triangle mean that train across the brighton main line include the gatwick express and those across the wide south east network have for many year be vulnerable to delay and cancellation at the time of develop those plan network rail report that service punctuality on the brighton main line be the low of any major route with the bottleneck at croydon be one of the main cause the croydon opportunity area be earmark for new home and new job by there will be extensive housing delivery in the brighton city region between horsham and crawley and along the south coast and gatwick be forecast to grow by by even with only one runway so the pressure on the brighton main line be set only to increase however the croydon bottleneck mean that there be no practical way of improve journey time meet passenger demand and opening up new destination on the brighton main line in the future because the maximum number of train that can be schedule through east croydon be per hour in the service be run at maximum capacity it be now almost back to pre pandemic level with schedule train rise look forward to hear how mr shannon intervention relate to the croydon area remodelle scheme and the brighton main line the most important thing madam deputy speaker be to congratulate the hon lady on secure the debate speak to she beforehand to try to help she in some small way do she agree that year of underspend on public transport have leave railway and bus service drown in repair work and that if the government wish to have thriving public transport service outside london local authority must be give the funding to fix service be they in croydon or newtownards rather than have to shake begging bowl for penny as they do now successful intervention agree with the hon gentleman sustainable long term funding be the only way for any area outside london to grow sustainably in addition cars would see significant improvement to east croydon station britain most use station by add two new platform large concourse to improve facility for passenger and well connection to local transport network it also provide an opportunity to modernise norwood junction station britain most use station by extend the platform so that more service can stop there and add footbridge with lift to finally bring step free access to this much love local transport hub despite consultation with stakeholder and passenger show that of respondent be in favour of cars in the previous government shelve these crucial infrastructure plan turn their back on economic growth in croydon and across the south east however passenger number on the brighton main line continue to recover well post pandemic with station entry and exit at east croydon station now back up to almost when compare to their pre pandemic level and back up to at gatwick airport station when compare with the same period give the renew interest in the expansion of gatwick airport the need to look again at cars be more vital than ever gatwick be europe busy single runway airport and with the gatwick airport to victoria route be the seventh busy flow for rail passenger nationally second when we take out the elizabeth line extension even without second runway demand for train service into gatwick be already reach capacity the economic case for gatwick expansion create an estimate new job and generate an estimate billion year for the british economy have be well document and the government have outline that any expansion would need to see the number of passenger arrive at gatwick via public transport increase from its current to it be not hard to argue that without the urgent improvement that cars bring to this line that ambition be difficult to achieve further delay in get car off the ground could not only hold back economic growth for the coast to capital region region estimate to be the seventh large regional economy in the country but it could also hold back economic growth for our country the hon lady be make an excellent case for solve the croydon bottleneck as it be know as she have outline it affect not only her area of croydon but my area of carshalton and wallington the hon member and have see each other on the train on the way into this place do she agree that public transport and train demand in particular can be affect by the frequency and reliability of the service if we be to fix this problem that could actually increase the demand for train use in our area which would be good thing not only for the economy but for the environment absolutely agree that once people get into the doom loop of think that the train be not go to arrive they find other route or stick to their car if we can improve rail performance in every region across the country be sure we will see passenger number also go back up to those pre pandemic level and even increase beyond that appreciate that the government have rightly state their intention to grow every corner of this country and that good public transport will no long be confine to the boundary of our city urge the minister to consider the wide impact that invest in cars could have for our coastal community what it could do for town and region outside london and what it could do for my part of outer south london with an estimate extra seat per hour on the brighton main line high than what would be provide without it cars be not just good for croydon and the whole of the south east it be good for our country too thank my hon friend the member for croydon east natasha irons for secure this debate and allow we to discuss this critical area of rail infrastructure as my hon friend have so clearly outline the brighton main line be crucial artery connect the south coast to the heart of london carry million of passenger each year it be lifeline for commuter gateway for visitor and crucial link for business that be drive our economy forward it also provide direct rail link into gatwick the uk second busy airport in her constituency east croydon station be major public transport hub provide link to service across sussex as well as the london tramlink the line facilitate billion of pound in economic activity every year enable business to thrive and community to stay connected that be reflect in the substantial investment in the line in the recent past the billion thameslink programme transform north south travel through london deliver fast more frequent and more reliable journey for passenger thameslink see an entirely new bespoke fleet of class train introduce to the brighton main line radically increase onboard capacity and improve the reliability of the service in addition major station such as london blackfriars and london bridge be entirely rebuild and the vital link to the elizabeth line be create at farringdon motion lapse standing order no motion make and question propose that this house do now dearden indeed via the major hub of east croydon station in my hon friend constituency the thameslink programme also establish new direct connection to peterborough and cambridge more than million be recently invest in upgrade gatwick airport station deliver new more accessible station concourse and double the space for passenger be very grateful to the minister for outline the investment make in the line historically indeed in gatwick case very large portion of the investment be make directly by the airport rather than by the department for transport this debate be about the fact that in shortly over decade the line will be completely at capacity so any train leave brighton will be full by the time it arrive at my constituency of crawley not single passenger from gatwick will be able to get on the train to london without these improvement and we be run out of time to secure the change necessary to avoid that outcome gatwick airport ltd have apply for development consent order to bring its northern runway into routine use alongside its main runway understand that it have commit to provide million rail enhancement fund to support improvement to the network require to accommodate additional passenger and mitigate the impact on performance as say more than million be recently invest in upgrade gatwick airport station deliver new more accessible station concourse double the space for passenger improve the reliability of train call at the station and ensure that it be fitting gateway to the uk for too many year gatwick airport station have be major bottleneck on the brighton main line due to the extended time that passenger need to board and alight from train since the significant expansion of the station and the widening of platform passenger can board and alight much more quickly reduce knock on delay far up and down the line as part of the gatwick upgrade the track layout through the station be remodelled to increase capacity and speed reduce journey time between brighton and london by five minute and improve performance hope that my hon friend the member for croydon east and her constituent have start to see the direct benefit of those intervention at gatwick be it in the efficiency of their train service or the ease with which they can start their holiday despite those investment demand and crowd on the line continue to grow up to it be victim of its own success we could say before the pandemic the croydon area remodelling scheme be rightly identify as priority scheme to address crowding and provide more capacity on the line as my hon friend have outline the complex junction at selhurst and pinch point at east croydon and norwood junction station create limit on capacity car be develop to address that through significant remodelling of the track and rail junction north of east croydon station and as far up as the norwood junction station area cars also envisage major redevelopment of east croydon station at the time network rail estimate that it would take over year to fully deliver the cars scheme at cost of around billion delivery would also involve significant and ongoing disruption for passenger up and down the brighton main line however the pandemic create significant change in travel pattern and uncertainty about future demand while at the same time stretch public finance in response the previous government take the decision to pause the scheme at the spending review no development work have be undertake on cars since then in her spring statement last week the chancellor be clear about the challenge face our public finance and the step that she be take to restore stability and support growth the ongoing spending review be an important part of that process we be work to carefully assess each element of public spending include rail investment ensure that every penny spend support our mission and the plan for growth give that this process be ongoing regret that be not able to comment on individual project such as the croydon area remodelle scheme until the spending review have conclude in june my department and certainly recognise the substantial benefit that the cars programme could bring by unlock development in croydon and provide capacity for growth across the coast to capital region also restate the offer make on thursday by the secretary of state for transport to meet my hon friend the member for croydon east to discuss cars and the driver for investment she have outline so clearly however remind she of the multibillion pound cost of the scheme in the context of the significant funding challenge that the government face across range of public service and infrastructure investment ambition we will continue to work with rail industry partner local authority and stakeholder across the region explore opportunity to improve rail service in the south east and to ensure that the brighton main line remain world class transport link one that meet the need of its passenger and support economic growth question put and agree to house adjourn official report march vol
