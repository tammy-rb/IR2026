in the nhs estate the under secretary of state for health and social care my hon friend the member for west lancashire ashley dalton send her apology due to family issue she be very much in our thought today thank to the decision take by my right hon friend the chancellor at the spending review health capital budget will increase to billion by the end of the spending review period that will deliver the large ever health capital budget in nhs history across this settlement more than billion will be invest to address the most critical building repair reduce the most serious and critical infrastructure risk and rebuild the broken nhs leave by the conservatives while welcome the recent announcement of million of extra funding for epsom and st helier university hospital nhs trust it be quite frankly drop in the ocean in comparison with the scale of need because the current backlog at the trust cost million patient and staff deserve safe and modern facility not patchwork repair therefore ask the secretary of state to meet with and visit epsom and st helier hospital to see at first hand the scale of the challenge and how we can accelerate progress absolutely appreciate the challenge that the hon member describe have meet with the trust myself the minister for secondary care my hon friend the member for bristol south karin smyth and have both meet with local mp about the challenge face epsom and st helier lord darzi investigation find that the conservatives leave billion black hole in nhs capital we be reverse that trend with the large ever capital budget for health the million for epsom and st helier trust for estate safety be in addition to the million of capital that the nhs south west london integrate care board be receive include for maintenance backlog it will take time but brick by brick labour be rebuild our nhs the imperial college healthcare nhs trust have the large high risk repair backlog in the country the support from the government estate safety fund be very welcome but to solve this problem we ultimately need new st mary hospital will the secretary of state join in praise the work of the new three year st mary taskforce which aim to get to full planning consent and explore different financing model so that we can finally get this hospital build thank my hon friend for the work that he and my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster rachel blake be lead in partnership with the trust and westminster city council to ensure that the people of his constituency have the hospital they deserve as he know this will be the most complicated scheme in the new hospital programme but that be no excuse for the year of delay that the scheme have face the trust now boast the big high risk repair backlog in the country so my hon friend be right to ensure that this be not allow to be put in the too difficult pile again we look forward to engage constructively and do everything that we can to expedite the progress that be desperately need for his community and our city pharmacy what step he be take to support rural pharmacy what step his department be take to support community pharmacy after year of underfunding the government agree record uplift of billion for for the pharmacy sector the pharmacy access scheme provide million to support pharmacy in area with few pharmacy include in rural area but funding must always come with reform our hub and speak legislation if it be pass in the other place today will allow pharmacy to streamline their dispense process and it be major step in the right direction in marry reform with investment recently visit modbury pharmacy where owner phil dawes highlight the challenge face small rural pharmacy he explain how the current funding model do not take into account the low footfall and limited referral rate that be common in rural area we know that if pharmacy in small market town close it can cause extreme difficulty for people to access advice and medicine particularly where there be little or no public transport and they have to go long way will the government consider introduce rural exception or adjusted funding threshold so that we can keep community pharmacy open the pharmacy sector be face huge challenge after massive cut over the past year we be begin to rebuild but the hon lady be right that there be particular challenge for rural pharmacy we be look at comprehensive reform in the pharmacy sector involve the well use of technology hub and speak dispensing and range of other option that would enable well remote dispensing for rural pharmacy have visit pharmacy across my constituency they be all struggle to provide service but be all very keen to take on the new service that the nhs be suggest will the minister commit to ensure that rural and community pharmacy be properly staff and equip to deliver those community service such as diabete testing and weight management treatment so that patient be not leave behind just because of where they live the hon lady be right that pharmacy will play central role in the shift from hospital to community that we will be put at the heart of our year plan an important part of that of course be pharmacy first the take up of pharmacy first be not what we would like it to be so we be look at option to increase awareness of pharmacy first and to free up pharmacist to be able to operate at the top of their licence part of that be about streamline the dispense side of what they do and the hub and speak legislation that mention early will be really important in that context the minister have speak many time about the importance of shift from hospital to the community have visit many local pharmacy and meet the chair of community pharmacy nottinghamshire see at first hand the important work they do to support community in mansfield do the minister agree that community pharmacy have key role to play in that shift and could help to take pressure off gp surgery my hon friend be absolutely right and commend he for the work he be do in his constituency include with pharmacy in many way what we want to see be culture change because the interface between general practice and community pharmacy be not where it should be we believe that pharmacist have huge amount more to offer but that require well digital interface and well information sharing single patient record that sort of vehicle will be really important for deliver some of those reform call the shadow minister be pleased to hear the minister speak about pharmacy first which be bring forward by the previous government and welcome by community the public and the pharmacist although be pleased to see the government continue it why have they decide to cap the number of consultation that pharmacist may do part of that be about the financial arrangement for pharmacy first which need to be set at level that incentivise pharmacist sadly give the way in which the scheme be set up under the previous government those incentive be not work which be one reason why the take up of pharmacy first have not be what it need to be it be question not of cap but much more one of get the right level of financial compensation for pharmacy first so that it work and incentivise the system be grateful to the minister for his answer but part of the problem be that once pharmacist hit that cap they be no long pay the per consultation in turn that mean that either patient will be turn away or the pharmacist must take the hit and pay for it themselves that disjoin the system and could create extra cost because patient who be turn away will turn up in other area of primary care such as their gp surgery how do that fit with darzi push towards community base service the hon gentleman will have see and be sure will welcome the record uplift of billion that we be put into the pharmacy sector after year of underfunding incompetence and neglect from the conservative party big part of this be ensure that the shift from hospital to community take place and we want pharmacist to be take pressure off primary care we have to make pharmacy first work effectively which mean get the allocation of fund right that be what we be work on in term of reform now that we have the spending review and the package that be what we will be deliver medicine supply chain community pharmacy if he will undertake review of the potential impact of medicine supply chain shortage on community pharmacy increase the resilience of the uk medical supply chain be key priority regularly meet the team to routinely take action to mitigate supply issue include request additional stock identify alternative global source and issue management advice although the department have no plan to conduct specific review we constantly work to identify and take forward further action to reduce the impact of medicine shortage include target winter monitoring have work in community pharmacy for nearly year have witness at first hand the pain that medicine shortage can cause north somerset patient and their loved one will the minister meet along with my hon friend the member for exeter steve race and other member of the all party parliamentary group on pharmacy to discuss the outcome of our inquiry into these shortage congratulate my hon friend and constituency neighbour on his dedicated career in community pharmacy and thank he for the expertise that he bring to the work of the all party parliamentary group to help member understand the impact of this issue on patient and pharmacy be plan to hold parliamentary event on the subject in the autumn and be keen to work with the appg to make it success for all member supply chain problem be just one of the many issue that be have an impact on community pharmacy my local pharmacy in noak bridge be one of they but it be also be hammer with national insurance increase and the combination of these issue mean that its long term viability be at stake will the review that the minister have mention include all the impact on community pharmacy that be affect their long term viability the long term viability of pharmacy and indeed the whole nhs be under threat from the right hon gentleman and his party but thank to this government it be be make fit for the future this be serious issue for all our constituent and we want to make the system work well the right hon gentleman will see from the year plan that we will make the nhs fit for his constituent mine and those of every other member call the liberal democrat spokesperson across the country community pharmacy struggle not only with supply chain problem but with dispense some of the critical medicine for our constituent at loss be concerned to read that high price for united states pharmaceutical be on the table for the next stage of trade negotiation with donald trump because an additional billion would cost both the nhs and our community pharmacy dear what step be the department take to ensure that the nhs and the vital medicine supply on which we rely will not be use as bargaining chip in trade deal with highly unreliable us president the hon lady have ask an important question about the pharmaceutical industry which be key to the country growth mission and to support all our constituent and the entire country as we know my right hon friend the prime minister be currently attend the summit we have good relationship with america and the department be work closely across government to ensure that the same stability of supply remain for our constituent access to gps whether he have make an assessment of the potential merit of expand the additional role reimbursement scheme to include gps what step he be take to improve access to gps the government inherit ludicrous situation whereby patient could not get gp appointment and gps could not get job so one of my first act be to cut red tape to give practice flexibility to hire gps along with an extra million investment thank to that combination of investment and reform this government have recruit an additional gps to the frontline since july exceed our target of we have invest an extra million in general practice this year take action to bring back the family doctor we do not pretend to have solve all the problem but change have begin and the good be still to come welcome the government commitment to restore the family doctor and the recruitment of additional gps nationwide but my constituency have yet to benefit from that concern have be express to about the expansion of the additional role reimbursement scheme to include only newly qualified gps which it be fear may be too restrictive have meet local gp partner who share that concern so will the secretary of state meet we to discuss how the scheme can well support area such as mine we be invest an extra million in general practice and have reform the gp contract to help bring back the family doctor and end the am scramble that contract reform include further change to make it easy to recruit gps through the scheme as my hon friend will see shortly when we publish the year plan for health general practice be at the heart of our proposal to build neighbourhood health service be keen to work with she and with gps to make it even easy to ensure that qualified gps can get job and patient can get gp appointment and should be delighted to meet she after year of the conservatives run down the frontline of the nhs many people in basingstoke still struggle to gain access to their gps one issue that patient and gps raise time and again be the lack of capital investment in new provision to meet grow housing need chineham medical practice for example be build to serve just patient but now serve more than and be set to serve many thousand more in the year to come what more be the government do to enable every patient in basingstoke to see their gp when they need to my hon friend be absolutely right just as this government be deliver record home building with huge target to build the home that britain need we also need to ensure that people get the local service that they deserve that be exactly why this government have invest an extra million this year to create additional clinical space in over gp practice which will create new consultation room and make well use of exist space to deliver more appointment know the chineham medical practice be one of the practice put forward by its integrate care board for funding so hope we will see that practice benefit from this investment in the near future as we rebuild our nhs the government additional role reimbursement scheme lead to just three new gps for my constituent in wokingham which be drop in the ocean more need to be do to deliver gp practice in new development such as arborfield in south wokingham why do ministers not support the liberal democrat amendment to the planning and infrastructure bill that would have make commitment to build gp surgery in all new housing development legally bind probably because be that prescriptive about every housing development be not sensible even if the thrust of what the hon member describe that as new housing development be build we need to ensure that local infrastructure go alongside it be the right approach take what he say about the number of gps and as have say we do not pretend to have fix all the problem in month but with respect those be three more gps than be there before know there be more to do but give time and we will rebuild general practice for his constituent and anyone else access to gps in my constituency of chichester be be undermine by the closure of the westbourne branch of emsworth medical practice at the end of this month patient will now have to travel to emsworth but we be talk about small rural village and there be no public transport to get my elderly and vulnerable patient to that medical practice over the border will the secretary of state please meet to urgently discuss how we can protect this vital service in rural village in chichester can well understand the hon member concern and her constituent concern practice closure be hard on community wherever they be but they disproportionately hit rural community and those that suffer with poor transport connectivity would urge she in the first instance to raise the specific local issue with the icb however reassure she and other right hon and hon member that the need of rural coastal and remote community be very much in our mind and crucially in the year plan and our thinking about how we build genuine neighbourhood health service in all type of neighbourhood mental health services staffing in rural areas what step his department plan to take to ensure mental health service be fully staff in rural area know this be an important issue for the hon member from the meeting we have about it last year this government be support local provider by recruit an additional mental health worker by the end of this parliament we be also expand nhs talk therapy and pilot six new neighbourhood mental health centre include hope haven serve whitehaven and rural copeland thank the minister for his reply but this month the care quality commission find high level of staff vacancy in the already understaffe psychiatric intensive care unit and acute mental health ward in south cumbria conclude that this be put patient safety at risk yet worryingly the icb in south cumbria be make additional cut of million this year with north cumbria also make cut in the light of that what be his plan to intervene to ensure that mental health staffing in cumbria be increase to safe level thank the hon member for that there be no doubt that the nhs university and other need to do more to get student trainee and qualified doctor and mental health specialist in place where the nhs and patient need they we will publish refreshed workforce plan later this year to ensure that the nhs have the right people in the right place to care for patient when they need it the snp have cut mental health service across scotland while fail to recruit the necessary workforce in rural community such as those in stirling and strathallan what assessment have the department make of how devolved mismanagement of mental health service be affect outcome for patient in rural scotland if we be to make an assessment of the way in which the snp have mismanage its responsibility in scotland we would be here for very long time be not sure can answer my hon friend question in the round but be sure that colleague from the snp will be welcome the record investment that the uk government have make in scotland be certainly look forward to the improved outcome that they will be deliver as result health of the elderly what recent step he have take to support the health of the elderly the spending review announce increase in nhs spending alongside more money for adult social care by invest in dexa scanner we can more rapidly treat condition such as osteoporosis which particularly affect elderly woman our urgent and emergency care plan promote fall prevention technology for long independent living and few hospital admission gps be now incentivise to improve continuity of care benefit patient with long term condition thank the minister for his reply but as the secretary of state know only too well my borough of havering contain one of the high number of elderly people in the entire london region yet queen hospital in romford remain chronically underfunde overstretch and struggle to meet the grow healthcare need of an age community will the minister commit today to the serious investment that queen hospital so desperately require to ensure well health outcome for old people across romford carefully note the fact that the secretary of state for health and social care who be sit next to have an interest in this issue so will tread very carefully with my answer understand that the hon gentleman have discuss this matter with the minister for secondary care the north east london health and care partnership integrate care board be responsible for delivery implementation and funding decision for local service but the hon gentleman representation have be carefully note today not least by the secretary of state for health one of the most important thing we can do to support the health of the elderly be to ensure that they can get to see their local doctor it be great to hear the health secretary talk about the improve access to appointment we be see that in chesterfield but he be also right to say that it be the first step back up the mountain the government inherit real crisis in gp access and the situation be particularly difficult in more deprive area will my hon friend tell what more we will do to ensure that people be able to see gp and in particular that practice that serve the most deprived community can get access to the extra gps they need my hon friend will know that when we come into government we inherit the absurd situation where the additional role reimbursement scheme be weigh down by red tape and it be not actually possible to recruit gps we change that we invest an extra million and as result we have well over more gps on the frontline but that be just the beginning we have contract reform and million of additional investment in general practice and we be move forward with an online booking system which will be obligatory by october we have much more work to do for example around the interface with pharmacy we be work hard on that there be lot more to do but my hon friend be right that the first step up the mountain have be take call the shadow minister last health question ask about delay to crucial medication in and the secretary of state say he be interested to hear more but his office say he would delegate it to minister and we still have not be offer date so could encourage he to look into that please the turn on winter fuel will help the elderly to stay warm and healthy this winter but another way to help elderly people would be to protect they from the respiratory syncytial virus will the government extend the vaccination to the thank the hon lady for that question but do not quite catch the word she use the virus be call interruption oh rsv yes we be certainly look at increase the coverage of the rsv vaccination do not have the statistic to hand at the moment but would be happy to write to she on that point many of those on waiting list be elderly and have chronic condition rather than see consultant at regular interval which may coincide with they be relatively well they be often keep on open appointment so that they can call when they be ill this be efficient and responsive care be the minister aware that this provision be be stop in some area in order to improve figure will quote from letter about an elderly patient regret can not keep he on my waiting list under the open appointment for treatment and have explain the politic of everything and where we be at be re refer to gp each time be expensive and waste of time can the minister explain why doctor be be ask to make decision for political reason instead of clinical one do not think any decision be be make for political reason our medical and health staff be very much focused on do the right thing from clinical point of view the hon lady raise an important point about continuity of care with people constantly have to be re refer into the system part of the reason for that be the utter incompetence with which the previous government manage our primary care system which have result in people be pass from pillar to post the additional role reimbursement scheme not actually be about have gps on the frontline but about have other staff which create more friction in the system and poor continuity of care this government be go to bring back the family doctor that be the way to get our general practice back on its foot nhs wasteful spending what step his department be take to tackle wasteful spending in the nhs what step his department be take to tackle wasteful spending in the nhs this government be deliver record investment in our nhs but that investment be draw from taxpayer and we have responsibility to every taxpayer in the land as well as to patient to ensure that every single penny be well spend that be why that investment be match with bold reform so that we get as much value as possible for every penny the abolition of nhs england will slash duplication and unnecessary bureaucracy and be pleased to report to the house that we have slash spending on agency staff by almost billion compare with last year all those saving be be reinveste into frontline care from speak to my local nhs trust in gateshead know the value it place on drive cost down but it still face financial pressure key among those be issue relate to the digital capital gap we be really keen in gateshead to improve that situation and to allow more people to access the nhs remotely will the secretary of state meet and gateshead nhs trust to talk about how we can tackle that would be delighted to do so my hon friend be absolutely right we have to ensure that the nhs be not only benefit from but at the forefront of the revolution take place in digital service and medical technology it be key to drive productivity and financial sustainability that be why at the spending review the chancellor announce that we would invest up to billion in nhs technology and digital transformation unlike our predecessor we will not raid tech budget to plug shortfall in day to day spending just this month we announce the modernisation of the nhs app so that patient can receive test result and book appointment save million in stamp envelope and letter thank the secretary of state for his early reply in scotland there be more quango than msp after four year and million of taxpayer cash down the drain the snp have scrap its plan for national care service its flagship policy which be see as significant setback for scottish social care reform and now we have people go to the pub in chauffeur drive ministerial car will the secretary of state advise his scottish counterpart on how to stop waste scottish taxpayer money give the state of the nhs in scotland suspect my counterpart need to go and drown his sorrow the truth be that the long the snp be in government the long the nhs in scotland be on the road to nowhere the snp be now on its fifth health plan in four year thank to the decision take by the chancellor it be not just the nhs in england that be receive record investment but the scottish government have use that investment to cut waiting list by almost quarter of million people the same could be true in scotland if the scottish people boot out the snp and elect anas sarwar and jackie baillie to deliver the change that scotland nhs need good way to save money in the nhs be to invest in palliative and end of life care because it avert cost that would otherwise go into the acute sector include into ambulance however this government be take money from that sector through their national insurance rise give that integrate care board be suppose to commission palliative care will the secretary of state commit in the year health plan to proper revenue funding model for hospice and for minimum service specification for palliative care can reassure the hon member that end of life care be feature in the year plan for health also recognise the pressure on our hospice sector which be why this government as well as deliver million through the child hospice grant commit million of capital investment the big in generation for our hospice none the less hospice do rely on the generosity of donor and be keen to work in partnership with the sector to look at what more we can do to encourage investment the final thing would say be that the opposition party welcome the investment in the national health service while oppose the mean of raise it they can not have it both way either they support the investment and the revenue raiser or they have to be honest with the public that they would be cut the nhs one of the most egregious example of waste in recent year be the almost billion spend on useless personal protective equipment during the pandemic when the treasury eventually recover some of that money will the secretary of state assure that scottish taxpayer will benefit in the usual way through the usual channel fiscal decision and spending be matter for my right hon friend the chancellor but let reassure the hon gentleman of two thing first the way in which the taxpayer of this country be rip off during national emergency be total disgrace and this government be determined to get our money back and reinvest it in frontline service where it should always have be secondly can reassure he that so long as there be labour government here in westminster scotland will continue to benefit from the investment it need to sort out its public service now it just need labour government in scotland to spend that money wisely waiting times what step he be take to help reduce waiting time in department this government be commit to fix the nhs and reduce waiting time our new urgent and emergency care plan be back by nearly million of investment to deliver new urgent treatment centre mental health assessment centre and almost new ambulance alongside that investment we be reform urgent and emergency care so that more patient be treat at the scene or in their home where appropriate which be well for they and will help to unclog department lot have be do but there be much more to do the minister for secondary care recently visit my constituency and see the pressure that newham hospital be under that be partly due to the pressure leave by the previous conservative government and partly due to capacity issue result from massive growth in population in the borough further pressure will come as we regenerate the massive area of brownfield site in the royal docks can the secretary of state reassure my constituent that as well as the excellent work be do on day to day capacity we will be look at infrastructure over the long term to make sure that we be not only deal with the growth that we have have but future proofing for the population growth to come know that my hon friend the minister for secondary care enjoy her visit and thank the staff at newham hospital for the work they do which also benefit my constituent we need to make sure that we be support hospital across our country to meet need because we be part of wide ecosystem notice that that point be also powerfully make by the hon member for romford andrew rosindell in his question my hon friend the member for west ham and beckton james asser be right to raise increase demand and pressure which be why we will shortly publish our year plan for health be happy to report that whipps cross and newham hospital have also be provisionally allocate million this year to improve building and estate the government continue to claim that they wish to expand community diagnostic centre to speed up scanning and treatment of patient and therefore reduce demand on the like of if that be the case why be they cut the revenue tariff that be available to the community diagnostic centre under the previous conservative government which have already impact the financial viability of the cdc and access for patient think the hon gentleman will find that since this government come to power we have reduce the size of nhs waiting list by quarter of million nhs waiting list be come down late figure show that this be the first time in year that waiting list have fall in the month of april so we be make progress not least thank to the investment that we be put into community diagnostic centre the hon gentleman have some brass neck to complain about nhs service under this government when we be clean up the mess that the previous government leave behind it would also help to extend the hour at chorley sunbed ban whether his department have make an assessment of the effectiveness of the ban on the use of sunbed by the sunbeds regulation act ban the use of commercial sunbed for require business to prevent under age use the department have commission the committee on medical aspects of radiation in the environment to review the act include the effectiveness of the ban accord to cancer research uk of melanoma skin cancer case be

product such as tan nasal spray and injection for just one session on the sunbed be enough uv exposure to increase the risk of melanoma to prevention be well than cure will the minister meet we to discuss the effectiveness of the ban and preventive measure such as access to free sunscreen at event as someone who be diagnose myself with an early stage melanoma really commend the work of my hon friend constituent never use sunbed and spend holiday in my youth in ireland so never see much sun either sorry to the irish tourism board as my hon friend say it be an overwhelmingly preventable

we move on biopsy waiting times what step he be take to reduce waiting time for biopsy result more patient be now get world lead testing technology in the nhs as part of our mission to revolutionise cancer care in this country the government be spend million year in capital on diagnostic include for the first time funding for the automation of histopathology laboratory to improve productivity we

of course our targeting of waiting list include diagnostic what happen in that case should not happen anywhere and will ensure that he get response as soon as possible cancer diagnoses what step his department be take to reduce the time take for cancer diagnosis what step his department be take to reduce the time take for cancer diagnosis reduce wait time for cancer diagnosis remain key priority under this government an extra patient have have cancer diagnose or rule out this have be support by investment include in cancer digital innovation that bring patient datum into one central platform

our labour government have recently invest in new state of the art linear accelerator machine in southend hospital the machine be the first of its type in the country and will drastically improve cancer treatment please can the minister outline how record level of investment such as in the linac machine and as announce at the spending review will finally mean that the nhs will be there when we need it be delighted that my hon friend constituent will benefit from the million investment these machine be game change and will reduce the number of visit for his constituent they be also more reliable which give more capacity to the system that be well for staff as there will be less appointment cancellation that be exactly the sort of thing we want to see more of and we be deliver that under this government it be the result of our drive to reduce long wait and treat more people quick that be reinforce in last week spending review and it be exactly what his constituent deserve early diagnosis of less survivable cancer be vital if survival rate be to improve what assessment have the department make of the report by the all party parliamentary group on less survivable cancer that

nhs dentistry the right hon member be right to point to child dental health after we win the election in july look across my portfolio and it be pretty much car crash in every aspect thank to the incompetence of previous government perhaps the most shocking statistic of all be that the big reason five to nine year old child be admit to hospital be to have their rotten tooth remove that be

shadow secretary of state may through the secretary of state pass on my good wish to the under secretary of state for health and social care the hon member for west lancashire ashley dalton in front of the health and social care committee in january nhs england then chief financial officer set out that pretty much all the additional funding to the nhs last year would be absorb by pay rise national insurance contribution and inflation what proportion of the late additional funding will be absorb in the same way first just do not buy the argument that invest in our staff be somehow not invest in the nhs who on earth do the opposition think provide the treatment deliver the care organise the clinic and deliver the service even in this great new world of technology the nhs will always be people base service and be proud that this be government who deliver for staff we be also wag war on waste and that be how we can deliver fair pay for staff and improve care for patient if only the conservatives have do that when they have the chance the right hon gentleman could not answer that question but hopefully we will get more positive response to this one recently have the privilege of

tiny sum in the context of the overall nhs budget to research lobular breast cancer which susan be currently battle to help improve outcome her immediate ask be even simple it be for the secretary of state to meet she in person to discuss the campaign and its aim he be decent man will he agree to do that thank the shadow secretary of state for his question and even more importantly thank the amazing campaigner for what they be do this be probably the easy question he be ever go to ask the answer be of course an emphatic yes one of the main concern have about assist dying be that it should never be easy to help someone die than it be to help they live if pass the terminally ill adult end of life bill would make thousand of terminally ill people every year eligible to end their life on the nhs do our health service have the money to fund this service as well as its priority of bring down waiting list can first thank my hon friend the minister for care for the considerable amount of work he have do to support the house as it make its deliberation on this important issue of course the government be neutral it be for the house to decide there be not money allocate to set up the service in the bill at present but it be for member of this house and the other place should the bill proceed to decide whether to proceed that be decision that this government will respect either way the uk be desperately short of doctor but thousand of applicant will be turn away due to lack of training place this be not situation of the minister making but he have now be in post for year can he assure we that nobody no union no treasury minister will prevent he from do what need to be do and lift the training cap should just say for the record that it be thank to my friend at the treasury that we be able to do so much to invest in our health service it be important to put that on record ahead of the budget the hon lady raise really serious issue and we be look carefully at what we can do to ensure that we get great people into our health service and that they can look forward to great career we be not in the right place as country now we need to be in well place the year plan will

await the outcome on the redress that the government will provide will the secretary of state please provide an update on when they can expect an announcement on the redress that will be make

this be complex issue involve input from different government departments we will provide further update on the commissioner report soon my constituency in scotland have significant shortage of health and social care worker despite extensive effort to advertise recruitment to get people in as replicate in part of england wales and northern ireland the rug have be pull out from under that by the change to immigration policy and visa for that sector will the secretary of state commit to push this hard in cabinet to ensure that we can have more geographic and sectoral visa be really proud of the contribution that overseas worker make to health and social care service across our country if they all leave tomorrow the service would simply collapse but think there be an overreliance on overseas staff in health and care service and that be contribute to level of net migration that be simply unsustainable have responsibility to help the home secretary bring those number down and to give opportunity through well pay and career progression to home grow talent and that be what we will do have receive many email regard poor service from pharmacy in my constituency in maryport resident report opening time not as advertise long queue low stock and delay receive vital medication will the minister tell the house how this government will ensure that the public get the good quality service from our local pharmacy be sorry to hear about the issue that my hon friend constituent be experience understand that he have raise the issue with the north east and north cumbria icb which be investigate his concern would be happy to be keep inform and if he be not happy with the outcome of that investigation he should certainly come back to this government be commit to support community pharmacy after decade of underfunding and neglect we recently agree record uplift to billion for the secretary of state may well be aware of the great awareness among young people of nicotine pouch that seem to be gap in the tobacco and vapes bill currently go through parliament will he commit to look at this issue to ensure that it be cover and that we bar this alongside other form of tobacco and nicotine as the hon gentleman know through bitter experience that rotten industry always find way and we have to keep on top of it and tackle the scourge of nicotine addiction he know about this issue well than most he have campaign so assiduously on it and he be right to raise it so let we look at what we can do to strengthen the bill if we can as it go through parliament what step be the secretary of state take to enable access to non hormonal non steroidal oral contraceptive such contraceptive be an emerge technology that will be subject to clinical and other relevant assessment before be consider for use in england the government remain committed to ensure that woman can access their preferred method in timely manner range of contraception be available free of charge from range of setting that include copper coil which be non hormonal non steroidal contraceptive device in prime minister question last week raise the need for universal national screening programme for type diabete will the secretary of state agree to meet to discuss this so that it could form part of the year plan give that it fit so neatly into prevention of issue such as diabetic ketoacidosis over treatment be in the chamber to hear the hon member question obviously we be lead by clinical advice when it come to decision on screen programme but understand the case she make would be delighted to ensure that she get meeting with the relevant minister earl mountbatten hospice in my constituency deliver outstanding care across the community despite that hampshire and isle of wight integrate care board plan to cut its funding by million while other hospice in the region have their funding increase be deeply concerned that the cut will affect our local health service will the minister meet to discuss how we can restore that essential funding and protect hospice care for my constituent we have provide hospice in england with record million in capital funding as my hon friend will know icb be responsible for commission palliative and end of life care service include hospice to meet the need of their local population nhs england have publish statutory guidance to support that would of course be more than happy to meet my hon friend to discuss that far the british dental association recently publish analysis show that the proportion of nhs funding spend on dentistry more than halve under the conservatives who fail to account for inflation and demand to the cost of billion it be no wonder that we have dental desert across much of the country will the secretary of state ensure that dentistry receive its fair share of funding from the new nhs funding allocate in the spending review the hon gentleman be absolutely right to point to the neglect and incompetence of the past year we be fight to get nhs dentistry back to where it need to be an important first step of course be the additional urgent appointment and supervise tooth brush programme but long term contract reform be what be need alongside the investment that will come through the spending review accord to the trussell trust the impact of hunger and hardship on people health be drive an extra billion in government healthcare spending what part be the department play in reduce hunger and hardship and thus the related healthcare cost in my constituency and across the country my hon friend be right to raise that important point it be truly shameful that million child in the uk now live in poverty we be develop an ambitious strategy that tackle root cause and we be already take action alongside cross government work on free school meal breakfast club and fund childcare the department be invest million in start for life service and support healthy diet for people through healthy start optician be important medical professional for our community unfortunately when speak to the hertfordshire and west essex integrate care board be tell that it will not allow optician to perform vital service such as treat minor eye injury as do so be deem too expensive despite that be the norm in the area surround my constituency will the minister meet to discuss how we can ensure fair system across the country rather than postcode lottery the hon gentleman be right to point to the anomaly in the eyecare system there be concern about the role that some aspect of the independent sector be play particularly in the light of the lucrative nature of cataract operation if he write to will be happy to set out the issue and guarantee that he will get the response in due course infertility be medical condition that affect one in six couple in the uk but access to nhs treatment be postcode lottery with less than of icb in england offer the recommend three cycle of ivf do the minister agree that we need to end that postcode lottery and will she meet and campaigner such as fertility action to discuss how we can end it for good in the light of the broad pressure and change in the nhs we have be consider the ambition on fertility service and fairness for all couple the national institute for health and care excellence be review its fertility guideline which will be the clinical standard for the future know that my hon friend will ensure that she and the group she talk about keep an eye on that and that she will work with they be happy to keep work with she on how we good support icb to improve their local offer have raise with ministers before my concern about the closure of st mark walk in urgent care centre in maidenhead frimley icb have confirm yet again that it will not reopen the centre against the will of the majority of maidenhead resident will the secretary of state meet and local campaigner to see how we can finally get st mark walk in centre back open after five year of closure know that the hon gentleman constituent will have note through his representation as constituency mp that he could not have fight hard to save that service we devolve these sort of decision to icb in order that they make decision close to the community that they serve with the conviction that those sort of decision be well take locally than centralised in whitehall understand the case that he make but have give icb challenge resource and freedom we ministers must resist the temptation to meddle every time they make decision that they believe be right for the community even if those decision be controversial will the minister look into minimise the pain of patient go through hysteroscopy and biopsy procedure by request that medical professional fully brief they on anaesthetic and pain relief in advance of procedure to ensure that they can plan accordingly my hon friend raise an important question we be committed to improve woman experience of gynaecological procedure include hysteroscopy woman should be provide with information prior to their procedure so that they can make an informed decision about the procedure and pain relief option include local or general anaesthetic he will probably make further representation which we will certainly look at one of the way in which the secretary of state have reduce the waiting list be by turbocharge the use of the private sector since january mean that half million people have be treat in irreducible spare capacity have that experience elicit any learning that the secretary of state be able to take into the wide reform agenda for the nhs absolutely the nhs always do well under labour government bark community hospital in my constituency have be provide antenatal service to mother in barking for many year and woman also use its service to give birth be therefore really disappointed when hear last week that the maternity birthing unit be likely to close many in my community be deeply concerned they be be redirect to newham hospital which the care quality commission have rat as require improvement woman deserve to give birth in safe clinical environment will ministers ensure that additional attention and resource be provide to newham hospital so that it improve its standard and my constituent who be be redirect to give birth there can do so in safe clinical space make sure that woman be give birth safely be the ultimate priority and the least that woman deserve understand my hon friend anxiety about this reconfiguration and she be right to raise that with the icb in the first instance we be happy to meet she as ministers too the crucial thing be that the service be configure and deliver in way that prioritise the safety of woman and their baby in march the minister for care tell that no decision could be take on new dental school at the university of east anglia until the spending review settlement be know now that we know it will he instruct the office for student to allocate new training place at the uea from the spending review have just be publish the key now be to secure the allocation within the overall financial envelope that will take matter of week and will be happy to report back to the hon member once we have that clarity between and the health inequality weight in nhs allocation make positive measurable difference to the health of deprive people unfortunately it be cut to in with the spending review increase in funding to the nhs when will the health inequality weight reach be really grateful to my hon friend for her question she be right to highlight the importance of funding follow inequality to redress that imbalance think she will be pleased with where we be with the year plan for health and would be delighted to meet she to discuss it people in east devon have be tell that they must now travel to exeter for audiology service that they previously receive at their local community hospital what step be the government take to encourage new provider to restore accessible audiology service that have be run theme this morning which will not be lose on ministers we will ensure as we deliver neighbourhood health service that people can receive care close to home wherever they live we have hear that message loud and clear today and think the hon member will see that priority reflect in our year plan for health declare an interest as my brother be gp when my resident be able to get gp appointment they be frustrate when they be send halfway across the borough to different surgery from the one they be register with by their primary care network can we address that and be it part of our proposal in the new gp contract we do want to put gps at the heart of neighbourhood health service and we want people to have care close to home there be benefit to primary care work at scale so would not want to criticise they for do that the important thing be different course for different horse some of we be much more mobile more active and more online and would welcome that flexibility for other continuity of care that be close to home or indeed in their home be important it be important that people get the right care in the right place at the right time wherever they live and that be what we will deliver be grateful for the consideration the secretary of state have already give to find fair and more effective way of compensate those injure by covid vaccination but he know that those who be profoundly affect by such injury be anxious for news can he give and indeed they progress report reassure the right hon and learn gentleman the constituent of his have meet and other campaigner that be have discussion with the cabinet office about how we deal with that and other issue that have be raise this morning include the sodium valproate scandal he know the complexity involve and have be grateful for his advice as former attorney general do not have specific progress to report now but reassure he and campaigner that this issue have not go off the boil and we be work to find resolution the challenge of find and keep an nhs dentist be raise with time and again across the filton and bradley stoke constituency and welcome the early action that this labour government have take to introduce more than urgent care appointment across our integrate care board area what will be the next step to help ensure that nhs dentistry be open up again to everybody thank my hon friend for that question and her relentless campaigning on this issue she be right that the urgent dental appointment be first step and we be look to embed that so that it go forward every year of this parliament the broad issue be around contract reform there be no perfect contract system the current one clearly be not work and we be look at option around sessional payment capitation and get contract that work and bring dentist back into the nhs the secretary of state will know that my local icb in bedfordshire luton and milton keynes be set to merge with hertfordshire cambridgeshire and peterborough the new icb will cover population of about million people give the difficulty we have have secure gp surgery in wixams will the secretary of state set out how supersizing that quango will help rural mid beds to get the local healthcare it need may respectfully say that that be part of the problem with conservative thinking they think that the answer to the nhs crisis be more quango and they measure success in the number of icb not the number of appointment and the size of the waiting list we be take different approach slash bureaucracy and reinveste in the front line we be not centralise but decentralise and cut waiting list record that the conservative party can not begin to touch couple of week ago at my constituency surgery though tear my constituent amy explain how follow hip operation in she suffer progressive nerve damage due to repeat failure in diagnosis referral and treatment despite raise concern for year she be tell that her pain be common nerve test in confirm damage and further test last year show significant deterioration after year she have only now be offer surgery all amy want to know be what step be be take to ensure that no other patient be leave permanently disabled due to such prolonged and systemic failure order that be very important but why do the hon member not want other to get in first on behalf of the nhs apologise to my hon friend constituent that be an intolerable situation but sadly not rare or exceptional there be too much of that happen and culture of cover up and cover reputation rather than be honest with patient about failure we be change the culture safety be at the heart of the year plan and would be delighted to talk to my hon friend far about his constituent case this morning attend an event about bladder cancer bladder cancer be the fifth high killer in the united kingdom and people be anxious to meet the minister and discuss those matter will he agree to meet bladder cancer organisation to take forward their four objective to make thing well for people in the united kingdom be sure my hon friend the under secretary of state for health and social care ashley dalton who be the minister responsible for cancer would be delighted to meet campaigner particularly as we put together the national cancer plan we want to ensure that we capture every type of cancer and genuinely improve cancer care for everyone in our country the minister may have see my constituent mollie mulheron recently feature on newsnight our local icb recently refuse her access to fertility treatment after recovery from an aggressive cancer with high likelihood that her illness will return will the minister meet and mollie to discuss that issue and access to fertility treatment for cancer survivor and patient yes will make sure that my hon friend get that meeting point of order on point of order mr speaker during proceeding of the house on june it become clear that some medium organisation have be give access to the strategic defence review document before parliament we also become aware that the timing of such early access may have be different for different organisation ask parliamentary question on the matter of who and when and although the government do not answer the question they make clear that trade association and think tank have also be give early access ask again and they refuse to answer but make clear that trade union and our people have be give early access mr speaker ministers be require to answer question use the nolan principle which include accountability and openness the principle state information should not be withhold from the public unless there be clear and lawful reason for so do the government have not follow these process in answer the question and that be particularly relevant to the minister for the armed forces because in his declaration in the register of members financial interests he declare membership of the gmb and unite and that family member be work as constituent for babcock international and that order the hon lady have raise point of order with but she can not go into full speech have get the message and be very clear on the message have no responsibility for the quality of answer to write parliamentary question but know this be key that the procedure committee take close interest in the matter she might therefore like to raise it with the hon member for lancaster and wyre cat smith who chair the committee far to that point of order mr speaker let finish with this one please raise the matter with the procedure committee would be good way to take this forward far to that point of order mr speaker we now know undoubtedly that the sunday times be give access to the white paper because people could read most of it in the sunday times the day before parliament see it although crucially the article do not mention up to new ssn nuclear power attack submarine will explain in quick second why that be important mr speaker at on the monday morning journalist be invite to reading room in horse guards parade where they be give access to the white paper section of the ministerial code clearly state where commercially sensitive material be involve no copy should be make available to the medium before publication thus that be clearly breach of the code however there be an early sitting in the reading room at am when we know the white paper be also see by member of defence company trade association academic think tank and trade unionist at the same time that the market be open mr speaker there be possibility of insider trading the share price of babcock which would benefit from maintain ssn leapt very early on after am order but mr speaker no no no please do not take advantage of the chair point of order be mean to be little bit more punchy they be not full blow statement take very seriously the point that have be make and that be why raise they myself at the time be very grateful to the right hon member for reiterate my word have no responsibility for the ministerial code if the house so wish that need to change because unfortunately it make nonsense there be ministerial code but it be not be keep to as we would expect it be for this house to change the ministerial code if it wish to do so or would be more than happy for the government to change it if they can not accept it because we can not have this continual breaking of the ministerial code it be appalling and it be unacceptable this be not political point in the end be here to uphold the right of back benchers back benchers should hear thing first if document be to be give out they should be give to mps be here to support mp but unfortunately in this particular area do not have the power to do so wish have because thing would be different on point of order mr speaker seek your advice over the past few day we have recognise jo cox murder give the additional focus and the encouragement of the targeting of mp use false information can you advise we as the person responsible for the safety of member of parliament how we as member should be behave both in the chamber and online we will never discuss members security on the floor of the house if there be issue member should please come to see privately let see what can do to reassure member but certainly do not want to open debate because do not think that that would add to member safety please come and see privately bill present multi storey car parks safety bill presentation and first reading standing order no peter dowd support by patrick hurley kim johnson david baines ian byrne derek twigg and paula barker present bill to increase the minimum require height of guard in multi storey car park to make provision about the height of guard in exist multi storey car park to require hour staffing of multi storey car park and for connected purpose bill read the first time to be read second time on friday july and to be print bill registration of births inclusion of deceased parents motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision for the inclusion of parent detail on child birth certificate where that parent have die before the birth of the child and for connected purpose for the vast majority of parent register the birth of their child be straightforward process it be simple piece of paperwork that mark special moment and bring important recognition of their new family along with notable legal right yet for number of woman every year what should be an uncontroversial step in their journey as parent become protracted and traumatic legal battle the law dictate that it be the duty of the parent to register the birth of child within day for married couple there be presumption of paternity for the husband under the law that mean either parent may register the birth unaccompanie by the other with both still record on the birth certificate therefore in the terrible event that their husband die before the child be bear widow mother can still ensure their name be on the birth certificate which be common sense however if the couple be unmarried the law do not recognise their relationship in the same way the fact that the mother do not have ring on her finger mean there be no automatic recognition of paternity if an unmarried woman experience the unimaginable tragedy of lose her partner during pregnancy there be no provision for she to register they on the child birth certificate unless both parent can be present the registrar be deem unable to verify the paternity of the father while suffer the grief of lose love one and face the new reality of parenthood alone bereaved mother leave the register office with blank space on their child birth certificate instead of their partner name in order to amend the birth certificate bereaved mother have to seek declaration of parentage through lengthy costly and traumatise legal process in the family court in some respect this be legal loophole the effect of improper and outdated legislation that have fail to provide for certain set of particularly tragic circumstance but it speak to deep inequality in the legal system unmarried couple be hold in low regard the law in this area have not keep pace with societal change the charity widowed and young first bring this injustice to my attention it be an organisation that provide fantastic support to those who have experience widowhood early in life pay tribute to the hon member for south devon caroline voaden who secure an adjournment debate on this issue and speak powerfully and movingly of her own experience of bereavement and to my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy who first expose the shortcoming of the legal process in parliament in the bill seek to legislate for widowed and young blank space campaign to come into existence to provide clear and simple process for unmarried and bereaved mother to register their partner on their child birth certificate through the charity have hear the story of brave and inspiring woman some of whom be in the gallery today to watch the proceeding would like to share their experience which illustrate the emotional impact of this issue when kelly partner jordan die suddenly in she go from plan their future to plan her fiancé funeral shortly after she give birth to their daughter kelly battle begin to prove that jordan be the father as kelly say he have want nothing more out of his life than to have kid so she be determined that his name would be on maisie birth certificate kelly use form to apply for declaration of parentage through the family court which come with an immediate cost of while have to provide dna from jordan mother and pay out hundred of pound in legal fee kelly be also ask demeaning question such as whether she have have any other partner after fight for two year kelly receive birth certificate for her daughter maisie with jordan name on it she now keep copy of it around the house and one in her purse at all time orlanda and her partner julian be on holiday when he unexpectedly collapse just day after discover they be expect baby girl julian die from heart attack when the registrar tell orlanda that julian would not be name on her daughter birth certificate she say it feel as if he have be rip from our history her process through the court take two year and four hearing many of the judge she encounter have never even come across situation like hers and she be often ask at hearing if julian would be attend as an ambassador for widowed and young orlanda say she be determined to make thing easy for woman who follow in her path let turn to sophie who be still in the midst of this torturous process the sudden death of her partner lawrence while she be pregnant with their daughter kinley turn her world upside down despite their have two child together and lawrence be legally register as the father of both sophie be tell that lawrence would not be register as kinley father she be devastate register their son together in be one of lawrence proud moment as sophie say he will always be her dad and he should be recognise as such sophie enter the uphill battle of amend the birth certificate and be bounce between departments and adviser until someone at the children and family court advisory and support service intervene on her behalf her hearing be at the magistrate court on july and will hopefully bring she some closure on this issue sophie say the experience have be exhausting confusing and emotionally drain add my personal thank to the woman who join we today for share their brave story and for allow to share they with the house kelly orlanda and sophie story show how traumatic and unnecessarily complex the process be widow and young estimate that this issue affect as many as woman each year while the woman who join we today have persevere through the family court many mother will give up out of frustration leave that blank space on their child birth certificate the system for register birth be govern by section of the births and deaths registration act and section of the family law act which make provision for those require declaration of parentage neither of those act provide for the specific circumstance in which one parent be deceased and child be bear outside of marriage declaration of parentage be not intend to prove the paternity of deceased partner but rather to resolve dispute parenthood this legal framework be unfit for purpose when the births and deaths registration act become law in of birth register in the uk be within marriage that figure have reduce steadily ever since and only half of child be now bear within marriage time have change and society have move on yet the law have not keep pace this bill would drag the legislation into the century and provide clear and simple process for register deceased partner name on birth certificate we can achieve that by place great reliance on registrar professional judgement with the right evidence registrar be allow to amend birth certificate so we can similarly empower they to correct the absence of deceased parent provide that they receive sufficient evidence of intended parenthood across europe in switzerland france and germany unmarried parent be encourage to register their parentage at antenatal appointment similar system could be create here and declaration of intended parentage could be make during pregnancy do not contest the importance of have rigorous process for prove intended parenthood but that importance be an argument in support of change in the law not against it because that process be currently non existent official be often unable to advise woman on how to register their deceased partner as parent because there be no guidance while there remain no clear route to prove intended parenthood bereave unmarried mother be be deny basic right the anachronistic legal framework be cause immense trauma for mother and child this bill would take direct action to address that injustice provide clear process for bereaved mother to follow and allow the registrar to include deceased partner on their child birth certificate that small change in the law would make huge difference it would spare grieve woman needlessly painful legal process and ensure that no mother or child have blank space on their birth certificate where their parent name should rightly be

and those in the devolved administration if we want security and safety for all our people that really need to happen entirely agree with the hon gentleman about the importance of share information good practice and policy development and hope that that will go from strength to strength under this government let now say something about abusive behaviour towards emergency worker as we all know they put themselves in harm way to protect we every day and they deserve robust protection in return that include protection from racial and religious abuse which be not only deeply harmful but undermine the value of decency respect and public service unlike most people emergency worker can not walk away from abuse when they enter private home they do so not by choice but because it be their duty to do so whether they be respond to call provide urgent medical care or attend an incident involve risk to life or property they be legally and professionally require to remain and act they can not remove themselves from the situation simply because they be be abuse the law must recognise that and ensure that they be properly protect in every setting include private dwelling at present there be clear and press gap in the law although existing legislation provide important protection against racially and religiously aggravate offence in public place they do not extend to abuse that occur inside private home policing stakeholder have highlight that gap and have emphasise the need for strong safeguard for emergency worker new clause to therefore introduce specific offence relate to the use of racially or religiously threatening abusive or insulting word or behaviour towards emergency worker act in the course of their duty crucially that include incident that take place within private dwelling this be focused and proportionate measure it do not interfere with freedom of expression rather it reinforce the principle that emergency worker should be able to carry out their critical role without be subject to hate or hostility because of their race or religion hope that the hon member for esher and walton monica harding will agree that these government new clause achieve

public confidence in police among other thing that mean ensure that only those who be fit to serve can hold the office of constable or otherwise work in our law enforcement agency as well as strengthen the vetting regime for police officer the new clause and the new schedule require the national crime agency the british transport police the civil nuclear constabulary and the ministry of defence police to establish bar person list and advisory list similar to those create in for territorial police force in england and wales the chief officer of these force and other will be under

programme and ahead of any future legislation to establish the national centre for policing to remove any barrier to the transition of service into the new centre we table new clause and against the backdrop of the government commitment to bring into force the repeal of the outdated vagrancy act which criminalise beg and many form of rough sleeping it be generally the case that when beg reach the threshold of antisocial behaviour there be already sufficient power available to the police and other to address that but we have identify two gap in the law that will arise from the repeal of the act which the new clause would address new clause make it criminal offence for any person to arrange or facilitate another person beg for gain organised begging which be often facilitate by criminal gang exploit vulnerable individual and can undermine the public sense of safety this provision make it unlawful for anyone to organise other to beg for example by drive people to place for they to beg that will allow the police to crack down on the organised crime gang that use this exploitative technique to obtain cash for illicit activity the minister be be very generous in take intervention have work

tackle form of exploitation my hon friend make that point very well these individual be exploit by serious and organised criminal gang and we be go to clamp down on those gang activity new clause re enact the offence of be on enclose premise for an unlawful purpose it will make it an offence for person to trespass on any premise that cover any building part of building or enclosed area with the intention of commit an offence without this replacement offence the police would be able to rely only on the trespassing provision in the theft act which cover trespassing only in relation to burglary it be important that the police have the power to tackle all case of trespassing with intent to commit an offence and new clause will ensure that new clause amend the extradition act under that act the uk can accept extradition request where the request person have already be convict in the request state when consider these case if the request person be convict in their absence and uk judge determine that they do not deliberately absent themselves from their trial uk judge be bind by the act to determine whether the individual be entitle to retrial in the request state first the new

guarantee retrial in the request state the act have previously be interpret as right to apply for retrial subject to the domestic law of the request state several state can not offer assurance to meet the condition impose by the judgment and there be therefore public safety risk of individual be discharge if the new interpretation of the act be leave to stand new clause therefore reinstate the

member for stockton west matt vickers copy of which have be place in the library with your permission madam deputy speaker will therefore seek to respond to the non government amendment in this group when wind up for now commend the government amendment to the house call the shadow minister would like to express my appreciation to all those who have work on the legislation to develop and shape the policy whether they be the majority develop under the previous conservative government or member of the bill team who be sure have provide helpful assistance to ministers as be sure we will hear today some of the measure in the bill be the result of amazing people who have suffer the bad experience but who have work to ensure that other do not have to suffer they in future in addition consider the context of the legislation it be right to pay tribute to the excellent work of police officer across the country week in week out those serve in our police force put themselves in harm way to keep our street safe those who serve and place themselves in danger can not be thank enough many people ask themselves whether they would have the bravery to stand up and intervene officer across the country do so on daily basis thank to the effort of the previous conservative government the police force number over officer in with record in march this be the high number of officer on both full time equivalent and headcount basis since comparable record begin in march be grateful to my hon friend for set out those police number do he share my concern about the additional police officer we be get when look at our figure for the west midland the boost be come from deployment worry about where they be actually come from and just how much of an increase we be really go to see wholeheartedly agree there be lot of concern about the neighbourhood policing guarantee and where the resource come from whether it be through special or volunteer of course we want to see more of they or redeployment when people ring they want to know that they be go to get the response they expect they do not want to see that deplete to move officer from one bucket to the next that have real consequence the big hit to our police force number at the moment will be the national insurance rise the tax that be tax police off our street the shadow minister and probably disagree on many thing but he be give very well present speech do he not recognise however that there may well be an increase in police number but we have see decrease in police staff in essex we lose over police staff during the conservatives period in office and number of police officer have be redeploy to role that could have be do by police staff be glad to see all those police officer get proper training through the hon gentleman math teach be glad he have new recruit in his part of the world but people be concerned about the frontline number the number of police on our street be huge concern to the public the chair of the national police chiefs council have say that the funding will not match the government ambition and fall short of maintain the exist workforce and just listen to the police federation which state quite simply this chancellor have listen to police officer can the minister confirm that by the end of this parliament there will be more police officer than be serve in march the shadow minister will know from our time in committee that be an ex police officer and thank he for his word about police officer serve the country do he agree that the bill will give the police more confidence that they will have the right power so that they be able to make difference welcome lot of the measure in the bill and hope they will really help our police officer to keep our street safe but the police need the resource funding and support to be out there enforce the legislation we be put forward today thank the hon member for his service on the committee as well as in the police force the house will debate number of amendment and new clause today and tomorrow the opposition amendment be sensible and aim to improve the bill which our constituent would want we to get behind amendment relate to the government objective which we all want to achieve of reduce knife crime by we know the untold damage knife crime cause to victim family and community across the country this legislation introduce new offence possession of an article with blade or point or an offensive weapon with the intent to use unlawful violence let put that in context imagine you be at home in your garden enjoy nice peaceful afternoon with the kid suddenly our hard work police officer swoop in on man walk down the street man carry knife or offensive weapon who be then prove beyond all reasonable doubt to have plan to use it for violence he could have be come for your neighbour your friend or your family this be man who clearly need to be lock up would you want to see he put away for four year or year in fact with the sentencing review whatever he be sentence to he be likely to serve significantly less who know how much of that four year he would serve before he could walk back down your street do not just take it from that this be more appropriate and fitting sentence take it from the professional the government put in charge of assess legislation relate to terrorism jonathan hall kc the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have look at the horrific incident in southport he support the creation of this offence but have say that the penalty appear to be too low knife crime have devastating consequence for our community increase the penalty to year would send clear and unequivocal message that such dangerous behaviour will not be tolerate and that those who pose risk to the public will face the most severe consequence urge member to support this amendment on fly tipping people across the country be rightly furious to see tosser and fly tipper dump waste on our street and green space they be all too aware of the impact on our environment wildlife and the ability of other to enjoy communal area amendment recognise the scourge that litter and fly tipping represent across the country accord to figure compile by defra for local authority in england deal with million incident of fly tipping and be estimate to spend more than million of taxpayer money clean it up each year that money would be well spend on frontline service accord to keep britain tidy litter and fly tipping cost the country million report june vol do my hon friend agree that that be money that could go to frontline service so it be about time we take more stringent measure to change behaviour along with some good enforcement could not agree more small minority wreak havoc on our countryside and our street and create absolute chaos that be what this amendment be about tough sanction to divert people from do such mindless thing the money waste every year on clean up would be well spend on frontline service such as fill pothole or provide community service instead it be use to clean up after those who have no respect for other or for our natural environment the most common location for fly tipping be on pavement and road which account for of all incident in the small van sized dump or an amount of waste that could easily fit in car boot it be therefore logical to conclude that significant majority of fly tipping incident stem from vehicle use vehicle to dump van full or boot full of waste should come with real consequence and the people who do it should feel that in their ability to use their vehicle as well as through financial penalty the previous government increase fine for fly tipping from to but we can go far to deter people from dump on the doorstep of other the amendment would require the home secretary to consult on the establishment of scheme of drive licence penalty point for fly tipper and those who toss rubbish from vehicle in committee the minister pledge to engage with defra on this issue by pass this amendment we could go far by commit to undertake consultation to develop workable and effective scheme for the benefit of all those who want to be able to enjoy their green space and for our environment and the wildlife that suffer at the hand of fly tipper and those who toss waste urge member to support the amendment let we send message to the mindless minority who wreak havoc on our green space before conclude my remark would like to draw the attention of the house to amendment and which among other conservative proposal aim to strengthen respect order we have hear the minister speak both in committee and in the chamber of the role these order can play in tackle antisocial behaviour the success of the policy will be contingent on its effective enforcement by the police and on perpetrator be aware that they will face tough sanction if they breach the order hope the government will continue to consider these amendment draw member attention to these amendment as they be indicative of the constructive approach conservative members have take towards improve the bill in way that we believe would benefit the legislation as whole hope that member across the house will give serious consideration to our amendment and new clause over the come two day the minister and have spend more time together than she probably ever envisage and believe we can agree that the bill contain some sensible and proportionate measure great protection for our retail worker effort to tackle antisocial behaviour and more measure to tackle vile and horrendous child exploitation however we can work together to go far and that be what our opposition amendment seek to do begin by once again welcome the bill it will deliver so much for my constituent by protect people from crime and enable tough action on antisocial behaviour include in area that have too long be label low level and ignore such as the illegal off road bike that constituent so often raise with the bill will introduce mandatory reporting for child sexual abuse one of the key recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse or iicsa this be long overdue measure which have long be call for by our labour home secretary and prime minister personally however remain concerned that the government be not go far enough on the issue of mandatory reporting have therefore table three amendment to the bill on that subject amendment and on which will focus my speech today amendment and be not intend to change government policy quite the opposite they be intend to deliver the government state policy to implement the iicsa recommendation relevant to the home office in full the home secretary state in january that that be the government intention and reaffirm that just yesterday respond with firm yes to my question after her statement on whether it remain government policy to implement the recommendation in full however there be three significant gap in our plan to implement recommendation on mandatory reporting where the bill do not deliver what iicsa recommend with these gap be concerned that the duty to report will be ineffective in some of the setting where it be most need my concern apply to religious group in particular will use the example of the jehovah witness the religious group grow up in to illustrate how and why jehovah witness have deep cultural distrust of secular authority which as happen in lot of religious group lead to culture of deal with everything internally include child sexual abuse and report nothing to the police their internal process for do so be atrocious jehovah witness have something call the two witness rule which mean that no action be take on any report of wrongdoing unless there be two witness to it there be never two witness to child sexual abuse give that context to highlight why the mandatory duty to report must be absolutely watertight as iicsa recommend to prevent people in the leadership of organisation like the jehovah witness from avoid it will cover the three gap in turn first there be no criminal sanction if someone do not comply with the duty understand that the government be propose professional sanction such as referral to the disclosure and barring service and to relevant professional regulator but that be not set out in the bill and would apply to only fraction of people under the duty it would not for example do much in religious setting where so many of the failing be happen and where the duty would if construct properly help immensely to protect child iicsa be clear that failure to comply should be criminal offence and amendment would make that the case it propose fine as the appropriate sanction which be in line with good practice overseas many other country france australia part of canada and so on have introduce mandatory reporting and many have do so with criminal sanction of this kind while the government will likely say that criminal sanction could have chilling effect that would stop people go into profession that work with child the international evidence clearly show that this do not happen in the australian state of victoria for instance professor ben mathews have do extensive research on mandatory reporting law and their efficacy which thoroughly encourage the minister to ask official to examine the second gap relate to those who come under the duty to report iicsa recommend that the duty should apply first to anyone work in regulate activity with child under the safeguarding vulnerable groups act and the bill use that criterion tick however iicsa also recommend that it should apply to anyone in position of trust over child as define by the sexual offences act which the bill do not include amendment would make it so the bill set out list of relevant activity in part of schedule which replicate about of what be in the sexual offences act however that miss be critical for start it include sport coach and teacher which schedule do not go back to my early example section of the sexual offences act include very effective definition of religious leader schedule do include definition of religious leader but require such people to have regular unsupervised contact with child to be subject to the duty that qualification will allow virtually any religious leader be they pay clergy or volunteer elder like in the jehovah witness to escape the duty as very few have regular unsupervised contact with child despite be in significant position of power and influence personally know at least one person who be sexually abuse as child in that organisation when they go to speak to religious leader about it in the presence of their parent not unsupervised they be advise that go to the police would mean bring reproach on god name so no report be make by either the victim or their family or by those religious elder that be commonplace under the bill as draft there be no sanction for that those elder be not mandate reporter even if they be the propose offence in clause of stop someone else from make report an offence very much welcome for the record apply only to other mandate reporter if therefore someone pressure victim or their parent not to make report that will not be illegal that offence need to be broaden too the national society for the prevention of cruelty to children be call for the government to consider broad offence of conceal child sexual abuse to which urge the government to give serious consideration will give more detail on that later if there be time the hon gentleman be make very important point in particular on the jehovah witness cult one of the method jehovah witness use to ensure that issue like this do not escape from the organisation be threaten individual with the act of disfellowshippe be cut off from all communication with their own family wonder whether he will go little far in recognise that too thank the hon member for that intervention be very pleased that other hon member in the house be aware of that issue which be something be try to do some work on separately it be certainly relevant to what be discuss to give the house little more context on that through the act of disfellowshipping when the organisation decide that someone have commit serious sin it can essentially tell all their family and friend to cut they off permanently the same apply if an individual choose simply to leave the religion disfellowshipping be very rarely apply to perpetrator of crime and be more often apply to the victim who report they it be an enormous problem that have to be deal with and look forward to engage with the hon member far on that as highlight on second reading the australian royal commission that investigate the organisation handling of abuse case find that while allegation have be document by religious elder against individual in australia alone not single one be report to the police we must tighten up this definition and ensure that it include religious leader the government could do so by amend the definition in paragraph of part of schedule and by add further item to the list in relation to sport professional to deal with that point as well however the much neater and strong legislative solution would be to just do what iicsa say and refer to the sexual offences act and the definition therein which amendment seek to do the third problem relate to what trigger the duty to report iicsa recommend that the duty should apply in three case first when mandated reporter be tell by child or perpetrator that abuse have take place secondly when they see it happen and thirdly when they observe recognise indicator of child sexual abuse which can range from thing like child be pregnant or have sexually transmit infection to other more subjective indicator our bill score two out of three as it do not include the third point on recognise indicator which be also refer to as reasonable suspicion overwhelmingly child do not report abuse that be be do to they at the time that the abuse be happen those who do report tend to do so year after it happen when it be far too late to protect they and far too late in many case to catch the perpetrator and stop they harm other child the australian royal commission in find that the average time for someone to disclose child sexual abuse be year after it happen so include reasonable suspicion be critical and that be what my amendment would do give the potentially subjective judgment need in that case amendment would exempt the case of recognise indicator from criminal sanction for non compliance which be also what iicsa recommend the government may be of the view that include recognised indicator and make my propose change to include position of trust would lead to flood of additional report that will overwhelm the system with false lead that prevent real case of abuse be tackle those be very reasonable concern and hear they but again we must look to the international example where this just have not take place in australia there be an increase in case after it bring in robust mandatory reporting law but the system adapt and cop with exist screening process to remove false report work more effectively notably the number of substantiate report double mean that twice as many sexually abuse child be be identify this be make huge difference we do not even have to go international to see that fear about flood of report just do not materialise we just have to go to northern ireland which already have mandatory reporting for all adult with criminal sanction for non compliance as part of its broad legislation require the reporting of arrestable offence to police and there be no overwhelming flood of report over there urge the government to take these problem seriously as say at the outset the home secretary have reaffirm several time that government policy be to implement iicsa recommendation which fall under the remit of the home office in full know that the government will need to reflect on these issue in detail so will not press these amendment to vote today should the minister not accept they but be aware that colleague in the other place will press similar amendment number of hon member have sign they amendment have signature for example so there be significant fear that without these change the propose mandatory reporting duty be too weak we all want to get this right but the impact assessment on very similar version in the previous government criminal justice bill be damn predict only very small increase in the number of report will if may conclude very briefly by return to what mention early about the potential offence of conceal child sexual abuse look at how to include this as an amendment to broaden discussion but it be very difficult to phrase in the correct way essentially the nspcc have highlight number of case where it argue the bill do not go far enough to cover the multitude of way in which report abuse could be conceal and people who intentionally conceal this crime could be allow to slip through the net iicsa find number of case where it believe that lack of reporting have border on concealment as couple of example we can imagine that clause as currently draft mean that senior leader of an organisation who choose simply to move on an employee they suspect of commit child sexual abuse rather than to ensure that they be report to the authority may not be catch under the offence around prevent someone else from report if their action do not actively prevent or deter that report explicitly other action could include community institution or authority destroy evidence of historical child sexual abuse in order to prevent it be reinvestigate or in some other way hamper or interfere with investigation that be take place it could also include someone bury evidence of child sexual abuse after it have be report to the authority so that it can not be properly investigate the bill provide we with strong opportunity to deal with some those issue and hope the government will look at that as the bill move through the other place thank you madam deputy speaker for call to speak and thank the house for listen to my contribution very much hope that the government will continue to look at these issue in more detail so that we can find an acceptable solution call the liberal democrat spokesperson rise to speak to amendment which stand in my name and briefly in favour of amendment and also in my name wish to start by thank all those who have campaign over many year for some of the sensible change to the bill that we be discuss today also want to put on record my thank to our fantastic police force include greater manchester police and also to my hon friend the members for frome and east somerset anna sabine and for sutton and cheam luke taylor for their assiduous work on the bill committee liberal democrat amendment would ensure that the police can not use live facial recognition technology when impose condition on public assembly or procession under section or of the public order act unless new and specific code of practice govern its use in public space have first be approve by both houses regulation around the use of live facial recognition have be discuss many time in this house and support for strengthen the current situation bring clarity and certainty to police force have gain support from all part of the house both in this chamber and in westminster hall hope this amendment do the same today the liberal democrats oppose the police use of facial recognition surveillance it breach the right to privacy and be far too often biased particularly give its propensity to wrongly identify people of colour and woman in our manifesto last year we commit immediately to halt the use of live facial recognition surveillance by the police and private company when datum or technology such as artificial intelligence be use by the police they must be regulate to ensure that they be unbiased they must be use in way that be transparent and accurate and that respect the privacy of innocent people policing should not intrude on this right for people who be not suspect of any crime on the question of bias much of the recent debate have centre around the national physical laboratory study into the equitability of facial recognition technology in law enforcement this report be frequently cite by proponent of facial recognition include the shadow home secretary both at the dispatch box when the bill come before the house on second reading and during well attend westminster hall debate last november as evidence that bias in the technology be on the decline however we should not overlook one of that study most critical finding in live facial recognition where real time camera feed be compare against predetermine watchlist the likelihood of false positive be not fix instead it depend heavily on the specific parameter of how that technology be deploy particularly on the face match threshold that threshold in turn be influence by both the size and composition of the watchlist as well as the volume and nature of the people move through the surveillance zone the study recommend that where operationally feasible the police use face match threshold of in order to reduce the risk of bias however and this be crucial without clear regulation police force be under no obligation to adopt this or any specific standard in other word the presence of the technology alone do not ensure fairness without oversight significant room remain for bias to persist in how facial recognition be apply this lead to increase instance of the wrong people be stop and search an area of police that already disproportionately impact black community new technology in policing may well present good opportunity to improve public safety and police should take advantage of they to prevent and solve crime however give that new technology can raise significant concern relate to civil liberty and discrimination we must ensure that any new power involve they be scrutinise by both houses liberal democrat amendment would ensure that the police can not use live facial recognition technology when impose condition on public assembly or procession under section or of the public order act unless new and specific code of practice govern its use in public space have first be approve by both houses this will ensure democratic oversight of any change to further legislation that may impact public privacy and civil liberty hope that the amendment will have support from across the house have just few word to say on amendment and which would enable review of antisocial behaviour power antisocial behaviour as member have already mention this afternoon blight community erode trust fray the social fabric and disproportionately affect the most vulnerable many colleague have raise issue within their own community some of which see in my constituency we have off road bike in heaviley marple offerton and high lane they be persistent blight on my community they intimidate people endanger public safety and be just really annoying but we must respond with law that be not just tough but fair and proportionate that be why urge all colleague to support amendment and which would ensure that antisocial behaviour law be review before be change and that any new guidance be create with public input also welcome amendment table by my hon friend the member for wells and mendip hills tessa munt which aim to ensure that the duty to report suspect child abuse cover faith group encourage the hon member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling to seek she out as he will find doughty ally in his attempt to improve the bill as it impact on faith group as say on second reading there be measure in the bill that the liberal democrats support be our amendment to be accept the bill would go even far towards keep our community safe in way that be proportionate and that balance the civil liberty implication of give the police more power hope that the house will support our amendment rise to support the bill and to speak to amendment which stand in my name and be support by more than member from across the house the measure in the bill represent the most significant package of crime prevention and police reform in generation from strengthen action against shoplifting knife crime and antisocial behaviour to introduce new power to confront child sexual abuse this legislation give our police the tool they need to take back our high street and town centre be proud to support the bill and be proud that this labour government be show leadership by put victim first support our police and turn the tide on crime after year of conservative neglect it be in that same spirit of place victim at the heart of our justice system that have table amendment it address an urgent and under recognise issue the devastating link between domestic abuse and suicide and the failure of our legal system to properly reflect it my amendment be support by southall black sisters pioneer black feminist organisation found in dedicate to empower black minoritised and migrant woman and girl particularly those flee violence for over four decade southall black sisters have be trailblazer in advocate for the right and safety of some of society most marginalised woman and girl and in address barrier root in racism sexism and socioeconomic inequality their mission be to dismantle the structural injustice harm black minoritise and migrant woman and girl while foster global solidarity for future root in equity justice and empowerment sincerely thank the dedicated staff at southall black sisters for their help with my amendment too often those who drive their victim to suicide through sustained coercion violence or psychological abuse walk away without consequence while the bill introduce welcome offence on serious self harm it still fall short of recognise the full impact face by victim of domestic abuse particularly when the abuse end in suicide the statistic should stop we in our track accord to the vulnerability knowledge and practice programme suspect suicide link to domestic abuse now outnumber domestic homicide it be estimate that three woman die by suicide every week as result of abuse yet since there have be just one conviction where victim suicide be legally recognise as the outcome of domestic abuse just one that be not justice it be failure to see these woman recognise what they have endure and hold their abuser to account coercive control and psychological torment may leave no bruise but the impact be every bit as lethal when domestic abuse end in suicide it must be recognise for what it be crime the injustice of this issue fall heavy on those already most marginalised black minoritised and migrant woman face the high barrier to safety barrier root in racism immigration insecurity stigma and lack of culturally competent service too often they be misjudge criminalise or simply ignore the justice system and indeed society must stop ask why do she leave and start ask why be he stop that be the change that amendment call for it shin light on these death and make it clear that when abuse lead to suicide the law must see it hear it and respond be pleased that through this bill the government be take forward meaningful change to deliver on labour mission to halve violence against woman and girl do not intend to press my amendment to vote but hope that the government will bring forward change that recognise the link between abuse and suicide and ensure that our law reflect that reality in france for example the law be change in to recognise suicide or attempt suicide as an outcome of domestic abuse perpetrator may now face up to year in prison and substantial fine if abuse be find to have significantly contribute to the victim death that be the level of seriousness that the issue should demand be grateful to the victims minister my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones for meet to discuss the issue that my amendment raise and welcome her invitation to submit evidence to the forthcoming law commission review also welcome the minister recognition that current homicide law do not adequately reflect these case fully support the bill mission to protect victim and restore trust in our justice system but that justice must be complete the woman drive to take their own life because of abuse must no long be invisible to the law in short amendment would criminalise abuser who drive victim to self harm or suicide by introduce new offence of encourage serious self harm or suicide follow sustained pattern of abuse the bill introduce new offence for encourage or assist self harm but fall short of cover case where victim die by suicide follow sustained pattern of coercive control and abuse recognise this form of abuse in law be critical the amend bill would reflect the severe psychological impact of coercive control enhance deterrence and increase survivor and public confidence in the criminal justice system it would also compel judge jury coroner and the police to properly investigate and respond to such case treat they with the seriousness that they deserve ultimately it would ensure that victim be not fail by legal framework that continue to overlook the long term and often fatal result of domestic abuse rise to support my amendment which seek to amend clause which bring in new law to make spike or administer harmful substance an offence be grateful for the cross party support have receive for this amendment from labour conservative liberal democrat green and independent mp the intended law around spike be sound one and it generally have cross party support indeed it be measure in the previous version of this bill bring in under the previous government my concern be that it have defect and that there be loophole my amendment seek to close that by ensure that spike by reckless act be also an offence spike be hideous heinous activity that destroy life it destroy people physical and mental health and at worst it kill people the majority of victim of woman and the average age of those be spike be just but there be no typical spike incident the majority involve put something in drink but needle spike be also on the rise the most likely place for spike to happen be in bar pub or club but it can happen anywhere include in supermarket or on the street spike be most commonly think among member of the public to be motivate by sexual intent or to facilitate theft but in committee we hear from colin mackie from spike aware uk about very different type of spiking which be what think the new law fail to address it be the rise in spike that seem to have no particular intent behind it it be sometimes refer to as prank spike spike for to quote the government own guidance seemingly bit of fun we hear from colin mackie about how his son greg die through suspect spiking of that kind the bill criminalise spike or administer harmful substance with intent to injure aggrieve or annoy do not accept that every case of spike fit into that definition will give an example of scenario where recklessness would cover case of spike by the way should say that recklessness be well trodden principle in criminal law date back over year it be an alternative to intent so that if the prosecution fail to establish that someone mean to do something it can alternatively establish that their action be so reckless that they should be convict an example be assault cause actual bodily harm the prosecution must establish the harm but it can establish either that someone intend that harm or that they do an act so reckless that harm be bind to follow it do not matter which it establish to jury it will secure conviction it be the same with manslaughter the prosecution can run case that although somebody do not intend for someone else to die their action be so reckless that they should have know that someone might die and it can secure conviction by the way in the absence of law on spike those two offence be often use but they be often defective which be why the government be bring in their own spike law however they have fail to replicate the principle of recklessness within it will give hypothetical example group of friend go into bar two of they have be take illegal drug they have do it before and they be enjoy themselves they say to each other that friend in our circle he need to loosen up some more he need to stop his ridiculous opposition to have bit of fun by take these pill tell you what we do he favour let not tell he but let slip one of these pill we ve be take in his drink so he can loosen up and enjoy the evening like we be they go ahead and do that and of course their friend very likely be harm he may not have do that drug before or he may have be take prescription drug and the mixture be cocktail be sure the house would intend that those two people have commit crime but when they be take to trial can see scenario where their defence will say member of the jury my client be foolish they be silly they should have do it but they do intend to annoy their friend they do intend to injure their friend what they intend to do be have bit of fun and help he have bit of fun it be stupid but they do not intend it how be jury suppose to convict beyond reasonable doubt on that instead if the prosecution could point to recklessness it would be able to say member of the jury we do not care whether what these two people intend would be fun for that friend it be so obviously reckless to any reasonable person that it must be crime and you must convict clause need that much more wide range all encompass try and test legal principle in it my amendment would do just that thank colin mackie from spike aware uk for bring that evidence to the bill committee and stamp out spiking which have also do huge amount as well as member no long in this place who have be do lot of work behind the scene be not lawyer but my hon friend have deploy clear and compelling argument at the beginning of his remark he reference how amendment to which be signatory command cross party support in advance of anything the minister may say be my hon friend able to indicate from conversation he have have with the home office and individual ministers the government response he seem to be make such compelling case it would be helpful if the government accept it thank my hon friend be on the bill committee where similar amendment be table so can reference the minister response at that time have also have brief word with the minister outside this place the government position seem to be that the type of activity be describe be cover in the intent to annoy but hope that have make it perfectly clear that all reckless act be plainly not cover by an intention to annoy do not for one minute suggest that the government wilfully do not want the law to work and to cover all scenario but be leave with the impression that they have not sufficiently address their mind to the gap loophole that be star they in the face if they do not like my amendment urge they to draft an amendment of their own to deal with the issue if just one person walk free follow this law because they be able to convince jury that their action be not annoying but they would have be deem reckless that will be terrible failure of what the government be try to do in the bill urge the minister to think again and urge all across the house to vote for the amendment to force the government hand table amendment on public order issue and the policing of demonstration before get to that welcome the proposal in the bill on fly tipping and look forward to the guidance that will be issue to the various authority to deal with it be attract by the opposition amendment on what be include in that guidance largely because like other member my constituency be plague with fly tipping seem to be follow by mattress throughout my constituency in virtually every area visit come to public order and my amendment which table to try to get on the record the reality of what be happen with the public order issue and demonstration in the explanatory note the government have set out this argument the regular protest follow the event in israel and gaza on october highlight gap in public order legislation principally the public order act and they have therefore bring forward proposal in response to the police challenge of such protest since october have be on virtually every national demonstration in central london organise by the palestine solidarity campaign and other group understand the pressure on the police service in fact have police constituent who have have their leave cancel and all the rest because of the frequency of the protest but that have largely be response to the depth of concern about what be happen in gaza people have want to express their view and one of the way of do that through our democratic system be to demonstrate and march and protest all the demonstration have be on have be peaceful good natured and up until few recent incident extremely well policed in the explanatory note the government set out that legislation be be bring forward in relation to three thing which think we can all agree on there be new criminal offence of climb on war memorial secondly there be possession of pyrotechnic article at protest which be dangerous anyway the other be about conceal identity although issue with that be refer to in other amendment because that might well have an impact on the exercise of religious freedom particularly with regard to the veil and be able to dress the government do not cite in the explanatory note the issue in clause of restriction on protest at place of worship in all the national demonstration in london that have take place there have never be an incident outside place of worship concern have be express by some group but largely think they have be by group who have motivation other than concern about public order in the negotiation with the metropolitan police on each demonstration that have take place there have be long discussion in which the route be identify and usually there be overall agreement to avoid any area that could be see as contentious and could provoke reaction even when place of worship such as synagogue have be some distance from the demonstration the organiser have try to ensure not just proper stewarding so that the demonstration do not go anywhere near it usually it have to be or minute walk distance away but that the time of service be avoid as well interestingly until recently there have never be problem but the police seem to have harden their attitude think as result of come under pressure from organisation that might simply not want the protest to go ahead in any form because they take different attitude to what be happen in gaza and pakistan interruption if the water the hon member for selby keir mather be carry be for thank he be concerned that not only be we try to solve problem that do not exist but it could be solve in well way be also worried about the drafting of the legislation clause have the phrase the procession be in the vicinity of place of worship we need clarity on what in the vicinity mean in the negotiation on the last demonstration the protestor want to march to the bbc and the police be concern about synagogue that be or minute walk away the protest organiser say fair enough we make sure that the protest do go anywhere it if there be service go on so no one feel in any way anxious about that however the wording of the clause be open to interpretation and that interpretation be often do by police officer who come under intense pressure from people who might have different motivation from those who be worry about public order the other issue be that the clause refer to procession that may intimidate person of reasonable firmness have no idea what reasonable firmness mean in fact have not see that term in legislation before it may well have come up in court and that may have set the precedent but have no idea what it be in fact would not be able to determine whether member stand with reasonable firmness on any issue because that change with time and with the circumstance worry that if interpretation of these term be leave so loosely in the hand of police officer they be put in an impossible position when it come to these definition and how they implement the measure for long time while demonstration have be go on the police have try to consult as well they can yet even that demonstrate how contentious these issue can become for instance they have consult the jewish community but there be real argument within that community about who represent they the board of deputies of british jews which be normally consult represent an element of the jewish community but certainly not the majority and that board be now split with member contradict the position of the majority other jewish group have not be consult or have only recently have be consult and they have express their concern about how the police be make the decision table an amendment to delete clause because want to get on the record some of the fact around the issue there have not be problem relate to place of worship on any of the national demonstration there be procedure for negotiating route and avoid disturbance which have work pretty well until very recently also before such legislation be produce we need great deal more consultation with much wide community the clause leave open the definition of vicinity and reasonable firmness and open up system that be more difficult to implement than the current system in which negotiation take place in an atmosphere of good will worry about this legislation and hope that in the other place we might get clear definition if nothing else before then we might even get much more detailed guidance from the government on how the bill will be implement otherwise it will cause more division rather than settle some of the problem that some people perceive think some simply want to stop the protest in my view stop they would undermine people democratic right and it would lead to people take action in different way would rather we channel their concern and sometimes yes their anger into form of protest that be manageable and more constructive expression of people view before the bill reach the other place urge the government to think again about clause and to see whether they could clarify some of the definition bring forward guidance and maybe halt the bill implementation until there have be much more thorough consultation with wide section of the community we all want the democratic right of protest uphold have never hear anyone in this house argue against that however we want that do in way that do not cause harm to anyone or deny people their democratic right to express their opinion in this coming period give international affair we will see more demonstration so it be important to get their management right through more effective legislation rise to speak to amendment to on child criminal exploitation thank the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell and the hon member for isle of wight east joe robertson for their speech and proposal voice my support for amendment table by the hon member for brent east dawn butler which would prevent driver licence information obtain by the police be use for the purpose of intrusive facial recognition and gather biometric and amendment table by the hon member for liverpool riverside kim johnson which would remove clause and the ban on face covering in protest situation the hon member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy have also table mitigate amendment on that subject amendment would create exception and not just defence relate to health work and religious faith covering also support amendment which propose an equality review hope the government will look at they all welcome the effort in the crime and policing bill to protect vulnerable child and particularly welcome the introduction of new offence of child criminal exploitation which will signal to perpetrator that coerce manipulate and exploit child into criminal activity be child abuse and will be treat as such criminal be exploit thousand of vulnerable child child in need data show that more than child be at risk of exploitation in and that be likely to be just the tip of the iceberg the perpetrator of exploitation include serious organise crime gang which be well verse in take advantage of legislative gap even though the bill take huge step forward area of it must be strengthen if we be to protect child and bring the perpetrator of that abuse to justice that be why have table amendment to first amendment and would amend the wording in clause to ensure that the offence include activity that put child at significant risk and be link to criminal conduct but be not in themselves criminal offence example of this include carry large amount of cash on public transport be use as look out or decoy and guard unsafe accommodation alone amendment expand the definition of exploitative activity to ensure that preparatory act such as grooming and coercion be capture by the offence welcome the minister comment early and be grateful for the engagement with these amendment but it be not yet obvious to how reference only the facilitation of future offence cover the gap that would be close by amendment and and amendment seem to have be only partly address would therefore welcome further clarification or discussion of the issue with the minister ahead of consideration in the other place secondly amendment would remove clause which currently amount to defence if the perpetrator reasonably believe that the child be over unless the child be under the age of while such provision be common in other area of law in the case of criminal exploitation this clause risk undermine the prosecution of perpetrator due to the well publicise issue of adultification and racism within the criminal justice system the recent independent office for police conduct report into race discrimination and the alexis jay report on criminally exploit child on behalf of action for children both highlight the role of adultification and racism in the criminalisation of child and how it lead to failure in safeguard response specifically but not only for young black boy the modern slavery act be clear child can not consent to their own exploitation and this principle must be uphold by our remove this part of the offence finally amendment to clause would insert the word age or over this would ensure that child could not be criminalise under the new offence of cuckooing it would recognise that they be more often than not the victim not the perpetrator in these situation the child target be often very young and extremely vulnerable and they need protection not prosecution these amendment be not merely technical they be essential they reflect the live experience of child and the finding of numerous report and review that provide compelling evidence of the need for more robust and child centre legal framework urge all member of the house to support these proposal together we can take decisive step towards well protect vulnerable child from exploitation before move on to the amendment want to speak about thank the minister for the speed with which the government have bring forward this bill it address important issue around protect retail worker and tackle shoplifting and antisocial behaviour issue that community such as the town and village that represent feel have be overlook all too often really welcome the government urgency of action in recognition of the great campaign fight by many union include usdaw and also of the real sentiment of my constituent that these crime need to be take far more seriously today though want to focus my time on amendment to clause in the name of the hon member for isle of wight east joe robertson which bring forward important legislative action on spike do so on behalf of constituent will call she sarah today because understandably she have ask to be keep anonymous for the purpose of the story she wish to share with all member but that in no way diminish the great bravery that she have show in her work on this it be real privilege for member of the house to meet constituent who have experience deeply traumatic incredibly difficult moment in their personal life show resilience and depth of character that lot of we could not even dream of and who turn their pain and personal trauma into powerful force for change that be deeply true of sarah and of so many woman right across the country who have be victim of spike sarah story be her own but it have theme that will resonate with far too many people here and across the uk it start on her birthday like most of we she be look forward to celebrate her birthday with her friend they have organise drink in nearby town and the night start off fill with fun and joy it end though with sarah alone traumatise confused and unable to speak in car park outside the venue after she be spiked sadly this horrific act be one that far too many woman across the country be fall victim to after she be spiked sarah try to do what she could she have lose control of her word she try to call out for help but she feel unable to an ambulance be call but do not know what to do it wait there with she but do not take she to hospital or make sure that she get the aftercare and testing that she need she be leave to fend for herself what be really tragic be the fact that on top of all that trauma and despite how difficult that moment in the car park must have be for she it be not the only time in this experience that she feel alone at every step when she engage with the police and the authority and when she push for action she be ignore there be insufficient action and insufficient focus there be minimal follow up and no prosecution and the police take no further action on her case many of we possibly include myself if be be completely candid would be completely flatten by that but not sarah she turn that pain into mobilise force and determination to push for action work with spike aware uk she have be campaign for specific offence of spike for some time and she be as excited as be to see that finally be bring forward by the government in the bill today this real meaningful change will ensure much more focus much more action and hopefully much great awareness of the damage that spike can do of the seriousness of the offence and of the seriousness of the consequence that will hopefully now follow it thank my hon friend for his brilliant articulation of sarah story which for too many of we include myself as the mp for darlington be not uncommon before be elect as the mp raise this issue in darlington because number of people there have be affect by spike do he agree that bring this provision into law today be important because for so many people often woman and vulnerable people not be believe when they report be spiked be one of the big barrier to seek justice lot of we have be inspire by my hon friend campaign before she arrive in this place and her intervention be powerful example of why it be exactly that moment that lack of belief that far too many victim of spike be encounter when they go to the authority at the moment and it be that lack of belief that we be look to completely undercut in legislate to make this specific offence today sarah reach out to because excited as she be about the bill she rightly want to ensure that we be deliver it as fully as possible know that it be the same motivation that make the hon member for isle of wight east table his amendment thank the minister for take the time to speak to about this amendment on friday know from the conversation she have have with official that they be confident that as draft the bill would capture the fullness of possible offence relate to spike be grateful to the hon member particularly for set out the case of his constituent who be here in westminster yesterday indeed also meet she do he accept that it be those of we elect in this chamber who make decision and that assurance from official that can not be articulate in this house be look for that articulation be not good reason not to back my amendment thank the hon member for all the work he have do on this important issue through table the amendment not just now but in committee do not want to put word into the minister mouth but be pretty sure she will be able to articulate some of those official view back to he when sum up however want to ask the minister as be sure the hon member and other colleague would want to that as we go through this process and give that she care so passionately about this issue she continue to test that understanding with official we owe it to sarah and the many other victim of spike to ensure that we get this right know the minister be as determined as be to ensure that happen and really hope that as result we can fully test official understanding and that view before we finally get the bill into law to ensure that we be take the fullness of action need to tackle spike that fullness of action be important because the issue that sarah encounter and the challenge that far too many people face from spike right across the country be not one that we can solve with legislation alone that be an important part of why we be act by bring forward new clause today and why we be discuss amendment if the bill be finally pass and finally bring forward that specific offence that so many of we have be look for hope that it will not be the end of the story hope the minister will be able to bring forward further action work closely with police chief and commissioner to ensure that this be drill into their strategic vision as part of our national strategy to reduce violence against woman and girl we need to make sure that force appropriately prioritise spike case that officer be appropriately train to encounter they and take they seriously ensure that deadline around collect cctv be not miss before crucial evidence be delete we need to ensure that right across the country there be not single force that be not take this issue with the seriousness that it deserve will certainly be reach out to both my police and crime commissioner to urge they to do exactly that and would welcome the minister thought about how this government can make sure that we use all the power and tool at our disposal to ensure that police force be do so too if we be to deter possible perpetrator of this crime it be important that the severity of this new legislation and the new penalty be well understand too would therefore welcome the minister thought on how we can ensure that we be disseminate the action we be underline today and hopefully bring into law in due course to ensure that right across the country no one be under any illusion that spike be not deeply serious offence it will be treat as such by this government and by the police who will go after they with the full force of the law for far too long victim like sarah and far too many people typically woman right across the country have be leave expose to spike they have be leave feeling like they be victim and leave to go through their experience alone fantastic organisation like spike aware uk have do all they can to champion their cause to bring they together to mobilise and to reinforce the need for change but it be only through action nationally and deliver through our police force right across the country that we can finally do justice to the severity of this issue and to the passionate campaigning of constituent like sarah who for far too long have feel that they have be suffer alone be glad to see this legislation come forward and to see this specific spike offence include look forward to work with the minister to ensure that we can deliver it in as ambitious way as possible as we have hear the bill be broad in scope before turn to the couple of amendment that support want to recognise that the bill scope be evidence by the breadth and number of amendment and new clause it be worth gently remind ourselves that number of the measure be carry over from the criminal justice bill which sadly fall due to the general election almost year ago though there be obviously new clause and amendment hope the minister be in listen mode in change mode and be willing to work across the house and hope that she accept some of these amendment because they would go long way to far improve this legislation have read through the bill and much of it go right to the heart of the community we seek to serve and represent there be topic in the bill that regularly pop up in my inbox and be sure into colleague inboxe as well want to cover two specific area the first be fly tipping and litter an issue that have speak about on many occasion in this chamber since be first elect support the amendment and new clause table by the shadow minister my hon friend the member for stockton west matt vickers in an intervention early touch on the cost of litter to the country think say that it be million but mean billion hope that can be firmly correct because it be big report june vol correction the principle be the same it be money that could go back into our community but billion spend on manage litter and fly tipping be huge amount of money that could otherwise buy huge amount of service for constituency up and down the country do the right hon lady calculation of billion account for how people feel for the degradation of pride in area where people fly tip and for the failure of local service to be able to afford to collect and clean up rubbish tip on the side of our road wonder if there be multipli effect in how people feel about their area because of all this fly tipping the hon lady make an important point there be social and community cost that be difficult to evaluate be fortunate to have some fantastic volunteer and group include the wombles group that go out and litter pick do not mind go out and help when can there be great sense of community come together but nothing be more frustrating than litter pick street walk back and find that one of the tosser have just toss some more litter out of their car do not think the right hon member be point at her shadow minister when she be accuse somebody of be litter tosser think it be just dramatic gesture because nothing could be far from the truth build on the point make by my hon friend the member for darlington lola mcevoy do the right hon member agree that when people see pothole unfilled litter uncollected overgrown verge and general disrepair when they be walk through decline they feel hopeless not just about their community in which they take such pride but about the ability of their council and elect official to act on their most immediate priority do she agree that when we restore pride in place by fix these problem we help to create confidence that politic can deliver well community that be an important point about pride in where we live and about hope as travel around the country often take mental note of the number of pothole drive across there be noticeable difference from one authority to another have to say that walsall be quite good at the moment when it come to fill pothole the hon gentleman make an important point about litter and community my local authority of late have be successfully prosecute some litterbug have see couple of example on social medium just this week of individual who have be treat the high street in pelsall as their own personal litter bin and the local authority have go after they and fin they that send strong message but there be more we can do although much of this be about clear up after these people we also need deterrence to stop this happening lot of it be down to lack of respect for the community and antisocial behaviour for want of well word and it be burden that we should not expect the taxpayer to keep shoulder we have reach something of tipping point and we need to do something more than let people walk away with slap on the wrist whether it be bin strike as we have see in birmingham rural fly tipping or littering lot of our community feel absolutely feed up and overwhelmed and they want action support the amendment table by the shadow minister because take together they form serious and joined up response that would help to protect and support not only our community and those who want to keep they clean but the local environment and wildlife too similarly it be often local farmer who face the burden of fly tipping when fly tipping happen on their land the cost of remove it fall to they it hardly seem fair that they be leave to foot the bill for waste that they do not create amendment on clean up cost seek to address that have hear time and again from frustrated landowner and farmer that the system often punish the victim of fly tipping not the perpetrator do the right hon lady have any thought on the idea that people who hire somebody privately to take away their rubbish be often be hold accountable for that third party company dump the rubbish illegally people be at loss to know what they be suppose to do the hon lady make another important point about tackle waste crime think that be the technical phrase for it again that be something that see locally enforcement matter but there also have to be strong reminder hate to use the word education so perhaps reminder be good to our constituent if somebody come to you and say they will clear your rubbish away your need to think carefully about where they be put that rubbish in my constituency fridge and mattress have be dump be drive down bridle lane last year and see whole lorry or van load of rubbish that have be fly tip in the middle of the road that mean that the road have to be block that be outrageous and it need to stop support amendment and on cost liability guidance they build on the principle that those who cause the mess should pay to clear it up it should not fall as it have time and again on stretch local authority and private landowner to clean up the aftermath of that criminal behaviour touch on enforcement early unless offender be financially liable any deterrent will be limit on litter we must consider drive licence penalty point for those who be catch throw litter out of car again that would be deterrent something to remind people that it be simply not acceptable to throw litter indiscriminately out of car accept that that would affect driver but think that they must take responsibility for the passenger in their car will leave my remark there madam deputy speaker because hope to catch your eye tomorrow to speak to further amendment and new clause today have indicate that there be lot of cross party support for do more to tackle fly tipping and litter which be scourge on our community lawlessness antisocial behaviour street crime and shoplifting have drag our community down when people believe that they can act with impunity without fear of apprehension or respect for other we need parliament to come down hard to restore law and order and give the police the resource that they need to make our street safe again therefore take this opportunity to welcome the crime and policing bill which put right the year of damage and disregard cause by the previous government my focus today be on street racing problem that stretch across the country but have become curse in bassetlaw where car speed along stretch of the the by pass that run through worksop and then into the constituency of my hon friend the member for rother valley jake richards those unofficial road race event be organise via social medium people meet up in an edge of town car park and then stage race up and down the attract huge crowd who come to witness the speed and the flashy soup up car with booming exhaust resident live close to the hear the noise include the screeching of tyre but they be terrified that they or family member will get catch up with the racer as they drive home or go about their daily business the fear of nasty accident be all pervasive across the country people who have turn up to watch the racing have die such as year old ben corfield and year old liberty charris from dudley and year old sophie smith from radcliffe young life needlessly lose let say in the spirit of openness that as young man perhaps do not always drive as responsibly as do now although the hon lady be make an important point there be an educational component to this will she join in commend the work of the under car club and its pathfinder initiative which teach young driver about the danger of drive in that fashion my concern be that such unorganised race event be hold to show off how fast and noisy car can be there need to be much strong action to control that worry that there will be further death and accident if the police be not give the power to deal with it in bassetlaw visit resident who tell that their life be live hell with their nerve on edge every weekend not only do they hear the noise but the front of their house have become view platform for the crowd thank the hon lady for make that point because have experience exactly what she describe on my own street in henley we have problem with street racing boy race if we can call it that and phone the police on several occasion they say we know it happen but we do have the resource to come and deal with it eventually they get so many call that they act they put in place some sort of prevention order for antisocial behaviour but that could be do only once they could not do it over an extended timeframe do she feel that the power should be strengthen for the police to stop that intimidating and antisocial behaviour very much agree that be why be raise it today the hon gentleman talk about public space protection order which will come to shortly but think the law need to be strengthen to give the police much strong power to deal with the problem it be not local phenomenon because it be happen right across the country and people be use encrypt social medium to organise the group since those visit have be work with bassetlaw district council and the police on this issue that council have join force with rotherham council and they be bring forward public space protection order which just mention to cover the whole of the from outside worksop all the way to rotherham with the ambition of prohibit car cruise and give the police the ability to serve fix penalty notice prosecute or issue fine for breach in the meantime have work with the police to install cctv camera at key point on the and there be plan to put up second the camera be be use to collect datum on the vehicle that turn up for cruise event the police then send pre enforcement letter to the car owner the owner be not necessarily drive at the time however because quite often young people have borrow their parent car mean that the notice be be send to parent but think that be just as good to be honest the police say that that be help to reduce involvement the police tell that they have put dedicated staffing into patrol the for the next four weekend their zero tolerance approach will include fine seizure and report to the court they be also share live intelligence on vehicle move around the county in order to be proactive and prevent cruising and meet before they happen they have be successful they believe in prevent racing before it start like the police be fearful that someone could die or be seriously injure so they regard this matter as high priority be disappointed that the local police of the hon member for henley and thame freddie van mierlo do not consider it in the same way this be serious issue most weekend on friday saturday or sunday night such car be present people perhaps just meet in an empty supermarket car park to compare their vehicle but on other occasion they take the opportunity to race have be out to look at the car myself to see who those individual be at first think that they be use their vehicle to engage in crime but the whole focus be on show off their soup up vehicle we have already have death quite often of the people who go out to witness the speeding so be call for much strong action to prevent further death the increase order in the crime and policing bill such as respect order will help to tackle antisocial behaviour do my hon friend think that they could be vehicle sorry poor choice of word to address the gathering that she have describe agree with my hon friend those order could be use the bill strengthen the ability to seize motor vehicle when they be use in manner cause alarm distress or annoyance but this be nationwide problem and ask the minister for private discussion to consider whether the bill can be strengthen to make it criminal to organise promote or attend an unofficial road race event welcome the bill because it respect and recognise the daily risk our shop worker face my constituent go to buy pint of milk in his local sainsbury at easter time he be queue up for the milk when somebody rush in and sweep the whole shelf of easter egg into bag they call it supermarket sweep and it be the new form of shoplifting it be not someone sneakily put something in their pocket or bag it be people steal food to order very publicly and it be food that be worth lot of money in my constituency of darlington have witness people do what my hon friend describe so often that it be now common source of conversation between and the assistant work in those shop do she agree that usdaw campaign to protect shop worker which have be go on for year be brilliant and that it be excellent that this labour government be go to finally introduce the right punishment for people who commit aggravate assault against shop worker usdaw be the first union ever join and very much support its campaign share the fear that shop worker have because there be nothing they can do they have to sit or stand and watch the crime happen for fear of be assault or abuse that be the advice that usdaw and their management have give they the law have to be strengthen to protect they they have to go to work every day and face that fear which create inordinate stress that be unacceptable my hon friend be give powerful speech in my constituency of bournemouth east regularly talk to shop worker who be experience the scourge of shoplifting no wholesale looting and they be be make to feel incredibly unsafe be think of the staff of tesco in tuckton the co op on seabourne road and tesco on the grove in southbourne be also think of the owner of wine shop who have hockey stick beside they so that they can chase away shoplifter who try to take cart of wine bottle do my hon friend agree that it be very good news that our labour government be introduce new offence of assault retail worker and end the effective decriminalisation of shoplifting will she also commend the co op party which like usdaw have campaign so hard for this new law wholeheartedly agree it be not just usdaw the co op party have campaign vociferously on this matter too it be so important and very much welcome the action this government be take this have go on for too long people need to feel safe in the workplace and this be the good step we can take towards that shop worker in worksop town centre also have to deal with an inordinate amount of antisocial behaviour for example have be tell about how young people come into greggs take food from the cabinet and throw it about the shop worker there feel so fearful that they have not take the covid screen down because they do not want to be attack the intimidation they feel be not acceptable have visit an opticians where the management escort their staff out of the workplace to their car on regular basis it be particularly bad last winter when speak to staff and management there because be so concerned have have meeting with the council and the police to tackle this issue welcome the government commitment to increase neighbourhood policing with more police in our town centre everybody tell they want to see more police walk the street so that they feel safe as they go into town and can make the choice about where they shop do not want people to think about their safety when they go into town centre in my constituency it be priority that they know where the police be know they by their name and feel safe as they go into town this bill go to the heart of many of the issue that have break our country and we be do what we can to repair it there be not huge number of area of the bill that impact scotland directly give the role of the justice system in scotland but road traffic law be one of those area antisocial behaviour involve vehicle have be raise by several member today and some power include those over vehicle licensing remain reserved it be important to remember that although lot of this antisocial behaviour be commit by young people it be not exclusively young people many old driver and user of motorise vehicle commit antisocial behaviour and it have big impact the vast majority of child do not engage in violent behaviour the long term trend for referral to the children reporter in scotland for both offence and non offence ground show significant reduction however road traffic offence and antisocial behaviour use vehicle have significant impact which amplify the effect for the community in the snp increase police funding to billion an increase of million on to support police capacity and capability and the scottish government be provide almost million in additional resource funding which be an increase of compare with the publish budget one of the issue that police officer and community raise with regularly be the use of bike the legal use of bike and decision around their use be broadly reserved matter for the uk government to be legally use in the uk bike must meet the criterion of an electrically assist pedal cycle the electric motor should not be able to propel the bike when it be travel at more than mph and the maximum power output should be police scotland have publish advice on bike include through awareness campaign to provide clarity on the standard require for they to be permit to ride on public road include safe and responsible use the hon gentleman be make an excellent speech this be indeed serious problem across the country in my constituency many resident be concerned about speed bike of various type be pleased that our local force thames valley police be take more action and would urge it to go far be glad to hear that police scotland be also take action on this terrible menace be pleased to hear that work be ongoing throughout the country should have say at the start that be speak to amendment which stand in my name the snp recognise that there have be call for further legislation on licensing which be what my amendment relate to the snp table similar amendment in committee relate to off road bike everyone who use our road and path be responsible for respect other road and path user and for follow the rule and guidance in the highway code unfortunately significant minority of road user be not respect the right of other road user and be rid motorised vehicle illegally on our road and path in the bad case they have cause serious injury and death to either themselves or other people cause huge heartache for the family affect commend the hon member for make that important point these young people who be use off road bike be not only tear up community and green space but put themselves at severe risk commend he for bring that point to the house because it be such an important one it go to the point make by the hon member for tewkesbury cameron thomas who talk about his experience as young driver and be more responsible driver now would echo that myself and be sure most people recognise that in themselves some of it be inexperience sometimes it be just plain stupidity but that education be important to help tackle the issue and ensure that people understand the potential consequence of such action both for themselves and for other people particularly good education piece be do in north east scotland when child from all over the area go to large venue and be give hard hit and pretty blunt message include video of serious road accident where people have be either seriously injure or kill when they go into the venue they see fine look car when they come out that car have be crush as if it have be in an accident that be hard hit experience and lot of young people come out of it with new respect for drive and use motor vehicle turn now to off road and quad bike and particularly bike which the amendment be focus on the snp support police scotland and its partner in deal with illegally modify vehicle and the misuse of off road vehicle the scottish government be consider way forward in partnership with police scotland and local authority to tackle vehicle nuisance and related safety issue that include continue to liaise with the uk government lot of work have go on behind the scene between the devolved administrations and the uk government and welcome that work by the minister and her civil servant which have be helpful the ongoing collaboration ensure that scottish interest be consider in any uk wide decision affect road safety we be also consider further option include liaise with the uk government on cross party basis and community engagement regard the potential use of mobile safety camera van to deter register vehicle from speed on public road the amendment call on the government to conduct consultation on licensing and track the ownership of bike and scooter which in many case be require to be insure although the public be generally not aware of that will make final plea to the insurance sector which think could be do lot more to make it clear to people what insurance do and do not cover the modification of vehicle that be raise early by the hon member for bassetlaw jo white be one such issue and do not recall see great deal about that in insurance document have receive over the year the insurance industry could do lot more to increase public awareness and try to tackle such issue and support the scottish and uk governments in their objective will be speak to number of new clause but will start by set out tiny bit of context and say why the bill be so important for my town at the heart of ipswich be community neighbour who support each other and small business that serve we in the town centre and that be see real shoot of recovery however there be no doubt that when be proudly elect as its mp we be arguably at our low ebb for generation regenerate our town be not just about economic it be about rebuild our community and that be exactly what the bill help to deliver welcome the government new clause and amendment which strengthen the bill far this have be good conversation and cross party debate but say gently to the shadow minister who try to claim credit for number of the change that do not think the argument if only we have year rather than will wash with many of the people watch the challenge that we have speak about do not happen overnight they be year in the making although appreciate the conversation that we have have today we must acknowledge the year of suffer that many of our resident business and emergency service will come to they in moment have face with those year behind we welcome the amendment that introduce important provision to help turn that tide the bill give the police the power they need to tackle mobile phone theft and recover steal good as have be say we be scrap the shoplifting threshold which have disproportionately hit small and independent business in my town and across the country it also introduce tough new respect order to tackle the bad antisocial behaviour offender so that our town centre be no long blight by the same offender again and again any retail worker in any corner of our town will be able to list shocking litany of abuse harassment and sometimes even violence as have be say usdaw and the co operative party have do incredible work in that area but such abuse be not part of the job which be why the bill create the specific offence of assault shop worker new clause will introduce new offence of trespassing with intent to commit criminal offence it will give the police the necessary power to act when individual enter premise with the intention of commit serious criminal act be that burglary theft assault or criminal damage for business in town such as ipswich that matter hugely speak regularly with local shop owner small business owner and retail worker who be proud to serve their community but who have see at first hand the impact of rise theft vandalism break in and antisocial behaviour on our high street the new clause give our police tool to intervene early before harm be do and when there be clear intent to commit crime the amendment also extend protection to those who protect we that be why strongly support new clause to which strengthen the law to ensure that emergency worker be properly protect from the threat intimidation and abuse that they all too often face while simply do their job to serve the public too many of our frontline police officer paramedic nhs staff and firefighter have face unacceptable abuse let be frank it be utterly disgusting that those serve our community and country who keep we safe sometimes with great sacrifice and selflessness all too often suffer such unacceptable behaviour be sure that everyone in the chamber have hear awful story of emergency worker who have endure abuse on account of their race or religion and the new clause make clear the consequence for an individual if they engage in such bigotry as say early we should never accept such thing as simply be part of the job the new measure ensure that when people threaten or insult those emergency worker there be clear criminal consequence to our frontline worker say this directly this house stand with you you deserve not just our gratitude but our full support you protect we so we will protect you another sad indictment of the last few year be the absolute impunity for violence against woman and girl speak to so many woman in ipswich who feel uncomfortable particularly at night woman have be tell to keep an eye on their drink for fear of spike and victim of other heinous crime have feel that they be fight not just the perpetrator but system stack against they therefore strongly support strong stalk protection order and the new spike offence however the bill be about more than new law it be also about fast justice strong protection and proper accountability for police and council when victim be let down that be why support new clause which rightly remove time limit for civil claim in child sexual abuse case the law should never compound the trauma of victim by close the door to justice simply because too much time have pass new clause and also apply much strong protection for child and young people the abuse and coercion of child be grotesque crime and the coward use child to carry out their criminal operation should face the full force of the law we know this abuse can be pernicious and the tactic that be use be constantly evolve but these new clause and other part of the bill seek to tackle the issue head on like the bill the new clause also put victim where they should always have be at the heart of the legal system the bill send clear message we will no long tolerate survivor be shut out by the technicality of the system their voice matter their experience matter and their right to seek justice matter public confidence do not just rest on tough talk or new offence it rest also on system that people trust trust that the police will respond victim will be support those who commit crime will be hold to account and power grant will be use fairly proportionately and with accountability the safety of our community can not rest on central government alone welcome this bill focus on partnership not pass problem between agency but solve they together the national initiative match our local initiative in ipswich have be work with labour lead ipswich borough council to put in place groundbreake partnership with ipswich central to tackle street drinking in our town centre the bill be proof that if we work together we can deliver at every level while we bring forward fully form and fully cost plan to make difference to the life of people in my town and in other be only too aware that some people still want to divide community such as our in ipswich they rarely offer real solution policy or change instead they simply want to feed resentment and pit neighbour against neighbour know that we be strong when we stand together not divide by fear or set against each other but unite in our determination to make our town and our country safe fair and more secure for everyone that be exactly what the bill will give we rise order before call the next speaker inform the house that plan to call the minister at pm which would give the remain members bob about five minute each rise to support amendment in the name of my hon friend the member for isle of wight east joe robertson hope that the minister listen to the compelling case that my hon friend make and to the compelling case make by the hon member for hitchin alistair strathern on the issue of spike more generally want to put on record my support for my constituent colin and mandy mackie and their organisation spike aware uk do not think any of we can fully comprehend their experience the police knock on their door to tell they that their year old son have die at college from drug overdose but they subsequently find out that his non alcoholic drink have be spike by five ecstasy tablet as other member have say there be no support or help for the family in that situation the police assume that he have die of drug overdose although they do not know that and they subsequently apologise to the mackies for their treatment of they what particularly admire about colin and mandy be how they have focus their effort on ensure that their experience be not share by anyone else that be why very much welcome the inclusion of spike in the bill which be continuation from the criminal justice bill introduce in the previous parliament the point to be make be about certainty and the amendment table by my hon friend the member for isle of wight east bring certainty to the situation have be in this house with previous ministers who have be tell by official that spike be already cover by legislation and therefore there be no need for specific mention of spike on that point will my right hon friend give way give the stricture on time have well not previous ministers say that there be no need for specific legislation on spike because it be already cover campaigning include by your colleague madam deputy speaker the first deputy chairman of ways and means the hon member for bradford south judith cummins and by my former colleague richard graham demonstrate that there be need for specific measure and that if we be go to have specific measure it need to bring certainty part of that certainty be for the benefit of the police and other the police should know that that reckless behaviour be also crime and there should not be any dubiety when they arrive at venue to find someone in partially conscious state or unable to articulate what have happen to they it will also allow campaigning to be clear that whatever the circumstance drink be spiked or person be inject and that be crime amendment or perhaps another amendment that the government might bring forward in the other place would bring clarity which be important that be what we need to bring about as the hon member for hitchin say that can lead to the great training of the police and nhs worker to be able to support people in spike situation hope the minister will reflect on everything that have be say today the final point will make relate particularly to scotland we need to have common approach across the uk it should not matter whether somebody be spiked in glasgow manchester or cardiff that be not to disrespect the devolution settlement and the different approach of the criminal justice system the effect and the impact should be the same wherever people be and the criminality should most certainly be the same whether the behaviour be intentional or reckless in the interest of time will skip through the many amendment want to support but there be few that will really make difference to people in milton keynes central first reiterate what my hon friend the member for bassetlaw jo white say on street racing unfortunately we have formula driver who say that his success be base on practise on the grid road of milton keynes which really encourage load of people to decide to race there in term of stalk and spiking the most egregious bit of spike for be the premeditation source the material bring they to the venue then use they on person that be not crime do on the spur of the moment significant premeditation come into it one of the major issue we have have in milton keynes be organise beg outside our shopping centre it be organise by gang people often look like they be homeless or they be assume to be homeless by care resident in milton keynes but in reality they be house by the council and they be exploit they have rota for which corner or which shop they can each sit in front of during which period of time and the majority of the proceed that people donate go to an organised crime network those individual be be exploit in other way as well new clause be so important in address this issue as the real true crime that it be not the crime of the people beg but of those organise the begging also rise in support of new clause which be on special measure for witness particularly around youth justice that be very important as we hear from my hon friend the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling many people who experience sexual abuse do not come forward for year and year so new clause which would remove limitation be really important let address couple of other thing in the bill my hon friend the member for bolton north east kirith entwistle make such an important speech consider domestic abuse and she explain it very well new clause be about bar person not have employment in law enforcement we must recognise that follow the case of sarah everard confidence in law enforcement be at an all time low when people call law enforcement because they have experience domestic abuse sexual harassment rape or stalking they be at their most vulnerable and they need to know that the people respond to those incident no matter which law enforcement service will treat they accord to the law and not with some of their own natural bias as we have see that bring to my final point in term of confidence in policing we need to ensure that all law enforcement be do with clarity of law not because of particular campaigning as we have see with the enforcement of the offences against the person act which we will debate later be incredibly fortunate to sit on the bill committee consider this legislation it be clear that although opinion differ on detail we all share common goal of tackle crime in meaningful way so that we can make people feel safe in our community again as community focus liberal have state many time that keep people safe and instill safety in our neighbourhood be some of the most powerful way that we can foster strong community and improve the quality of life and freedom of opportunity that everyone in our country should enjoy be grateful to the government for their willingness to engage with the point that we all make in committee particularly to the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips and the minister for policing and crime prevention the right hon member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham dame diana johnson despite several productive conversation it be frustrating that several important addition to the bill be reject by the government in committee for that reason rise to speak in favour of several new clause before we although several of the measure close to my heart those regard community policing knife crime and stalking be not before the house today there be several press new clause that feel must speak to they pertain to what should be fundamental right in our country the right to freedom from oppression and the right of access to proper healthcare for woman congratulate the hon member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling on the courage he demonstrate in his speech early and encourage the government to consider the measure he speak to if they come back from the lords if not to consider they beforehand start by express my support for amendment which deal with spike and be table by the hon member for isle of wight east joe robertson spike be horrendous offence deeply violate act of harm and potential exploitation that must be treat with the utmost seriousness in committee we hear evidence from colin mackie who be the chair and co founder of spike aware uk colin give important evidence for the committee to consider indicate that spike offence can often be intend as prank rather than intend to cause harm his son greg die in suspect drink spike incident in club and colin have since campaign alongside greg mother mandy for change in the law to stop similar incident from occur also thank the hon member for hitchin alistair strathern for raise broad concern about spike agree that further measure need to be introduce include awareness so that testing take place further evidence can be gather and conviction can be secure amendment be sensible and necessary clarification of the law it make clear what seem painfully obvious that what matter in spike case be not the nature of the intent but the recklessness and callousness of the act itself encourage member across the house to support the amendment when we vote be also pleased to support amendment as well as related new clause and which we will discuss tomorrow take together these amendment create vital safeguard around the right to protest they would subject facial recognition technology to the proper scrutiny of regulatory framework for the first time and would enshrine the right to protest from many people in my constituency of sutton and cheam and from campaign group such as liberty know that these measure be long overdue and will provide much need clarity to police force as they use new technology to fight crime police force themselves be ask for these measure and be look forward to briefing later this month from the minister on that subject in particular remind the house that hongkongers in my community be deeply worried about the impact of unregulated use of facial recognition technology on our street they fear that if compromise such technology could provide powerful tool to the chinese communist party in its transnational oppression of hongkongers here on our street in britain we know that facial recognition technology can be powerful tool for police force as they try to keep we safe but as with any new technology with great capacity to infringe on our liberty in daily life it must be properly regulate liberal democrats have proud tradition of stand up for those civil liberty argue that we must never throw they away or sleepwalk into surrender they amendment which the liberal democrats have table be rightly in that tradition it would make sure that facial recognition technology can not be use in real time for biometric identification unless certain condition be satisfied such as prevent or investigate serious crime under the serious crime act or public safety threat such as terrorist attack or search for miss vulnerable people it would also make the use of such technology subject to judicial authorisation with judge need to approve its use and appropriately define its scope duration and purpose these regulation would allow for safe use of this important tool protect our civil liberty while keep we safe from crime in the time remain will speak to amendment which have be table by the hon member for rotherham sarah champion and be support by many member across the house include myself welcome the government provision to limit sex offender ability to change their name and know that many other member also welcome they pay tribute to tireless campaigner such as della wright who have campaign for such provision for many year and who have the privilege of meeting at an event organise by emma jane taylor another tireless campaigner and constituent of mine emma jane be survivor and have speak very bravely about the lifelong impact of child sexual abuse like many survivor she have channel her pain into campaign such as this one and have set up charity project that charity be base on research show that of child sexual abuse be carry out by person know to the victim we be right in the house to focus as we have in the past on online abuse and abuse by stranger but we should not forget that of child sexual abuse be carry out by someone the victim know work by project raise awareness of good safeguarding practice emma jane bring to my attention the loophole that allow sex offender to change their name and potentially continue to offend untraced amendment would strengthen the name change provision in the bill by require sex offender to notify the police of their intention to change their name seven day before submit an application to do so even if the government do not adopt amendment either here know that it will not be vote on or in the other place it be important for they to monitor the success of the change that be in the bill and in particular the number of sex offender who do and do not come forward to comply with the rule hope that the government will monitor development closely and will introduce new legislation if the loophole be not closed as they intend it to be child sexual abuse be wicked and despicable crime and the government be right to introduce these measure as well as the other about which member have speak so eloquently ask the government to follow up on the bill implementation and to monitor that extremely closely as this matter be important to many member of this house be grateful to member for set out the case for their amendment and will seek to respond to as many member as possible in the remain time available the shadow minister the hon member for stockton west matt vickers table amendment to which echo many of the amendment consider in committee do not propose to repeat the consider response that my ministerial colleague and provide at that stage but will deal with couple of the amendment to which the shadow minister refer today amendment deal with the possession of weapon with intent to use unlawful violence it seek to increase the maximum sentence for possession of bladed article or offensive weapon with the intention to use unlawful violence from four year to increase the maximum penalty for that offence in isolation without look at other possession offence would result in inconsistency in the law in this area we have set the maximum penalty for the possession with intent offence at four year imprisonment to be consistent with the maximum penalty for all other knife relate possession offence we will conduct review of the maximum penalty for knife relate offence and establish whether they be still appropriate the shadow minister say that the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have recommend that the sentence for the new offence of possession of weapon with intent to cause violence should be increase substantially in his recent report the independent reviewer recommend the creation of new offence for case where an individual prepare to kill more than two people he say if this offence be create then there be no need to reconsider the maximum sentence for the propose offence of possess an article with violent intent under the crime and policing bill as have say the government be consider create such an offence so increase the maximum sentence for the new offence of possess an article with violent intent be unnecessary we will debate the matter far tomorrow when we consider the shadow minister new clause the shadow minister also table and refer to amendment and which would make those responsible for fly tipping liable for the cost of clean up when local authority prosecute fly tipper on conviction cost order can already be make by the court so that landowner cost can be recover from the perpetrator while sentencing be matter for the court guidance on present court case produce by the national fly tipping prevention group which the department for the environment food and rural affairs chair explain that prosecutor should consider apply for compensation for the removal of waste and we will consider build on that advice in the statutory guidance issue under clause amendment concern point on drive licence as penalty for fly tipping again sentencing be matter for the court but will ask my counterpart at defra who be responsible for policy on fly tipping to consider the benefit of enable the endorsement of penalty point for fly tipper the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart speak to amendment on the use of live facial recognition in the policing of protest live facial recognition be valuable policing tool that help to keep people safe its use be already govern by the human rights act and data protection law do however recognise the need to assess whether bespoke legislation framework be need and we will set out our plan on this later in the year on facial recognition do the minister agree that my amendment would stop the police access everybody drive licence to use they for complete surveillance which be not the intention of the bill be grateful to my hon friend for raise that point probably will not have time to go into detail but the amendment be not require because what my hon friend describe be not what the bill be intend to do be very happy to speak to she outside the chamber about that but reassure she that that be not its intention on amendment the home office regularly engage with frontline delivery partner and practitioner to understand how the antisocial behaviour power be be use and their effectiveness in prevent and tackle asb that be why the bill include measure to strengthen the power available to police and local authority new requirement in the bill for local agency to provide information about asb to the government will far enhance our understanding of how the asb power be use to tackle antisocial behaviour on amendment want to make it clear that housing injunction and youth injunction be not novel they be already provide for in legislation in the form of the civil injunction which be be split into three separate order the respect order the youth injunction and the housing injunction the youth and housing injunction retain element of the exist civil injunction that be not cover by the new respect order namely element relate to offender under and housing relate nuisance asb also assure the house that any revision to the asb statutory guidance be extensively consult on with relevant stakeholder include frontline practitioner the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for hazel grove also speak to amendment table by the hon member for wells and mendip hills tessa munt which would apply the duty to report child sexual abuse to anyone work or volunteer in any capacity for religious belief or faith group know that she have have an opportunity to discuss that amendment in recent day with the minister who have responsibility for safeguard turn to the amendment table by my hon friend the member for north west cambridgeshire sam carling think it be very helpful and useful for the house to hear his experience and knowledge of the issue involve jehovah witness group and he bring to life what it mean when such report be make on amendment the government do not consider that it would be proportionate to provide for criminal sanction that may inadvertently create chilling effect on those who wish to volunteer with child or enter certain profession we be create specific offence of prevent or deter person from comply with the duty to report and anyone who seek deliberately to prevent someone from fulfil their mandatory duty to report child sexual abuse will face the full force of the law will the minister give way will continue because need to cover other amendment that have be table on amendment assess the sign and indication of abuse can be complex and subjective particularly for the very large number of non expert that this duty will apply to many of whom be engage with child infrequently or irregularly we have therefore choose to focus the duty on scenario in which reporter have be give an unambiguous reason to believe that they be in receipt of an allegation of child sexual abuse amendment seek to add reference to the legislative definition of position of trust in schedule however person occupy position of trust only in relation to specific sexual offence commit against specific child and the term value as definition for reporter of abuse be therefore limited the amendment also have the potential to create confusing duplication give the significant overlap between regulated activity with child and position of trust the list of activity in schedule have be draw up to set out activity involve position of trust that may not be adequately cover by the definition of regulated activity the government will of course keep this list under review and amend it if necessary my hon friend the member for bolton north east kirith entwistle speak to amendment which relate to the new broad offence of encourage or assist self harm in clause she make very passionate speech on this issue and know that she too have meet the minister to discuss it in recent day on sentencing the court must already consider the circumstance of each case include aggravate and mitigate factor and follow relevant guideline set by the independent sentencing council where defendant have previous conviction this be already recognise as statutory aggravate factor in sentencing on whether charge of murder should be bring in the circumstance set out in the amendment have to say to my hon friend that the amendment be wholly inconsistent with the criminal offence of murder which have different element that must be meet before person can be convict that say it be important to recognise that where the encouragement or assistance result in suicide the separate offence of encourage or assist suicide apply manslaughter may be charge if there be direct link between the abuse and the suicide the right hon member for hayes and harlington john mcdonnell speak to amendment which aim to delete clause the clause will allow the police to impose condition on protest near place of worship if the police have reasonable belief that the protest may deter individual from access the place of worship for religious activity even if that effect be not intend that give the police total clarity on how and when they can protect place of worship while respect the right to peaceful protest number of hon and right hon member speak about spike include my hon friend the members for hitchin alistair strathern and for darlington lola mcevoy the right hon member for dumfriesshire clydesdale and tweeddale david mundell and my hon friend the member for milton keynes central emily darlington as well as the hon member for isle of wight east joe robertson who table amendment before say anything else pay tribute to all those who have campaign on this issue for many year include family and campaign group richard graham former member of this house be pioneer of the case for bring forward spike amendment as discuss in committee the offence as draft already capture wide range of criminal behaviour which cover both spike and non spike incident for example it cover the victim be pepper spray as for the reference to specific intent to injure aggrieve or annoy that wording be of long standing and have be widely interpret by the court every case will be judge on the fact for instance if someone administer harmful substance as prank they would likely be find to have intend to annoy or aggrieve the broadness of the new offence and the increase in the maximum penalty as compare to the penalty for the exist offence under section of the offences against the person act be in the government view sufficient introduce recklessness as an alternative to intent risk over complicate the law and be unnecessary for secure appropriate conviction the hon member for isle of wight east spend lot of time look at this issue so want to address it the spike clause in the bill be model on the offence under the act which do not have recklessness test in the case of gantz an intention to loosen up the victim he refer to that intention in the example he give today be cover it may be helpful for he to reflect on that we also understand that as recently as last month person be convict of spike another person as joke we therefore deem that the inclusion of recklessness be unnecessary to ensure the appropriate conviction that we be look for with this new offence however we be very happy to continue to have conversation about this to ensure that we get the law absolutely right many other speech be make today that would like to comment on but be run swiftly out of time in my early comment refer to amendment to from the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry fully understand why amendment be table by the hon member for moray west nairn and strathspey graham leadbitter but those who cycle have duty to do so safely and in accordance with the highway code and they be wholly responsible and liable for their action in conclusion hope that in the light of the response have give to the amendment today members will not press they commend new clause to the house debate interrupt programme order this day the deputy speaker put forthwith the question already propose from the chair standing order no that the clause be read second time question agree to new clause accordingly read second time and add to the bill the deputy speaker then put forthwith the questions necessary for the disposal of the business to be conclude at that time standing order no new clause arrange or facilitate beg for gain person

sexual exploitation girl under the age of and woman who have suffer miscarriage or stillbirth or have give birth prematurely have face invasive and prolonged criminal investigation that cause long term harm can the hon lady advise we whether there be any other area of law govern the taking of life in which the guardrail of the criminal law have be remove that be what new clause propose when it come to the voiceless child be there no thought of protection for they the hon and learn member will know that the abortion act be not go to be amend new clause will only take woman out of the criminal justice system because they be vulnerable and they need our help have say it before and will say it again just what public interest be be serve in the case have describe this be not justice it be cruelty and it have to end back by cross party mps and organisation and building on year of work by dame diana johnson my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north and cottingham order remind the hon member that she should not have refer to the minister by name do apologise madam deputy speaker every day be school day my amendment new clause would disapply the criminal law relate to abortion for woman act in relation to their own pregnancy be narrow targeted measure that do not change how abortion service be provide nor the rule set by the abortion act the week limit remain abortion will still require the approval and signature of two doctor and woman will still have to meet the ground lay out in the act will the hon lady give way not at the moment but will later healthcare professional act outside the law and abusive partner use violence or poisoning to end pregnancy would still be criminalise as they be now there have be cacophony of misinformation regard new clause so let we be clear if it pass it would still be illegal for medical professional to provide abortion after week but woman would no long face prosecution nearly of abortion happen prior to week and those need later care often face extreme circumstance such as abuse trafficking or serious foetal anomaly the reality be that no woman wake up or more week pregnant and suddenly decide to end her own pregnancy outside hospital or clinic with no medical support but some woman in desperate circumstance make choice that many of we would struggle to understand new clause be about recognise that such woman need care and support not criminalisation as member will know much of the work that do be drive by the plight of highly vulnerable woman and by sex base right which be why table new clause have profound concern about new clause table by the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson which would remove the ability of woman to have consultation either on the phone or via electronic mean row back on the progress make in and again require woman to attend face to face appointment before access care introduce in telemedical abortion care represent revolution for woman and access to abortion care in this country we lead the world evidence gather in the uk help woman in some of the most restrictive jurisdiction include the united states to access abortion remotely here the large study on abortion care in the world find that telemedicine be safe and effective and reduce waiting time the fact be that half the woman access abortion in england and wales now use telemedical care give the increase in demand for care since the pandemic there simply be not the capacity in the nhs or clinic to force these woman to attend face to face consultation new clause would have devastating effect on abortion access in this country delay or deny care for woman with no clinical evidence to support it what concern most about the new clause however be the claim that make abortion hard to access will help woman in abusive relationship let quote from briefing provide by anti violence against woman and girl group include end violence against women rape crisis women aid solace women aid and karma nirvana which contact member before the vote in they say the argument that telemedicine facilitate reproductive coercion originate with anti abortion group not anti vawg group the priority for such group be restrict abortion access not address coercion and abuse force woman to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term do not solve domestic abuse could not agree more my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy who table new clause have terrible experience today she be unable to walk into parliament because of the abuse that she be receive outside and the picture that be be show that be unforgivable and want to extend the hand of friendship to she and make it clear that we be not in this place to take such abuse while my hon friend and share an interest in remove woman from the criminal law relate to abortion new clause be much broad in term of the scope of its propose change to the well establish legal framework that underpin the provision of abortion service while entirely agree with she that abortion law need wide reform the sector have emphasise its concern about new clause and the ramification that it pose for the ongoing provision of abortion service in england and wales the current settlement while complex ensure that abortion be accessible to the vast majority of woman and girl and think that those in the sector should be listen to as expert who function within it to provide more than abortion every year more comprehensive reform of abortion law be need but the right way to do that be through future bill with considerable collaboration between provider medical body and parliamentarian work together to secure the change that be need that be what change of this magnitude would require my friend the hon lady hope she do not mind if refer to she as friend be make clear point she have draw attention to great deal of confusion and misrepresentation in respect of what she be try to achieve in her new clause and she have share some heartrende example however she have just say something with which think the whole house would agree in recent year we have see our legislative approach to abortion effectively as place ornament on legislative christmas tree tack measure on to bills in very ad hoc way think she be actually right this be serious issue say this as husband and as father of three daughter that require serious consideration in public bill committee with evidence from all side and so on do she agree with that notwithstanding her laudable aim and heartfelt sincerity it would be much well if these complex issue be deal with in free stand bill rather than by amendment to crime and policing bill thank my friend the hon member for his intervention and hear he make that point in an early intervention on the minister the fact be that new clause would take woman out of the criminal justice system and that be what have to happen and have to change now there be no way that these woman should be face what they be face whether or not we agree on this issue and this be why have not support new clause long debate on this issue be need however all that this new clause seek to do be take woman out of the criminal justice system now and give they the support and help they need the hon lady and have be friend for all the time we have be here we have time last night to chat about these thing and we both know each other point of view may ask she to cast her mind back to telemedicine if she do not mind it be say that telemedicine be need to protect vulnerable woman who be unable to attend clinical setting but the risk be surely great woman may be coerce into abortion against their will with an abuser lurking in the background of phone call and pill can fall into the wrong hand as we all know do she accept that with all the protection she be put forward to safeguard woman the one thing that do not seem to be part of this process be the unborn baby and that concern greatly thank the hon member for that contribution and for the recognition that while our voice and opinion differ across the house we have respect for each other do not see this as discussion about the abortion act or raise any issue relate to it because this be the crime and policing bill and the new clause be only about ensure that vulnerable woman in those situation have the right help and support that be the whole purpose of it it be not about the issue that he would like to discuss now absolutely recognise that my hon friend be come from the right place on her amendment totally agree with she that reform be need and she have raise some very powerful case she describe this as very narrow change but in actual fact she be ask we to ensure not just that in such case the police should act differently but that in every case ever no woman can ever be prosecute it be hell of leap for we to take when this remain against the law for she to say that these woman whatever the circumstance must never be prosecute that be why do not think will be support the amendment despite recognise that she be right that such reform be need can she say anything to explain why there must never be any prosecution ever yes thank my hon friend for his intervention because the truth be that we have to flip this around no woman or anybody be deter this be not deterrent the criminal law do not work as deterrent these woman be desperate and they need help they may be coerce or it could be just stillbirth it could be but prosecution be not go to help the woman at any point agree with my hon friend that these woman need help but can not imagine more lonely and difficult experience than be woman who have an abortion under the circumstance she be outline and think that be problem with new clause would it not actually make abortion much more dangerous and much more lonely by simply decriminalise the woman but not those who may be there to give support can not think of any other time when someone might be more in need of support do not know of any woman who have have an abortion at any stage and take it lightly any abortion at any stage of your pregnancy be life change experience that be why do not take this lightly that be why whether it be six week week week or whatever and whether it be in term or out of term that experience of child loss whether it be plan or not stay with woman for the rest of her life do not take this easily stand up here with the abuse we have have outside this chamber this be serious issue and these be the woman who need the help they need that help and they need it now we can not continue in this way this very simple amendment to the crime and policing bill would take the woman out of that situation and that be what be seek to achieve if woman go all the way through to full term and then decide it be an inconvenience do the hon lady still think that she should be cover by this legal protection wow would like to know if the hon member actually know of any woman who would put themselves in that situation if there be not coercion or control of some kind obviously lot of research and conversation have be go on for year on this issue understand that people across the house have deeply hold religious view indeed be bring up catholic my issue from what have be tell be this how would that woman go about it if it be by take abortion pill she would have baby paint picture of kill an unborn child in that way do not help to serve what we be do in this place we need to protect the woman interruption need to make progress in the meantime doctor nurse midwife medical body abortion provider and parliamentarian have come together to try to end the criminal prosecution of woman on suspicion of illegal abortion offence this be specific and urgent problem and one that be simple to fix new clause be the only amendment that would protect woman currently at risk of prosecution and protect abortion service that be why it have the explicit backing of every abortion provider and every organisation that represent abortion provider in england and wales the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists the royal college of midwives the royal college of general practitioners the royal college of psychiatrists and the royal college of nursing also endorse it numerous violence against woman and girl group include the end violence against women and girls coalition refuge southall black sisters rape crisis england and wales imkaan and the centre for women justice be also behind new clause the public overwhelmingly support this change too implore colleague not to lose sight of the moral imperative here namely vulnerable woman be drag from hospital bed to police cell on suspicion of end their own pregnancy this be urgent we know that multiple woman be still in the system await decision accuse of break this law they can not afford to wait we have once in generation opportunity to put an end to this in simple and secure manner this be the right change at the right time so implore colleague who want to protect woman and abortion service to vote for new clause let we ensure that not single desperate woman be ever again subject to traumatic criminal investigation at the bad moment of their life there must be no more lauras there must be no more nicola packers rise to speak in support of new clause which stand in my name but first will speak briefly to new clause which we have be discuss so far the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi speak about some pretty harrowing case and say how the first lady be utterly traumatise by have have her abortion at home which she receive via telemedicine my new clause seek to make woman safe by ensure that they be see and give the opportunity for proper medical consultation before they get to the stage where they be give inappropriate medication because of misunderstanding and then end up traumatised deliver relatively mature foetus unexpectedly at home the hon lady do not say during her speech whether she believe that baby should be terminate right up to term but want to put on the record that do not work as an nhs consultant paediatrician and have care for and personally hold baby in my hand from week and six day gestation right through to term be very aware that baby from say week upwards have more than chance of survival so although be supportive of woman right to choose early in pregnancy be not supportive of similar right in relation to healthy baby right up to term until the pandemic woman have to attend abortion clinic where they would see professional and talk through their desire for an abortion and the reason for it at the clinic it would be check that the woman be pregnant and how far pregnant she be the hon lady raise case of woman who believe they be so far pregnant but who turn out to be much far pregnant which be well know sometimes it go the other way one of the key reason for this confusion be that woman often blee in early pregnancy and they may believe that those bleed episode represent period when woman think that she be week pregnant therefore she may actually be week pregnant that consideration be important in the context of access an abortion because at home abortion via telemedicine be allow only up until week the reason for that be not to be difficult or awkward or to make it more difficult for woman to access abortion instead it be safety issue because we know that complication be great later in pregnancy what happen in the early stage be that the procedure essentially cause the foetus to be bear if that happen to baby much later in pregnancy the procedure will cause it to be bear when it have chance of survival which can lead to traumatic experience for the mother as they deliver much large foetus than expect it can lead to bleed and in one case be aware of have lead to the death of mother who be give pill to take at home when she be much far along in her pregnant than she have expect if this be about safety then we also have to think about the safety of the baby in my constituency baby have live birth at week gestation tragically that baby go on to live for just four day struggle over that period and then die must we not consider the baby safety as much as the woman safety thank the hon lady for that intervention think we need to consider both remember case involve lady carla foster in june from my reading of the case she admit to lie about where she be in her gestation say that she be far back in pregnancy at seven week when she be actually much far along she turn out to be around week pregnant when her baby her little girl whom she call lily be bear in the paper have read about the case she describe be traumatise by the face of that baby which could have be prevent if she have be to proper clinic and see health professional as that health professional would have clearly see that she be not seven week pregnant and that take abortion pill intend for early pregnancy be not suitable or safe medical intervention if one have termination later in pregnancy it be do by foeticide essentially an injection of potassium chloride be administer to kill the baby and then the baby be bear in the usual way but deceased that be why it be important to know what the gestation be because the termination offer under the law be do by different route to make sure that it be do safely we know that the later in pregnancy termination happen the more woman be at risk of medical complication my hon friend be make an expert and well inform speech and shall be support her amendment on the point about the risk involve with abortion to birth what do she think about jurisdiction such as new zealand and the state of victoria in australia that have decriminalise abortion and see significant increase in fail late term abortion where baby be bear and there have be lot of physical harm and risk as result every jurisdiction have democratic right to do as it choose and respect that but it be tragedy when we hear of case where late term abortion have not be support by medical care or the law and woman and infant have suffer significant harm as result want to raise the case of stuart worby some people say that this issue be about protect vulnerable woman but in this case which be prosecute in december man who do not want his partner to be pregnant when she do want to be pregnant decide to take matter into his own hand he ask woman who be not pregnant to get the pill for he he put they in drink and give they to his partner induce miscarriage he have rightly be put in jail for that but the case demonstrate that there be man out there who will obtain tablet with the help of woman that could not have happen if woman have to have an in person appointment because the woman arrive at the clinic to get the abortion pill on the man behalf would be clearly see not to be pregnant so would not be able to obtain the medication my amendment seek to protect woman woman who be wrong about their gestation or who be mistake in think they have have bleed or whatever to make sure that they have safe termination use the right mechanism be delighted to tell my hon friend that too will be support her amendment there have be lot of talk in this place in recent week about coercion in different bill and in different context the kind of coercion that she describe be reality it be all fine and well to have fanciful middle class view of the world but as say in respect of different bill there be many wicked people do many wicked thing the kind of coercion that she describe be the truth it be the reality agree with my right hon friend and shall come to coercion little later first let go back to new clause which decriminalise the woman have an abortion in relation to her own pregnancy it seem to that what many wish to do be decriminalise abortion up until term that be legitimate position that some people take urge the hon lady to rethink what she be say there be nothing in new clause that refer to abortion up until term there would be no change to the abortion law absolutely no change at all we be not say abort to term and it be extremely harmful for she to say that thank the hon lady for her intervention currently it be illegal for woman to procure her own abortion between week and term if the baby be healthy if there be problem she have to have it do by doctor in hospital under the propose new rule we will have be situation where woman can legally have an abortion up until term if she want to do so interruption yes at any gestation that be completely legitimate argument it be not one that support or agree with but it be legitimate argument that people can make if that be the case they should have the courage of their conviction and make it if criminal law do not work as deterrent why do late term abortion increase in the state of victoria and in new zealand after decriminalisation if we look at new zealand in there be increase in late term abortion between week gestation and birth compare with therefore criminal law do act as deterrent and when it be remove we see an increase we need to learn from different jurisdiction in that regard the hon lady be right to say that we have see an increase in incidence of people take abortion pill late previously it be very difficult if not impossible to obtain the pill it be certainly impossible to obtain they through nhs clinic but now it be possible because people can use telemedicine clinic they say that they be seven week pregnant and ask for pill and we have see example where people have ask for the pill much far on in their pregnancy into the week obtain the medicine and make themselves very unwell in do so turn to coercion when doctor see patient they take at face value everything the patient tell they when lady use telemedicine to have an abortion it be not possible for doctor or clinician to know whether somebody else be in the room with they or sit the other side of the camera force they to say what they be say it be not possible for the doctor to know whether the lady be pregnant or not or whether the person ask for the medicine will be the person who take it that be very unsafe take the hon lady point although the same would apply if someone be face to face with doctor for example could get abortion pill and then give they to someone else after my appointment represent semi rural constituency where we struggle with lack of bus route and medical facility understand her concern about coercion but there will be lot of woman in my constituency who be victim of domestic violence and coercion for whom it will be significantly hard to access telemedicine be her amendment to be pass point be make about middle class people but it would be poor people who struggle to access the service as result of her amendment the hon lady be correct that if woman get the tablet at clinic she could give they to somebody else but in order to get they in the first place she would need to be week pregnant and the clinician would check that she be pregnant when the medication appear not to have work question would perhaps be ask about where the tablet have go so think there be an inherent safety feature there the hon lady bring up the issue of bus route that be important but the question be whether we should improve the bus route or make medical service less safe most clinical service be access by individual attend hospital or clinic and in some respect this instance be no different because it be important that proper medical check be do be not try to limit people access to what be clinically legally available be try to make sure that people be safe when they do so want to turn to woman who have be traffic or be be force into sex work we talk yesterday in the house about young girl who have be groom and rap in the grooming gang scandal would we put it past those evil nasty man to have get drug and give they to these young girl to hide the evidence of their crime would not what about those who want to preserve the honour of their family by prevent their daughter from be pregnant what about those who think that the baby be carry by their partner be of the wrong gender they would like boy but be have girl what about those who be try to cover up sexual abuse particularly of teenager and young girl by cause termination to hide the evidence of their crime what if partner do not want baby stuart worby get catch be prosecute and be rightly in jail but how many other have do that and not get catch we simply will never know no one know who be take these medication if we have proper clinic gestation can be check clinician can ascertain more effectively if woman be be coerce and they can make the abortion medically as safe as possible my amendment be not pro life or pro choice it be pro safety think we all agree that there be concern about vulnerable people and abortion law in this country but we disagree about how to address they propose new clause as way to address those concern and recognise that the issue of abortion access be increasingly under attack not just in our country but around the world if we think that we face these challenge because we have outdate law in this country why would we retain they in any shape or form rather than learn from good practice around the world for all our constituent to start let put on the record that take seriously all the concern raise across the house about abortion recognise that this be complex issue hear strongly the story about investigation and prosecution and want to see change but also recognise that change do not come without consequence new clause therefore be base on what be good abortion law what many of we have work on it be base on what the sector itself use to say matter which be that abortion law in england and wales should recognise development in modern abortion law in northern ireland deliver on the promise we make in this place in that abortion be human right that safe care be human right for woman and that we should see progression of minimum human right standard on abortion include through the proposal of the committee on the elimination of discrimination against women want to start with how the new clause would do that want to be clear that only this new clause would provide for decriminalisation decriminalisation as define by marie stopes mean remove abortion from the criminal law so that it be no long govern by both the offences against the person act and the infant life preservation act because that would protect both clinician and those who be at threat of criminal prosecution decriminalisation would not impact the regulation on safe medical use medical conduct safeguard recognise that be serious concern or the distribution of medicine and neither would it stop tackle those people who seek to use abortion as form of abuse or coercion want to explain how in decriminalising and remove the law that have cause those problem the new clause would keep the act not as list of reason why someone would be exempt from prosecution but as guide to how abortion should be provide many of we in the house would recognise the shock for our constituent that abortion be illegal in theory and that the guideline in the act be the settle will of this place to resolve any regulatory challenge the new clause would require the secretary of state to comply only with section and of cedaw the convention on the elimination of all form of discrimination against woman those section be about minimum not maximum standard of care and that be only if the secretary of state believe there appear to be an incongruence that need to be address be try to reconcile the two thing that the hon lady have say she talk about the significance of the act when lord steel david steel as he be then speak on its second reading he say that it be not his aim to leave wide open door for abortion on report july vol yet she have say that it be human right and so people should have the right to an abortion how do she reconcile her advocacy of what she describe as the settle will of the act not have abortion on request with the right to have an abortion on request hope that the right hon member have read the human right requirement because they be about the treatment and dignity of the woman in question and the safety of the service provide do not believe that lord steel would want woman to be put at risk indeed think that be why he fight for that original legislation we have support these human right treaty in this place for other reason the new clause as in the provision in northern ireland would use the human right requirement as guide template or test as to whether the safety and wellbeing of woman be at the heart of what many of we believe be healthcare rather than criminal matter the new clause set out additional test for how we would interpret those human right provision it bring in the international covenant on economic social and cultural right to constitute the right of woman to sexual and reproductive health and gender equality fundamentally those human right be about equal treatment of each other body at the moment the lack of human right create an inequality for woman in my constituency and his an inequality that woman in northern ireland do not face we should shape service around their wellbeing it be an established principle some have argue that we should not make this change through amendment to legislation this issue have always rightly be non governmental and there be people who disagree with the right to abortion and people who support it in every single party that mean that proposal for reform of abortion will always come from back benchers or from somebody who have win the golden buzzer of private member bill which happen very rarely for those who have call for consultation the good news be that it be exactly what we get by vote for abortion to be human right in northern ireland if hon member concern about this amendment be the lack of consultation they should know that voting for it will trigger consultation on how to apply the human right test to abortion provision in england and wales so that we can test whether our service meet the objective that we set for woman in northern ireland there be difference of principle on the question of human right because there be two life involve in these decision that be the fundamental problem respect the right hon gentleman belief and will always defend his right to it tell he this however the human right of the woman carry the baby be intricately related to the ability of the baby to survive if we do not look after woman and protect their wellbeing there will be no baby the human right test allow we to ask whether it matter to we that we treat woman equally when it come to the regulation of this healthcare procedure practically it also mean that there be somebody to champion those regulation in northern ireland the human right commissioner have take the government to court when access to the procedure have be deny she have establish buffer zone and safe access to abortion clinic as human right indeed she be now look at telemedicine as human right and at how to provide it for woman in safe way will the hon lady give way will one more time and then want to make some progress the hon lady refer to northern ireland it be courtesy of her intervention back in that we have foist upon northern ireland the most extreme abortion law of any place in this united kingdom law that totally disregard the right of the unborn and treat they as commodity to be dispose of at will and at whim in consequence we have see huge unregulated increase in the destruction of human life through the destruction of the unborn in northern ireland do not think that that be an example that anyone should want to follow in any part of this united kingdom respect the fact that the hon and learn gentleman do not agree with abortion but as have say throughout my life when campaign on this issue stop access to abortion do not stop abortion it stop safe abortion we be talk about how to provide abortion safely he disagree with abortion and will always defend his right to do so but will also point out the thousand woman who have now have abortion in northern ireland safely which mean that their life be protect surely if somebody be pro life they be pro woman life as well new clause be on that fundamental question will the hon lady give way be sorry but can not will tell he afterwards why can not but promise that it be not out of lack of respect for his position some say that northern ireland be different but why would we think that woman in northern ireland be different from woman in england and wales when it come to human right we be seek not to remove our regulation but to apply the same test to they we simply want the secretary of state to ask whether they be human right compliant those who celebrate bring abortion to northern ireland and who continue to promote it do not just celebrate the provision of service they celebrate the liberation of woman from this inequality which we risk perpetuate for our constituent will the hon lady give way be sorry but can not take any intervention new clause be primarily about whether we think that abortion be human right and how we apply that principle to our law here it be also about the very present and real threat to access in our community member will have see outside this place the modern anti abortion movement that we now have in the uk and will have receive the scaremongere email of course those in that movement be react more strongly than ever to the idea of woman have this human right protect in law because their opposition be not about child if it be they would not shout at mine when they see they in the street it be about control woman they do not openly advocate for an end to abortion access but they make lurid claim include the claim that there would be abortion at birth so let put that one to bed because new clause retain the framework it retain not just the time limit crucially it be different from new clause in that regard but all the provision in the act relate to everyone involve in an abortion we know that the majority of abortion happen at less than week in this country but we should protect the time limit we should also protect the medic involve because the person who get fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis after week be the person we should protect most of all if we reduce that time limit and if we start to target medic it could happen in this country as in america those people who be ask to carry to term baby who they know will die will not get our protection yes we must stop the investigation and prosecution under outdated law that make no sense but we must also protect people at that most heartbreaking moment when they be tell that baby that they really want will not live that be what keep the act do will the hon lady give way be sorry can not take intervention because of time those who worry that new clause remove outdated law should look at the limited number of prosecution that have take place under exist law and compare it to the number of investigation that have take place let we deal with the claim that be be put about first there be claim that repeal would mean that there would no long be the crime that msi have call reproductive coercion that be what it call the offence of coercion in the serious crime act which it hail that offence would remain and it explicitly cover force someone to have an abortion give the same penalty as section of the offences against the person act those who claim that coerce someone to have an abortion would be legal under new clause have not pay attention to that legislation or to the call from the abortion provider to ensure that more healthcare provider and it seem more government lawyer be aware of that law and of reproductive coercion those who claim that the loss of the concealment of the body law in section of the offences against the person act would facilitate live abortion should look at the exist law on grievous bodily harm and actual bodily harm which be use in such case because of the difficulty of prove an offence under section and indeed because of the requirement of the infant life preservation act have give birth to baby at week want to be very clear why time limit and medical decision matter when it come to abortion not just to the application of substance misuse law let we be very clear that there would be criminal offence to cover the case that the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson describe but we be also talk about remove law that have criminalise people who have have stillbirth these be people who need our compassion and who need we to be able to differentiate between an outdated law that criminalise abortion and the malicious intent in the substance misuse legislation people should recognise how seldom these offence can be prove because they make no sense also in retain the act we retain the good faith principle for all party to an abortion that would deal with the trope of sex selection nobody can prove that abortion for sex selection reason have happen but that be cover in the good faith arrangement that be retain with the legislation return to the subject of northern ireland because it be not the absence of regulation that make difference it be parliament vote to make abortion human right and then the government work with we to make it happen vote for new clause would kick start similar process we know that government lawyer never really like to deal with change who this be the proper and appropriate way to proceed and in our parliament this be the only way for back benchers to make change on matter of conscience those of we who recognise that reproductive right be the foundation of social justice know that now be the time to act if we be not free to control what happen to our body we can not be free in the rest of our life those who be play politic with abortion play politic with equality the vice president of the us have attack our buffer zone we should not tolerate his interference in any matter of human right only new clause would give buffer zone that human right footing we would not ask woman to carry to term baby that would die at birth but again there be people in this place who call our abortion law ludicrous and who advocate for reduction in the time limit put woman health second that would not happen with human right framework those of we who care about these right need to act tonight less than half of all man under in this country believe that abortion should be legal in most case so those who feel that abortion be settled matter that can not be weaponise in our politic need to listen to the drumbeat already bang loudly in this country we face choice today we know that these law be outdated do we retain but limit they or do we remove they and get ahead of what be to come urge colleague who care about these matter to listen to our american counterpart who bitterly regret not have act under biden and obama to protect abortion access and who now find medic be prosecute and drag across state line do we learn from how parliament have act before procedurally member know that if new clause be pass new clause can not go to vote so they will not have the chance to say whether they believe that safe and legal abortion be fundamental human right want to be clear that will support new clause but with great hesitation that be not because dismiss those propose it hope we can all agree that there be genuine and decent term for disagreement it be because new clause bring in lock on ministerial power it explicitly restrict what ministers and the government not parliament can do on this subject in delegate legislation committee it have be surprising to learn in these debate how few people have have the joyous experience of sit in delegate legislation committee stack by the whips with government mp that make major change to the law but in year that have happen to number of time we have see it on tuition fee rate and welfare cut and the previous government try to do it with the retained eu law revocation and reform act only new clause would stop ministers use regulatory power to overturn abortion right they could use they only to bring in human right compliant regulation conversely if new clause be pass there be no constraint on how ministers could use the power the minister might say that the new clause bring in no requirement to make regulation that be true new clause do not require regulation but it can and will facilitate it as the hansard society point out ministers sometimes seek power in bill to enable they to take action that they consider appropriate that leave ministers with huge power new clause would bring abortion within the province of this legislation and give the secretary of state enable power to make law relate to abortion as long as they would not reverse the disapplication of abortion law to person act in relation to their own pregnancy the power could be use to target medic or the family of person seek an abortion therefore ask the minister to explicitly give commitment that if new clause be pass there will be no further regulation on abortion under the bill and no application to make new clause workable or to clarify the impact of prosecution on the anti abortion law that remain if the minister can not do that by definition she prove that that power will exist by contrast new clause would restrict that it would give power back to this place nobody can bind future parliament but we can demand that it be not small committees of hand pick select mp make decision on the government behalf and that each of we should be able to act on behalf of our constituent criminalisation do not reduce or deter abortion it just make it hard to carry out safely we should be clear that criminalisation will remain if only new clause be pass if we want the decriminalisation that the sector have always advocate for for good reason it be only through new clause that we can achieve that hope that colleague in the lords will have hear this debate and will not let these matter rest regret have no place in politic it certainly have no place in the politic that come here to represent when there be those who would seek to attack woman in this way pledge to continue fight for woman right pledge to continue fight to make abortion human right in this country and ask colleague to consider the case for do so in this way but ask people who care about this to think about this moment and whether we will ever have another one when this parliament could act in such positive constructive and establish way we can get one thing over the line why not make it the thing that would make the big difference to our constituent rise order be impose an immediate four minute time limit member will see that many colleague wish to get in this evening rise to speak for new clause and against new clause and be grateful for this opportunity to place on the record my grave concern about this hurried attempt to significantly alter our nation abortion law it be my view that by do so we risk create series of unintended consequence that could endanger woman rather than protect and empower they we need more time this be not pro choice versus pro life debate we already have the most inclusive abortion law in europe medical abortion be available up to week which be double the european average and we have the option of full term abortion on medical ground instead today debate be about ensure that legislation as significant as this seek to introduce wholesale change to abortion law affect england scotland and wales be not rush through without the chance for significant scrutiny indeed minute of back bench debate do not cut it in my opinion we should of course treat woman seek an abortion with compassion and dignity that go without say as councillor on plymouth city council chair the commission on violence against woman and girl defend the voiceless be my guide principle in politic and it be with those woman and unborn baby in mind that make this speech as over medical professional say in an open letter cite in the telegraph today if offence that make it illegal for woman to administer her own abortion at any gestation be repeal such abortion would de facto become possible up to birth for any reason include abortion for sex selective purpose as woman could mistakenly knowingly or under coercion mislead abortion provider about their gestational age if either of these amendment be to become law it would also likely lead to serious risk to woman health because of the danger involve with self administer late abortion they continue quite aside from the increase number of viable baby live be end beyond the week time limit there would likely be significant increase in such complication if new clause or be to pass as they would remove any legal deterrent against woman administer their own abortion late in pregnancy the current law permit flexibility and compassion where necessary but for these reason we believe legal deterrent remain important many supporter of new clause and claim that the week time limit for abortion would not change but that be misleading any time limit be meaningless if abortion be legalise all the way up to birth for any reason without legal deterrent my concern be that once decriminalisation have take place further step will be take to expand abortion time limit indeed many of the campaigner mention this afternoon be on record saying as much it be important that we be realistic about that we be not here to amend the abortion act this be not backbench business debate we be here to debate an amendment to the crime and policing bill hope that the hon lady stand correct do not think it be case of be correct have significant concern that should the new clause be pass those be the next step it be bit of slippery slope we may just have to disagree on that public opinion and professional advice be clear polling undertake by comres reveal that only of the public support the introduction of abortion up to birth of woman would like to see reduction in the time limit from week to week or less still well above that of many of our european neighbour and of the population oppose the sex selective abortion that new clause and would allow will the hon lady give way no will make some progress those who champion new clause claim that it be need to stop arrest long investigation and the prosecution of woman but it be important to highlight that prosecution under section and of the offences against the person act almost always relate to male induce or coerce woman into abortion by decriminalise woman we would by implication also stop the opportunity to prosecute abusive or coercive male to be prosecute for aid and abet abortion there need to have be case to answer in the first place instead stand here to suggest well route forward new clause table by my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson she have rehearse the argument for that new clause excellently but will add that freedom of information request have reveal that one in woman who take pill by post require hospital treatment equivalent to more than woman between april and september further investigation find that the number of ambulance service call out relate to abortion increase in london they also increase in the south west where my constituency be from in to in increase that correlate directly with the removal of the need for doctor appointment at home abortion be make permanent by just vote in march polling in june find that two third of woman support return to in person appointment call on the house to support new clause rise to speak in support of new clause table by my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi which would remove woman from the criminal law on abortion before my election last year serve as the director of the women equality network wales and this issue have long be close to my heart until very recently violent man end their partner pregnancy make up the bulk of prosecution under this law but recently we have see big rise in woman be target many erroneously this be not law that exist in northern ireland scotland france canada australia new zealand or even member may be surprised to know the most anti abortion state of america but it be increasingly use against woman in this country want to take some time today to speak about one of these woman will call her becca which stress be not her real name know about what happen to becca because her mum and dad be horrify at what happen and they want we to hear about the injustice this law cause and to think of becca when we cast our vote later becca be year old when she give birth to her baby in hospital she have access legal abortion care through licensed clinic think she be in the first week of pregnancy she have suffer very rare complication and her pregnancy be later on than she and her doctor expect her parent report that she have gain no weight have have regular period and have be work night shift for the nhs only hour before will the hon lady give way due to time will not apologise when becca give birth her baby be small and premature she say the first hospital she stay in be amazing provide support for she her partner and their baby the second however make the decision against professional guidance and rule on patient confidentiality to report she and her partner to the police on suspicion of attempt abortion one month after her child be bear becca return home to register the birth the police swoop both she and her partner be arrest she from her parent house and he from their baby cot side they be hold in police cell and interview under caution without understand what be happen or why when they be bail social service visit their house and tell they they be not allow to care for their baby without supervision mean that becca could not breastfeed or hold her baby until her parent be approve as supervisor during that visit the social worker make difficult situation even worse tell the family their baby be deaf and blind as result of the alleged abortion attempt the baby be not this casual cruelty by social worker cause immense distress fortunately becca her partner and her baby be now do well social service agree that they be good parent and be no long monitor they imagine that many member across the chamber today have never think this kind of cruelty exist under abortion law in this country know that have never consider it the truth be that the current legal framework harm woman and girl when they be at their most desperate and the only people who can stop it be we here in parliament today while change the law by vote through new clause today can not erase what happen to becca and her family it can stop it happen to any more woman urge member to keep woman like becca in the forefront of their mind when they vote think of becca and vote for new clause my concern about these amendment be such that and other commission lead king counsel to draft legal opinion regard their effect let inform member of his conclusion begin with new clause the kc confirm that under new clause in practice it would no long be illegal for woman to carry out her own abortion at home for any reason at any gestation up to birth note that the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi acknowledge in her explanatory statement to new clause that her amendment apply at any be up to full term let we be clear what this mean under new clause woman would be able to perform their own abortion for example with abortion pill which can now be obtain without an in person gestational age check up to birth with no legal deterrent due to medical advancement we can save the life of foetus at week yet we can legally terminate foetus at week shall be vote against all the amendment relate to the decriminalisation of abortion do the right hon gentleman agree that we should actually be reduce the window in which it be possible to have an abortion so that the law reflect the reality of modern medicine agree let move to new clause be deal with very narrow legal point and it might be of interest to the house that the kc conclude that the new clause would render the week time limit obsolete in respect of the prosecution of woman who undertake termination of pregnancy in typical circumstance he explain that the amendment would repeal the abortion law offence include those relate to late abortion in other word new clause would fully repeal all exist law that prohibit abortion in any circumstance at any gestation both in relation to woman undergo an abortion and abortion provider or clinician perform abortion in the second iteration of her new clause the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy have add measure that seek to amend the abortion act to create the impression that time limit would remain however the abortion act only provide exemption against prosecution under the law that new clause would repeal so those offence would no long remain under new clause since the abortion act itself contain no penalty or offence and neither would the propose new clause introduce any add mere mention of an ongoing time limit in the act would be toothless and utterly meaningless under the law new clause would de facto have the effect of fully decriminalise abortion up to full term for both woman and abortion provider hon member do not need to take my word for it it be not often that they will hear agree with the british pregnancy advisory service the uk lead abortion provider but its assessment of new clause conclude that it would largely render the abortion act obsolete and create regulatory lacuna around abortion provision and access there be one additional angle that member need to be aware of on new clause the legal opinion find that the effect of the amendment be that woman who terminate her pregnancy solely on the basis that she believe the child to be female would face no criminal sanction in connection with that reason or at all similarly on new clause the opinion confirm that it would not be illegal for woman to carry out her own abortion at home solely on the basis that the foetus be female these amendment be not pro woman they would introduce sex selective abortion sex selective abortion be already happen in this country back in telegraph investigation find that doctor at uk clinic be agree to terminate foetus because they be either male or female bbc investigation in find that non invasive prenatal test be be widely use to determine baby sex early in pregnancy lead to pressure impose on some woman to have sex selective abortion that evidence lead the labour party to urge ban on such test be use to determine the sex of baby in the womb report by the nuffield council on bioethics similarly find that several website be privately offer test to determine the sex of baby and the council warn that the increase prevalence of private testing may be encourage sex selective abortion pass new clause or new clause would likely make the situation bad in conclusion what we be face with be an extreme set of amendment go way beyond what public dominion demand and way beyond what be happen in any other country in the world rise in support of new clause and new clause be someone who choose the spend the majority of my time in this place focus on woman who make up of the population on mother parent woman health and maternity and would like specifically to address comment that have be make in the chamber today which pit the life of foetus against that of mother despite the fact that of mp be now woman and that every single one of we represent constituency that will be woman rarely hear woman issue be discuss here on every issue in this house there be an angle that affect woman differently and that especially affect those care for child differently yet we do not speak about it when people speak against abortion in any form be stupefy by the bubble from within which they speak will they also speak out about the risk of give birth when two third of maternity ward be deem unsafe by the care quality commission doubt it will they speak out about the fact that more than million woman be keep out of the labour market because of their caring responsibility which be seven time those of man doubt it will they speak out about child in temporary accommodation the extortionate cost of childcare medical negligence and the decimation of sure start doubt it until hon member have do their time make this world one thousand time well for mother and parent as it need to be suggest that they reflect on the audacity of make judgment in isolation today that cry life every decision we make in this place come relative to its context woman who end up in the truly agonising position of have an abortion be protect life she be protect her own life hers be the life that hon member choose to vote against if they vote against these amendment hers be the life hon member would be choose to discard as other have say in reality the amendment before we today will affect very few people but will critically mean that while woman be the carrier of child she will not be criminalise for anything to do with or within her body give how little the world tend to care about woman and their body personally trust those individual woman far more than trust any state or judicial system that have yet to prove it can properly support the right of woman that be why will be vote for this and any amendment that far the right of woman over their own body believe that both live matter in every pregnancy both the mum life and the child life abortion be often frame as choice between the right of the mother and of the child reject that frame but today we be consider two amendment new clause and new clause that would be bad for both woman and unborn child and one amendment new clause that would protect both woman and unborn baby who be old enough to survive outside the womb in the last parliament along with number of colleague warn that the pill by post scheme for at home abortion would cause an increase in medical complication dangerous late abortion and coerce abortion sadly those warning have become reality study base on freedom of information request to nhs trust find that more than woman who take at least one abortion pill at home provide by the nhs in need hospital treatment for complication that be the equivalent of more than one in woman or per day last december stuart worby be jail after use abortion pill obtain by third party through the pill by post scheme to induce an abortion in pregnant woman against her knowledge or will such case could have be prevent if abortion provider have not push in the face of warning about precisely such incident for the removal of in person appointment where woman identity and gestational age could be accurately verify and any health risk assess the issue of inaccurate gestational age have lead indirectly to the amendment before we today abortion provider have themselves concede and quote jonathan lord former medical director for marie stopes that until recently only three woman have ever be on trial over the past year for illegal abortion since then there have be an increase in investigation and prosecution albeit small number compare to the quarter of million abortion we now have every year in the united kingdom this small rise in prosecution have be cause by the pill by post scheme which have enable woman either because they miscalculate their own gestational age or through dishonesty to obtain abortion pill beyond the week limit when at home abortion be legal and consider safe for woman and even beyond our week time limit for abortion tragically this have lead to viable baby live be end what be the answer suggest it can not be to make thing bad by decriminalise abortion that would be bad for woman and unborn life remove the legal deterrent against dangerous late term unsupervised abortion that would put woman at risk as well as baby even long after they be viable in the womb this would render our already very late time limit redundant in context where pill can be obtain without any reliable in person gestational age check the alternative solution be to end the pill by post scheme and reinstate in person consultation that be why support new clause and the public support it too new polling have find that just of woman support the current pill by post arrangement and two third want return to in person appointment decriminalisation may allow the problem with the pill by post scheme to be cover up but it will not stop the problem happen in fact it will incentivise more dangerous late term abortion of viable baby let close by turn to northern ireland when the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy hijack the northern ireland executive formation etc act to impose abortion on northern ireland she argue that woman in northern ireland face discrimination because they do not have access to the same abortion provision as woman in great britain let very clear northern ireland be very different northern ireland do not have the pill by post scheme so direct correlation with gb can not be make ask hon member to support new clause it be worth be absolutely clear about what new clause would and would not do it would simply remove the threat of prosecution for woman who end their own pregnancy it would not change the abortion time limit which remain the rule around telemedicine remain the requirement for two doctor to sign off remain in recent year there have be what consider to be worrying rise in the number of people be investigate prosecute and even imprison under the law these prosecution be deeply distressing and in most case entirely disproportionate it be far more common for woman to miscarry or to miscalculate the stage of her pregnancy than to wilfully break the law to fully address the question from my hon friend the member for chesterfield mr perkins do not think it be right in the context of what be actually happen in investigation and prosecution that any woman should be prosecute the harm cause by the number of investigation and prosecution where it be absolutely not justified outweigh that constituent come to see yesterday and explain that when she be she be coerce into forced marriage by her family she have not be allow to have any sex education so when she become pregnant she do not even realise it be only when her mum notice that she manage to access legal abortion but she tell that she could have be in situation in which she would have have to get out of that marriage in order to have late abortion do my hon friend think it would be in the public interest to go after woman such as my constituent who be in force marriage be that helpful absolutely think it be not helpful to go against those woman new clause would retain the criminal prosecution of man who force woman to have an abortion or indeed anyone who coerce woman into have an abortion one in eight know pregnancy end in miscarriage yet we have see woman subject to invasive investigation delay medical care and lengthy legal process because they have have an abortion or stillbirth many colleague have already speak about the intense distress that legal proceeding inflict whatever the circumstance in the case of nicola packer it take four year to clear her name during that time the scrutiny she face be entirely dehumanising with completely irrelevant matter treat as evidence of wrongdoing for every woman who end up in court many more endure police investigation often include phone seizure home search and even in some case have child remove from their care all that not only be distressing and disproportionate for those woman but make abortion less safe if woman be scared of be criminalise they will not be honest with their midwife gps or partner abortion be healthcare and healthcare rely on honest conversation between care provider and patient will rebut bit of the misinformation that say that new clause would allow abusive partner or other to avoid prosecution that be simply not true apply only to the woman who end her own pregnancy healthcare professional who act outside the law and partner and other family member who use violence or coercion would still be criminalise just as they be now and quite rightly so the amount of misinformation about abortion be distress have see it within and without this chamber what be the fact some of abortion happen before nine week as woman who have lose two very much want pregnancy at about that stage be very aware of what that actually mean physically and of what stage the foetus be at then abortion after week make up just of all case and those be due to serious medical reason woman be not end their pregnancy because of convenience would not change what be happen with abortion care but it would protect woman from be drag through these brutal investigation which be completely inappropriate in the majority of case anyway woman be extremely unlikely to try to provoke their own abortion outside the time limit criminal sanction for that or distressing and intrusive investigation be entirely disproportionate it be not in the public interest to subject these woman to these investigation will finish with this woman who have abortion woman who have miscarriage and woman who have child be not distinct set of woman many of we will experience at least two of those thing if not all three let we stop make false distinction and try to pit group of woman against each other and let we stop brutally criminalise woman many of they very vulnerable woman in the way that the current law do because it serve no purpose today we can end that rise to speak against new clause and and in support of new clause table by my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson first it be important for to say that fully support woman reproductive right think that we generally get the balance right here in the uk and protect that be hill would die on however be disturb by new clause and which would decriminalise abortion up to birth if they become law fully develop baby up to term could be abort by woman with no consequence the reason we criminalise late term abortion be not about punishment it be about protection by provide deterrent to such action we protect woman we protect they from try to perform an abortion at home that be unsafe for they and from coercive partner and family member who may push they to end late term pregnancy have great respect for the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi who have table new clause we share many of the same objective on other topic but in this case think she be try to solve very real issue the increase number of prosecution with the wrong solution these amendment be drive by the case of carla foster among other carla foster be mum who be prosecute under uk law for carry out an illegal abortion in may during the covid pandemic she carry out the abortion at to week of pregnancy after receive the relevant drug through the pill by post scheme introduce during lockdown this be terrible case that harshly demonstrate the flaw with the current process but the issue here be not the criminalisation of abortion after week it be the fact that carla foster be give the pill without check how far along she be in the first place she be fail by people here in parliament who vote to allow those pill to be send out by mail during lockdown without an in person consultation that be an irresponsible decision and one that might have be forgive in the light of global pandemic if it have remain temporary however in march the scheme be make permanent if we want to protect woman from knowingly or unknowingly acquire abortion pill after week of pregnancy and induce an abortion at home we must put an end to the situation in which those pill can be acquire without face to face consultation at which gestational age verification by medical professional can take place these drug be dangerous if not use in the right way as we see when stuart worby spike pregnant woman drink with they result in the miscarriage of her week old baby make no mistake the pill by post scheme enable that evil man and his female accomplice to commit that crime it be also important to note that prior to the pill by post scheme only three woman have be convict for an illegal abortion over the past year demonstrate the effectiveness of the safeguard however since that scheme be introduce accord to jonathan lord who be medical director of marie stopes at the time four woman have appear in court on similar charge within an eight month period criminalisation of abortion after week be not the problem the pill by post scheme be if new clause pass while the pill by post scheme remain in place here be what will happen more woman will attempt late term abortion at home use abortion pill acquire over the phone and some of those woman will be harm many of they will not have realise that they be actually go to deliver something that look like baby not just some blood clot that be go to cause huge trauma for they many of those woman genuinely will not have realise how far along they be due to implantation bleeding be mistaken for their last period and on top of all of this some of the baby will be alive on delivery we in this place need to get away from this terrible habit of only consider issue through middle class lens what about woman who be be sexually exploit and traffic what about teenage girl who do not want their parent to find out that they be pregnant order call david smith rise to oppose new clause and and to support new clause all the new clause concern the issue of abortion through the process of decriminalisation new clause and will introduce the possibility of de facto abortion up to birth for any reason in this country for the first time in history let be clear this mean that it will no long be illegal for woman to abort full term healthy baby that would be profound change in the settle position on abortion in this country for the past year an extreme move that polling have show that the vast majority of the country do not want indeed recent polling show that only of the public support the idea of abortion up to birth new clause would diminish the risk of woman be criminalise for abortion beyond the current legal limit through the reinstitution of in person appointment that be popular recent polling show that two third of woman back return to in person appointment for abortion do not want to be stand here talk about abortion it be not something that come into parliament to do be also very conscious that as man should be very careful about comment on the experience of woman however feel that new clause and give no choice but to speak against they despite my huge respect for the mover of new clause in particular what be we try to achieve here if the aim be to decriminalise woman in difficult situation have huge sympathy for that for eight year be the chief executive of homelessness charity that house and support woman in desperate situation many of whom be traumatise dependent on substance with fluctuate mental ill health condition and extensive experience of the criminal justice system common theme among they be that they have be abuse and harm from very early age consistently into their adulthood the woman we serve and support still have agency they still have free will if their circumstance be desperate at time they nevertheless often confound those circumstance to rise above they however they also make decision that they regret they make decision at time that those around they and even they themselves later be appal by recall few year ago support woman in hostel who be traumatise by her own decision to abort child do my hon friend agree in the context of this language about protect people that we also need to protect people from these decision when they be not make with the proper safeguard and protection in place do agree if something be absolute in term of the new clause as understand they it must cover all eventuality and what we be try to say be that we simply do not believe that it can have hear it say that no woman would induce an abortion after week but we can not introduce such profound change in abortion law on the basis of simple hope that no woman would take such drastic step if we remove the possibility of criminal prosecution for abortion post week gestation it be certainty that some woman will take that drastic step if there be no sanction and no wide consequence will my hon friend give way be afraid be go to make some progress in accord to government statistic there be quarter of million abortion if only of they take place as late term abortion that would mean late term abortion year we also risk the rise once more of backstreet abortion imagine scenario in which woman know that she can not now be prosecute under the law for late term abortion but for some reason wish to go ahead with one or be pressure into it surely at this stage she be more likely to get hold of pill by post which be not consider safe to take outside clinical context after week by pretend to be under the legal limit to undertake dangerous procedure on herself or to seek to procure an off the book abortion will the hon gentleman give way will make progress the new clause seek to address perceive problem of police action that be over zealous in handful of case by make fundamental change to abortion law that would put more woman at risk while also risk the life of infant child my hon friend be give speech that think many member will find difficult to hear from such wonderful friend and colleague do he agree that many woman be already face incredibly difficult situation and many could already have late term abortion for which they could order pill online we do not want to criminalise those who be not do that it be entirely wrong to criminalise people for take action do my hon friend agree that the majority of woman be do the right thing absolutely do agree that the vast majority of woman be do the right thing but do not believe that we can cover all eventuality through such fundamental black and white change in the law the real problem be that the temporary pill by post abortion scheme bring in during covid which do not require in person appointment have be make permanent that be why add my name to new clause in person appointment would remove any doubt about the gestational age of foetus within narrow range and massively reduce the likelihood of successful coercion which be something have see throughout my work as have mention this would consequentially remove the possibility of egregious police overreach which know my hon friend be so concerned about will my hon friend give way be just come to my conclusion the choice for members be very clear indeed stark it be to approve the big change to abortion law in year while believe make thing bad for woman and their unborn child or to solve the problem of criminal justice overreach by reinstate in person appointment for abortion this be clearly very difficult subject and just feel that amend this bill be not the right way to go about such divisive and emotive change but will leave it there rise order the speak limit be far reduce to three minute rise to speak against new clause and which represent rush change to our abortion law of profound consequence not only for the unborn child but for woman themselves my fear be that if pass these new clause would undermine the ability to prosecute abusive partner who force woman into end pregnancy inadvertently lead to more dangerous and highly distressing at home abortion and risk reduce the status of an unborn child to legal non entity also wish to put on record my deep unease about the continue attempt to lasso unrelated legislation with amendment on abortion whether or not one support liberalisation we should all be able to agree that these amendment represent substantial change to the exist law be afraid the hon member be not state what my new clause would actually do it take woman out of the criminal justice system and this be the crime and policing bill be also express my concern about other amendment that have be table but believe the hon member be none the less propose substantial change that deserve more than two hour debate among back benchers as mps we be not here simply to express our opinion of an ideal world or even to focus only on highly distressing case we be legislator and no great legislative duty exist than to make sure that what we do in this house do not lead to unintended consequence in the real world for the most vulnerable in two hour of debate on tuesday afternoon we be be ask to rewrite profound boundary in british law that protect the unborn child that be not responsible lawmaking it be procedural ambush it be tell that not even the promoter of decriminalisation in this house can agree on the form it should take that ought to make each one of we pause because it speak to the challenge of move beyond principle to real world application it be worth our recall previous effort to amend bills in this way and their consequence the temporary pill by post scheme bring in during the crisis of the pandemic be make permanent by an amendment hooked with little notice on to an unrelated bill and what have we see since we have see woman access pill under false name and gestational date and take they far beyond the recommend week limit and viable baby have be lose after late term abortion that be not woman healthcare it be legal and medical failure will the hon lady give way will the hon lady give way be afraid there be simply not enough time that failure be now be use to justify the loosening of abortion law still far due to recent uptick in case of woman be investigate have look carefully at the argument be push for decriminalisation and with those from the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy see that the bogeyman of the us right be back apparently unless we agree to these amendment evangelical religious group pay for by us cash be go to start roll back woman reproductive right in this country this be utter nonsense we be in the uk and we have very different and more balanced national conversation this be not pro or anti life it be not extremist to want protection for viable baby and it be not anti woman to say that coercion or dangerous self medication should not be outside the reach of the law we also see the argument make that this be solely woman health issue and nobody but she should have say over what happen to her body but that be to ignore very inconvenient truth that have always stalk the abortion debate this be not about one body there be two body involve like it or not this house have duty to consider the right of woman against the safety and morality of abort the unborn viable child without consequence it be not extreme or anti woman to say that baby matter too accept that new clause do not decriminalise doctor or third party carry out an abortion outside exist time limit but let we step back and ask why we have criminal law at all it be not simply to punish but to deter the former justice minister laura farris have express concern that the challenge of prosecution for infanticide will become great she have also raise similar concern about prosecute coercive partner if the termination be no long criminal offence order want to start by align myself with and commend the speech of my hon friend the members for morecambe and lunesdale lizzi collinge for ribble valley maya ellis for monmouthshire catherine fookes for gower tonia antoniazzi and for walthamstow ms creasy be proud to stand alongside my colleague and be proud to listen to what they have to say today and because of what they have to say today have less to say which will allow more people to speak have be send here by my constituent to defend and further their right to safe and legal abortion my inbox have be inundate with message from constituent who be concern and who want to be able to have safe and legal abortion they want to be remove from the criminal justice system as my hon friend the member for gower say because we have situation where clinically vulnerable woman who have go through some of the bad experience that anybody can go through will in some case be arrest straight from the hospital ward hurry to cell and make to feel unmitigated level of shame and guilt on top of the physical and mental trauma they have already experience my hon friend be articulate exactly the point which be that very few woman if any at all take the decision to have an abortion lightly it be an incredibly difficult painful and hard decision which be physically and mentally very tough to deal with do he agree that that be the crux of what we be do here alleviate some of the pain that those woman be have to go through thank my hon friend for that really powerful intervention completely agree if in this place we can do one important thing today which be to send signal that we wish to alleviate that pain then we should do it be my hon friend aware of the fact that it be impossible medically to determine whether somebody have have miscarriage or have use abortion pill so the case these woman do not have scientific or medical basis only suspicion if we really want to protect the woman we would make sure that she have the right advice and the right medical support throughout her pregnancy thank my hon friend for that intervention do agree and it take to the point make by my hon friend the member for ribble valley she talk about how over many year woman have be deny access to the healthcare advice guidance childcare and other infrastructure that be so critical to woman quality of life we need to end that full stop that take to another point which relate to new clause listen to the mover of new clause the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson and to those on the opposition benches make case in support of it be afraid do not agree there be nothing in the clinical evidence available to support the new clause as somebody who run domestic abuse and mental health charity for five year before be elect be very painfully aware of the trauma and difficulty that woman who have be domestically abuse will go through and do not want they to feel on top of that shame and trauma about try to access abortion service it be important that we think about those people forget who it be on the liberal democrat benches but they make really important point about poor people who be unable to access transport link to access clinic there be really important point about our infrastructure be break down such as bus connectivity that be the legacy of the past year but it be legacy we must none the less contend with or woman will be impede in their access to abortion service as consequence do the hon gentleman agree with the advice from the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists the royal college of general practitioners the royal college of midwives the royal pharmaceutical society the faculty of sexual and reproductive healthcare and the british medical association who all know much more than we do about the issue to vote firmly against new clause because it make woman more vulnerable thank the hon gentleman for that intervention agree with those body and agree with he finally the hon member for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez make an argument about bogeyman of american politic somehow be conjure up by my hon friend the member for walthamstow represent bournemouth east in my constituency we have bpas bournemouth which be target by us vice president vance when he make his point about buffer zone and abortion access have speak with the people who work at that clinic since that speech be give and they be scared they want to support woman reproductive right and woman health and safety but staff member vehicle be be tamper with and woman seek the clinic support be find their access impede they want we to be sensitive in what we say and how we say it because there be people across our constituency who be deeply concerned for the welfare of woman and who look to we to send the right signal through how we conduct our politic be signatory to new clause and new clause recognise that there will be vote on new clause first will vote in favour of it and call on all member across this house to do the same we have run out of time so will call the front bench speaker call the liberal democrat spokesperson as be usual on matter of conscience these vote will not be whip by my party today as believe be the case across the house that say my party pass relevant policy at our party conference and will lay out that policy before talk little about my predecessor work on the act then will explain in personal capacity why will support some but not all of the amendment before we the liberal democrats believe that woman have the right to make independent decision about their reproductive health without interference from the state and that access to reproductive healthcare be human right the current law impact the most vulnerable woman under that legislation some can be drag from hospital bed to prison cell and endure needlessly long period of investigation and prosecution the provision that allow for this be introduce before woman be even allow to vote so it be not surprising that many see the need for they to be update in the past five year there have be both debate about whether the police have the resource that they need to keep our community safe and surge of police investigation into woman suspect of obtain medication or instrument to end their pregnancy outside the law that surely can not be the good use of police time lib dem policy be to ensure proper funding for impartial advice service so that people can receive comprehensive unbiased information without be pressure access to abortion should never be make more stressful so we would maintain safe zone around clinic to protect those seek care my predecessor as liberal mp for hazel grove the late dr michael winstanley later lord winstanley be key in shape the abortion act he be on cross party group of around dozen mp who seek to refine the language and the strategy of that vital legislation dr winstanley continue to be mention on the doorstep in my constituency and he be know among other thing for bring calm professional insight to the debate he draw on his background as general practitioner and on his medical knowledge and experience to ground the discussion in medical evidence and be especially vocal in highlight the dangerous and often desperate condition face by woman when abortion be severely restrict he make the case that legal regulated abortion be not only safe but more humane at the end of this debate will join the world health organisation the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists midwife nurse psychiatrist general practitioner and the end violence against women coalition in support new clause to be clear this new clause would not change how abortion be provide or the legal time limit on it and it would apply only to woman act in relation to their own pregnancy healthcare professional act outside the law and abusive partner use violence or poisoning to end pregnancy would still be criminalise as they be now will the hon lady give way be under strict encouragement from madam deputy speaker to be speedy so will not give way very much support the spirit of new clause but can not support new clause acknowledge that those who table it want woman to be able to access the good healthcare available but it would be step backwards to make it hard for woman to access the treatment that they need whether that be woman in coercive relationship or those who live in rural area with limited transport option and who find it hard to access in person medical appointment telemedicine enable timely accessible abortion care we rightly speak repeatedly in this house of the strain on our nhs space staff and capacity so it feel entirely retrograde to roll this service back and insert clinically unnecessary barrier and can not support do so the amendment and new clause before we be subject to free vote so member can rightly choose for themselves very much hope that we choose to move forwards not back call the shadow minister in recent week and month in this house we have become familiar with vote of conscience the amendment that shall speak to new clause and be also matter of conscience although be respond for his majesty official opposition conservative members will have free vote so the view that express will be my own and fully recognise that there may be conservative colleague who disagree with recognise that the hon member for gower tonia antoniazzi and for walthamstow ms creasy table new clause and with the very good of intent have no doubt that all member who sign they do so with the objective of support and safeguard the right of woman and can unequivocally say that share those aim as do my hon friend the members for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez for reigate rebecca paul for south west devon rebecca smith and for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson and my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh who have also speak however do not believe that new clause or achieve the safeguarding of woman that member seek view on abortion do not have to be absolutist be pro choice be not incompatible with be pro life when the foetus be at stage at which it be inherently viable believe that woman should have autonomy over their body do not negate the need for system that safeguard woman from physical and emotional harm as we have hear new clause would ensure that pregnant woman be not criminalise for access an abortion during their pregnancy it would however retain the law relate to the provision of abortion in healthcare setting as it stand effectively woman in england and wales would legally be able to abort an unborn child by her own mean up to the moment prior to natural birth but healthcare professional would be break the law if they try to help she do so outside the week limit there be calumny at the heart of this which be that these new clause be compatible with the act when breach an act of this parliament cease to be unlawful it lose its force and therefore its purpose and that calumny can not be allow to stand on the record thank my right hon friend for his intervention on the one hand abortion would be decriminalise for woman on the other restriction on her ability to access that same procedure in safe control and supportive setting would remain we must be careful not to create law that have unintended and potentially harmful consequence especially for those it be design to help and especially when those who be likely to rely on it be likely to be in state of stress or distress new clause raise many question be it tenable to legalise all but full term abortion in england and wales but not in other part of the uk what would be the legal implication if woman in gretna travel mile across the border to carlisle to have an abortion after the week limit that be in place in scotland under new clause how do we monitor such abortion that occur outside healthcare set how do we ensure that mother physical and mental health be protect and support and what happen to the once deliver foetus if the abortion be outside healthcare set as we have hear new clause go far than new clause in many respect so many of the same concern apply new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham would mandate an in person consultation before pregnant woman be prescribe medication to terminate pregnancy this new clause be not about make abortion hard to access an abortion should of course be readily available to those who need and want it and of course abortion medication should be easily accessible during the appropriate stage of pregnancy but this new clause be about the safety of the mother and the unborn child face to face appointment be commonplace for patient with wide range of medication and condition particularly when new medication be be prescribe private in person consultation allow doctor to be as sure as they can be that the woman be act of her own inform free will and ensure that her mental state be assess and understand it also reduce as much as possible the likelihood of medication be misuse or abuse telemedicine while it have its place can never be replacement for the patient doctor relationship develop during face to face appointment it have serious shortcoming there have be many case where abortion medicine have be misuse follow telemedicine and there have be many more hospitalisation of woman follow the use of telemedicine however stress that not all of these case will be down to misuse we should all be aware of that new clause do not attempt to restrict access to abortion and would not support it if it do instead it would act as an important safeguard to protect woman from emotional trauma and physical harm let begin by emphasise that all woman in england and wales can access safe regulated abortion on the nhs under our current law also recognise and respect that there be strongly hold view across the house on this highly sensitive issue and welcome the consider and informed debate we have have today the government maintain neutral stance on change the criminal law on abortion in england and wales we maintain that it be for parliament to decide the circumstance under which abortion should take place and will allow member to vote accord to their moral ethical or religious belief if it be the will of the house that the criminal law on abortion should change whether by our exempt pregnant woman from the offence or otherwise the government would not stand in the way of such change however we must ensure coherence between the statute book and any legislation propose it will be helpful if first set out the relevant law as hon member will know in england and wales the criminal offence relate to abortion must be read in conjunction with the provision of the abortion act which provide exemption to the criminal offence the act define the circumstance in which abortion or termination can legally take place section of the offences against the person act be the offence of administer drug or use instrument to procure an abortion it be an offence for pregnant woman to unlawfully take drug or use instrument with the intent of procure her own miscarriage it be also an offence for another person who have the intent of procure the miscarriage of woman whether or not she be pregnant to unlawfully administer drug or use instrument with that intent it be also an offence under section of the act for person to supply or procure drug poison or an instrument that be intend to be use to procure miscarriage the infant life preservation act deal with act in the later stage of pregnancy include late term abortion in england and wales under section of the act it be an offence for any person to intentionally destroy the life of child before it be bear if it be capable of be bear alive unless it can be prove that the act be do in good faith and only to preserve the life of the woman turn to the amendment the purpose of new clause table by my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi be to disapply criminal offence relate to abortion from woman act in relation to her own pregnancy at any gestation this mean that it would never be criminal offence for pregnant woman to terminate her pregnancy regardless of the number of week of gestation include beyond the week will the minister give way apologise but will not we be really short on time it would also not be criminal offence for woman to intentionally deceive register medical practitioner about the gestation of her pregnancy in order to procure abortion pill by post beyond the week time limit it would remain an offence for another person such as doctor to do the relevant act and for pregnant woman to do the relevant act for another woman unless the provision of the abortion act be apply new clause seek to ensure that woman can not commit an offence in relation to her own pregnancy under the law relate to abortion include under section and of the offences against the person act and the infant life preservation act the phrase relate to abortion be not define in the clause but in practice will be limit to these provision as there be no other offence that relate to abortion in england and wales it be suggest during the recent westminster hall debate on decriminalise abortion and again today that the risk with new clause be that it create general power for the secretary of state to amend the abortion act or the relevant criminal legislation relate to abortion would like to clarify that new clause do not create such power nor do any other provision of the crime and policing bill new clause do not grant the secretary of state additional secondary legislation power while clause of the bill do grant the secretary of state regulation make power in relation to the provision of the bill that can only be exercise to make provision that be appropriate in consequence of the bill provision it would not for example give the secretary of state general power to make substantive amendment to the abortion act in order to change the rule about abortion or to amend the offence against the person act to reintroduce criminal offence as that would not be consequential to new clause turn to new clause table by my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy which would repeal exist criminal offence relate to abortion and concealment of birth place duty on the secretary of state to implement certain recommendation relate to abortion service and create regulation make power regard criminal offence relate to abortion will the minister give way will not give way this be complex new clause and will not address all of its provision or the policy intention behind they however will highlight area where the house may want to consider whether the duty or delegate power may be unclear or give rise to unintended consequence acknowledge that my hon friend approach seek to mirror the model use to decriminalise abortion in northern ireland however it be important to recognise that the circumstance in northern ireland at the time be markedly different from those in england and wales there be no function executive no provision of abortion service except in the most exceptional circumstance and no equivalent to the abortion act so provision have to be make to create regime for abortion service as such the approach to decriminalise abortion in england and wales where the provision and regulation of lawful abortion already exist need to reflect the distinct legal context new clause would impose duty on the secretary of state to implement paragraph and of the convention on the elimination of all form of discrimination against woman in england and wales by use the regulation make power in subsection the cedaw report contain recommendation relate to the criminal law on abortion which would in so far as they relate to england and wales already be address by the repealing of the offence through subsection and of the new clause the report include recommendation that go beyond the provision of abortion service such as on the provision of sexual and reproductive health and education as have mention the cedaw report and its recommendation be develop in the specific context of northern ireland and therefore reflect the position there at the time the position in england and wales be different with exist guidance service and legislation that already address many of the report recommendation turn to the criminal law aspect of the new clause subsection and would repeal section to of the offences against the person act as well as the infant life preservation act repeal those offence would remove criminal liability for woman act in relation to her own pregnancy and would also decriminalise any other person do the relevant act to pregnant woman or in relation to the body of child for example there would no long be specific offence to cover case of forced abortion that would mean that situation in which an individual subject pregnant woman to violence with the intention of cause miscarriage would be deal with under different offence relate to assault and bodily harm rather than section of the infant life preservation act the moratorium on investigation and prosecution contain in subsection would discontinue such case therefore those suspect of force woman to have an abortion before the offence be repeal could not be investigate for those offence subsection seek to repeal section of the offences against the person act which criminalise conceal birth by dispose of child body after its birth unlike section and of the act that offence be not limit to abortion relate act repeal it entirely could therefore create gap in the law regard non abortion relate concealment of birth follow child death while understand the concern of my hon friend the member for walthamstow about investigation under section relate to allege illegal abortion full repeal may have unintended consequence will briefly address point that my hon friend make about exist offence that cover this matter the offence of pervert the course of justice require positive act couple with an ulterior intent that the course of justice will be pervert therefore it be not necessarily the same and we do not want to provide unintended consequence it be important to note that subsection grant the secretary of state regulation make power in the light of the repeal of these offence subject to certain restriction the power could be use for example to create offence specifically target at force abortion or conceal birth by dispose of child body while do not comment on the policy intent the house typically exercise its full power of scrutiny over the introduction of new and serious offence rather than confer power on the secretary of state to do so through secondary legislation new clause which be table by the hon member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson deal directly with the abortion act the intended purpose of the new clause be to require woman to attend an in person consultation section of the abortion act do not apply to consultation that take place before the medicine be prescribe woman would therefore continue to have remote consultation for prescription of the medicine but would then be require to travel to hospital or clinic for an in person consultation before be able to self administer the medicine at home alternatively woman could have an in person consultation to be prescribe the medicine and then the medication could be post to the woman at home the overall effect of this new clause would mean that no woman could legally have an at home early medical abortion without an in person consultation in conclusion if it be the will of parliament that the law should change the government in fulfil our duty to ensure that the legislation be legally robust and workable will work closely with my hon friend the members for gower and for walthamstow to ensure that their new clause accurately reflect their intention and the will of parliament and be coherent with the statute book as have already state the government take no position hope these observation be helpful to the house when consider the new clause question put that the clause be read second time diane abbott jack abbott debbie abrahams luke akehurst bayo alaba dan aldridge heidi alexander sadik

on point of order madam deputy speaker irrespective of our position on the vote that we have just take we have to acknowledge that we have make major change to abortion law yet that be on the basis of no evidence session no committee stage scrutiny and just minute of back bench debate and wind up speech by minister who refuse to take any intervention when the chamber be full of one line debate if we want to continue like this can you advise madam deputy speaker on how we can improve our rule so that we do not have this situation in the future mr mayhew to be clear nothing have happen that be out of order your point be more one of frustration than process and procedure and it be not point of order for the chair business without debate delegated legislation motion make and question put forthwith standing order no betting gaming and lotteries that the draft casinos gaming machines and mandatory conditions regulations which be lay before this house on may be mccluskey question agree to prostate cancer treatment motion make and question propose that this house do now mccluskey joe biden recent diagnosis have to some extent put prostate cancer in the spotlight of late but it be not just he there be stephen fry jools holland and robert de niro more than man in the uk and million man worldwide be diagnose with prostate cancer yearly which be project to double by with one in eight man diagnose during their life it be the most common male cancer more than half of those man be pre retirement age such as the cyclist sir chris hoy who be diagnose at but plus be the most common age my late dad be when he be diagnose he leave this earth just shy of his birthday in august so he have year it be often say that man die with prostate cancer not of it with my dad it spread to bone cancer but pneumonia be actually the cause of death on the certificate miss he every day treatment for prostate cancer have improve dramatically since then one crucial breakthrough be the development of the drug abiraterone great british success story discover and initially develop in london at the institute of cancer research it be shin example of british science lead the world and revolutionise advanced prostate cancer care will the hon member reiterate question that have for the minister specifically give that abiraterone be already approve for use in scotland and wales what action be the minister take to ensure that man in england be not disadvantaged in access lifesave cancer treatment the hon member read my mind about the postcode lottery which will come to in my list of question know that my hon friend the minister be very sympathetic and on the right side abiraterone be now global drug half million man around the world have have transform outcome improve quality of life and extra year spend with love one will the hon lady give way yes will what an honour to give way to the hon member for strangford jim shannon thank the hon lady for bring forward this debate she be absolutely right to do so and congratulate she on that she may not be aware that abiraterone be not routinely available in northern ireland for man with high risk hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer unlike in scotland and wales it be primarily approve for man with advanced prostate cancer that have already spread while it can be access through an individual funding request process it be not standard first line treatment option do she agree that man in northern ireland and right here in england should be able to access treatment that be available in scotland and wales the hon gentleman make powerful point we be see theme of uneven application the rule of law mean that the law apply to everyone so it look like something have go wrong here thank the hon lady for secure this important adjournment debate we have hear from number of member who have constituent who be affect or have frustration with the current system meet gentleman call david in the run up to the general election who have metastatic prostate cancer and be not eligible for abiraterone he ask if we would push and do what we could in parliament to ensure that people such as he could get the drug he be fortunate and can afford to pay for it privately but not everyone be in that situation this be about ensure that we have equality of access for everyone regardless of their financial circumstance do the hon lady agree that we need to have another look at this issue completely agree with the hon gentleman that access should be base not on how deep somebody pocket be but on need abiraterone halve the risk of relapse each relapse literally cost the nhs million the definition of lose lose as many member have point out it be already successfully available on the nhs and routinely fund for use in metastatic case in england but sadly there be catch abiraterone be not available on the nhs for man with non metastatic prostate cancer live in england thank my hon friend for bring forward this very important debate for her constituent my constituent and people in the uk do she agree that since this issue be last assess by the national institute for health and care excellence there have be significant development as have be mention by other colleague both in the provision of the drug in other nation and the fact that it be now available off patent so it be much cheap to access that will fundamentally change the cost benefit analysis that nice do previously do she agree that her constituent and my constituent need this drug just as much as patient in scotland and wales who be benefit from it totally agree west london need the same as the west of scotland the west of wales and all the other bit of those other nation man can access abiraterone on the nhs in scotland and wales but not in england even with an identical diagnosis it seem at well anomalous that their postcode not their prognosis be determine their treatment and we all know that the nhs be mean to be free at the point of need would give anything to have have long with my dad be remind of he when like the hon member for harrogate and knaresborough tom gordon have someone come to see peter treadgold who come to my advice surgery and point out that he be fall between the crack he have long stand diagnosis with remission and he diligently follow all the advice he be under nhs monitoring for year because he have heighten prostate specific antigen level although he be never actually offer an mri or ultrasound scan last year his cancer come back and he be tell that he would need hormone and radiation therapy abiraterone be not offer peter be one of the one in three people who get the devastating news that their cancer have come back and have be deny access to treatment that could save or extend his life the first time hear of abiraterone be when meet peter because as my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip danny beales say in my dad day it would not have be cost efficient however it be now generic drug it have go off patent but it be license only for metastatic case as my hon friend the minister know well there be complicated convoluted process involve in get it approve for non metastatic case there be no question about the effectiveness of abiraterone it have have one of the big trial know to mankind genuinely world beat trial when nhs england own clinical priority advisory group plot the clinical benefit against the net cost abiraterone score highest in that tabulation it be calculate that two year of abiraterone treatment would halve the death rate for man with locally advanced prostate cancer but we hear about budgetary challenge have write to the minister and table question and have be tell that nhs england have not identify the recurrent budget to support provision of the drug we should look long term at the remission and at the cost of chemotherapy hospital appointment and other associate thing those cost add up university college london find that abiraterone would pay for itself if it be day do member know what the nhs be actually pay do anyone want to hazard guess oh we be not do call and response abiraterone cost day now that it be off patent and have come down in price that be less than three measly quid to avoid costly relapse scan chemo hospital appointment and everything else less than three little round one to improve life and reduce death as we have hear only people who can fork out up front for private treatment or private medical insurance currently have that option and again our nhs be not mean to be for private profiteering or big pharma drug pusher people be see their pension and life saving evaporate and we be in cost of living crisis this drug should be universally available it take less than one year for abiraterone to be approve for man with non metastatic prostate cancer in scotland and wales in england it be now three year and counting and we still have not have concrete resolution right now abiraterone be the cheap and most cost effective it have ever be and as the excellent prostate cancer uk put it the postcode lottery must end lord darzi independent investigation into the nhs find that the uk have high cancer mortality rate than other comparable country and sadly progress in diagnose cancer at stage and be flatline just over half of prostate cancer be catch at an early stage that fall well short of the nhs target of appreciate that labour have just come into power after year of the conservative party so it will take time to fix our health system but we need it to be more responsive to act early and rapidly to use all the tool it can and to offer preventive rather than after the fact care in every case abiraterone exemplify all those thing welcome the chancellor real term increase in nhs spending to deliver the exciting plan to build an nhs fit for the future with the year plan come soon and the national cancer strategy due this autumn we have real chance to deliver significant improvement for people live with cancer so as be customary have list of question for the minister will incorporate those of my hon friend think we be all friend here even if we sit on opposite side of the chamber first will the minister commit to explore way of ensure that additional nhs funding be use to make abiraterone available to all man who need it in england and in northern ireland as the hon member for strangford jim shannon have point out secondly will the minister support the introduction of national programme of screen for prostate cancer like those that we have for comparable cancer in the united kingdom thirdly give the complexity of nhs england decision make process in relation to the availability of abiraterone which sound like right old bureaucratic nightmare as the function of nhs england be transfer back to the department of health and social care will the minister take step to ensure that all decision about access to medicine include abiraterone be timely and transparent know that she have have long career in the nhs and as have say she be on the side of the angel fourthly will the minister commit to publish an equality impact assessment give the disturbingly disproportionate effect that prostate cancer be have on black man who be more likely to develop it and to receive late diagnosis and less likely to receive the right treatment be do this partly for dad who be watch from somewhere up above but also for the black and minority ethnic man who be implicate here and now this be the second time that you have be in the chair madam deputy speaker when have be talk about health inequality since friday when we discuss assist dying you have chair both debate excellently fifthly in the light of the lengthy approval process will the minister assess the adequacy of the funding formula model we have nice and we have the medicines and healthcare product regulatory agency and it all seem bit knotty and consider whether novel pharmaceutical treatment could be produce cost effectively especially as my hon friend the member for uxbridge and south ruislip say when they come off patent be argue for simplification in case in which drug be already prescribe for limited use and there be credible case for expand their application to generic treatment we be halfway there we just need to go that little bit far prostate cancer uk estimate that man die prematurely each year because we have no access to abiraterone each week that this continue man in england will die from cancer that could have be treat cheaply have they live in scotland or wales labour be the party of the nhs and labour government introduce the uk first dedicated cancer strategy so let we go for this win win for all end the iniquitous unjust postcode lottery celebrate the good of british science and widen access to abiraterone for all those who need it not just those who can afford it thank my hon friend the member for ealing central and acton dr huq for secure the debate and thank the other member who have speak as my hon friend have say more than man be diagnose with prostate cancer every year and one in eight will be diagnose with it during their lifetime commend she for raise an issue that know be very personal to she as she have articulate so well be sure that her late father be watch she carefully she be also right to support her constituent peter by raise this issue which affect so many man and to highlight the number of black and minority ethnic man present with the disease that be something on which we have all campaign very strongly timely and equitable diagnosis and access to innovative medicine for the treatment of prostate cancer be of the utmost importance to support fast diagnosis nhs england have redesign pathway to maximise capacity we be also aware of very early stage trial of the use of artificial intelligence in prostate cancer detection and we look forward to formal report on those trial so that the evidence can be consider carefully the effect of prostate cancer have be well note tonight as have the number of man who be affect about die from it each year more than of they in northern ireland do the minister agree that northern ireland should be include in the commissioning and will she undertake to speak to the health minister in northern ireland about the issue do she also agree that this need to sit alongside uk wide prostate cancer screening programme target in particular people with family history of the disease we talk regularly with our colleague in northern ireland and be always happy to do so as the hon lady know this matter be devolve so it be matter for northern ireland and we respect the devolution settlement our elective reform plan publish in january build on the investment already make with an ambitious vision for the future of diagnostic testing this will include more straight to test pathway increase and expand community diagnostic centre and well use of technology with nearly community diagnostic centre up and run they can take on more of the grow diagnostic demand in elective and cancer care we will also deliver additional capacity in by expand some exist centre and build up to five new one we will address the challenge in diagnostic waiting time provide the ct mri and other test that be need to reduce the elective and cancer wait member know that the national institute for health and care excellence we have hear little about it this evening be an independent body responsible for assess whether new licensed medicine can be recommend for routine use in england base on thorough assessment of their clinical and cost effectiveness the nhs be legally require to fund nice recommend medicine ensure consistency of access for nhs patient wherever they live in england nice be able to recommend promise new cancer medicine for use through the cancer drug fund which support patient access while real world evidence be generate to address clinical uncertainty through the cancer drug fund nhs patient also benefit from access to cancer medicine from the point of positive draft nice guidance accelerate access to clinically and cost effective medicine by up to five month through this process many thousand of patient include patient with prostate cancer have be able to benefit from effective new treatment at price that represent value to the nhs the drug that be the subject of this debate abiraterone be license as my hon friend the member for ealing central and acton say it be recommend by nice for use in the treatment of certain type of metastatic prostate cancer and it be now routinely available to nhs patient in england in line with the nice recommendation nhs england have recently put in place an interim commission policy that make abiraterone available for man with high risk hormone sensitive metastatic prostate cancer pende the outcome of nice update of its negative guidance be pleased that this approach be agree between nice and nhs england late last year to ensure uninterrupted access to abiraterone for man leave the stampede trial my hon friend raise particular concern about access to this drug for man with non metastatic prostate cancer first it be important to note that abiraterone be not license by the mhra for use in this indication and it be therefore off label nice do not evaluate the off label us of medicine and the drug be also now off patent and available generically which mean there be no single manufacturer that could sponsor an mhra licence application or nice evaluation it be therefore for nhs organisation to take decision on funding base on the available evidence nhs england consider abiraterone for the treatment of non metastatic prostate cancer through its clinical prioritisation process last year through this process nhs england conclude that evidence support the routine commissioning of the drug in this indication approximately man per year could be eligible for this drug and it be estimate that it would cost an additional million per year to fund that while as my hon friend say there may be some cost saving in the pathway from prevent the disease progression these be unlikely to materialise for about five year and would not impact the up front cost of the million per year for the additional out patient monitoring and drug cost have not hear the figure she outline but will get back to she on some of the question she ask and it would be helpful to know where those figure be from unfortunately it have not be possible to identify the necessary current funding to support the commissioning of abiraterone for this purpose or any other treatment in this prioritisation round know that be disappointing for those affect and want to acknowledge that this be really difficult and unusual situation however want to assure my hon friend and other hon member that the funding position for this treatment do not mean that there be no treatment option the nice guideline on prostate cancer recommend the treatment of non metastatic prostate cancer with surgery and radiotherapy want to assure hon member that nhs england be keep this position under review and would reconsider funding for abiraterone for non metastatic prostate cancer if the funding position change early this month nhs england meet prostate cancer uk which share its financial model of the expect cost impact nhs england be review this in more detail and encourage it to continue those discussion in closing recognise how hard it be when patient want access to effective treatment also recognise the distress and worry it cause not only for patient but for their family and friend the government be commit to ensure that we provide access to the most innovative and effective medicine but it have to be in way that be sustainable and affordable for the nhs it be right that nhs england continue to engage with prostate cancer uk and know that my hon friend and other member will keep an eye on this and similar issue with drug come forward the national cancer plan will seek to improve every aspect of cancer care to well the experience and outcome of people with cancer our goal be to reduce the number of life lose to cancer over the next year be grateful for the opportunity to respond to the debate this evening question put and agree to house adjourn
