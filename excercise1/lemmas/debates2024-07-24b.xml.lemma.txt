design by sir frederick gibberd sir frederick design harlow to be place of community every community have its own shopping area playground and green space local historian describe harlow as be design excuse for this madam deputy speaker on socialist principle it be place where people can see barbara hepworth or rodin while just walk down the street that sense of community be put to the test during the pandemic when we see dark time not only in this country but across the entire world be proud to report to everybody in this house that during those dark time harlow community step up they pass the test they support the most vulnerable people across our town and community perhaps that be no surprise give that our town invent the fibre optic cable and be the home of harlow college and the birthplace of rupert grint have no idea why put those thing in that order apparently harlow have the low density of pub per head of population that be okay though because there be one five minute staggering distance from my house it be the convention to talk about non controversial issue in one maiden speech that be tricky when you find yourself in room with people with oppose view think that might talk about football but be leeds supporter and my hon friend the members for southampton itchen darren paffey and for derby north catherine atkinson go before so think shall leave the subject alone but be sure this house will join in congratulate the mighty harlow town on their league cup victory last season let we not worry about what league it be instead decide to talk about young carer subject very close to my heart as have say be secondary school math teacher for year in one school have boy in my form shall call he george but that be not his real name he be lovely lad every friday it be my job to check that pupil have get their homework planner sign by their parent so that we know that the pupil be do their homework and record it properly but george never get his planner sign anyone who know as teacher would say that be bit of softie so let it go but over time have to keep he back at break time and lunch time because his planner be not get sign he never argue he just turn up do his five minute detention and go on his way it be only at parent evening that find out that both george parent be severely physically disabled and that george and his sister be young carer feel terrible it be probably that experience that inspire to become more involved in support young carer the solution to george issue be really easy george like many young carer do not want to be treat differently what we do be say your sister can sign your planner for you as long as your sister get it sign there be no problem lo and behold he get it sign by his sister he get detention if he do not he be happy with that be pleased to say that that story be about year old think we have progress quite well in our recognition and understanding of young carer thank member from across the house the leader of the liberal democrats and my own prime minister for bring their experience to this house in recent school census of school say that they do not have any young carer can tell members that from my experience of support young carer that can not be correct it be predict that there be more than young carer in essex alone essex county council have identify roughly of they so there be huge number of young carer whom we have not identify let alone get the resource in place for would like to end my maiden speech on positive ask the house to join in thank all the young carer have work with and all young carer across great britain and northern ireland for the incredible job that they do many of they do not even think of themselves as be young carer because it be just what they do they help love one but want to put it on record that to they be absolute hero
