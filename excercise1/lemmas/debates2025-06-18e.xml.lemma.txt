border and we spend million of taxpayer money on persuade just four volunteer to be remove to rwanda take no lecture from he if she want to find out who have lose control of our border suggest that she look to her immediate right because ever since the home secretary scrap the rwanda deterrent before it even start illegal immigration across the channel have go up by so far have be the bad year in history for illegal immigrant cross the channel that be on her watch that be down to her government the prime minister be plan crisis talk with president macron and be finally admit that the situation be in his word deteriorate the government laughable plan to smash the gang lie in tatter will the deputy prime minister at last accept that we need removal deterrent so that every single illegal immigrant who arrive on these shore be immediately remove will she commit to that yes or no if the conservatives want to argue that the arrival since july be down to the scrapping of the rwanda scheme they need to explain why there be more than arrival in the same period start in july when the rwanda agreement be in place it be absolute rubbish they lose control of our border we be get control of our border the right hon gentleman need to apologise do not see how the deputy prime minister have the brass neck to claim that she have the situation under control when the number cross the channel this year be the high in history she ask about the rwanda deterrent she be obviously not listen to what say early the rwanda scheme never start indeed illegal immigrant in order want to hear the question and be sure our constituent want to hear the question and the answer the rwanda scheme never start illegal immigrant in calais say before the election how much they want the prime minister to get elect because he would help they to get here when australia start similar scheme about year ago it work within few month as consequence of the government lose control they now accommodate in asylum hotel and flat grow number of illegal immigrant many of whom cross the channel the home office supplier be actively offer above market deal to landlord to get hold of their property for use by illegal immigrant in the meantime hard press young people here be unable to rent or buy why do this government prioritise housing for illegal immigrant above housing for our young people again gently say to the right hon member that under his government watch immigration increase fourfold until it reach almost million in single year they also create the hotel which we reduce to just over in our first month in government one million pound day spiffe up the wall because they be so incompetent we be build the home that they fail to deliver over consecutive year of failure they should apologise while we get on with the job of rebuild britain goodness the deputy prime minister have cheek housing start in quarter four last year go down her mission to rebuild britain be not go very well she talk about asylum hotel but she obviously have not look at the most recent number the number of people in asylum hotel be high in march this year than it be at the time of the election and she give no answer about the priority be give to illegal immigrant over people already live here zimbabwean paedophile due for deportation be recently allow to stay in the uk because court find that he might face some hostility back in zimbabwe which apparently breach his article right what about the right of child here to be protect from this dangerous paedophile who be look out for their right not the government there be thousand of such case involve foreign criminal there be solution we need to scrap the human rights act for immigration matter so that this sovereign parliament decide on the law that our court apply but the deputy prime minister party vote against that have simple question why do the government side with foreign criminal and not the british public the conservatives have year of failure on these issue we have deport foreign national offender since we come to office which be more than they do over the same period will take no lecture from the johnny come lately who could not do anything when he be in office last saturday mark eight year since grenfell eight year fight for justice the hillsborough family include margaret aspinall from huyton have campaign for

have be consistent in urge iran to engage with the diplomatic process and work with the united states and we continue to support that diplomatic approach be grateful to the deputy prime minister we support those effort today the government be set to unveil their plan to cut personal independence payment and carer allowance prospect that one of my constituent describe as terrifying liberal

skill bootcamp and will be sure to send the detail to the hon member for clacton nigel farage reset with permission mr speaker shall make statement on as london councillor over year ago remember hear the then labour government bold plan for high speed rail to link our major city address the capacity need of the future and in the word of then prime minister gordon brown to join the high speed revolution sweep the world it be vision of confident nation and clear signal our great town and city in the midland and the north with potential that have be untapped at well and ignore at worst could be place of opportunity and aspiration again that be the promise of but after decade and half of tory timeline plan then delay route draw up then cancel budget calculate then blow and promise make then break we inherit project that have lose the trust of the public that create an image of britain woefully unable to deliver big infrastructure project and that have be ax from swathe of the country it be originally mean to serve phase could end up become one of the most expensive railway line in the world with project cost soar by billion under previous conservative governments and billion of taxpayer money be sink into phase work before it be cancel by the previous government there be also clear evidence of poor management despite the oakervee review advise that government halt construction contract pende improvement in price and simple engineering they press ahead regardless it have be no less than litany of failure and today be draw line in the sand call time on year of mismanagement flawed reporting and ineffective oversight it mean this government will get the job do between birmingham and london we will not reinstate cancel section we can not afford but we will do the hard but necessary work to rebuild public trust and we have not waste any time since july we have appoint new leadership of ltd to turn this project around we have make clear to the new chief executive mark wild that the priority be build the rest of the railway safely at the low reasonable cost even if this take long we have start the year long task of fundamentally reset the project include commission infrastructure expert james stewart to lead review into governance and oversight as part of that reset we have reduce financial delegation to ltd place lid on spiral cost until the reset be complete and we regain confidence and we have support mark wild review of the size and cost of as an organisation but today we be go far can confirm we have publish the landmark james stewart review and the department response the review commission in october last year by my predecessor be tough independent look at how the department for transport and government deliver major project the government not only welcome the review but have accept all the recommendation and my department be already deliver on these specifically across five key area first on the lack of oversight and scrutiny quite simply there have be too many dark corner for failure to hide in the ministerial taskforce set up to provide oversight of have inconsistent attendance from key ministers include the then transport secretary and the then chief secretary to the treasury the government have re establish the taskforce with full senior attendance per the review recommendation new performance programme and shareholder board will offer much need oversight and accountability secondly the report highlight could cost the taxpayer million more than plan we will stop this spiral any far by deliver all the recommendation on cost control that start with fundamentally change its approach to estimate cost it include certainty over funding which the spending review have give it also mean work with supplier so that their contract incentivise save cost for taxpayer as far as be concern supplier should make well return the more taxpayer money they save thirdly the review identify deficit in capability and skill with fundamental lack of trust between my department and be clear that both capability and cultural issue within must be address the new chief executive be already strengthen the organisation include by fill critical gap in area such as commercial expertise and he will be back by mike brown announce today as the new chair this be new era of leadership that the project desperately need with mike bring significant experience as former transport for london commissioner mark and mike be part of the team with that turn crossrail into the elizabeth line we have do it before and we will do it again fourthly between and ltd provide initial design for euston station come in almost billion over budget when ask for more affordable option it offer one cost million more than the first attempt the word affordable be clearly not part of the lexicon the combined cost for those two fail design which have now be write off be more than quarter of billion pound what be more the previous government announce euston ministerial taskforce unbelievably the taskforce never meet this government recognise euston huge potential we have already commit funding to start the tunnelling from old oak common to euston and we will set out more detail in our year infrastructure strategy we will use james stewart finding to transform infrastructure delivery across government implement real change in how we deliver infrastructure be not just for the department for transport this government be commit to implement these recommendation and adopt new approach to deliver infrastructure as will be set out in our upcoming year infrastructure strategy in that spirit the prime minister have also ask the cabinet secretary to consider the implication for the civil service and the wide public sector of the issue raise in the report include whether further action or investigation be warrant we be waste no time in deliver on this review will update parliament on our progress through my six monthly report even if the information be uncomfortable because for government who last week pledge billion in capital investment for new major project and who believe in the power of transport infrastructure to improve life and deliver on our plan for change that level of failure can not stand we will learn the lesson of the past year and restore our reputation for deliver world class infrastructure project have speak about our inheritance and james stewart review so let finally turn to mark wild initial assessment which lay bare the shocking mismanagement of the project under previous government will place copy of his interim finding in the library he state in no uncertain term that the overall project with respect to cost schedule and scope be unsustainable base on his advice see no route by which train can be run by as plan he reveal that cost will continue to increase if not take in hand far outstrip the budget set by the previous government and he can not be certain that all cost pressure have yet be identify it give no pleasure to deliver news like this billion of pound of taxpayer money have be waste by constant scope change ineffective contract and bad management there be also allegation that part of the supply chain have be defraud taxpayer and have be clear that those need to be investigate rapidly and rigorously if fraud be prove the consequence will be feel by all involve have to be honest this be an appalling mess but it be one that we will sort out we need to set target that we can confidently deliver and that the public can trust and that will take time but rest assure that where there be inefficiency we will root they out and where further ministerial intervention be need will make they without fear or favour will finally start deliver on our watch year of mismanagement and neglect have turn into shadow of that vision put forward year ago but this government be elect on mandate to restore trust to our politic and that be why we will not shirk away from this challenge and why today we turn the page on infrastructure failure can think of no well mission than deliver new economic opportunity new home commercial regeneration and an upskilled supply chain all of which can still unlock but no one should underestimate the scale of the reset require passenger and taxpayer deserve new railway that the country can be proud of the work to get back on track be firmly under way under this government and commend this statement to the house call the shadow secretary of state thank the secretary of state for her statement and for update the house on the initial finding of the review also thank she for advance notice and copy of her statement on the substance of the secretary of state statement believe there be broad consensus in this house on the central point that mistake be make in the delivery of as she note cost more than double the project have be repeatedly delay and the pandemic completely change travel pattern it undercut the assumption that guide the original plan and cause construction cost to rise sharply across the world by up to in some case as result of supply chain shortage as the world emerge from the crisis it have long be apparent that be not go accord to plan in my first two year as member of this house sit on the public accounts committee then chair by the hon member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier in the summer of we publish report on that raise serious concern in number of area and contain recommendation for how to improve the project in the previous government concede that be not go to plan and make fundamental change to it the result be the cancellation of the northern leg of and the creation of the network north plan under that plan billion be to be divert from the northern leg of to multitude of transport project that would benefit more people in more place and more quickly than the then government believe the delivery of could however we also recognise that the path we take to reach that point be not perfect far from it will not today pretend that the network north plan be not product of mistake we make in the handling of because it clearly be as country we must learn from those mistake and we must not repeat they on that note and with your permission mr speaker would like to express my gratitude to mark wild the chief executive officer of for his continue effort to support the delivery of the project recognise his leadership in rescue the crossrail project in london it be the noble lord harper then secretary of state for transport who appoint he to lead in may we be all encourage to see he play lead role in oversee the correction and completion of the project because his experience will be invaluable in help to get it back on track also welcome the appointment of mike brown as the new chairman of like the secretary of state know he from my year in london politic when he be commissioner of transport for london he be very capable man and wish he well in his new role the secretary of state have inform the house of her intention to accept recommendation of the independent review into have not yet see copy of that report which believe be be release today although we will need to study those proposal carefully before confirm our support for they can assure the secretary of state if they offer well value for taxpayer we will back they the secretary of state have also raise very serious concern that taxpayer may have be defraud by subcontractor assure she that if that prove to be the case will share her anger and will support whatever action be necessary to get to the bottom of those allegation would request that she keep the house inform as the investigation by and his majesty revenue and customs progress before close would like to press the secretary of state on number of matter in recent week the government have announce several project that either be fund by network north or align with its commitment however we have yet to see clear government commitment to either fully support the network north plan or scale it back can the secretary of state now provide definitive update on which element will proceed and which will be abandon it have be report that official be consider plan back by the mayor of greater manchester to build an lite track between birmingham and crewe will she confirm whether those report be true will conclude by turn to the planning system more generally the whole house will recall that grapple with legal challenge high court proceeding and judicial review all of which add delay and cost what assessment have the secretary of state make of the extent to which legal challenge and judicial review delay the delivery of how can future infrastructure project be protect from excessive or politically motivated litigation and do the secretary of state believe that sufficient action have be take to prevent some of the more spurious concern about such thing as bat and newts obstruct future vital infrastructure project thank the hon gentleman for his response and indeed for the tone with which he make his comment be pleased to hear he acknowledge that mistake have be make on by the previous government think he describe the path as not have be perfect would go so far as to say that it have be shambolic mess he strike sombre note in his remark and would ask he to consider go far once he have have the opportunity to read the full james stewart report because an apology on the part of the conservative party for the mess in which it leave this infrastructure scheme be undoubtedly warrant also thank he for his comment on the action that be take with regard to allege fraud within the supply chain can assure he that will provide appropriate update to the house on the progress of the hmrc investigation that be now under way the hon gentleman ask to set out our plan for investment in transport in the midland and the north the conservative party take the decision to cancel north of birmingham and make wild promise about what it would do with the money it claim it be save he be kid himself if he think that that money ever exist in last week spending review this government set out billion to be invest in local transport scheme across the country whether in birmingham liverpool manchester leeds or newcastle the hon gentleman approach be fantasy he promise the moon on stick and have absolutely no means to deliver he ask to set out the government plan for far enhance rail connectivity in the midland and the north can assure he that further announcement will be make both as part of the government year national infrastructure strategy and beyond that in the week and month ahead the hon gentleman also ask to opine on the extent to which litigation have cause delay in the delivery of infrastructure project he will know that through this government planning and infrastructure bill we be tackle this issue by limit the number of judicial review and legal challenge that can be bring unlike his party this government be serious about deliver infrastructure and about provide the stable leadership that this country need when it come to infrastructure before come to the chamber today look up the number of rail ministers in the department under his government it be in year it be no wonder that project such as be leave in such state of disarray just as this government have return stability to the nation economy so will we return common sense and stable leadership to the delivery of the nation infrastructure call the chair of the transport committee also thank the secretary of state for the decisive action she have take to address the cause of cost overrun we look forward to have mark wild and the rail minister at our committee very shortly actually want to celebrate something that leadership should be proud of the work they have do on skill and workforce innovation they have provide good practice work that the construction industry and transport project can learn from and in fact be learn from however urge the secretary of state to get her department to learn from country such as france and spain which have manage to deliver extensive high speed rail project to time and at fraction of the cost of here in the uk thank the chair of the transport committee for her comment she be right to recognise the excellent work that have do on skill and the workforce we have over people work on this project at the moment and think that have do good work on open up opportunity whether through apprenticeship for the next generation or through the supply chain will heed my hon friend advice about learn from the speed and ease with which other country deliver infrastructure report june vol correction call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the secretary of state for her statement and for advance sight of it what we have hear today be clearly damn indictment of conservative mismanagement connect our large city with high speed rail be mean to help boost economic growth and spread opportunity the original idea high speed rail network connect london to manchester and leeds be clearly the right one but what we have end up with be year of delay and billion of pound of taxpayer money be pour down the drain with no end in sight the litany of error that the secretary of state have outline be truly shocking and show that the conservatives be comatose at the wheel lack of oversight trust and planning have leave we with high speed railway drastically reduce in scale and inflate in price the shocking allegation of fraud by subcontractor be emblematic of the tories lack of oversight and interest in properly safeguard the public interest and public money as we see with the scandal of personal protective equipment procurement during covid we must now make sure that any money lose to fraud be claw back as soon as possible may ask the secretary of state three thing first can she guarantee that if any fraud have take place any money lose will be return to the government and her department as soon as possible and that the police will be provide with the necessary resource to investigate the matter fully secondly the secretary of state have say that the ministerial taskforce set up to provide oversight on have inconsistent attendance from the then transport secretary and chief secretary to the treasury do the secretary of state agree that those right hon member should apologise for those particularly damn lapse thirdly we share the secretary of state confidence in mark wild and mike brown but can she say when she expect to be able to give the house an accurate assessment of the scheme full cost and of when will finally be up and run the hon gentleman raise three fair issue and agree with his assessment that the previous government be not just asleep but comatose at the wheel he ask whether the alleged fraud in the supply chain will be fully investigate and whether money will be return to the taxpayer can assure he that no stone will be leave unturned in get to the bottom of this matter he be also right to highlight the question of poor and inconsistent attendance by individual who hold my role the rail minister role and treasury role it be imperative that politician who have oversight of these infrastructure scheme stay close to the detail of what be happen both through their own official and directly with the executive and non executive leadership of the project that be certainly what intend to do know the rail minister have monthly meeting with the new chief executive we have already hold meeting of the ministerial taskforce and there be another one due soon have have multiple one to one conversation with the leadership team at the hon gentleman ask when will be in position to provide full update on cost and schedule mark wild have tell that he will require until the end of this year to do that full piece of work be not prepared to get ahead of that because that be how we have get into problem previously the hon gentleman can rest assure that as soon as have more information in addition to the six monthly report that provide to parliament will come back to this house this be the late national scandal to arise in our attempt to bring in infrastructure scheme on budget and on time but the taxpayer be not the only victim of the failure of this project so far there be also the people of the north of england be originally scheme intend to help the economy of the north west and yorkshire and those community on the way so there be complete failure there what we will be leave with be an extension to the london underground system and that will not help people in leeds bradford manchester sheffield and elsewhere will the secretary of state consider safeguard the original route so that when we get our infrastructure plan in place we can build something that this country can be proud of gently say to my hon friend that the mayor of the west midlands might have something to say about his great city be see as the end of an extension to the london underground line it be completely right that our two great city birmingham and london be connect with high quality rail service although this be difficult day in expose the state of the project have no doubt that in time it will be railway we can be proud of also say to my hon friend that be aware of forecast capacity constraint between birmingham and manchester and in other part of the country we be invest through thing such as the trans pennine route upgrade in improve connectivity to other great city in the north of england we be determined to ensure that everyone no matter where they live in the country have an excellent public transport system that they can rely upon my constituency have be devastate by roughly mile of and have consistently warn this house during the previous parliament and this through the lens of the miserable experience on the ground in buckinghamshire about the reason for the cost overrun poor governance and everything else that the secretary of state have highlight in her statement today if she must persist with this wrong project with new delay will she give commitment to my constituent and the rest of the county of buckinghamshire on how much long they will have to live in misery as part of building site more importantly will she look urgently at unlock some of the mitigation fund that we be find incredibly hard to access and get spend on the ground that would be of some small tiny comfort to my constituent who be live in misery it be essential that we proceed as quickly as possible with the remain civil engineering work that will have affect the hon member constituent to date if he wish to write to with detail of the problem he have experience with access mitigation fund will raise that for he with the chief executive of the conservatives announce that they be scrap the northern leg of in former railway station sum up their attitude to the railway and send shockwave through the industry include in derby rail city that will be build the train will the transport secretary ensure certainty and timeliness go forward so that the industry can have confidence that we will not see further delay which have already be so damaging for the supply chain my hon friend be right that certainty be critical for the rail supply chain it will be number of month before be in position to confirm with any certainty the schedule and estimate final cost as soon as the new chief executive mark wild have provide that information to and my department will be update the house the secretary of state know that run through my constituency and she will accept that what make my constituent particularly angry about what she have describe be that have pinch every penny in compensate someone unfortunate enough to find themselves in the path of this railway yet waste million elsewhere can she assure we that as part of the reset line drawing or page turn however she describe it she will look at how people be compensate when affect by such major infrastructure project do she accept that it would be sensible to consider how parliament could look again at this project whose budget and timescale have balloon and decide whether we still think it be worthwhile use of taxpayer money the right hon and learn gentleman be right to point out that we have some form as country in seek to gold plate infrastructure project the last government talk about this railway be the fast and the good in the world frankly would like this country to do thing well and properly the point he raise about compensation be one that any government should keep under review while bear in mind the need to provide value for money to the taxpayer can assure he that will make sure on any infrastructure project oversee in this role that the house be appropriately update and that we proceed with transparency on the cost and benefit of the scheme thank the secretary of state for her statement and the candidness with which she have deliver it the village represent in north buckinghamshire be they turweston westbury quainton or north marston know the hon member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith will be familiar with those community have for too long face chaos and disruption from and its contractor news that there will be yet more delay will cause they significant distress will the secretary of state update the house and explain what additional practical support financial or otherwise her department plan to give rural community such as mine over the year ahead think the big reassurance that could give my hon friend be my cast iron commitment to ensure that we proceed as rapidly as possible with the completion of the remain construction work which know will have have an impact on his constituent while can not commit myself to the provision of further compensation from the dispatch box today if they be experience particular problem he should not hesitate to bring they to my attention and that of my department welcome the statement and do not disagree with word of the secretary of state analysis of what have go wrong in the past the public accounts committee which have the honour of chairing have produce eight comprehensive report over the year of this project and there be some common theme throughout those report first the secretary of state department be not in any way blame she because this be what go on in the past do not have the right mix of skill to be able to challenge the assertion of those in ltd project manager engineer people who really know how to build railway secondly as we say in our report publish on february we find that there be considerable disagreement between and the department about the cost of the railway the high estimate be the top range of which be billion in price and more than billion in today price and think we need an assurance fairly soon about what it be go to cost thirdly be not at all surprised that the secretary of state have have to delay the completion date but this be the second reset in five year so we really want to see it work think that the people of this country will be very keen to know when her half yearly report be publish and if possible before when the project be likely to be complete thank the hon gentleman and his colleague on the public accounts committee for the work that they have do on this over so many year he be right to highlight the need for skill within the government so that they can act as strong client of we also need to ensure that we have the right commercial acuman in and know that the chief executive officer be work on that must however disappoint the hon gentleman because think it unlikely that in my next report to parliament which believe be due before the summer recess will be able to provide any concrete information about new schedule window and new cost envelope think that the work will take the chief executive towards the end of the year before we be in position to make that information public my constituent know more than most about the daily misery of construction particularly in the village of water orton and kingsbury and the town of coleshill and they will welcome my right hon friend statement meet the new chief executive officer mark wild on monday to discuss the reset and be delighted that he accept my invitation to come to the spud club in water orton and talk to resident there do my right hon friend agree however that it be time we end the failure of oversight the scandalous overspend and the suggest fraud and it be time the dust settle on this project rather than settle on my constituent clean washing clean car and clean window my hon friend have paint graphic picture understand that when large infrastructure work be take place those who live close to they will often experience disruption in their daily life and want to put on record my thank to the resident of kingsbury coleshill and water orton for their patience agree wholeheartedly with my hon friend that we need once and for all to put an end to this cycle of overspend delay and waste and get on and build railway that be fit for the century the disastrous decision by the last conservative government to stop the work at euston station dent investor and commuter confidence in our railway and in major infrastructure delivery their failure to keep cost under control and to manage the basic of the project simple thing such as turn up to meeting have create the quagmire in which find itself today and do not envy the secretary of state the task that confront she be glad to hear that the government see the huge potential of comprehensive redevelopment of euston station but can the secretary of state reassure that we will not end up with cut price station that do not realise the potential of the project can give the hon gentleman that assurance this be once in generation opportunity not only to re provide the exist euston station which be sure will frustrate many member and their constituent at time but to provide the new station there and to unlock land around it that will enable new home to be deliver but be also massive commercial opportunity for regeneration in the heart of london it be very exciting opportunity one that we will be say more about in the come week delay to have blight part of west london around the main site at old oak common benefit when they finally arrive will include major interchange with great western railway and the elizabeth line will the secretary of state consider open the elizabeth line station at old oak common as soon as be feasible rather than wait for to begin operate and will she reclaim some of the good will of the people of west london by direct tiny fraction of the cost of to the repair of hammersmith bridge my hon friend have ask about the possibility of open an elizabeth line station at old oak common before the opening of the station will certainly speak to the rail minister in the other place and explore what the opportunity might be if may will then write to my hon friend he may have hear the chancellor announce last week during her statement on the spending review that we be open and finance structure fund to enable local authority with asset that be costly to repair to bid to the government for help with repair dilapidated bridge tunnel and so on will say more in due course about how the fund will operate and be sure that we will be talk about hammersmith bridge again as we have for many year thank the secretary of state for the clarity of her statement vast swathe of staffordshire be currently own by third of the village of hopton be under ownership and this have an enormous impact on farmer and people who live along the route where so many empty house sit can the secretary of state reassure my constituent that that farmland and those house will be return to the farmer and to the people who actually want to live in those community will be say more about the safeguard land and the direction that apply to it in due course thank the secretary of state for the action that she have take today they be clearly necessary and it sound like we be on well track however provide little or nothing for rail user in the south west other than ongoing delay during the construction and operation of old oak common will the secretary of state consider funding or prioritise the funding for the critical final phase of the dawlish rail resilience work that will help business and rail user in devon and cornwall and perhaps even in swindon the hon gentleman tempt to talk about the dawlish scheme must admit that it be topic will need to take up with the rail minister and will be happy to give the hon gentleman response in writing in respect of the merit of the scheme be grateful to my right hon friend for her honesty as she set out this late reset necessitate by the mess that the tories leave old oak common be part of my constituency and this week eight association across two borough have band together to create the old oak alliance with the purpose of fighting for compensation and mitigation in the current circumstance they will be bitterly disappoint by the news of even more prolonged disruption will my right hon friend meet or well still come on site visit to meet they and see what they be put up with we be deal with company whose idea of engagement be jam tomorrow and death by powerpoint be sure the leadership of would be very concerned to hear that description of the way that the project be engage with local people that be not what expect of an infrastructure company and be sure it be not what the chief executive of ltd would want either would be very happy to meet my hon friend the previous government cancel phase of and from what the secretary of state have say today my understanding be that it remain cancel and that phase will not be reinstate that be the case can she let know when the safeguarding of land particularly in the mid cheshire section will be lift be afraid can not give the right hon lady date today but can assure she that be fully cognisant of this issue we need to look at whether there be any requirement for any future scheme as soon as we be in position to provide update will come back to this house and be sure to provide hon member will all the relevant information the line run down the west side of aylesbury it will bring no benefit at all to my constituency yet my resident have suffer year of noise disruption flooding loss of access to the countryside and the destruction of their natural environment as result of its construction be pleased that the government be get grip on this issue and commend the secretary of state for her honesty and focus but my constituent will understandably be concern by the news of further delay and potential further disruption can the secretary of state confirm that she will do everything in her power to hold and its contractor to account in order to minimise the ongoing disruption for my long suffer resident can assure my hon friend that we be determined to see the main work civil engineering contract complete as soon as possible that be the element of construction that generally create most disturbance for local community and we be pretty much at peak construction now thank her constituent for their patience while we continue to deliver this vital new piece of rail infrastructure have campaign against this project ever since up and down the line never believe the original billion price tag furthermore it would have benefit only rich businessman and drive business from the north of england to london it would have have the opposite of the intended effect rather than have another reset have the moment not come to recognise that this be failure let we scrap use the ten of billion of pound that we can save in the next decade to upgrade railway line across the entirety of the united kingdom to the benefit of many million and spend the rest on other national priority in these financially straiten time surely the time have come to scrap the entirety of the project and to recognise that we have get it wrong we be not go to be country that spend over billion on rail infrastructure but then never see train run on it we have already see too much waste and be interested to hear that the hon gentleman be advocate more we also have significant capacity constraint between birmingham and london he seem not to want to do anything about that but think those two great city deserve railway that be fit for the century be just sorry that he do not my constituency be the only one in the country that have phase phase and phase it be not true to say that the line will not continue north of birmingham because it will cut through mile of staffordshire through my constituency until it rejoin the main line at handsacre the failing of ltd have be clear to my constituent for year and frankly it be shocking to hear about the dereliction of oversight by the previous government although it be what we have always suspect people across lichfield burntwood and the village will quite rightly be furious farmer landowner and business in my constituency have be fight tooth and nail with for year to get it to do the job right we have see compulsory purchase that have never be pay temporary possession that come with multitude of exchange back and forth and back and forth again with land agent take massive fee for thing that should have be sort year ago crop loss payment that never come and many many more issue people in streethay have have to deal with ongoing roadwork around junction that have become far too overcomplicate by try to put railway underneath it and that have see the village almost cut off at time people be absolutely sick of the failing of that organisation be multitudinous and the failing of the conservatives to fully hold it to account should be an embarrassment to they and an embarrassment to this country really do welcome reset but it have to lead to meaningful change can the secretary of state give and my constituent any assurance that it will be deliver as quickly as it possibly can be and with as little disruption as we can get away with can she finally give we timeline for when the safeguard land will be return to landowner this have be go on for far too long share my hon friend anger he be powerful advocate for his constituent who have endure disruption and agree entirely that the way this project be handle be dereliction of duty on the part of the previous government that be why we have appoint new leadership why we be accept all the recommendation of the james stewart review and why we be go through this fundamental reset as soon as have receive advice from the new chief executive about the revise cost and schedule will update my hon friend and other hon member as south west region mp do the secretary of state agree that the west country have for decade be the poor country cousin of our rail network and that money spend on be money not spend elsewhere will she do all in her power to ensure that the relatively small change that be necessary on the network in the south west to make life lot easy go ahead and will she look particularly at the absolutely woeful west of england line there be challenge across the rail network and readily accept that improvement be need in many part of the country do not necessarily accept that the south west be the poor cousin of the rail network but can assure the right hon gentleman of my determination to make sure that everyone no matter where they live in this country have well rail service at the end of this parliament than they do at the beginning of it the transport secretary will know that my constituent have endure year of disruption and of draw out and poorly manage roadwork as they drive past lichfield on the give that billion of pound be squander by the previous government and the disruption continue can she say more about how she will get grip on this project to ensure that we have vigorous oversight and that it be deliver effectively and on time for our constituent we have appoint new leadership we be establish new governance we be look at the incentive contain in the contract on the civil engineering work we will make sure that no stone be leave unturned in provide value for money for the taxpayer on because this country be make very significant investment and we need to ensure that every penny be wisely spend the cost of have now spiral to over billion welsh taxpayer be pay dearly for this appalling mess even though we get no benefit whatsoever wales be now owe at least billion this be not go to go away so when will we get our fair share the right hon lady may have hear the chancellor announce in the spending review over million of investment in the welsh railway over year that will enable work to take place on the burns station in south wales and at padeswood siding on the north wales line it be significant investment in welsh railway the like of which have not be see for many many year as shadow transport secretary for four year be wholly supportive of this concept just want to correct the hon member for clacton nigel farage who completely misunderstand its basis as be sure the secretary of state agree the purpose be to deliver capacity for the north of be misnomer but that opportunity have now be lose can she give some assurance that through the trans pennine upgrade skill and expertise will be roll out across the entire north of england not just to the north west and yorkshire but to the north east include through the continue roll programme of electrification be think specifically of the stretch from northallerton to middlesbrough and beyond because that be where we get the gross value add and the economic growth from can we have some assurance that those ambition will not be fetter one jot by this damn indictment of the past year of failure can assure my hon friend that the government recognise the need to improve rail connectivity in the midland and the north he be also right to highlight the need for stable pipeline of investment so that the supply chain can plan and so that we do not lose skill the government have an ambitious rail programme there be east west rail the trans pennine route upgrade and be determined to build on this country proud railway heritage and ensure that we have railway fit for the modern day the devon and cornwall rail network be only one severe storm away from be decapitate at dawlish phase of the south west rail resilience network be desperately need when will the minister visit the line to see how desperately need it be dawlish be very beautiful part of the country so be very tempt to take the hon gentleman up on his invitation this be the second time in this statement that the dawlish programme have be raise give the hon member for newton abbot martin wrigley an undertaking that would speak to the rail minister on that subject and then write to he will come back to the hon member for torbay steve darling in write at the same time thank the secretary of state for her statement have be an abject failure when it come to the political accountability of the previous administration on transport efficiency will she press on with reform to the driver and vehicle standards agency so that we can fix the drive test system and keep our country move we have really important programme of work across all arm length body of the department for transport include the dvsa it be really important that we provide public service in an efficient and effective way be conscious that my hon friend constituent and other may be very keen for rapid progress on drive test wait time can assure he that the issue be focus of discussion that be have with the dvsa welcome the secretary of state statement too serve on the public accounts committee so know that while be by far the large civil infrastructure programme in the united kingdom the second large be the low thames cross from tilbury to gravesend for which about billion be currently budget if her tight approach to produce saving be there any way that some of they might be vire to pay for the low thames crossing if not exactly which private sector company will pay for it so far be afraid the government have be rather vague on that point we be explore finance option for the low thames crossing on monday we announce that there would be million of public funding this year to take forward utility work and some land purchase will say more to this house in future about the private finance arrangement that we be explore commend my right hon friend for the swift action she have take to try to put right this disastrous situation create by the previous government the parallel with the fast track contract for personal protective equipment can not be ignore understand that contract be sign when appropriate decision have not be make will the people who sign those contract be interview will they have to explain why they decide to take those decision against advice will we get any of that money back as say in my statement the prime minister have ask the cabinet secretary to investigate whether the james stewart report raise any question for the civil service or the wide public sector my hon friend be completely right to highlight the point about contract be sign with construction company even before the scope of the work have be agree it be little wonder that the country have end up pay more we sign contract with company to deliver work yet there be no clarity whatever about what work the government want they to do this be dreadful and woeful failure of oversight by previous government ministers and will not allow that to happen on my watch before be elect to this place be member of independent panel for the community and environment fund and business and local economy fund the secretary of state statement make for pretty shocking reading there be talk of fraud and shambolic mismanagement thing that should bring shame on everybody involve one of the problem with be always the name which put the focus on speed rather than capacity my hazel grove constituent use the west coast main line and they talk to about the capacity problem that remain indeed see they every week when come up and down to work the secretary of state say that she be not reinstate the line north of birmingham she also say that trans pennine work be under way what specific work be be undertake by her department on capacity on the west coast main line north of birmingham be aware that the mayor of the west midlands and the mayor of greater manchester have put proposal to the government on this issue in the we be likely to see severe capacity constraint between birmingham and manchester we be review those proposal and hope to be able to say more on they in the month ahead thank the secretary of state for the honesty with which she have address these very difficult issue may ask she to say little more about the lesson that can be learn from the success of the elizabeth line both the far superior leadership and management of the programme and the economic benefit generate the billion invest in capital yield billion in benefit in just the first three year of this amazing piece of infrastructure while the delivery of the elizabeth line be one of my proud achievement as deputy mayor for transport in london must admit that it be not without its challenge the trust between transport for london and the delivery project and the transparency and honesty between different part of the system be among the fine aspect of how we get the project over the line it be one of my proud day when her majesty queen elizabeth open the elizabeth line at paddington shortly before she pass away there be lot of learn that we need to take from crossrail we be do that and we be determined to get on and see this railway open east west rail be due to travel through my constituency on the historic marston vale line how will the secretary of state ensure that the mistake make on we have hear some shocking story today will not also be make on east west rail be afraid that there be very little confidence in the east west rail company it be important that my community be listen to that we deliver this infrastructure fast and at low cost and that people who be impact be properly compensate east west rail be fundamentally different from the construction of the hon gentleman will know that it be be deliver in three phase and that it be only the latter phase between bedford and cambridge that will necessitate the construction of new track the chief executive of east west rail david hughes be determined to deliver the scheme rapidly offer good value for money to the taxpayer and properly engage with community if there be any particular issue the hon gentleman be concerned about he should raise they with and will gladly speak with the leadership there on the public accounts committee ask boss what think be relatively simple question how much be they spend on newt mitigation however they could not give an answer similarly can confirm to the house that have information suggest that the cost of the so call bat tunnel be well north of the purport million commend the secretary of state for the leadership that she have show today will she hold accountable for some of these bat shed crazy cost can assure my hon friend that the estimate cost of the bat structure be million in price agree that we can not have an environmental mitigation regime that allow this sort of thing to happen the government have put forward significant reform in this space and we will continue to monitor the need for further change so that we can deliver infrastructure in well way thank the secretary of state for give candid and transparent statement to this house on birmingham be the only birmingham mp present which surprise it be disappointing that there will be delay and additional cost but every cloud have silver lining my constituency have one of the high level of unemployment at time the national average in addition we have see the closure of number of local station it would improve the network if they be reopen will the secretary of state meet to discuss how we can get my constituent into job and the possibility of open three station handsworth wood soho road and city health campus would be very happy to ask the rail minister to meet the hon gentleman to talk about the station in birmingham that he mention welcome the statement from the secretary of state may speak today of the east of england the right hon member for richmond and northallerton rishi sunak famously promise dividend when he cancel north so might we expect some of that to be use to replace the crucial haughley and ely junction in order to finally sort out the rail connection in the east of england understand the importance of the ely area scheme in term of rail infrastructure and hope to say more about rail investment in the week before the summer recess will the secretary of state set out the step she be take to ensure that infrastructure like the million bat tunnel will not be include in future project such as east west rail can tell the hon gentleman that the planning and infrastructure bill include proposal to reform specie and habitat protection the proposal for environmental delivery plan and the nature restoration fund enable shift to protect the whole population of specie rather than focus on purely local consideration that will ensure well outcome for nature without cause we to incur unreasonable cost as happen with the bat mitigation structure thank the secretary of state for her answer to my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart on capacity on the west coast main line stockport be the one place where it be at full capacity and be mean to solve that however because of the cancellation of the northern leg of we face train go through stockport already pack line welcome the response to the plan put forward by the mayors of the west midlands and greater manchester but will the secretary of state commit to engage with stockport council on those plan we need to find solution to this capacity issue because it could hold my borough back for decade be very conscious of the need to invest in and improve public transport in stockport and if the council would like to write to with any relevant information will gladly consider it also point out that our investment in transport for city region announce couple of week be good news for stockport metrolink will be extend to the town hope the hon gentleman will welcome that as good news for his constituent it may surprise the secretary of state but actually have some sympathy for she for inherit the nightmare when she receive the update budget and timeframe will there be cost and timeline at which point she will say enough be enough it well to stop or be it an open end cheque book if the hon gentleman have bother to read the spending review last week he would have see that the government have commit billion over the next four year which enable work to be take forward as have say number of time today will be update the house when have further information available about both the overall cost envelope the estimate final cost at completion and the anticipated schedule with decade of delay cost spiral to eye watering sum of anywhere between billion and billion and now credible allegation of fraud in the supply chain will the secretary of state say what step the government will take to recover hard work taxpayer money from fraudster hold those responsible to account and announce final stop to waste money have say on number of occasion that billion of pound of taxpayer money have be waste by constant scope change ineffective contract and bad management that be what this reset of be all about it be why we have appoint the new leadership and it be why we be fundamentally change the governance structure as say in answer to previous question the matter of potential fraud in the supply chain be be investigate by hmrc and we will be provide update to the house as and when further information be available point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker wish to once again raise the case of alaa abd el fattah the british egyptian citizen who be still imprison in egypt his mother have be on hunger strike for long time now she be in st thomas hospital and her health be deteriorate ask those on the treasury bench now to take message back to the prime minister that we need to do everything we possibly can to secure alaa release because fear that we may well lose his mother laila soueif one initiative that could be try again be joint approach between our prime minister and president macron to president sisi to urge alaa release think we be in dangerous moment the government have undertake number of action the prime minister commit to do all in his power and he have approach president sisi however just feel we need to make at least another last attempt both to secure the release of alaa and to secure the life of his mother thank the right hon gentleman for his point of order and for notice of it he have put his point on the record and be sure his concern will have be hear by those on the treasury bench bill

the proportion of qualifying tenant require to give notice of claim to acquire right to manage to establish duty on freeholder to assist right to manage company in establish contact with leaseholder within the freeholder property to make provision about establish presumption in favour of right to manage in certain circumstance before the first tier tribunal to require the secretary of state to review procedure for convert leasehold property into commonhold property and for connected purpose rise to speak on topic that matter dearly to all of we in this house accountability and representation as legislator our job be to hold legislation to account and ensure that it represent our constituent interest it be the role of our constituent in turn to hold we to account whenever election arise would like to thank my constituent for join we in the gallery today accountability be at the heart of our consumer relationship with standard and competition embed into commercial law it be also key part of our social contract when someone in position of power do wrong there need to be system of recourse when it come to housing however this too often go out the window frequently there be stark gap between those who provide our housing and those who live in it alongside an accountability deficit whether in private renting social housing or the sector that the bill seek to remedy leasehold my constituency have the high proportion of leaseholder in the country for too long they have have to endure system that leave they without full control over their home and at the mercy of wide range of bad actor be proud to be elect on manifesto that promise to ban the sale of new leasehold property and make commonhold the default tenure across the land since the election the government have act with speed in this area inherit rush piece of legislation from their predecessor and untangle it with speed set out our plan for reform publish white paper on commonhold and expedite move that include the recent reform to the right to manage those action have already have positive impact in the cities of london and westminster constituent have write to say that they submit right to manage application on march as the government change allow they to do so join they in thank this government for act so quickly in this area and look forward with interest to the publication of the leasehold and commonhold reform bill later this year one of the most visible consequence of the leasehold system be the scourge of unscrupulous manage agent for the past six month my hon friend the member for hendon david pinto duschinsky and have be co ordinate action as co chair of labour for leasehold which be an alliance of labour party colleague against some of the worst perform actor in this sector many of the members support this bill have be tirelessly advocate in this campaign for leaseholder in their constituency and nationwide and pay tribute to that work in the course of our work we have hear story of resident suffer at the hand of manage agent as they fail to conduct essential repair engage in threaten and abusive behaviour towards resident and even run off with hundred of thousand of pound of leaseholder money all while provide little justification for their service or the high fee that they charge in this process have also meet the most dedicated leaseholder organiser who have collect testimony from thousand of neighbour to highlight poor practice accountant who have volunteer their time to scrutinise invoice and auditing process and lawyer who have provide free advice to other building go through the first tier tribunal however without legal system that support they the leaseholder remain unable to seek the accountability that they deserve from distant and disinterested manage agent these leaseholder include my constituent in neville house share owner who pay year in service charge for service that have not be deliver for year with report of mould be ignore for month and who be stick between their social landlord manage agent and freeholder in complex cladding case they include the resident of sheldon square who have have manage agent ignore sewage leak into their flat have be bill for damage cause by contractor to their building and have receive threaten letter post to individual leaseholder in flagrant breach of datum protection these leaseholder also include the resident of oxford and cambridge mansions whose manage agent and freeholder have ignore report of gross misconduct against building staff fail to take action on leak persist for year and ignore report of damp and mould emerge from flat that they themselves own and be use as storage room all while complex major work loom with an opaque tendering process that may cost resident million ultimately the situation amount to one of accountability and representation in most case manage agent do not feel need to represent leaseholder interest and the only accountability they have be to the building freeholder who far too often take little interest in resident welfare there be some way out of this situation and one be by acquire the right to manage that involve form right to manage association recruit half of the flat in block to join and submit an application to the landlord who can then accept it or drag leaseholder through the first tier tribunal there be multiple loophole and hurdle obstruct leaseholder from achieve even this basic step property can not have over certain percentage of square footage of commercial space and sometimes even flowerbed or communal car park get include in that even when large number of resident be in favour of get the right to manage and no one in the building be opposed hit the threshold can be difficult this be due to number of reason from owner who do not reside in their property to freeholder who retain large number of flat in the building to let out privately or as mention previously to use as storage room this bill would go some way to rectify this hurdle first it would lower the threshold require for successful right to manage application from of qualifying leaseholder to as many campaigner have point out this alone be not enough that be why the bill redefine qualify tenant during right to manage application as tenant who respond either positively or negatively when ask to vote put simply it change the threshold for right to manage claim from can you find majority of the flat owner in your building to do enough of the actual leaseholder in your block want this to go ahead the bill address number of other issue too most notably it establish duty for freeholder to assist the right to manage company when it contact their fellow leaseholder and it establish presumption in favour of leaseholder on occasion when freeholder counter claim at the first tier tribunal this bill do not go all the way to fix the right to manage and number of obstacle would remain particularly in mixed use development there be no quick fix to the right to manage commonhold or any other reform manage block of flat will always remain challenging and will lead to difficult debate within building as to how to manage complex and expensive work what matter be that the company who manage the building be accountable and represent fairly the people who live in the building through reinvigorate the right to manage we can achieve this leaseholder across the country be ready to take this step to hold their manage agent to account all they need be for the law to be on their side

act where the offence occur before may be proud to have stand on manifesto pledge to halve violence against woman and girl in decade and know that colleague on the front bench take that extremely seriously there be significant measure in this bill on intimate image abuse stalk spike and the sexual exploitation of child know they mark only the beginning of the government mission to tackle those shameful crime as national inquiry into child sexual exploitation perpetrate by groom gang rightly get under way we must now also confront the adult sexual exploitation be perpetrate on an industrial scale by pimp website and man who pay for sex both of which currently enjoy near total legal impunity law against the commercial sexual exploitation of adult in this country be outdated unjust and totally ineffective in fact our current legal framework create conducive context for commercial sexual exploitation failing that overwhelmingly affect woman pimp website which function as massive online brothel operate openly and freely supercharge the sex trafficking trade by make it easy and quick for exploiter to advertise their victim those online mega brothel make million of pound every year by advertise thousand of vulnerable woman from across the world for prostitution in the uk sadly our legislation allow that man who pay for sex so often leave out of conversation on prostitution and sex trafficking but who be the beat heart of such brutal trade abuse with impunity their demand and their money drive the sex trafficking trade yet we do very little to deter they let we therefore start that process today by make it crystal clear as parliament that it be not possible to buy sexual consent give someone money accommodation good or service in exchange for sex act be sexual exploitation and abuse it be never acceptable commend the hon lady and her party for bring this legislation forward she be probably well aware that we in northern ireland through lord morrow and the assembly sometime back bring in specific legislation on this for the first time in the united kingdom have she have an opportunity to look at that legislative change we have at stormont what she bring forward be even well than what we have originally try to get at the assembly do she feel in all honesty that woman will be protect from sexual exploitation as she have clearly say that they should the hon member be right to say that there be excellent practice in northern ireland and the northern ireland affairs committee which chair be look at that he may be interested in that why should we implement this model for sex work when the evidence from the republic of ireland and northern ireland show that it have increase violence towards sex worker my hon friend and obviously do not look at this through the same lens for it be prostitution and not sex work and we need to see some more example of that be use we currently have situation where sex buyer enjoy near total impunity while the vulnerable woman they exploit can face criminal sanction if they solicit on the street the state hand out fine to woman in self defeat effort to stop they solicit on the street ignore the question of where those woman be most likely to earn the money to pay their fine sanction victim of sexual exploitation be counterproductive and barrier to seek help and exit this ruthless trade that be why have table amendment new clause and new clause would make it criminal offence to enable or profit from the prostitution of another person online and offline thereby outlaw dangerous pimp website that be fuel demand and facilitate sex trafficking new clause and would together shift the burden of criminality off victim of sexual exploitation and on to perpetrator new clause would make it criminal offence to pay for sex send clear message to boy that that be not an acceptable way to treat woman and an equally clear message to man who be consider pay for sex that they face prosecution we know from research with uk sex buyer that this would be an effective deterrent over half of sex buyer question in one study say that they would definitely probably or possibly change their behaviour if law be introduce that make it crime to pay for sex new clause would repeal sanction against victim of sexual exploitation who solicit on the street to remove that barrier to woman exit prostitution and rebuild their life it be also widely agree that the expunging of criminal record of section offence be necessary to end the unjust stigmatisation that these woman continue to experience that be why have also table new clause to introduce such mechanism the home affairs committee have recommend that the home office change exist legislation so that soliciting be no long an offence and legislate for the deletion of previous conviction and caution for prostitution from the record of sex worker by amend the rehabilitation of offenders act for most of these woman their record of conviction be record of their exploitation and abuse and they live in fear of have to disclose that history when apply for job or volunteering decriminalising section offence and allow for the expunging of those historical conviction would allow those woman to finally be free of the record of their abuse and the stigma they have endure for decade my amendment would usher in legal framework that recognise that prostitution be violence against woman and the only way to end this violence be to deter the perpetrator and profiteer be delighted then that more than hon member have sign new clause to particularly thank member of the all party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation which chair for their support the amendment be inform and support by survivor and good practice frontline support service such as nia kairos women work together and note that unsurprisingly some of my proposal be hat by pimp website one of which vivastreet email its ally urge they to mobilise against my amendment recent sky news investigation find that over half of the prostitution advert on vivastreet display phone number link to another advert on the site which be key red flag for organise sexual exploitation therefore find it reassure that those prostitution pedlar be unnerved by my proposal want to address myth promote by defender of pimp website that shut down these site will make no difference to the scale of sexual exploitation take place and will instead simply drive it all into the dark web and make it hard to identify that be patently nonsense lack in logic and evidence the dark web carry major disadvantage for both trafficker and sex buyer it would require significant technical expertise to post as well as locate and access prostitution advert on the dark web thereby substantially restrict the pool of exploiter able to engage in this crime there be also no evidence that such shift have take place in jurisdiction that have outlaw pimp website the reality be that police simply can not keep up with the scale of sexual exploitation take place via pimp website on the open web another myth want to address be all too visible in the write submission oppose my amendment submit to the public bill committee every single one of the organisation who argue that pimp website should be allow to operate describe prostitution as work as sex work the idea that pay someone to perform sex act be an ordinary consumer activity that order woman online to perform blow job be the equivalent of order cappuccino be pernicious and harmful myth prostitution be violence against woman let we legislate to put pimp and trafficker out of business we must protect individual from exploitation today but also address the historical criminalisation of victim and abuse thank member on the front bench for their engagement on this issue and look forward to work with they very closely rise to speak to new clause and in my name new clause in the name of the hon member for tunbridge wells mike martin and new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for gosport dame caroline dinenage new clause seek to commence the sex base harassment in public act which be take through the house as private member bill by greg clark the predecessor of the hon member for tunbridge wells greg do great work on this bill be one of its supporter and member of the bill committee speak on second reading third reading and in committee it be simple act which have cross party support it be not in any way controversial piece of legislation it correct an oversight in the law that have be miss out in previous piece of legislation as so often happen private member bill require statutory instrument to commence it and that statutory instrument have not yet be lay in this house be sure the minister be well aware of that and be seek to do so this new clause would allow the act to commence now rather than require that statutory instrument thereby save she little bit of time hope therefore that she might look favourably on it as say this be an act that be support across the house there be no division on it it be very much something that we all want to see so hope that the government accept the new clause and that the hon member for tunbridge wells can follow on in the footstep of his predecessor in make sure that this act of parliament become live and real for the people who need it let turn now to new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for gosport be almost disappointed not to be able to table this new clause myself because it fit with the work that have do previously on these issue be secretary of state for digital culture media and sport when the digital economy act introduce age verification for pornography again new clause be simple piece of legislation which would make non fatal strangulation criminal act if in pornography this do not impact on what people may wish to do in their private life but it do mean that those image would not then be available to be see in pornographic film it also mean that there be protection for child who may be look at this pornography we do not want they to look at it but we be realist and recognise that this happen and that it do not normalise what be really dangerous act which should not be promote in any way know from experience that social medium company will remove content if it be illegal they will not remove it if it be not therefore this simple change would mean that the depiction of non fatal strangulation would become illegal content and social medium company would therefore be force to act hope that this be something that can be support across the house although understand that we will be push to division this evening do hope that the minister can say something about the government introduce something similar perhaps in the other place so that we can make sure that this inappropriate content be illegal and therefore not available to be see by child let turn now to the new clause in my name wish to start with new clause because my hon friend the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti who have be such champion of this legislation have to go to delegated legislation committee at pm also wish he very happy birthday he be choose to spend his birthday in this chamber and attend dl committee what hero again think that this new clause will have cros party support it concern the removal of parental responsibility for individual convict of sexual offence against child when have talk about this to colleague and ask they to consider support the new clause they have be utterly amazed that anybody convict of sexual offence against child may be allow to have parental responsibility for their own child that responsibility be stop only if the offence be commit against their own child that can not be right how can it be that convict sex offender somebody who have be convict of sexual offence against child be allow to make parental decision about their own child my hon friend constituent have talk about this believe that they be know as bethan in this situation and have be real champion on this issue in this particular case man who be convict of rap relative who be child still have parental responsibility for his own child that can not be acceptable again this feel like piece of legislation where at some point we just fail to address this one issue hope therefore that this can be see as defect in the legislation that we all agree should be correct new clause be relatively simple amendment to the modern slavery act but it reflect phenomenon that we simply do not know about when we introduce the act year ago as the minister on the bill remember go through many definition of what constitute trafficking and exploitation but at the time the phenomenon of orphanage trafficking be simply not know that may be shock to some in this chamber because there be such awareness of the issue in australia and new zealand but we simply do not know about it here what happen be that institution that call themselves orphanage be set up but they be not orphanage when we think of orphanage we think of place where child with no parent be look after because the state do not have any other way of look after they in this country and across the western world we do not want to put child into such institution we want they to be in family base setting we want to make sure that they be foster and that they have the right support orphanage exist around the world but some of they be not orphanage and more than of the child there be not orphan they have be put into these institution which be not register with the authority or anything else simply to raise money the walk free foundation estimate that there be million child globally live in those institution that be horrify when it be put to people that million child over of whom have parent have be take from their parent purely for the purpose of raise money there be utter disbelief how can this possibly be the situation today it be estimate that christian church in the united states give billion per year to institution that be not orphanage they be simply there to raise money imagine be on cruise around south east asia and one of the excursion be to view an orphanage this do happen to friend of mine and to pay money for the privilege of read story to the child how cruel be that this be child who have be put in an institution perhaps their family believe that they be put there for well life for an education do not necessarily blame the family but these child be there simply to raise money busload of tourist kind western people turn up and sit down to read story to these child and then give money these poor child be leave they do not have any further contact with these people gap year student can be involve they may have decide to spend bit of their gap year work in one of these institution which be in south america africa or south east asia across the world those young people be do what they believe be the right thing voluntourism think it be call but they be be exploit these child be there simply to raise money my amendment would add one further definition into section of the modern slavery act it would add orphanage trafficking to the definition of modern slavery exploitation it would just mean that we in our legislation would reflect orphanage trafficking within the law there be more that we need to do but this be simple first step to make sure that it be recognise that would mean that first we would be raise awareness of the matter but secondly individual and organisation that wish to give money to these orphanage would potentially be in breach of the modern slavery act and step could be take against they would not wish to criminalise anybody who want to do the right thing for people but it be important that we pass this measure we would also be only the second country in the world to take such action because the only other country that have legislate on this be australia pay tribute here to linda reynolds think that she have just stop be senator who take up this issue she be an incredible woman she take up the issue and have go around the world with it she force legislative change in australia and have take it up with the inter parliamentary union which as result have issue lawmaker guide to stop orphanage trafficking and pass motion and resolution to raise awareness linda reynolds be the hero on this issue she go to one of those orphanage and walk away say this be not right this do not feel like an authentic place these child do seem to be be look after this be not something want to support understand that this new clause will not be select for separate decision but ask the minister when sum up to reflect on step that the government may take and whether they might consider bring this measure back in the other place will introduce private member bills on it and continue try to amend legislation hope that at some point the government will be able to get the collective responsibility agreement they need so that we can reflect this heinous crime in our legislation appreciate be call to speak madam deputy speaker also really appreciate be able to follow in the wake of my two friend my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi and the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley who have be incredible campaigner on these issue know from first hand experience of meet the victim and survivor they speak about that there be gap hole in our legislation hope that the house will support their amendment because that would do something to close they rise to speak first about my new clause and which seek to well protect child victim of sexual and criminal exploitation and empower our frontline responder to keep they safe welcome the government introduction of the mandatory duty to report which be recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual exploitation as it have the potential to strengthen our child protection system however follow detailed conversation and meeting with rotherham and sheffield nhs safeguarding staff share their concern about the fine detail of its implementation to put it bluntly the duty will not protect child as intend unless mandate reporter be adequately train recognise report and crucially respond to child sexual abuse be far from straightforward so to prevent overwhelming an already strained system all those under the duty must be train to know what to look for and how to report it let give an example nursery nurse might see bruise around the genital area of toddler and with the fear put it that way of her duty on mandatory reporting she will report it to the hotline or directly to the nhs safeguarding team which be absolutely the right thing to do however toddler fall over and they fall in awkward place so that nursery worker need to have the skill and experience to be able to know when it be appropriate to report and when it be not appropriate along with what evidence to gather and what not to at the moment be scared that everything will be report and that the system which be there to protect and safeguard those child will be unable to cope hope that standard training package will be give to all people who fall under the duty will now turn to new clause and on child criminal exploitation which know the safeguarding minister my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips be very familiar with have campaign on this with she for many year in previous parliaments as baroness casey report state right now criminally exploit child be at risk of prosecution rather than protection these new clause seek to change that they have the backing of action for children ecpat uk barnardo and many other child charity in alone more than child be refer to the national referral mechanism as potential child victim of criminal exploitation but many more end up in courtroom not safeguard system as my police chief say to it be deeply sad that the first time we see these criminally exploit child be when we be look to criminalise they we can not get above this and ahead of it clause rightly create new offence of cce recognise the severity of that abuse however without correspond change to the modern slavery act legal protection remain inconsistent and inadequate new clause seek to fix that in similar vein new clause would insert definition of child criminal exploitation alongside the offence in clause evidence from the jay review into criminal exploitation of child demonstrate that the current lack of definition contribute to significant inconsistency in practice across the country and persistent failure to identify child as victim see that time and again in rotherham with young exploit girl all too often refer to as child prostitute and not give the support they need the shift start only after we get the statutory definition for child sexual exploitation clear consistent legislation empower professional to intervene early prevent inappropriate prosecution and ensure that exploit child receive the safeguarding support that they need turn to my amendment on register sex offender which be support by mp from across the party it will not be new to many in the house as have bring it up in the last three parliaments between and sex offender be prosecute for failure to notify change of information the same ongoing pattern allow offender to slip through the crack with over go completely miss in those year welcome the new measure in the bill that require some offender to seek police authorisation before apply to change their name on uk passport and drive licence which will genuinely make difference however remain deeply concerned that many of the new measure lack strength and could lead to confusion clause state that sex offender must give seven day notice of use new name but do not define what use mean the amendment seek to provide much need clarity it would require offender to notify the police of an intention to change their name seven day before do so by deed poll that would allow vital time for the authority to conduct appropriate risk assessment more than that want to draw attention to the fact that the bill still rely too heavily on sex offender do the right thing which be something they rarely do finally will speak to my new clause and in my capacity as chair of the international development committee last week my committee publish its report on international humanitarian law it be vital that those responsible for attack on aid worker and unlawful blockage of humanitarian assistance be bring to justice throughout the inquiry it become apparent that the uk need power to exercise universal jurisdiction over crime of genocide crime against humanity and war crime there must be no safe haven for those who commit such heinous crime my new clause would allow the relevant authority to prosecute people suspect of those crime without any requirement for connection to the uk at time when the legitimacy and impartiality of some international court be be question the uk must stand firm in support of these important mechanism for accountability to prevent impunity for serious violation of international humanitarian law while ensure that we have the domestic power need to hold perpetrator to account no matter where their crime be committed rise to speak to new clause which stand in my name and be support by hon friend in different political position across the house but before do so want to congratulate the government that be unusual from the opposition but will do so anyway think that the minister will know what be about to say the cuckooing amendment which be move in the last parliament the previous government and she in particular be in discussion on that have be passporte through as it be so that cuckooing will be criminal offence that will hugely help those who have their house take over the vulnerable and the elderly and where crime be commit from those house the police will have reason to go in without explicit knowledge of the crime be commit other than the cuckooing to that extent thank the government for make that law hopefully it will go through without too much problem in the other place and many other appreciate that enormously new clause be consequential to an amendment to an early bill on reckless and dangerous cycling because there be no offence that be relevant to that and people be be kill and injure as result of cyclist bad behaviour on the road one person in particular who campaign for that amendment be matt briggs and he be the reason that bring that amendment forward the government accept that amendment and it be now bind into legislation however there be an issue at the time about the danger of bike we know from talk to the police that bike be now become responsible for some of the bad crime on the street involve antisocial and threaten behaviour they be silent and they can creep up on people rather quickly and lot of thing that be be snatch by people on motorised scooter be now be snatch use bike shall come back to the question of illegal bike in second but the user of legal bike be as much of problem because they be not include in any relevant legislation that would have allow they to be prosecute by the police for offence such as dangerous or reckless cycling as would normally happen for bicycle user bike be huge and grow problem in there be pedestrian casualty in the uk result from collision with pedal cycle include bike recent datum indicate that there be incident involve bike and scooter in an increase from incident in the previous year while this rise partly reflect the grow number of rider it also highlight concern regard the reckless behaviour of number of those user bike rider be approximately more likely to be involve in accident compare with traditional cyclist and bike accident be nearly twice as likely to cause severe injury and nearly twice as likely to require surgical intervention compare with conventional bicycle accident that be not to mention the illegal bike and the enhanced bike which the minister will know be the cause of even more significant problem we table new clause because it be our impression that the original cycling amendment that be now law do not deal properly with bike however after long debate with the department for transport and heavy look through some of the legislation that already exist have finally agree that the definition under the cycling element of the original amendment which be accept by the government incorporate bike have similar concern about mobility scooter obviously they be fabulous tool enable so many in our constituency to get out and about but the number of serious injury cause by mobility scooter have go up by nearly in the last year and the number of fatality have double these heavy class mobility scooter which can go up to mph and travel on the road be not subject to insurance rule and can not be penalise under dangerous driving regulation do my right hon friend agree that this be something the government also need to consider very carefully would really love the minister to look at whether there be any legislation that would be implementable in case such as these my hon friend be right and hope the government will respond to that however she will forgive if focus on the essence of new clause which be bike the definition of legal bike be one that use pedal and also use electricity to assist the cyclist all the other one be illegal this bring to the problem that if this measure be go to go through into law as it will will the government press the police to start arrest and prosecute not only the people who deliberately use bike for nefarious purpose but more importantly those who just cycle dangerously on footpath bike be now more dangerous than bicycle in the sense that they be bicycle and therefore get up to high speed even though the speed be suppose to be govern they be still high than most cyclist will get up to in the normal act of pedal their way to work my right hon friend and have discussion about this early on the subject of illegal bike do he agree that we need to clamp down on the illegal conversion kit that be readily accessible online which allow an ordinary bicycle to be convert to do anything up to or mph table write question about that and the government say that it be for the office for product safety and standards and local authority trading standard to enforce that but could the government do more to crack down on it it be funny that my hon friend raise that point because be just about to get on to it be glad he have pinch my speech but we be on the same side so let thank he for get ahead of reinforce that point the government now need to decide whether to do something about that issue in the other place all non bicycle electricity support cycle be legal but all the other be either illegal or have to be use on the road and therefore have to qualify for road use which mean in many case take instruction and pass test or treat the bike like car or motorcycle the problem be that most people do not know that they be either ignorant of it or they deliberately do not care and they can buy these illegal bike in lot of legal shop in the uk it seem bizarre that we be allow people to buy these bike many be not bike they could be board or all sort of contraption and they then think they be able to use they most people do not check up on the highway code or the law they just get on and use they they be deeply dangerous to themselves but also to other road user would press the government to look at this again in the other place it be too late to do it here to see whether there be some way in which sell these thing to people without proper licence could be make illegal have listen to the right hon gentleman speech with genuine interest this be not party political point at all be there perhaps work that could be do on public information campaign to make people aware of these bike as he have just say many people do not realise that they be illegal if they can buy they in legal shop they do not realise that they be do anything wrong in the first place do he agree that public campaign like that would be welcome be all in favour of public campaign and agree with the hon gentleman that it would be very good idea for people to know that what they be buy be illegal suspect many of they already do so that notwithstanding if such campaign could be back up by penalty for sell illegal bike in shop that would be far well way of deal with it right now lot of kid do not know that the bike be illegal and they go and take these thing and they can pay for they and that be where the danger come from we be shut the door too late these kid have go on to the road they have create an accident and they have kill themselves that be too late for we what we need to do be get ahead of this and try to figure it out completely the final bit of this issue be the fact that people can change the monitor inside the box even on the legal bike and lot of they do so we see they go down the road at mph which be incredibly dangerous be motorcyclist have to say but member should not go look for the leather jacket leave it at home oh no do get excited it not that great motorcyclist have to be test even more than car driver there be balance test and they have to know everything like that this be absolutely critical because it be slightly more dangerous mode of transport more exciting yes but more dangerous someone can not buy motorcycle in shop and take it away unless they be able to show their licence and that they be qualified to ride that bike and that really require instruction but people can buy bike these electric vehicle without any sort of licence it seem bizarre that that should be allow even though we want people not to use petrol diesel and all the rest of it because of the environment this go beyond that be the right hon member aware of simon cowell campaign he purchase an electric bike flip over backwards and almost break his back that be definitely clear indication of how dangerous these bike can be these bike often accelerate fast and only someone who be use to rid something that can move quickly on two wheel can do that if not they will go off the back in car they would be restrain by the seat but that be not the case on bike or motorcycle know that do take some instruction be ready lean into it and all the rest of it my main point be that that be good illustration of how we be be bit too casual about these mode of transport and too many young kid do not understand that they should have some training for their sake we should do more on this issue my right hon friend have be generous with take intervention support his amendment and note that his amendment helpfully include scooter because there be real problem as scooter do not meet the criterion in the highways act they be effectively ban when speak to the hard work police in waterlooville they say that scooter be ban in public area we have real problem with illegal usage in public area and in the shopping centre however people do not know that and we need the law to be more proactive deliberate and expressive and that be why an amendment like this be right be there anything he would like to add on the issue of scooter bow before my right hon friend great knowledge in these matter have head up the department simply say that for this particular purpose agree with she be urge the government to take this matter away and look at it in the other place although will not press my amendment because legal bike be incorporate in the early cycling amendment that put forward and the government accept we need more work on illegal bike and scooter my worry as have say again and again be that people can buy these thing without any qualification whatsoever whereas if as motorcyclist buy bike have to be able to demonstrate that be qualified to ride it away from the shop people be not require to do so with bike and scooter so there be peculiarity everywhere else in our legislation we follow through this one have drop through the grid and therefore urge the minister and the department to look closely at the matter and see whether we can define that well in the other place and ensure that shop be unable to sell those bike will not press this new clause because think we be at the right place so far with the government will speak to new clause and in my name new clause and propose restriction on the delivery and display of pointed knife to avoid death and serious injury from knife attack new clause repeal certain unnecessary and unlawful punitive measure direct against roma gypsy and traveller community be grateful for the interest the minister have show in these matter and for meet to discuss they do not intend to press they to vote but look forward to her response as to how they may be progress support many other amendment and new clause to the bill have sign new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson and new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell on set up an economic crime fighting fund of course congratulate my hon friend the member for gower tonia antoniazzi on her new clause which be debate and pass yesterday on second reading express general concern that the necessary and complex legislation affect the criminal justice system set out in the bill and in other bills and report in this session would place an even great strain on an already creak system will not repeat what say then but hope and trust that ministers from the home office and the ministry of justice be work together to ensure that resource be in place to deal with the unintended consequence when supply in one part of the criminal justice system cause demand in another more police number mean more arrest prosecution conviction and incarceration but early release or community alternative to custody can create more work for probation and for the police new clause and would change the sell practice of manufacturer and retailer in the following way first they would prevent the delivery of lethal point knife to domestic premise remote locker and collection point nothing in they would prevent the delivery of pointed knife to chef butcher fishmonger or any other commercial enterprise that use pointed knife in the course of business secondly they would prevent the display of pointed knife in shop but would allow safe rounded knife to be openly display in shop and deliver by courier or mail with minimal restriction there be three key driver of the proposal home office statistic show that two people be kill by kitchen knife every week they also show that in homicide case in which pointed weapon be use over half of those weapon be kitchen knife research from de montfort university show that it be the point of knife that kill safe rounded knife may injure but they do not penetrate clothing let alone artery or vital organ we be approach the one year anniversary of the southport killing the dunblane killing lead to change in the law on the sale of gun southport should be the dunblane moment for knife welcome ronan law and the government amendment to the bill to impose enhanced age verification but those amendment do not go far enough more could and should be do no reputable manufacturer or retailer will be prosecute if these new clause become law indeed they would make it easy for reputable manufacturer and retailer to market and sell rounded kitchen knife any homeowner would still be able to purchase pointed kitchen knife by mail order they would simply have to collect their purchase in store where more effective face to face age verification can take place knife harm be complex issue there be no single simple solution but these new clause would help reduce the harm cause by knife whether by criminal activity accident or self harm support my hon friend new clause in fact when be minister for young citizens and youth engagement we pose this question of whether there should be round knife be glad to see that the debate have move on because at that point people find the idea that this would help solve the knife crime problem almost comical so thank he for pursue this issue when it be people like propose it it be regard as comical but now idris elba be in favour of it as well as expert across the field pay tribute to not just those celebrity but victim and expert particularly those on the safer knife group of which be member it look at the legal medical and psychological effect of knife crime and suggest practical way of not eliminate but reduce the number of death and serious injury new clause seek to repeal draconian police power relate to unauthorised encampment those power be introduce to the criminal justice and public order act by the police crime sentencing and courts act which become law under the previous government these punitive and hostile power lead to the victimisation of romani gypsy and irish travellers who be among the most marginalised group in uk society be clear that traveller and minority group absolutely do have right but they also have responsibility when this law be put in place there be good reason for it to redress some of the imbalance do the hon gentleman agree that repeal this law would leave our community unprotecte against unauthorised traveller encampment in area like mine the police become involved in game of cat and mouse excrement litter and bad be leave in our community would not repeal leave the police with no power to tackle the issue be afraid that be the sort of nonsense that hear lot of the time let read to the right hon lady some of the measure that be in force before the police crime sentencing and courts act be pass temporary stop notice injunction to protect land from unauthorised encampment licensing of caravan site possession order interim possession order local byelaw the local authority power to direct unauthorised camper to leave land address obstruction to the public highway plan contravention notice enforcement notice and retrospective planning stop notice breach of condition notice power of entry on to land power of the police to direct unauthorised camper to leave land and police power to direct trespasser to an alternative site that be the position before that act come into effect there be ample power to deal with these matter rise no will not give way again frankly find the right hon lady last intervention bit beyond the pale so be not give she another opportunity be afraid that the sort of information she peddle lead to the situation that we be in the constant threat of criminalisation of nomadic lifestyle have devastating impact on family that be why human right campaigner and international body include the council of europe and the united nations have raise concern about the legality of the provision that be address the hon member have just paint complex legislative picture do he not agree that there be need for the legislation because all the measure that he have just read out simply be not work the power be there but we must look at their implementation be always sympathetic to the hon gentleman because he be such good opponent for at two election and take to heart the measured way in which he put his point but to counter what he say in may follow judicial review of part of the act bring by wendy smith against the home office the high court issue declaration of incompatibility with the human rights act the court find that certain provision on the extension of ban on return to particular area from three month to month constitute unjustified discrimination against gypsies and travellers despite that the power remain in force and although the declaration of incompatibility with our law relate only to the provision just mention put it to the minister that all of part could be scrap without any detriment to the enforcement of previous law police and local authority already have whole spectrum of other power as have set out which they can and do use against encampment if they be fail to use those it be for they to say why also know that the police do not seek those power they be simply impose on they the crime and policing bill present the perfect opportunity for the government to put this right by repeal part of the act which let we remember allow police to ban gypsies and travellers from an area to arrest and fine they and even to seize their home hope to receive positive news today but if my right hon friend the minister wish to discuss these matter far would be happy to engage in that discussion have great support from friends families and travellers and other excellent group represent the roma gypsy and traveller community to see how the law can be make fair to nomadic and non nomadic community that be what be be ask for here frankly at the moment the law do not create balance it create bias one way rise to speak in support of new clause which be in my name and in the name of other it be very simple amendment that would require his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue services to include firearm licence in their peel police effectiveness efficiency and legitimacy obligation declare an interest as chairman of the all party parliamentary group on shooting and conservation and as firearm owner first thank the minister for policing and crime prevention for attend our most recent meeting of the appg to answer range of question from our member we be very grateful for her time share her commitment to protect public safety through sensible firearm law and an effective and efficient firearm licensing system it be not in the interest of the public or the shoot community for the wrong people to have gun in their possession that be why be propose the new clause member will be aware that the firearm license system in the uk be postcode lottery with separate licencing authority inconsistency in the application of the law guidance and service be endemic across the system quarter of police force be take year or more to process application for certificate with delay across the system gloucestershire constabulary the force that know well recently put out statement say that it be not accept any new firearm licence application for two year due to lack of train firearm officer intervene and the police act quickly to reverse the decision set up gold command and now receive regular update from the team however that wait be not good enough especially when the government be impose hike in fee an inefficient and ineffective licensing department endanger the public the inquest on the tragic murder in keyham plymouth reveal that the devon and cornwall police firearm license department which have issue certificate to the murderer remove his firearm after an assault but unbelievably give it back to he once he have do an anger management course the department be describe as chaotic shamble that could not operate its own risk matrix it identify the murderer as low risk when in reality he be high risk and should never have receive certificate appreciate that the minister have give assurance that datum on licensing department waiting time for both renewal and new application be now be make available to the public however that do not go far enough to ensure that police force take their inefficiency seriously and put an action plan in place to improve department across both england and wales peel inspection take place every year or so for every police force in england and wales they include theme such as treat the public fairly respond to the public and resource and value for money firearm licensing come under all three category yet there be no mention of it in any previously publish peel inspection in addition although the minister have reassure we that all fund receive from the full cost recovery of firearm licensing will be ringfence for improve firearm license department that be not guarantee the british association for shooting and conservation which act as my secretariat on the appg write to all force when the increase in firearm licensing fee be impose seek assurance that all fund would go to firearm licensing to date only third of constabulary have give that assurance include firearm license in peel inspection be powerful way to ensure that police force be publicly accountable fund properly and run efficiently for the benefit of public safety new clause be sensible and proportionate probe amendment that hope the minister might feel able to accept if it be to be table in the other place rise to speak in support of new clause which stand in my name and to lend my support to other vital amendment particularly those relate to protest right joint enterprise facial recognition and predictive policing technology new clause would require the home secretary to publish comprehensive equality impact assessment within month of the bill become law acknowledge the initial equality impact assessment but must stress that they be no substitute for thorough and ongoing review of how the power will be use and who they will affect this bill touch every part of our criminal justice system from police power and sentencing to surveillance if we know anything from decade of experience it be that such legislation rarely land equally we already know for example that black man be disproportionately stop and search that muslim community be target by counter terrorism law and that ethnic minority community be more likely to face over police under protection and systemic mistrust we must also talk frankly about how the system fail woman particularly in the context of violence against woman and girl while the state have find countless new way to expand police power and increase maximum sentence we be yet to find the will to use those power to properly protect woman not when woman who report domestic abuse and sexual violence be ignore not when black minoritise and working class woman who report violence be dismiss and not when rape be effectively decriminalise with case rarely make it to court let we not forget those case that have shock the nation the report that have expose misogyny racism and abuse within police rank and the institutional discrimination and failure that some force still fail to admit exist we have lot of work to do to rebuild trust between police and community and that be why new clause matter so much if we be to hand over even more power to the police and the state we also need to demand more scrutiny accountability and transparency we have to ask what do this mean for woman survivor and marginalise community full post legislative equality impact assessment will help to ensure that this house understand the real world effect of the law it pass particularly on woman girl and those whose experience be shape by intersect inequality of race class immigration status and more voice my continued support for amendment relate to joint enterprise in the name of my hon friend the member for liverpool riverside kim johnson too many young people disproportionately young black man have be convict under joint enterprise simply for be present not for pull trigger wield knife or plan crime but for be in the wrong place with the wrong people at the wrong time sometimes that place just happen to be where they live that doctrine rely on racist assumption about gang affiliation and collective guilt and despite repeat warning from campaigner academic and even senior judge nothing have change that be why these amendment be so important to review to correct and to prevent any further injustice reaffirm my support for new clause which protect the fundamental right to protest on the potential infringement of protest overall in the bill let say that protest be not nuisance but vital part of democracy whether it be the suffragette demand the vote trade unionist fight for fair pay or black life matter campaigner call for racial justice every major advance in civil right have come through protest stand here as black woman from working class background because of the organising resistance and yes protest of those who come before any legislation that seek to silence dissent or to criminalise those who dare to challenge power must be wrong if the history of protest have teach we anything it be that the struggle of today be mark of progress tomorrow we must not continue the legacy of the previous government which chip away at civil liberty under the guise of public order our job as lawmaker be to protect not repress the right to be hear finally reiterate my concern about the provision in the bill relate to facial recognition artificial intelligence and predictive policing address in new clause in the name of the hon member for leicester south shockat adam and for brighton pavilion siân berry these technology be not neutral they be train on biased datum and deploy in biased way that pose very real threat to civil liberty and racial justice facial recognition have be show time and again to be less accurate in identify black and brown face predictive policing draw on historically racist pattern of enforcement and use that datum to justify further surveillance in the same community this be automated injustice and if we pass the bill without proper guardrail we will be responsible for unleash technology that entrench discrimination in way that we do not yet fully understand and that those affect will feel for year to come the role of this house be not just to pass law but to ensure that those law be just their impact be fair and they reflect the value of equality and accountability that we all claim to stand for that mean demand well protection for woman and girl particularly in the face of state and police failure defend our right to protest end legal doctrine such as joint enterprise which sweep up the innocent with the guilty and put strict safeguard around surveillance technology which be already disproportionately harm minoritise community that would also mean put in place something like new clause to ensure that we properly assess and monitor the real effect on the most marginalise in our community of the power that we grant in this house apply an immediate five minute time limit rise to speak in favour of new clause to strengthen the law on tool theft in early may this year join police officer from sidcup and havering in raid to uncover steal tool at boot sale in east london unlicensed boot sale be notorious for sell steal good however be still astounded by what officer find as they arrive in police van and unmarked car there be flurry of action among some trader steal good be hide van try to flee and the key to vehicle crowd with tool be suddenly lose but the police have strike quickly and in number steal tool be uncover across trader stall six arrest be make and eventually officer strike the mother lode van overflowing with steal tool the raid take officer to second site where even more steal tool be uncover over steal tool be find worth around half million pound on just one day officer be even able to return some marked tool to their owner the raid show why tradespeople must mark their tool properly if they be mark with the like of dna tagging the police can easily prove they be steal and lock up the thief responsible they can also return the steal tool to the hard work tradespeople across the country but mark tool alone will not stop tool theft van be be break into in broad daylight and tool sell openly across the country it be disgrace the law must change to punish the thief responsible and crack down on the boot sale drive the crime wave that be why encourage all member to support new clause table by my hon friend the member for stockton west matt vickers first it would increase fine to well match the severity of the crime reflect the cost of replace tool and repair damage to van and of lose work do my hon friend agree that accept the amendment be one way in which the government could reach out to business and trader and show that they be on the side of local business and the people who get up every morning and go out to work in effect white van whom tool be key to be able to do the job as be the farm implement that be also subject to theft thank my right hon friend for her vital contribution we must back the maker not the law breaker whether they be white van man or rural farmer who be have their tool steal the impact on their ability to go to work be significant but it also have an impact on their family because of their ability to buy food and other good we must back the maker and not the law breaker secondly the bill would impose tough sentence on thief by recognise the seriousness of the crime finally it would require council to create an enforcement plan to stop the sale of steal tool at boot sale these be all necessary change to help stop tool theft across the country tradespeople and industry can not afford parliamentary dither and delay as campaigner tradespeople police expert and industry have tell we action be need now every minute van be break into and tool be steal cost tradespeople thousand of pound hurt their mental health and stop they from earn living do my hon friend agree that it be not just about theft from van this be about people whole livelihood and ability to work business can be strike down do he agree

roundtable that very large company also suffer lot of damage for example on average openreach van be hit three time day which delay the fibre rollout in rural community over million of survey equipment be steal from balfour beatty van in just three month impact which we have discuss today if any mps be unsure about the need to act now they need to speak to shoaib awan frankie williams

instagram and they will see case every single day of people have their tool steal and the damage that be do to their financial and mental health the impact of this on the wide economy be now so severe that we must act parliament must act across party to change the law today hope also thank the police and crime commissioner across the country who be get stick into the problem have highlight example from the met of sidcup and havering police force in particular but know that the pcc in kent and sussex be also do great work tackle this issue as have highlight this be not party political issue and appreciate the work of the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin in shin spotlight on it today we can work cross party and get the law change now and hope in all sincerity that all mp get behind this amendment and that the government can help we change the law today get on the side of the maker and tackle the lawbreaker rise to speak in support of new clause in my name and new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel new clause propose to change the law on joint enterprise for those who do not know this be century old doctrine that allow multiple people to be convict of crime usually murder or manslaughter even if only one person commit the fatal act evidence demonstrate it lead to unjust conviction disproportionately impact young black and working class people with young black man time more likely to be convict under joint enterprise than their white counterpart thank all who support my private member bill that have its second reading in february and for their continue support for the campaign particularly joint enterprise not guilty by association as result of judicial review bring by liberty and jengba the crown prosecution service conduct pilot survey of joint enterprise case result in access to accurate datum and highlight the racial disparity that exist case law on joint enterprise be reverse by supreme court ruling in the jogee case identify how the law have take wrong turn for year the law commission be now undertake review of homicide and the sentencing framework for murder it will examine the law on joint enterprise in light of the supreme court ruling on jogee with campaigner anticipate clear solution on the disparity and inequality while understand the government have some reservation about my amendment it be clear that there be recognition across the house that joint enterprise need to be fix the prosecution of joint enterprise case be flawed and racialise the supreme court ruling do not resolve the key problem with the law speculative prosecution theory be accept in place of strong evidence this allow and encourage racist stereotyping use gang narrative to imply collective intent and use person taste in music as evidence of be in gang with police be call as expert witness on drill music which be conflict of interest art not evidence be make significant inroad in this space propose criminal evidence creative and artistic expression bill to limit the admissibility of evidence of person creative and artistic expression in criminal proceeding and for connected purpose the westminster commission on joint enterprise be gather evidence and will produce report for the government in reform of joint enterprise be long overdue it have go as far as it can in the court and it be now for parliament to act that be what the former director of public prosecutions who be now the prime minister have say new clause would enshrine the right to protest in law the purpose of this amendment be to keep public authority power proportionate and to uphold the right of our society to protest peacefully as fundamental pillar of free and equal democracy the right to protest and the freedom to express dissent go back century and be champion across the political spectrum from the peasant revolt to the suffragette we celebrate the great british tradition of direct action so many of our freedom have be win this way include worker right most recently we have see the farmer protest outside parliament the mass trespass organise by the ramblers association in defence of our right to roam strike worker anti war protester and beyond million of people have march peacefully against the genocide in gaza thousand of disabled people have protest against propose welfare and disabled benefit change we have see protester outside parliament against the assist die bill and yesterday pro life protester gather outside this place the ability to protest and freedom of expression and assembly be protect by article and of the european convention on human right and be enshrine in uk law the plan demonstration outside the bbc headquarters in january demand impartial coverage of israel war in gaza be ban by the met police on the basis that the headquarters be in close proximity to synagogue this be after week of meeting and agreement of the route with the met police this be serious infringement of our right to protest if we can not protest outside the headquarters of our public broadcaster what do that say about our democracy this should be of concern for all who believe in democracy and free society the government have chance now to change course and roll back on these clampdown for our right and freedom for our democracy rise to speak in support of new clause in my name and in the name of the chair of the select committee on home affairs the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley and of the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy both of whom thank for their support it be also co sign by member from across the house represent our entire political spectrum from almost every party include many member of the labour party new clause seek to do something very simple to commence the protection from sex base harassment in public act which have already receive royal assent this act simply criminalise the harassment of people in public base on their sex but this be crime that overwhelmingly affect woman so this really be about the criminalisation of harassment of woman in public the act start life as private member bill lay by my constituency predecessor greg clark he be approach by sixth former in our constituency who say that she have be harass while come home from school one third of schoolgirl in the united kingdom say they have be harass in their school uniform we should be ashamed of that statistic and greg be ashamed and he take action the act as pass create specific offence of harassment on account of someone sex like the new clause rise to speak in support of it receive cross party support include it must be say from the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips who be now the minister for safeguarding and violence against woman and girl the act criminalise harass follow and shout degrading comment and make obscene gesture at woman and girl in public with the deliberate intention of cause they harm or distress and it carry maximum sentence of two year so be quite disappointed and confuse by the interaction that have have with the government on this issue every time have press they for an update on commencement have not really receive substantive answer for example eight month ago ask question in this house and receive letter from the government tell that the home office be make all the necessary arrangement and that would be contact when commencement date be confirm as new mp think this be quite promising five month ago table write question and the government respond say that they would publish next step at the early opportunity then two week ago receive reply from the government to further communication state that an update on commencement would be provide in due course each communication receive from the government be little vaguer little bit less definitive about commencement yesterday at her instigation meet with the minister for vawg and think fantastic finally we will get some answer but there be nothing be afraid there be nada zip gently ask the minister present now not the minister for vawg what be the point in arrange meeting if the government be not go to say anything new to what they have previously say be grateful to the hon gentleman fellow member of the select committee on defence for give way and be proud to put my name to new clause in his name also pay tribute to he for take forward greg clark previous work in very cross party way for the benefit of the community do he share my frustration and slight bewilderment at the way in which the government appear to be block commencement in the government defence do not think that this be difference in policy it be difference in timing but the timing seem to be very elastic we seek definitive time when the act will be commence perhaps the minister can respond at the dispatch box as somebody who be incredibly proud to work with the hon gentleman predecessor on this legislation have work for many many year to recognise misogyny in our hate crime framework let say that it will be two year in september since this house agree to this legislation on cross party basis it will be two year in september of the work be do in theory to be able to commence the legislation many of we on the government benches be proud of our commitment to recognise misogyny in hate crime so will the hon gentleman join in say that we really want to understand what the barrier might be to get on with the job that we know across this house will keep woman and girl safe on our street can actually give the hon lady very specific time it be month to the day since this act receive royal assent if the minister would be so gracious we might have from she either time for commencement or as the hon member for walthamstow say specific problem that be stop the act be commence rather than some of the more general response we have have to date be doubly disappointed that although this act be pass in previous parliament express the unanimous will of parliament as it pass without division it be entirely commensurate with the labour government policy to halve violence against woman and girl harassment and violence be on continuum and spectrum one of the thing we be try to do be to change the culture of man in how they act towards woman this act be part of that and really do contribute to the labour government priority and manifesto indeed the minister for vawg sit on the public bill committee for the act in and say that the labour party would work with the then conservative government to ensure that the bill pass without division and so it do the government have signal that they will vote against new clause which have be select for vote tonight when the new clause have cross party support and the original act have unanimous cross party support why will the government vote against the new clause it seem to that they be vote against their own manifesto and their own commitment while in opposition that be difficult to understand because think we all want the same thing will conclude implement the protection from sex base harassment in public act be an important step in help the labour government to achieve their own manifesto commitment let this not be another speech without action urge hon and right hon member to vote for new clause rise to speak to new clause in my name this be very simple new clause in way about how we stop mobile phone that have be steal from be reconnecte to the cloud and sell on if we can break that link we can stop the proliferation of mobile phone theft which have increase by some mobile phone be snatch every single day and there have be marked increase in westminster know that number of mp have have their mobile phone steal some of they be sit not too far away from the amount of money in this crime be incredible do not believe phone manufacturer be that keen to stop this crime because feel it be part of their business model when somebody have their mobile phone steal they go and buy another mobile phone new clause say that once somebody phone have be steal and they report it to the police the police must report it to apple google samsung or whoever which then stop that phone from be reconnecte to the cloud in effect that phone would become inactive if the manufacturer fail to do that within hour it would be fin we need to ensure that the manufacturer take this issue seriously because they be not here be the simple thing if we want to stop mobile phone be steal to order we need to ensure that the manufacturer take the issue seriously we need to ensure that imei number be easily accessible and we need to ensure that thief can not reconnect the mobile phone rise to speak to new clause which be table in my name and support by my hon friend the member for rutland and stamford alicia kearns and be very pleased to say by member from both side of this chamber it would extend the definition of extreme pornography to include depiction of non fatal strangulation know as nfs nfs be make criminal offence in under the last government not because we think the government should necessarily stick their nose into what people want to get up to in the bedroom but because abuser use non fatal strangulation without consent as it leave little visible injury and make it hard to prosecute under domestic abuse case when woman die from strangulation it be become increasingly common to use the defence that it be sex game go wrong non fatal strangulation have life out there in the world of online porn as we know the uk be large porn consumer in any give month more than million adult in the uk will access online porn and the vast majority of they will be chap that be up to they we do not judge but we know from research that online porn be so widespread that one in child have see it by the age of nine unfortunately it be the guide that many young people use to learn about sex that be why be extremely worried that non fatal strangulation have be find to be rife on porn site evidence have show that it be directly influence the sexual behaviour of young man who be non consensually strangle young woman during consensual sex recent polling have suggest that of to year old have be strangle without give consent during consensual sex we be not be prude in call for this misogynistic act to be ban in online porn health expert warn that there be no way to strangle someone without risk give that blood and airflow may both be restrict person can become unconscious within second of be choke and within second they can have seizure due to lack of oxygen death can occur within second of be render unconscious almost of the woman kill in the uk since be strangle by an intimate partner perpetrator who choke their partner be seven time more likely to kill they be sure the minister will agree that it be alarming to hear report of young man and boy seek advice on how they can safely strangle their partner in bed and that girl be expect to accept that kind of behaviour there be even report last year which the minister may have hear about of draft personal social health and economic education guidance from welsh local authority include safe choke during sex for child sex education class we need to send signal that strangle your partner in bed be not safe it can be precursor to coercive abusive behaviour know that the government also want to send that signal because in february they say in their response to an independent review commission by the previous government the government will take urgent action to ensure pornography platform law enforcement and prosecutor be take all necessary step to tackle this increasingly prevalent harm therefore urge the minister to support my new clause which set out one of the necessary step refer to in the government response we need to back this amendment ban this harmful practice and send out very strong message that depiction of non fatal strangulation in porn normalise something that be not normal and be not safe rise to speak to new clause which stand in the name of my hon friend the member for bolton west phil brickell and be support by the all party parliamentary group on anti corruption and responsible tax welcome the bill for its clear and ambitious strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour and crime but if we want truly safe street we must also step up our effort to tackle financial and economic crime that be the aim of our amendment which be support by at least member from across the house economic crime be now the most commonly experience crime in the uk account for more than of all report incident yet we invest just of gdp in enforcement that be not sustainable and these crime be not victimless they erode public trust exploit our financial institution and hollow out high street and community in my constituency of kensington and bayswater from earl court road to queensway notting hill gate and portobello road resident and small business owner be feed up with the proliferation of suspicious cash intensive business such as candy store low grade souvenir shop harry potter shop and barbershop these business be more than just an eyesore hear persistent concern about vat evasion rate avoidance and even troubling link to serious organise crime and money laundering for those reason be very encourage by operation machinize the national crime agency lead crackdown on barbershop suspect of launder criminal fund early this year take this opportunity to put on record my thank to the leadership of the nca and the serious fraud office and to their frontline staff they have engage closely with the appg on anti corruption and responsible tax which chair those organisation be do excellent work but they can not tackle this problem alone we need proper cross government co ordination and resource for enforcement new clause would require the government to assess the option for create an economic crime fighting fund it would be pool fund finance by share of the asset already recover through enforcement confiscation fine and defer prosecution agreement it would not be new money that money be recover by our enforcement agency but currently it be return to the treasury and often leave unspent due to outdated annularity rule in for instance the nca have to return million of recover criminal asset because it could not spend the money fast enough that be inefficient and perverse such fund would create virtuous cycle with more enforcement more recovery and great deterrence the sfo return for every invest which be smart economic and compelling argument for long term sustainable resourcing with the financial action task force review on the horizon the uk need to demonstrate that it have the financial and technical capacity to take this issue seriously otherwise we risk fall behind our global partner in the fight against corruption and illicit finance look forward to the forthcoming publication of the government anti corruption strategy and have value the opportunity to work closely with the anti corruption champion baroness hodge in shape that strategy the foreign secretary be also right to make it his mission to position the uk as the global capital of anti corruption and to commit to summit on financial crime next year the ambition be clear but we must now match it with resource co ordination and reform very briefly will highlight an area in which this bill will make real difference the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith refer to new clause many resident of kensington and bayswater have contact about the dangerous and antisocial use of illegally modify bike especially by delivery driver that include speeding reckless pavement riding and off road use be cyclist unlike the right hon gentleman be not motorcyclist and support active travel and safe cycling but what we be see be dangerous and resident have have enough as such be glad that the bill will give the police the power to seize and destroy illegally modify bike within hour build on power that already exist under section of the police reform act thank the minister for recently confirm to that delivery bike will be cover by the new provision and for take into account the concern of my community hope she will look kindly on our request for support in sustainably fund the fight against economic crime rise to speak in support of liberal democrat new clause and table by my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart also commend my hon and gallant friend the member for tunbridge wells mike martin on his new clause represent one of the most rural constituency in the uk know just how deeply rural crime affect my constituent life and livelihood be not talk about the occasional petty theft from property the problem we face be calculate organise crime and it be devastate north cornwall farmer small business and entire community in our rural area take the farmer in st kew who lose more than worth of tool and equipment in single night or the farming couple in blisland who have two of their quad bike steal worth in that case the police do not even arrive until three day later to this day the couple have hear nothing more that be not to blame our hard work local constable who be stretch to breaking point it be no wonder that of countryside resident say that rural crime be harm their mental wellbeing and these be not isolate incident they be all part of grow pattern that successive government have allow to thrive under their watch new clause would finally extend the equipment theft prevention act to cover gps unit which be some of the most commonly steal piece of farm tech separately new clause would establish dedicated rural crime taskforce on which the liberal democrats have long campaign it be work in scotland and handful of regional police force so it be time that the government develop and roll out properly fund and equip taskforce nationwide be pleased that after year of pressure from and my liberal democrat colleague the government have finally announce that they will be commit to full rural crime strategy hope that the minister can today update the house on its timing strategy alone however will not stop theft it must come with proper enforcement that be why new clause and new clause matter they would guarantee minimal level of neighbourhood police and ensure that every local authority area have officer exclusively dedicate to community base work in cornwall the police be do all they can but when the force get less money per head than almost anywhere else in england it be not enough officer be overstretch and underfunded we need boot on the ground with officer who understand the rural landscape they be serve that be why urge the house to back these amendment for the tradesman who have lose their tool for the farmer who have lose their machinery and vehicle and for every rural community that have lose faith that justice will ever be do separately new clause and would make it criminal offence for water company to breach pollution performance commitment and would finally hold senior executive personally liable for their failure in north cornwall my constituent be live with the consequence of systematic pollution for profit in south west water issue more than sewage alert in its region include during the official bathing season and staggering outside of it this be routine and preventable environmental harm south west water pledge to significantly reduce its sewage discharge but freedom of information request show that it increase its discharge by shocking five time last year versus the previous year and the human cost be real in widemouth bay

surgery few week ago by teenage girl who require hospital admission after surf in harlyn bay in st eval deal with resident report brown water come from their tap as result of crack at bears down reservoir due to south west water lack of maintenance many have no water for day and the compensation from south west water be household the leadership behind these constant and shocking failure continue to be reward susan davy the chief executive of pennon group which own south west water be pay total of in that be small increase of from the year before our beach river and family be be fail and let down especially by the last conservative government and now by this government that be why these new clause offer clear message order call rachel taylor on april three nail bomb go off in london kill four and injure one of they explode at brick lane the hub of london bengali community one explode in soho at the admiral duncan pub the heart of london gay district and one explode in brixton in an attack on south london black community the sick terrorist who commit those evil act be motivate by hatred he hat bengalis and black people because of their race he hat lgbt people because of who they love and how they live their life he hat those group because they be different from he he hat they because of who they be raise that appalling incident to remind the house that hatred come in many form but whoever in our society it be against we must all stand equally strongly against it we must have hate crime law that show that whether the hatred be for someone race religion sexual orientation gender identity or disability britain be country that will not tolerate it that all hatred be equal and that all those who commit vile act of hatred will face the same grave consequence regret to say that that be not currently the case today the law recognise five category of hate crime race religion sexual orientation transgender identity and disability but only two race and religion be treat as aggravate offence subject to strong sentencing power the other three be not that discrepancy can not be right we can not say as society that some form of hatred be more evil than other be at university when section be introduce remember it vividly it be more than law it be an attack on the right of people like to live openly it stigmatise lesbian gay and bisexual people and it push we out of public life go into politic to fight that cruel law and everything it represent hate corrode our entire society it do not just harm the individual who be target it create fear fear to go outside fear to speak up fear to be see it silence people it make we all afraid research by stonewall find that less than half of people feel safe hold their partner hand in public that be the impact that the fear of hatred have on people it make they afraid even to show the world that they exist unfortunately far too many recorded crime never result in charge of disability hate crime record by police lead to prosecution of homophobic hate crime lead to prosecution of hate crime against transgender people only lead to prosecution behind those statistic be real people whose scar may heal on the outside but who may never recover from the fear and trauma that they have suffer in teenage far right extremist be jail for target and attack transgender woman along with another young man he kick she to the ground in park in swansea and hurl transphobic abuse at she in cassie phd student and wheelchair user be wait outside shop when two drunk man grab her wheelchair push she down the road and make sexual comment she have to escape by roll into traffic we must fight back against this hatred we must show that we be not content to stick with the status quo the victim of these attack deserve to live in society that say that we take this hatred seriously and will not stand for it victim must be at the heart of our criminal justice system and we must ensure that law protect they that be why my new clause be so important lgbt and disabled people tell that they do not feel as safe as they use to we be see rise transphobia everywhere pride flag be be take down at county hall and some politician be openly question whether disability be even real be proud that labour in our manifesto commit to equalise our hate crime law by make hate crime against lgbt people and disabled people aggravate offence be proud to be bring forward that change through new clause hope that can persuade all my parliamentary colleague to support the new clause today and to take this important step forward for equal right thank my hon friend the members for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier and for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball for stand shoulder to shoulder with throughout this process and urge the house to support the new clause as mps we receive wide range of correspondence from constituent during some of the most difficult time in their life but the email that receive from emma johnson be perhaps one of the most harrowing that have ever receive it be because of emma story that have table new clause and will speak to it today on november emma have just go into labour with her young child mother and child be okay when she receive call inform she that her parent have be tragically kill in car crash the driver of the other vehicle have no licence and be uninsured on what be suppose to be one of the happy day of emma life she instead have to identify the body of her parent ian and gail when the case come to court the driver of the other vehicle be charge with the less offence of cause death by careless driving rather than by dangerous driving that reduce the sentence available to the court even though he be swerve in and out of traffic and drive without licence or insurance put it to the house that this by its very nature be dangerous since the verdict emma have be fight not for vengeance but to make sure that no other family have to suffer the same injustice she have seek justice not just for her parent but for other people who face the same heartbreak she be call for simple but vital change any driver who kill while drive without licence or insurance should automatically face the more serious offence of cause death by dangerous driving today say directly to emma who know be watch that fundamentally agree with you your dedication to the cause be commendable and you be do your late parent proud we know that road accident happen but if someone wilfully get behind the wheel of car when unlicensed and uninsured and swerve in and out of traffic that be not an accident it be dangerous choice to put other live at risk new clause would rightly treat such behaviour as seriously as drive under the influence of drug or alcohol it would close loophole in the current law and bring great justice for victim if the new clause do not progress today ask the minister to meet and emma to ensure that her campaign continue rise to speak in support of new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick andy slaughter it seek to repeal the unnecessary and arbitrary police power introduce via the police crime sentencing and courts act which introduce new power to seize the home of gypsy and traveller family and to fine arrest and imprison they the power contain in part of the act have have devastating impact on romani gypsy and irish traveller community and on culture that be not only century old but protect by law the government have legal and moral duty to facilitate this way of life not to legislate it out of existence as we hear early from my hon friend the member for hammersmith and chiswick in may the high court find certain provision in part of the police crime sentencing and courts act to be incompatible with the human rights act the government have so far fail meaningfully to respond to that let alone correct it in issue the declaration of incompatibility the high court recognise the lack of transit provision for gypsy and traveller community across england and the impact that the act power have on gypsy and traveller family if there be any doubt in people mind about the state of transit provision in england refer they to the research publish this year by friend families and travellers which find that of the local authority have no transit provision at all notably the introduction of the power have an effect on the community fear of be target and sanction will share the word of someone from the romany community who have be directly impact by these power which highlight the human consequence of these law this law add to the knock on effect we face daily with access to healthcare and education be move on constantly have be detrimental to my health as sometimes have to drive over mile to see gp could be make criminal and lose my home all because have never know any different it be painfully obvious that what we need be not criminal sanction for family who have nowhere to stop the answer be of course to create law which ensure there be enough place for people to stop might add that the planning and infrastructure bill provide the perfect opportunity for that as stand here today during gypsy roma and traveller history month urge the government not to delay far let we repeal part of the police crime sentencing and courts act through this bill and take meaningful step towards justice inclusion and respect for all community would like to start by pay tribute to berney hall who be in the gallery today and who have be campaign for change in the law to remove the month limitation period for historic case of rape of to year old girl when they occur before it can take year for victim of abuse to come forward baroness kennedy of cradley table amendment to the police crime sentencing and courts bill in the other place which seek to close this loophole but they be not take forward by the previous government that be why have table new clause hope the government will give all survivor of this terrible crime the closure and justice they deserve be support several amendment today include new clause table by the hon member for rotherham sarah champion recently meet mum from my constituency whose ex partner be convict of sexual communication with child and put on the sex offender register but be then allow to change his name understandably my constituent be horrify to learn that he could take on new identity and that other woman might not be aware new clause would stop offender avoid monitor measure that be important for public safety as well as reassuring victim that perpetrator can not dodge the repercussion of their action be also support new clause to new clause and and new clause in addition support new clause table by my hon friend the member for esher and walton monica harding which would strengthen protection for emergency worker by address hate motivate offence commit against they in private dwelling no one do their job to protect other should face abuse whether on the street or in someone home hate fuel attack on those who serve the public must be prosecute with the seriousness they warrant finally thank my hon friend the member for tunbridge wells mike martin for table new clause which would ensure the government implement the protection from sex base harassment in public act no one should have to put up with sexual harassment and this change in the law be long overdue rise to speak to new clause to in my name first thank the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones for her engagement on the issue be about to discuss and pay tribute to uk feminista which run the all party parliamentary group on commercial sexual exploitation to cease the centre to end all sexual exploitation and to barnardo for its steadfast campaign on tackle violence against woman and girl and the protection of child my new clause reflect the recommendation of the very thorough recent review conduct for the government by baroness gabby bertin into online pornography be so proud that this labour government have make commitment to halve violence against woman and girl truly believe that regulate violent online pornography which be view by nearly of man once week in the uk will make clear impact on that commitment as the hon member for gosport dame caroline dinenage have already powerfully argue sexual strangulation be one of the most frequently find act across all category on mainstream pornography site despite its danger it be portray as perfectly safe and normal part of sex in google search cease find million video immediately for choke her porn want to share the story of hannah who meet her killer james morton on the day she die morton be report as be obsess with strangulation frequently watch porn feature strangulation of woman although the judge say morton have strangle hannah without warning or permission morton claim he begin to lightly strangle hannah before more forcefully strangle she woman and girl be pay the price of both an industry that seek to profit from the most violent kind of content and law that be not fit for purpose despite the clear evidence of direct connection between view strangulation content in mainstream pornography and undertake such act the law require the removal of this type of pornographic content only if the threshold of life threaten be clearly meet new clause would ban pornographic content depict all strangulation and with the requirement in the online safety act to remove illegal content would place duty on platform to remove strangulation video or face sanction it be clear that we need strong regulation offline we have be regulate pornographic content since the video recordings act which specifically prohibit offline content that the british board of film classification would find unsuitable yet our online regulation have not keep pace of particular concern be content that depict sexual activity with child know as teen porn or incest porn this content feature young look performer make to look under age through use of prop such as stuff toy lollipop and school uniform such content normalise child as object of sexual desire and drive the demand for child sexual abuse material pornography producer have get around the ban on incest material by promote porn video in which there be step incest in society where many of we have blend family it be simply not right that step daddy daughter pornography be legal no matter whether the actor be over or not new clause would ensure that what be illegal offline be illegal online we must also ensure that all illegal pornographic content be regulate equally online regardless of where that content be host duty under the online safety act to combat illegal content apply only to pornography website that host user to user interaction or user generate content and pornography website that host only commercially produce pornography be exempt from illegal duty we must not allow that to continue new clause would ensure that all pornography site must adhere to illegal content duty finally it be important to remember that the act of sexual violence have speak about today be perpetrate against real woman and girl this be not act or perform woman be often force or coerce into this industry and once in it even the most famous pornography performer be exploit for example kate be traffic from the uk to the pornography industry in america where she suffer horrendous abuse and be force to take part in dangerous and degrading sex act on film the consequence of what she endure have stay with she despite she escape the industry the truth be there be no way of know whether the woman who appear in pornography have give their consent or whether they be even adult new clause would ensure that pornography website access from the uk must verify the age and consent of every individual feature on their site and crucially enable individual feature in pornography to withdraw their consent to its publication at any time look forward to work with the government and colleague across the house to tackle the harmful impact of this multibillion pound industry rise to speak to new clause in the name of my right hon friend the member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley have to say be little surprised that be have to speak to this new clause today and implore the minister to give it due consideration not least because it be present on cross party basis in the previous parliament by baroness harman in fact on the day it be debate baroness harman who have do all the work on it be away due to personal matter and it be speak to by the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips who be of course now the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girl the minister will be aware that this issue directly concern constituent of mine whose experience will speak to later really encourage the minister to give the new clause due consideration and if it be not take up perhaps she can clarify in her remark why there be delay every engagement have have with the department have suggest that such provision be well on its way so would be curious to know about that for the benefit of the house the new clause seek to remove the parental right of convict sex offender it be unconscionable to my constituent that child could be subject to live with sex offender because the sex offender be their parent it be reprehensible that the law allow that to happen it allow convict criminal who have commit the most heinous crime to exploit the law and it put vulnerable child at risk my right hon friend the member for staffordshire moorlands be incredibly generous to when speak about her amendment the truth be that my constituent have drive in this remember the first time that the parent of bethan come to see will use that name for the purpose of this speech frankly as father do not know whether would have keep my composure the way they do if be in their position they speak about it in such an honest way and they continue to do so the other experience have with the family be up in the gallery with they when the amendment be debate and could see their sheer joy when bethan daughter father be sentence he be ban from any future contact with child but he be not ban from contact with his own child this critical amendment would stop that it would give bethan and other in her position the assurance she need that her child can not be contact by convict paedophile know the minister to be very capable minister and good person and be sure she agree that no parent should have to go through this the amendment could save anguish for many thousand of parent and give they clarity of further importance be that bethan have to self fund her case to severely restrict her daughter father parental right but that be not something that every parent will be able to achieve and there be people without legal aid of course the consideration most paramount be the safeguarding of the child and protect the innocent victim but this protection should not be available only to those who can afford it the proposal be also champion last year by the hon member for birmingham yardley who ask how an individual can be consider too dangerous to work with or be around other people child yet be allow to have responsibility for child life so long as that child be their own do not think that be controversial statement to make so ask the minister to give the amendment due consideration this be clearly something that be very important to and my constituent if the amendment be not pass today will push for further amendment on this issue and bring forward debate on it as well as private member bill when speak to bethan family they talk about how devastated they be that the amendment be not take forward hope the minister will recognise the anguish that this delay be cause rise to support new clause and in my name the amendment address two specific but crucial failing in our current road traffic law the absence of adequate penalty for drive without ever have hold licence and insufficient consequence for people who fail to stop after an incident the amendment be in honour of harry parker much love year old whose life be tragically cut short on november on his way to school engage with the family regularly and this have truly rock adam and kelly it be utterly devastating for they to have lose their child at such an early point in his life extend my deep sympathy to harry parent and admire their courage in seek change through their grief the driver who kill harry be drive without licence have no insurance and do not stop shockingly all charge be drop the police and the crown prosecution service follow the letter of the law but that be why be here the law as it stand do not recognise the gravity of these offence when they be commit by someone who should never have be behind the wheel in the first place that be why have bring forward the two amendment new clause on unlicensed driver would amend section of the road traffic act to introduce tough penalty for individual who have never hold licence new clause on the offence of failure to stop would amend section of the act to allow court to impose unlimited fine custodial sentence and disqualification from drive for up to two year more importantly it would allow the court to impose any combination of those penalty no law can bring harry back no sentence will ease the pain of the family and friend these amendment be about restore the balance and send clear message if someone choose to drive without licence and if someone run from the scene of crash there will be real world consequence appreciate that the amendment may not progress but ask the government to take they seriously with road safety strategy which hope we can push forward in future rise to speak to new clause in my name which bring forward because of isabella year old girl who live in my constituency in may of this year isabella be hang out with friend in lyme regis when she be lure to the cemetery group of young people be wait one of they have their phone out and be already film her arrival moment later another girl who isabella know launch brutal assault her head be smash against concrete step she be stamp on and kick in the face again and again while isabella be be attack no one stop to help instead they stand by and they film they laugh and they demand they be send the video the attack be premeditate but so too be the filming the recording begin before isabella even arrive it be not take to provide evidence or to expose wrongdoing but take deliberately to broadcast her humiliation and glorify the violence have see the video it be horrific isabella mother have see the video her friend have see the video and hundred and possibly thousand of people have see the video because it be intentionally and maliciously circulate on social medium and in private whatsapp group in school across west dorset child who be not there and who do not even know isabella see her brutal attack play out on their phone the violence do not stop when the attack end it be share it be forward it be replayed and it be whisper about isabella attacker be charge with actual bodily harm she receive anger management class and six month restraining order that be bad enough but the people who film it walk away entirely unpunished the filming have start before the attack occur they know the attack be come they plan to film it and then they proceed to share the video while laugh they do not walk away unpunished because there be no proof of what they do the video be the proof but because our law do not yet recognise such specific premeditated and deeply harmful behaviour as the offence that it should be that be why believe that new clause be so important it seek to create specific offence for premeditated filming and distribution of violent act with the intent to humiliate distress and psychologically harm the victim it recognise what too many family already know that this be not about punch throw or kick deliver but about the deliberate choice to film violence broadcast it and humiliate the victim repeatedly for an audience that grow with every share every click and every forward message we be not talk about evidence or journalism or about someone catch wrongdoing to expose it indeed new clause make it very clear and contain an explicit safeguard to protect public interest journalism and for footage be use as evidence yet where there be premeditation and where someone knowingly film or broadcast an attack with the intent to amplify the victim humiliation that behaviour must face consequence isabella case be not an isolated one the hon gentleman speak with great passion about his constituent yesterday evening hold roundtable with parent in my constituency to talk about mobile phone use in school one of the parent be gp and she speak about how child who have be subject to such attack have come to her surgery say that they be contemplate suicide because of what they have face do he agree that this go well beyond mere humiliation and to some of the bad mental health problem our young people could face agree with the hon gentleman we do not fully understand the last psychological damage especially as this be grow problem have receive further letter from other people who have tell about similar incident in other school other town and other playground nationally the problem be rise accord to the youth endowment fund survey of young people report see real world violence online in the past year and that most of that footage be of fight involve young people it be happen in our community right now and the law be fail to keep pace our child already face enormous pressure from social medium from online bullying to app design to capture their attention and expose they to content far beyond their year as parent we do our good to protect they but we can not be everywhere we have duty to put proper deterrent in place where social medium company have continually fail we we have duty to send clear message that this behaviour be unacceptable that it be dangerous and that it will not go unpunished will finish with the word of isabella mother sarah she say have to live with the flashback of watch my daughter be beat also have to live know that this video will be forever available on social medium on behalf of sarah and of isabella hope that the government will support change to the law so that something positive can come from isabella experience pay tribute to the hon member for west dorset edward morello for his speech and for advocate for new clause he be powerful advocate for his constituent who suffer such horrific thing and thank he for that rise to speak in support of new clause which stand in my name it would create new stand alone offence of assault delivery worker before begin though let refer member to my entry in the register of member financial interests and my membership of the gmb union delivery worker be vital to our local economy they link shop with home cafés with customer and community with each other they help keep our high street alive and our home supply but too often they be abuse assault and attack just for do their job rolston who rid for deliveroo have be verbally abuse and threaten with violence on people doorstep for ask for id when deliver alcohol as the law require he to do emiliana have be rid in kent since she have have two motorbike steal and have be pelt sometimes it be far bad claudiu carol kondor be an amazon delivery driver he be kill in leeds last year

just three week early and be try to protect his livelihood instead he lose his life no one should leave home to go to work and not come back those be just few story but they be not isolate incident the union of shop distributive and allied workers have find that of delivery worker for major retailer such as tesco sainsbury asda ocado morrisons and iceland have be victim of abuse in the past year quarter have turn down delivery because they fear for their safety and have be physically assault and this be happen during an epidemic of retail crime shoplifting have nearly double since the pandemic and rise by last year alone in store retail staff also face absolutely shocking abuse welcome the labour government commitment to protect retail worker with stand alone offence which usdaw through its freedom from fear campaign have campaign on for year it be the right move because no one should feel unsafe or face abuse verbal or physical just for do their job delivery worker be on the frontline too they work alone often at night they be public face and can be vulnerable when something go wrong delay miss item or the wrong order they be the one who face the backlash too often frustration turn into abuse violence or bad delivery worker deserve the same protection that this government be rightly offer to staff in store when parliament place extra responsibility on delivery rider to police much need law on age verification it should legislate to provide additional protection for they new clause be back by the gmb union usdaw deliveroo the british retail consortium and ukhospitality trade body and trade union be campaign together because they know the reality they see what delivery worker face every day since the covid pandemic delivery rider have become part of how we shop and we rely on they wish to speak about new clause to and return once again to police and police funding in new clause on neighbourhood policing the liberal democrats seek to address the government recently announce neighbourhood policing plan the plan pledge to recruit an additional police officer figure that still simply do not stack up speak last week in westminster hall about the discrepancy in the government pledge the lack of clarity around the baseline figure against which progress will be measure the fuzziness around how the officer transfer from other role will be determine or implement and the fact that the officer overcounte as be in neighbourhood role by of the police force in england and wales mean that the officer the government have announce this year be all but net neutral in term of additional warrant police officer it be an in year increase of just officer once the adjustment be take into account new clause appear to misunderstand how operational control and deployment of police resource work it make no reference to the operational decision make responsibility of the chief constable much as the government have stipulate the redeployment of officer without explain how and where that will be implement subsection state the home office must publish proposal detail the additional funding that will be require to ensure that police force can meet these requirement without reduce officer number in other frontline policing role yet it fail to stipulate that funding be inequitable in the first instance have speak at length about the police allocation formula so ask the liberal democrats and in particular my neighbour the hon member for st neots and mid cambridgeshire ian sollom if they will join in lead call for the policing minister to ensure that the police allocation formula be update to reflect the population increase and redistribution that have occur since the formula be first introduce be aware that the policing minister state in westminster hall on june that there be white paper come in the next few month want to make clear to hon member this afternoon that within that there will undoubtedly have to be discussion about finance and resource for police official report june vol welcome that discussion and know that she will if nothing else be keen to address my concern as priority if only to get off her back new clause mention funding within the context of minimum level of police the liberal democrats be ask for every police force in england and wales to maintain neighbourhood police team at level necessary to ensure effective community engagement and crime prevention who stipulate that level be that at the chief constable discretion or be it the police and crime commissioner the metro mayor the policing minister or the home secretary define effective furthermore ringfenced allocation of for neighbourhood police from future police grant report would hamper the flexibility of operational budget for chief constable when we should be allow they the freedom of operation to be the arbiter of how their resource may be employ most effectively within their constabulary area lastly new clause be on the rural crime prevention strategy an area that appear to have be all but overlook by the government in their recent announcement be sure that the national rural crime unit already have strategy it be establish under the previous government in and have recover steal property include agricultural machinery and vehicle worth over million since its inception it have also co ordinated uk wide operational response result in multiple arrest as well as disrupt organise crime group cambridgeshire rural crime action team already punch above its weight in alone it recover almost million worth of steal property seize vehicle use in crime attend more than incident and prosecute suspect they work closely with the national rural crime unit but once again despite their success they be underfunde and under resource cambridgeshire be large county with significant rural area yet we rely on just small team of officer to take on everything from machinery theft to the real danger of the violent organise crime group who conduct hare coursing an issue that desperately need to be tackle in cambridgeshire the government neighbourhood policing plan gloss over the need for great police presence in our rural community west of the in my constituency there be dozen of village that will in theory have name officer how will that prevent someone take an angle grinder to vehicle shed on an isolated farm at am the government have talk good game on police but their number do not add up their strategy have hole all over it and for all the talk of an uplift in police finance senior police officer have repeatedly raise concern about the police allocation formula remain unchanged on that last point expect the forthcoming white paper to address the change for which have repeatedly and consistently call for cambridgeshire constabulary to be fund fairly and for its officer to be properly resource rise to speak to new clause otherwise know as banaz law table in my name and in memory of banaz mahmod be grateful for the cross party support that have receive for the new clause from labour conservative and liberal democrat members and for the opportunity to continue the work of my hon friend the member for birmingham yardley jess phillips and the last women and equalities committee be proud to be member of the committee banaz be young woman from south london in she be murder by her father her uncle and five male cousin in so call honour killing her crime in their eye be to leave an abusive husband whom she have bravely report for rape and violence and to seek love with man of her own choosing believe she have bring shame and dishonour upon the family they convene what they chillingly call council of war and plot her death banaz body be find month later bury in suitcase in back garden in birmingham this horrific injustice do not begin with her murder however banaz go to the police five time she report rape she name her abuser she predict her own death and still her cry for help be dismiss an investigation by the independent police complaints commission into the police handling of banaz case later find multiple serious failing this be not only family crime it be community crime police estimate that as many as man be involve in plot the murder cover it up or encourage this honour narrative banaz uncle call her death justice other call he hero banaz case be not unique shafilea ahmed somaiya begum raneem oudeh khaola saleem and fawziyah javed be all woman subject to honour base abuse the domestic abuse commissioner estimate that at least honour killing take place in the uk every year more than incident of honour base abuse be record annually but the true scale be almost certainly great while fully support the important step this bill take to tackle violence against woman and girl be concern by its insufficient focus on honour base abuse and be grateful to the minister for victims my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones for take the time to meet however must stress that subsume honour base abuse within extant law do not adequately contend with these issue and be not sufficiently capable of yield the change promise by banaz law my new clause call for honour base abuse to be recognise in law as an aggravating factor in sentencing it also call for victim survivor who act in self defence or under coercion after year of abuse to have that context recognise as mitigate factor with this new clause statutory guidance across the criminal justice system could be give so that police prosecutor and court could be train to recognise and respond to this high risk often collective form of abuse want to pay tribute to the bekhal mahmod banaz sister her courage and the tireless work of southall black sisters have bring we to this point will not be press my new clause to vote today but hope that ministers will take this opportunity to reflect on the need to take further action against all form of honour base abuse because the need for reform be undeniable will the hon lady give way order think the hon member for bolton north east kirith entwistle just run out of time remember that too raise banaz case as back bencher rise to speak in support of six of the new clause that go to the heart of our responsibility as legislator safeguard child restore public confidence in the law and defend free expression although due to the lack of time will not be able to go into they all in detail new clause stand in my name seek to ensure that where an individual under the age of have be caution or convict of child sex offence the police must notify any organisation that that child be involve in where they be with other child or an organisation that that person be seek to join this new clause stem from real case in my own constituency and would close dangerous and demonstrably harmful safeguarding loophole which have already discuss privately with the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips hope that the government will look at this as they take this legislation through the other place new clause also stand my name address another gap in legislation person ability to buy car without provide any form of verifiable id or indeed prove that they can actually drive this be in memory of andrew rowlands with the support of his family and it would make it hard for criminal and reckless driver to use untraceable vehicle with impunity and kill people as happen in andrew case new clause table by my hon friend the member for west suffolk nick timothy seek to reaffirm the right to speak freely about religion or belief include criticism satire and dissent by restore clarity to our public order law know he will be speak to it later and wholly support it it be closely align to new clause which be be put forward by the opposition front bench today we need to start address some of these non crime hate incident which think be become pernicious attack upon freedom in our society more broadly it be great to hear the hon member for lowestoft jess asato speak about pornography and some of the amendment she have put forward support new clause in fact have be do some work recently with the british board of film classification because there be clearly major issue between what be allow to be broadcast and age rat within traditional broadcast setting and what be available online there be grow body of evidence link violent and abusive pornography with increase rate of sexual aggression especially towards woman and girl fully support the new clause and hope that the government pay attention to what the hon member propose support new clause relate to cousin marriage be glad that the opposition front bench have put it forward and speak at length about the matter early in westminster hall this be not knee jerk reaction it represent the next logical step in serious and ongoing effort to protect the vulnerable and promote social cohesion have already introduce private member bill in this session on the marriage element follow the successful challenge ban virginity testing and hymenoplasty in the last session because when it come to protect woman and man from outdated coercive and harmful practice this house must not look the other way this be not about race or religion it be about freedom societal cohesion and health it be about freedom because consent be meaningless when extended family can pressure young man and woman into cousin marriage that they do not want we must stand up for those without voice and give they the legal backing to say no it be about cohesion because multigenerational cousin marriage often foster huge issue around social segregation lock individual into closed system of authority when country like norway and denmark have act decisively there be no excuse for this country to lag behind other with progressive credential it be about health because there be real risk the born in bradford study which have be go on for many year have find the real societal implication and we still do not know the full side effect of multigenerational first cousin marriage we rightly prohibit relationship where power distort consent between teacher and pupil doctor and patient and within close family setting the same logic clearly apply here as well this new clause be root in compassion not condemnation it speak to freedom especially for woman and the courage to legislate where silence simply cause harm each of these amendment address different risk child safety public accountability and freedom of expression but they be unite in the common principle that the law should protect the vulnerable demand responsibility and preserve the freedom on which healthy and confident society depend rise to support new clause table by my hon friend the member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor in fiona pilkington drive herself and her year old daughter francecca hardwick to lay by near her home she also take the family pet rabbit to soothe her daughter who have severe learning disability she then set the car on fire kill they both an inquest two year later hear how the family have be keep virtual prisoner in their home by youth who throw stone flour and other object and keep up relentless stream of abuse at the time the independent police complaints commission conclude that one of the police main failing be in not identify the abuse as hate crime the case prompt wide concern that many police force be fail to properly identify hate crime motivate by disability and thus treat they as low priority antisocial behaviour something disability campaigner say too often remain the case be proud that last year our labour manifesto commit to champion the right of disabled people and to the principle of work with they so that their view and voice will be at the heart of all we do support my hon friend new clause which would implement our manifesto commitment to protect and disabled people by make all exist strand of hate crime an aggravate offence the new clause would finally place the law commission recommendation on statutory footing as the commission have say it be undesirable for the current law to give the impression of hierarchy of victim the bill will be powerful in deliver the government safe street mission and plan for change it will help to tackle the crime that matter most to community but that have be ignore for too long after year of the tory dereliction of duty on law and order disability hate crime be one such example under the conservatives there be staggering increase of nearly in police record disability hate crime between and as chair of the appg on autism be particularly concerned about the impact on autistic people and those with learn disability hate crime can wreck life it create huge mental health problem for people with learn disability and autism people who often do have the ability to understand or cope with it those be the word of mark brookes the hate crime ambassador for the dimensions charity who be part of the with sam campaign for no more learn disability and autism hate crime aggravated offence currently exist only for offence involve racial or religious hostility the high maximum penalty available for aggravated offence be perceive to have more powerful symbolic and deterrent effect high maximum penalty mean that aggravated offence be often pursue in the crown court rather the magistrate court as the hate crime charity galop have argue the crown court be more appropriate forum for deal with the gravity and victim impact of hate offence and it have superior facility for victim have research the experience of disabled people in the criminal justice system over the past year so know that this opportunity to legislate to strengthen the law on hate crime offence must be seize disabled people enrich our society new clause would foster respect and equality for all by ensure justice for disabled victim of hate crime let start by highlight my support for new clause and which deal with neighbourhood policing they would ensure that police force be require to practise community police at level necessary to ensure effective community engagement and crime prevention it be shame that the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty be not in his place to intervene for definition on that it be about engage with local community and ward panel to define the appropriate level in their area which be sure he would support rather than take top down view the new clause would compel the secretary of state to produce an annual report on the state of community police we have outline way of funding that too of future police grant would be ringfence for community policing activity literally make crime pay in the reverse of the manner in which that phrase be normally use by allocate fund recover from the proceeds of crime act to community police that be important because commitment to police number mean little without serious action to reverse the scale of forthcoming cut such as the cut of officer and staff that we in london be about to experience this year indeed as the metropolitan police commissioner recently tell the bbc ambition and money go alongside each other urge member across the house to support those new clause will now turn to my new clause and it be good to see the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips in her place to continue conversation that we have have many time on stalk stalk be heinous crime it throw life into chaos leave victim in life change and near constant terror and too often go unpunished the current legislation force too many victim to meet an improbably high bar of evidence force they to jump through hoop to be perfect victim just to prove the scale of the threat against they have hear from victim in my sutton and cheam constituency who have have their life completely upend by their stalker and who be completely at their wit end after face so many obstacle to get justice it be clear that the two relevant section of the protection from harassment act be the root of those obstacle the distinction between less section offence and more severe section offence be fail victim and fail to recognise the total scope of stalk successful prosecution of section offence be far too hard to achieve the burden of proof be place so heavily on the victim even celebrity such as emma raducanu and other in the public eye who have be affect by stalker feel unsafe and unprotected by exist legislation do the hon member agree that be clear additional evidence that the law need strengthen the hon member provide clear and visible example of how the legislation be not work if somebody with such high profile and with additional security protection can not be protect from stalker thank he for his apt intervention the burden of proof mean that many victim withdraw from the process completely and give up on gain justice my new clause would compel the secretary of state to publish review into the two clause within six month of the act receive royal assent and to make time for that review to be properly consider in the house upon its completion they would also compel the secretary of state to launch review into the effectiveness and adequacy of the stalk awareness guidance provide by public body in england and wales and to make similar provision for proper consideration and debate in this house know that aim be support by the minister so would like to hear how it be be bring forward new clause table by my hon and gallant friend the member for tunbridge wells mike martin be incredibly important and deserve the support of the house the new clause automatically commence the protection from sex base harassment in public act when the crime and policing bill receive royal assent that he have manage to corral together such luminary in this house as the right hon member for staffordshire moorlands dame karen bradley my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart and the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy for brighton pavilion siân berry and for clacton nigel farage to support the measure be triumph in itself we speak about new clause in committee and very much support its measure on tool theft it would add the theft of tool from tradesman to the list of aggravate factor in the sentencing act and present way forward towards more sensible regulation of temporary market where too many steal tool be often sell out of car boot recently visit the kimpton industrial estate in stonecot in my constituency where hear more about the awful impact of that kind of theft from tradespeople who too often be leave with their livelihood wreck and very little proper recourse to get their life back on track other than to fork out huge amount to buy new tool which in many case be later steal again it be horrible cycle which also hear about at the stop tool theft rally on the street outside this chamber early this year the measure set out in the new clause provide good path forward but will not solve the issue alone without the kind of commitment to restore community police that mention in reference to new clause and police force will remain too overstretched to mobilise the resource to investigate these crime in the first place my hon friend talk about community police and get police officer back into the community so do he support my new clause which seek to streamline the way police case file be prepared and submit to the crown prosecution service it be common sense approach that would reduce red tape and most importantly get police back out support victim and build the community trust that they need my hon friend word have convince and hon member across the house about her new clause the met police recently respond to freedom of information request about tool theft which reveal that nine in tool theft in the last five year in london go unsolved which show the scale of the problem and the importance of support new clause today would like quickly to draw attention to some other amendment new clause and table by my hon friend the member for hazel grove would hold water company executive to account properly for the first time and that would mark huge step forward in tackle the sewage crisis we face in this country those individual should be hold liable for their carelessness and fixation with raise bill while run company into the ground and ruin our river wish have more time to outline my reason for support the clause but refer the house to my many prior contribution on the subject new clause table by the hon member for bolton north east kirith entwistle would mark step forward in provide support to victim of honour base violence and murder new clause table by the hon member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor would strengthen the law on hate crime direct at disabled people and rightly seek to protect people who be victim of hate crime because of their association with individual in those group and wholeheartedly support it in contract new clause table by the official opposition would weaken hate crime legislation in this country and fear it be motivate by complete lack of respect for the decade of progress we have make in recognise the type of discrimination face by people the length and breadth of this country for this bill to push we forward and not drag we backwards that new clause must be reject refer to my entry in the register of members financial interests as proud member of the trade union movement no one should go to work with the uncertainty each day that their safety might be put at risk we as government clearly support that for emergency worker and of course we be legislate for retail worker too new clause table by my hon friend the member for knowsley anneliese midgley address delivery worker and today stand to speak for my new clause which would do the same for transport worker every day transport worker face verbal abuse sexual harassment or physical assault whether on bus tram or ferry transport worker alongside their trade union the rmt be call for new measure to protect they at work first the introduction of specific offence of assault or abuse transport worker and secondly an extension in the maximum sentence from six to month not least if sentence be now to be serve in the community have mean to speak to my amendment today but that intention be supersede by the government movement on this which really welcome it will close loophole so that it will now be an offence to abuse an emergency worker on the ground of race religion or sexual orientation in somebody private dwelling congratulate the government on that welcome the hon member intervention this just go to show the extent to which our public servant put themselves in harm way often run towards danger on our behalf when people be serve we our constituent day in day out they deserve the protection that we be aim to introduce in this legislation let we look at the scale of the abuse our transport worker be face transport for london say that of worker be physically assault with verbally abuse and experience violence at work and that be just in the last month in fact tfl worker have incident of violence or aggression perpetrate against they more widely the british transport police highlight in that offence be commit and just in the last year there be crime with violent crime and there have be increase since out transport worker will not be safe unless more measure be include in this legislation we be also hear from other group of worker so we need to look holistically at the threat they be face and how we can put those protection in place to ensure that specific measure be available to help keep they safe that would also be well for the public we should also look at the work the rmt have do it have survey its woman worker and of transport worker who be woman have be sexually harass in the last year and that too be on the rise two third of rmt member have experience abuse violence or antisocial behaviour but have not report it as they be not confident that they will get the recourse they need this be have an impact on their health and wellbeing the level of post traumatic stress disorder experience by transport worker be double that of the general population that be why they be call for legal protection for all public transport worker because of the scale and the prevalence move forward with this will also deter perpetrator and support worker it will improve action and response time and the support that be available we in this house need only think back to the covid pandemic belly mujinga be spat at while work at victoria station and sadly lose her life she be there serve faithfully as sale clerk during that period her union the transport salaried staffs association have say while we remember belly today our union continue to fight for safe and healthy workplace for all of our member that be why be here today to fight for they alongside the trade union the british transport police the rail industry body the rail delivery group network rail and all of the transport union stand together say they need more measure to keep worker safe on our transport system we often hear about other safety risk that transport worker place themselves in but today it be about their own personal safety and be sure this house will hear it so be ask for clear support for new clause but of course be willing to meet the minister to discuss how we can advance the cause of transport worker and hope that if we can not make these amendment today we will be able to do so in the other place before turn to my new clause welcome in particular new clause on non crime hate incident and new clause propose by my right hon friend the member for basildon and billericay mr holden which would ban sexual relationship between first cousin this bill present an opportunity for the government to support my new clause to protect freedom of expression that be urgently need because existing legislation have be manipulate to create blasphemy law for the protection of islam from criticism and protest as say in my speech last week be not muslim and reject any attempt to tell that can not say what think about any religion no idea or belief should be above criticism or scrutiny the transformation of the public order act which have become britain de facto blasphemy law need to be reverse section and of the act be now use to prosecute individual for express legitimate opinion the law be be twist make the protester responsible for the potentially violent reaction of those who can not deal with criticism of their belief the introduction of offence for religious hatred back in raise enough concern about free speech from parliamentarian across the spectrum to lead to section of the public order act the legislation protect freedom of expression state clearly nothing in this part shall be read or give effect in way which prohibit or restrict discussion criticism or expression of antipathy dislike ridicule insult or abuse of particular religion or the belief or practice of their adherent that be very welcome but it apply only to part of the act that be why my amendment would extend section to the whole of the public order act to section of the malicious communications act and to section of the communications act people from across the country have write to express their support for my new clause as introduce it in similar form in ten minute rule bill last week thank in particular fiyaz mughal from tell mama for his support some have express concern for my safety in make this case in so do they reinforce just how grave the crisis of our freedom of expression have become it have be encouraging to receive cross party support for my new clause but be disappoint although not terribly surprised that not one member from the liberal democrats have support it or voice their opposition to the revival in this debate and recently of blasphemy law that be not very liberal not very democratic and not very appropriate for the party of gladstone this government and political leader in general must be much braver and more honest about how we deal with the threat to free speech from the threat of violence but we see the opposite when have ask question about this issue ministers have stick to their line to take insist that we do not have blasphemy report june vol in this country when everyone know that actually in effect we do even bad the government plan to impose definition of islamophobia on we that would stop criticism of islam and islamic practice clamp down even more firmly on free speech and empower extremist while let down the pluralist and moderate in the british muslim population the hon gentleman be make really impassione speech in some way agree with element of what he be say be involve in extensive discussion with the humanist recently about exactly this issue gentleman be prosecute for burn koran and he just want to express his displeasure to the turkish government do the hon gentleman not think it would be preferable to ensure that the law be be adhere to correctly by those who administer it in the court rather than try to bring in an additional law that could damage religious relation in some way thank the hon lady for her contribution but the point be that the court be interpret the law as they see it if we in this place believe that interpretation to be wrong it be our job to correct it through legislation and think the appropriate way to do so would be to extend section of the act in the way have describe will the hon gentleman give way do not know whether the minister be allow to intervene but she would be welcome to do so interruption she have be here long than have we do discuss whether or not be allow to intervene have be involve with case of harassment and malicious communication involve antisemitism and anti jewish hatred be the hon gentleman suggest that criticise jewish people should be allow no think the minister have misunderstand my point actually be about to move on to related issue which be that hat people and discriminate against they on the basis that they be muslims or indeed member of different religious group be already crime if someone be harass jewish people in the way that the minister have just describe that would be criminal offence even if my amendment pass however as be say islamophobia be make up and nonsensical concept that elide the protection of individual from hatred with the protection of idea and belief and in my view be therefore completely unacceptable in principle can ask the hon gentleman what he would like to tell the family of mohammed saleem the year old grandfather who be stab simply for be muslim that be obviously an appalling crime remember it very well but do not think it have anything to do with what be say in this debate in free and pluralistic society we have to be free to criticise idea there be law to protect people but we can not have law that protect idea from scrutiny or criticism however the government be press on with their work on islamophobia only this week on the very day that baroness casey say that the rape gang be often not prosecute because of the ethnicity of the perpetrator ministers launch consultation on the new islamophobia definition that consultation be open only to carefully select invite organisation it will last for only four week and it allow contributor to remain anonymous in other word as lot of people have put it to it be rig and that be completely unacceptable parliament repeal blasphemy law year ago and trial for blasphemy have stop many decade back in any case but they be with we once more parliament must act to restore our freedom of expression briefly would like to express my support for new clause declare my interest as be chair of the rmt parliamentary group and this issue be part of our campaigning particularly give the rise number of assault on bus driver at the moment also express my support for new clause and congratulate the hon member for liverpool riverside kim johnson on her determined campaign on the joint enterprise initiative of course also support new clause which deal with the right to protest and who could not support new clause after the speech we have hear from labour members today want to raise an anomaly that have arise in debate about terrorism legislation since do not want to go into too much technical detail but basically section of the sentencing act give the crown prosecution service the power to allege terrorist connection if the offence be or take place in the course of an act of terrorism or be commit for the purpose of terrorism the implementation of that legislation mean that if an offence be determined to have terrorist connection the sentence become aggravate and harsh restriction be impose both within prison and on release believe that have cross party support there be no problem with it however in the counter terrorism and sentencing act come along the power in the sentencing act relate to schedule offence such as murder kidnapping and hijacking thing that we would naturally consider to be terrorism the counter terrorism and sentencing act extend the use of that definition to an offence that be punishable on indictment with imprisonment for more than year by move away from schedule of offence almost any offence before the crown court meeting that definition be bring into consideration for example protest case involve damage of more than become interpret as terrorist connect case when we have have discussion about terrorism we have always have problem with definition lord carlile do report for we way back in and he say that jury trial be one of the guard that can assist in protect we from the misinterpretation of the range of definition he say that jury trial provide an important protection against prosecution the public find unreasonable or arbitrary the problem be that the use of this section of the counter terrorism and sentencing act do not involve jury such thing be not bring before jury it be apply only by the judge at sentencing as result we have find that since late the provision in the act have be deploy for the first time against protester someone who have possibly commit criminal damage aggravate burglary or yes violent disorder in protest activity now find themselves with terrorist connection allegation that will never be bring before jury because it will be apply only at sentencing amnesty international have express its concern about direct action protest be subject to the uk overly broad definition of terrorism law which be open to misuse and abuse four un rapporteur have express their concern to the government about the misuse of the terrorism legislation in this instance they have say that the legislation be be use against political prisoner which be raise concern about the potential infringement of their fundamental right raise that issue here because an increase number of case be be trap by misinterpretation of the legislation that we bring forward in and that be result think in injustice and miscarriage of justice an anomaly which we will have to address at some point if we do not address in this bill to correct crucial misinterpretation of what this house intend back in rise the speak limit be now reduce to four minute will not be able to speak to all the amendment that member have work so hard on and that have support so many time by put my name to they but the member know that support they new clause and in particular new clause be all important proposal that the government should listen to do not support new clause from the official opposition and can not support new clause and as do not believe there be any evidence that those measure would help make sex worker safe we have to respect evidence and listen to sex worker and their voice on these issue principally rise today to speak to my new clause and and new clause from the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel first new clause would require the home office to publish quarterly datum on antisocial behaviour order include the number of time that stop and search power be use prior to such order be issue and the protect characteristic of individual who receive those order that be important scrutiny to make sure the power be be exercise fairly new clause would enable regulation to vary the ability of police force to use stop and search power specifically it would require the government to suspend the use of those power by any police force subject to engage status under his majesty inspectorate of constabulary and fire and rescue service if force have reach the point of require formal monitoring due to systemic issue it be right that the most intrusive and abuse police power be subject to heighten scrutiny or even suspension new clause would prohibit the deployment and use of certain form of predictive police technology particularly those that rely on automate decision making profiling and artificial intelligence to assess the likelihood that individual or group will commit criminal offence my hon friend will recognise that danger such technology however cleverly sell will always need to be build on exist flawed police datum or datum from other flawed and biased public and private source that mean that community that have historically be over policed will be more likely to be identify as be at risk of future criminal behaviour as have always say in the context of facial recognition question of accuracy and bias be not the only reason to be against these technology at their heart they infringe human right include the right to privacy and the right to be presume innocent my new clause and new clause table by the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel be intend to preserve our right to protest my new clause would remove the definition of serious disruption from the public order act that new concept be extremely broad and lead to arbitrary application and confusion with police impose criminal sanction and other anti protest measure on action that simply do not qualify liberty recently win judicial review case in the court of appeal relate to the public order act serious disruption to the life of the community regulations the regulation seek to define the phrase serious disruption but the court side with liberty however because the same wording as that which be challenge be use in section of the public order act the definition remain in force leave it in place be legally confusing and could breach our obligation under article and of the european convention on human right therefore urge my colleague to support the new clause refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests and my membership of the trade union usdaw rise to support new clause table by my hon friend the member for knowsley anneliese midgley before become member of parliament be proud to campaign for many year alongside retail worker as part of usdaw freedom from fear campaign which successfully highlight the epidemic of abuse and violence face by retail worker and bring together worker employer and sectoral body for year there have be consensus outside this place that something need to be do but here there have be no consensus warm word do not lead to the necessary action from the last government the sacrifice make by retail worker during the pandemic be quickly forget and give that the late figure from usdaw show that one in retail worker and one in eight delivery driver have be assault at work in the past month it be well past time for we all to remember that these be frontline worker provide vital service that be why the introduction of new stand alone offence of assault retail worker be so vital and so welcome too many worker have suffer life change injury while simply try to enforce the law or provide service uphold age restrict sale be key part of their role bring with it unique challenge it be not small responsibility but legal duty that often act as flashpoint for abuse failure to comply carry serious consequence for the worker include disciplinary action or prosecution we in this chamber put that duty on they we hold they accountable and we need to give they the protection that they deserve the new stand alone offence will provide clear deterrent give prosecutor well tool and send powerful message to offender that abuse will not be tolerate thank my hon friend for support the new clause and for sign it along with other member do he agree that our hard work delivery driver in the freight and logistic sector also need such backing give that they often face attack at knifepoint while deliver what our country need welcome my hon friend intervention but do not need to interrupt my speech because be about to deal with exactly that point new clause would create specific offence along similar line to cover delivery worker which be incredibly welcome these worker deserve protection just as much as in store staff they too be require to enforce the law and conduct age check and this bill place additional requirement on they regard the delivery of knife but unlike in store staff they carry out their work without the safety net of colleague security or familiar surrounding as be the case in scotland follow the passage of the protection of workers retail and age restrict goods and services scotland act home delivery driver must be include it be only right that delivery worker in england and wales receive equal protection which must not stop at the shop door we should never underestimate the important contribution of retail worker they serve our community bring essential to our door and keep the nation feed without they the country would grind to halt new clause provide the opportunity to give retail worker the protection they so obviously deserve and urge hon member to take that opportunity and to send clear message from this place that abuse be not part of the job rise to support new clause in the name of my hon friend the member for stockton west matt vickers on monday the government hastily come to the house to deliver yet another turn and to announce national inquiry into rape gang it be apparent that this turn be force on they because whenever any member of the public or member of parliament say that they want national inquiry the response from the government be that they be far right jump on bandwagon or even blow dog be the word use by ministers on the front bench this be hasty turn in fact those on the government front bench be somewhat take aback as it appear that the prime minister have appoint baroness casey of blackstock in the hope that the whole thing would go away and that the inquiry would not happen she say that she change her mind because of the weight of evidence that confront she her word be think have surprise people in downing street and beyond she do and the clincher be that the local inquiry be inadequate because local authority could decide whether they be go to commission an inquiry and the government would not intervene she also say that of the five local inquiry only one come forward that be in oldham there be reluctance from local area to face up to the fact and to accept their failing denial run through absolutely everything denial be like poisonous thread it weave its way through all public body strangle the truth and stop justice come forward it be essential that an investigation be hold into all the failing of the police local authority prosecutor charity and political party the prime minister himself be in denial until saturday when the turn be force upon he he often brandish his credential as the former director of public prosecution and in he pen an article for the guardian in which he acknowledge that there be at least victim but he do nothing until the turn be force upon he we need to ask question about the statutory inquiry because the public need to know the answer who will chair the inquiry what type of inquiry will it be it already seem to have be water down will it be independent national inquiry or as it now seem national commission what be the term of reference it be not good enough to say that we will hear in due course what be the inquiry power that be unclear will there be judicial power to subpoena people to give evidence welcome the inquiry and the investigation into who be responsible for help this scourge to continue unabated but do the right hon lady agree that the recommendation of the jay review urgently need to be implement and that the inquiry should not delay the implementation of those recommendation the inquiry should not delay that but the inquiry need to be do with speed and haste not be water down and not brush under the carpet because it be essential that the victim voice be hear and that they have justice the house also need assurance there will be no exemption from prosecution in exchange for evidence it need to know if witness can be compel to produce document protect by public interest immunity when will that happen it be not good enough that the home secretary be say that it would be three year away close to general election it need to be do as soon as possible also wonder why it will be statutory inquiry not criminal inquiry be it because criminal inquiry can lead to arrest charge and criminal prosecution whereas statutory inquiry tend to make series of recommendation to then be act on at the end of this inquiry will we see prosecution will we see deportation time and again we hear that community cohesion be put above working class girl that can not ever happen again that issue be not investigate for fear of people be label racist can not ever happen again if somebody do wrong the colour of their skin or their religion do not matter they have do wrong if they have commit criminal act it be right that they be bring to justice this government will not get away with water down national inquiry they have be drag kick and scream to deliver national inquiry that national inquiry need to be deliver rise to speak in strong support of new clause table by my hon friend the member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor be proud to be the first signatory to it as believe it represent vital step forward in the protection of some of the most marginalised people in our society new clause would amend the crime and policing bill to create aggravate offence where the underlie crime be motivate by hostility because of person sexual orientation transgender identity disability or perceive identity it would align the legal treatment of those form of hate with the framework that already exist for racially and religiously aggravate offence it deliver on promise promise that we in the labour party make in our manifesto to the british people that we would act to close the gap in our hate crime law and provide equal protection to people and disabled people in the criminal justice system it be about live up to our value labour be the party of equality fairness before the law and stand with those whose voice have too often be ignore that be why join the labour party and this amendment be root in that tradition it be also fitting that we be table this new clause in pride month and in the wake of the supreme court ruling which have cause so much anguish among the trans community we know the scale of the problem hate crime base on sexual orientation have rise by over the last five year against tran people that figure be the charity galop which support victim of abuse see increase in referral in the last year alone in the year end march disability hate crime incident be report shamefully just of that hate crime involve violence result in charge and yet still the majority of incident go unreported too many victim still believe the system be not on their side new clause give we the opportunity to change that it would give police and prosecutor clear route to charge and convict offender in way that truly reflect the nature of these crime know what it mean to think twice about how you walk down street to pause before hold someone hand and to wonder whether that shout from across the road be something that you can ignore or that you can not afford to ignore and know be not alone in that have speak to my constituent and to people from far beyond who tell they do not feel safe reporting hate when it happen they do not believe they will be take seriously there be profound failure of trust one that we in this house have duty to repair this be also about dignity it be about recognise that whether you be trans teenager be punch in park gay couple be spat at on the tube or disabled man be harass on his way to work all people deserve the full protection of the law they deserve to know that this country be on their side and that if they be target for who they be justice will not look the other way new clause would provide vital protection for disabled people who remain far too invisible in the public conversation around hate crime despite face damaging harassment violence and abuse every single day this change be recommend by the law commission and support by stonewall galop and disability rights uk be proud that it be back by right hon and hon member across the house people be simply ask to live their life in peace and have the right support when thing go wrong hope we can take step forward in advance right and disability right today be proud to follow the hon member for burton and uttoxeter jacob collier who make an incredibly powerful speech if people do not feel safe in their neighbourhood those neighbourhood will not thrive child be deny their independence because parent fear let they walk to school or play in the park while business suffer from not only the financial impact of shoplifting and worry about the safety of their worker but the reluctance of customer especially the elderly who do not feel safe go out to those shop when trust between different part of our community break down the very fabric of our society be weaken to lead good life we all need to feel safe therefore welcome the government mission for safe street and the commitment in their manifesto which rightly state visible neighbourhood policing be the cornerstone of the british consent base model in too many area it have be erode leave the police reactive service focus on crisis response rather than prevent crime however action speak louder than word while the promise of thousand of extra police officer be welcome the national police chiefs council have make clear that the amount fall far short of what be require to fund the government ambition and maintain the exist workforce it fully support the government drive to cut crime and grow officer number but say that for those goal to succeed investment in policing must live up to the ambition let bring this close to home dorset be one of the lowest fund police force in the country and too be sad that the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty be not present to hear say that agree with his concern about the funding formula be pleased that dorset crime level be low than in many other area and accept that area that face daily serious crime need the investment however our small semi rural town and village often feel completely forget in community across mid dorset and north poole organise shoplifting be now on the rise offender know the chance of be catch be slim welcome the bill inclusion of the offence of assault retail worker on behalf of michelle nicola and lewis who have all write to one be tell by shoplifter who have be apprehend in her shop know where you live however this new offence be meaningless without enough police officer embed in our neighbourhood another retailer tell we have extensive cctv headset alarm system panic button and anpr camera but the individual involve have no respect or fear of police action they realise that the police be not equip to tackle it and do not believe the government think it be politically important dorset be home to award win beach world heritage coastline and many historic town and village we be less than two hour from london the home county and the midland our population swell in the summer put huge pressure on police service yet there be no recognition in police budget of the need to boost police number to reflect the seasonal demand that be why support new clause and in the name of my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart which would require minimum level of neighbourhood police town like wimborne and wareham should not have their resource strip to support large coastal town be also proud to support new clause which would make offence aggravate when motivate by hostility towards sexual orientation transgender identity or disability we live in an increasingly divide society and division and hate in the virtual world be fuel real world crime people be four time more likely to experience violence than their straight counterpart disabled adult be three time more likely to experience domestic abuse and half of all transgender people have be sexually assault at least once in their lifetime that be why can not support new clause which would remove the recording and retention of non crime hate incident if we stop record those incident what would say to my constituent samreena who tell flee domestic violence be practise muslim and wear hijab since the day arrive have face problem because of my religious identity she say that go to park take the bus and go shop all feel like war zone we want safe street and safe home but they will be safe only if they be safe for everyone order intend to start front bench speech at around pm it be completely unacceptable for anyone to face abuse harassment or discrimination due to their race disability religion or belief sexual orientation or gender identity hate crime have profound and lasting impact on their victim as they target the very essence of who person be in the year end march over hate crime base on sexual orientation and nearly target transgender individual be record in england and wales these be not just statistic these be real people and they represent real trauma and systemic failure to protect some of the most marginalised member of our society we have see this in my constituency with an appalling homophobic attack on young man outside local pub only this april that be why strongly support new clause table by my hon friend the member for north warwickshire and bedworth rachel taylor the new clause would create statutory aggravate offence for crime motivate by hostility towards person sexual orientation transgender identity or disability or even the perception of these characteristic it would also extend protection to those target because of their association with individual from these community this amendment be vital step in recognise the specific harm cause by hate motivated offence it ensure that perpetrator of such crime whether they involve physical violence harassment or criminal damage be hold fully accountable under law it send clear message that hate have no place in our society and that the law will reflect that while the amendment strengthen the legal framework we must acknowledge that legislation alone can not dismantle prejudice we must go far first we must improve report mechanism many lgbtq and disabled individual do not report hate crime due to the fear of be dismiss or retraumatise police force must build trust through community engagement and training that reflect the live experience of those most affected secondly we must invest in education hatred be not innate it be learn school must be empower to deliver inclusive curriculum that promote empathy respect and understanding from an early age education be our most powerful tool in prevent hate before it take root thirdly we must ensure that support service for victim be fully fund and accessible that include mental health support legal aid and safe space for those recover from trauma victim must know that they be not alone and that help be available my message be clear everyone have the right to feel safe and we must collectively adopt zero tolerance stance against hate crime this amendment be not just legal reform but moral imperative and for we it be manifesto promise it reflect the value of the labour party and wide society which consist of dignity equality and justice for all let we pass this amendment and continue the work of build country where everyone can live free from fear and hatred call shockat adam to make the final back bench speech would like to speak briefly to the issue of live facial recognition and new clause and in my name new clause call for ban on live facial recognition because it be not safe lack legal legitimacy and be an attack on the fundamental democratic right of the british people it be the choice of authoritarian state and dictator and should have no place in british policing which remind the minister be still by consent the technology be not safe it be describe by the court of appeal as novel and controversial academic have show that the technology make mistake in the recognition of dark skin woman in to of case yet of light skin man be identify correctly caucasian female be also not safe just ask danielle horan who be escort out of not one but two home bargains store due to an apparent facial recognition mix up it be no wonder that the court of appeal in strike down the south wales experiment rule it breach of public sector equality duty in fail to recognise possible bias in the algorithm facial recognition lack legal legitimacy by operate under vague common law power unlike dna or fingerprint it be also an attack on hard win democratic right undermine the principle that people should not be force to identify themselves to police without suspicion it have be use to monitor protester thus deter lawful participation and threaten free assembly which be some of our most important and enshrined civil liberty just ask the protester pick up in russia underground train station or protester and uyghurs in china the government must think again new clause call for broad safeguard on automate decision make to ensure that law enforcement do not solely rely on ai algorithm and that there be always human review of its use the new clause also call for transparency for the right of people both to know what information be hold about they and to contest decision make by any ai and to stop abuse by put in the necessary check those check must meet high global standard recommend by human right organisation and the good practice standard of our neighbour in the eu without human safeguard the government be usher in minority report world potential dystopia where the computer simply say no and there be nothing we as individual can do about it unamended the bill be dangerous and intrusive and break the fundamental contract between the british people and the police along with the fundamental right to be consider innocent until prove otherwise for those who think that that will never happen here please take look across the atlantic it certainly can happen here it be time for the government to admit that they have get this wrong it be sign of strong not weak government if they listen to the evidence and change course as result live facial recognition be not the answer and will cause more problem than it claim to solve it need to go call the liberal democrat spokesperson our community have be plague by crime and antisocial behaviour for too long change be clearly need after the former conservative government fail to get even the basic right on stop and solve crime more than police community support officer have be take off the street since and more than million crime go unsolved across england and wales in even though there be many measure that we welcome in this wide range bill we have hear some impassioned speech today and look forward to vote in favour of some change it remain the case that opportunity for the government to take real action in number of area from crack down on sewage dumping and rural crime to support real return to proper neighbourhood policing have not be take will focus my remark on the amendment in my name the previous conservative government let water company get away with pumping sewage into our river and on to our beach for year create an environmental crisis and public health emergency while the company executive hand themselves huge bonus this government have take some step in the right direction but in our opinion they have not go nearly far enough everyone deserve the right to enjoy clean safe river in their local community yet our waterway have be pollute often with impunity by water company that operate under weak regulation and with the complicity of negligent conservative government who vote time and again throughout the last parliament against tough action on sewage dumping the scale of the crisis be undeniable accord to the government own datum there be more than sewage spill in alone release million hour worth of sewage into our river and coastal water today just of river and lake in the uk be in good ecological health and despite that environmental failure water company executive pocket million in pay and bonus in the financial year that be damn reflection of system that reward pollution and punish the public with high bill and dirty river in my hazel grove constituency sewage discharge into water body last year cumulatively last for almost day at the otterspool road outflow alone sewage flow into the beautiful river goyt for more than hour the liberal democrats have push and will continue to push to hold the company and their leadership to account particularly commend my hon friend the member for witney charlie maynard for his effort in hold thames water to account for its failure last year liberal democrat amendment to the criminal justice bill suggest create an offence of fail to meet pollution performance commitment level but it be defeat by the conservative government as we have scrutinise this bill it be clear that we be again witness government that do not go far enough to reform broken water industry or hold polluter to account lib dems have plan to do exactly that with new clause we would create new offence of fail to meet pollution commitment level while new clause would create senior manager liability for failure to meet those commitment level if this government be serious about end the national scandal of sewage dumping they really should stop shield those responsible and start deliver real accountability the people in our local community have right to feel safe walk their street but the previous conservative government demolish community policing slash police community support officer number and leave more crime than ever unpunished our community massively value the excellent work do by local police team so they acutely feel this loss be sure that be not alone in hear from constituent about rise in shop theft whether it be from pet shop nail salon or even charity shop and we have see that in my own constituency in recent month be also sure that be not alone in hear report of people on illegal off road bike intimidate resident and cause serious accident as they do in offerton and high lane in my patch liberal democrat new clause and would help to restore community police the visible trust bobby on the beat these new clause would guarantee minimum level of neighbourhood police and require every local authority in england and wales to have dedicated team assign solely to community base duty be my hon friend as surprised as be to hear the contribution from the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty who seem to ridicule the concept of have minimum level of police for community which would surely protect they and help to prevent theft of farm equipment which be the example he give in his speech do not know why anybody would be against minimum level of neighbourhood police it be in this government manifesto that they want to see proper restoration of neighbourhood police it be the model that have the most trust and the most support from my community and be pretty sure everybody community and it seem daft frankly to oppose such measure at no point do say that be against minimum level of neighbourhood police merely point out that the liberal democrats new clause be simply not good enough in articulate that point this be where would encourage the liberal democrats to put pressure on the policing minister to change the police allocation formula be grateful to the hon gentleman for time his arrival to the chamber so beautifully that be skill agree with he about the importance of neighbourhood police also agree that the funding formula should put enough weight behind neighbourhood police so that all our community that need that strong neighbourhood police get it interruption can not hear the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy who be speak from sedentary position but would be delighted to take an intervention be invite the hon lady to withdraw what she and her colleague say about my hon friend because it be incorrect do not recall mention the hon member hon friend say that somebody say that it be incorrect to have minimum level of neighbourhood policing be daft and hold to that belief new clause and relate to rural crime in rural area organise gangs target farm machinery vehicle and gps equipment the cost of which soar to more than million in accord to the national farmers union and hear for myself when meet local farmer recently about the impact that organise fly tipping and equipment theft have must applaud the work of my hon friend the member for north cornwall ben maguire who have be remarkably effective in push the government on this area in particular he secure from the home secretary commitment to establish new rural and wildlife crime strategy which of course be welcome liberal democrat new clause and would extend the equipment theft prevention act to explicitly include the theft of gps equipment and establish rural crime taskforce to ensure that the new rural and wildlife crime strategy can be as effective as possible something that be discuss often in this house be duty of candour and its introduction be commitment that welcome from this government justice must be accessible to all and survivor should never have their trauma compound by government and court that fail to uncover the truth and hold those responsible to account as happen after the hillsborough disaster it continue to be deeply disappointing to see how slow this government have be in implement legal duty of candour new clause would ensure that police officer must be open and honest in all investigation and oversight process share relevant information proactively and truthfully failure to do so would lead to misconduct charge include serious consequence for intentional or reckless breach too many police officer be struggle to access the mental health support they need with grow number on mental health leave as result so new clause seek to deal with that issue we would require every police force to ensure that all police get proper training on how to deal with that will conclude by commend my hon and gallant friend the member for tunbridge wells mike martin on his work on new clause he be dress in the colour of all party represent the cross party work he have carry out to get support for it urge the government and colleague across the house to back that new clause and the change that have outline so that our community get the action they so urgently need call the shadow minister may have say it yesterday but it can not be say enough once again pay tribute to the hard work of police officer pcso and police staff across the country they put themselves in harm way every day to keep our street safe under immense pressure hope that every member across the house will join in thank they for their service yesterday mention the opposition support for many of the measure in the bill although give that the vast majority be carry over from the previous government criminal justice bill it be probably no great surprise enforce the bill will require resource have already outline concern about funding for our police force and the devastating impact that will have on frontline police number ask that question of the minister yesterday and be not quite sure hear an answer will the minister confirm whether there will be more police officer at the end of this parliament than the record high level achieve by the last government in march interruption yes the high number on record turn to new clause which relate to tool theft and declare an interest as the son of builder not toolmaker he be not toolmaker no tool theft be completely out of control and know the impact it have on people life research from direct line show that tool theft be report to the police in single year amount to one every minute this country be build on the back of our tradesman they be the small business that make huge contribution to our economy and literally build the world around we just imagine get up at daft to go to work and earn living leave the house only to find your van have be completely raid and all the tool steal the ability to work be steal as well the impact be huge it be not only the cost of replace the steal tool but day of lose work and disappointed customer many of whom may have take day off work themselves the issue be make bad still when tradesman go to car boot sale only to see steal equipment be sell in broad daylight with no action take by the authority in recent month have be campaign alongside tradesman for real action on this issue just last week the leader of the opposition and my hon friend the member for old bexley and sidcup mr french meet tradesman business and the police to hear at first hand about the impact we hear from campaigner include the gas expert shoaib awan and frankie from on the tools alongside affect business such as checkatrade balfour beatty and bt openreach if the conservatives have win year in government would they have start to tackle this epidemic one of the thing we be do be put record funding into police and put record number of police on the street the one thing we be not do be tax our police force off the street we be make huge progress would also like to mention sergeant dave catlow of the metropolitan police who join we last week he be do great work on this issue new clause propose three key change first fine for perpetrator would equate to the cost of replace equipment repair the damage cause and the loss of work secondly theft of tool would be treat as an aggravated offence mean tough sentence for the crook who steal tradesman vital equipment finally council would be require to put in place an enforcement plan to crack down on the sale of steal tool at car boot sale will also take this opportunity to pay tribute to the hon member for portsmouth north amanda martin for her campaign on this issue know how much she too want to see action on tool theft as the minister know my hon friend the member for mid buckinghamshire greg smith bring the equipment theft prevention act through the house it could make real difference on this issue will the minister confirm when the government will table statutory instrument to put it into action turn to non crime hate incident new clause would change legislation and guidance to remove the recording and retention of non crime hate incident the use of non crime hate incident have spiral out of all control and well beyond its originally intend purpose the deal should be simple if the law be break justice must be serve but non crime hate incident be different beast you do not break the law you just say something daft and end up log on police record like criminal we need our police on the street not police hurty word on twitter we have all see the utterly barmy story of nine year old who insult another pupil in the playground be that unkind yes of course it be but instead of quiet word with teacher or call to the parent the police be bring in appeal to member across the house would they want that happen to their child or would they rather give they proper telling off at home this also have big effect our police officer be be tie up document playground spat and twitter comment treat childish jibe like national security threat while real crime such as burglary robbery and even violent offence be be push to the back of the queue in fact research from policy exchange have find that nationally over police hour be be spend on non crime hate incident our police need to get back to keep our street safe not police silly word or childish playground issue before conclude my remark would like to draw the house attention to some of the opposition other amendment that could protect our community and keep our street safe we would have be vote today on new clause to secure that national statutory inquiry into groom gang scandal that be our country shame child sexual exploitation ruin live prey on the most vulnerable in our community exploit they for horrific sexual act and often coerce they into life of crime national inquiry be what the victim want so be glad that the prime minister have finally turn give into the pressure and join what he describe as the far right bandwagon of people who want national inquiry as the leader of the opposition say yesterday we must not have another whitewash the national inquiry must ask the hard question and leave no stone unturned criminal investigation must run in parallel to the inquiry it must look at the whole system whitehall the crown prosecution service the police and local authority and wherever there be wrongdoing there should be prosecution foreign perpetrator must be immediately deport and the inquiry must be fully independent with statutory power cover all relevant town local council simply can not be leave to investigate themselves new clause aim to reinstate people confidence in police we have recently see the perverse anti racism commitment issue by the national police chiefs council it call for arrest rate to be artificially engineer to be the same across racial group advice to treat black and white suspect differently be morally indefensible it be by definition two tier policing it undermine trust and confidence in our police this new clause would give the home secretary the power to amend or require the withdrawal of any code of practice intend to direct policing practice new clause make provision in relation to off road bike know many member across the house know the havoc be cause by they in local community the issue have be raise by member on both side of the house numerous time in westminster hall and in this place and the tweak in approach that feature in this bill will simply not be enough use alternative legislation the police be already able to seize off road bike without notice the new clause would remove the prohibition on the police enter private dwelling to confiscate an off road bike and ensure that police destroy seize bike rather than sell they back into the market urge the minister in fact beg she to look again comprehensively at how we tackle the scourge of off road bike would also like to draw the house attention to new clause which would introduce mandatory deportation for foreign national find in possession of child sexual abuse image these sick paedophile have no place in our country and they along with all foreign offender should be deport to conclude the british people want our police to be able to focus on put real criminal behind bar the thief who nick our hard work tradesman tool not spend time police playground squabble and treat they like crime our opposition new clause be common sense change that hope the whole house will get behind protect victim and restore police to what

in that whether this government focus on investment zone improved infrastructure or high perform college that turn people out who be work fit and raring to go they have the ability to target growth into area where the engine that once power our economy stop run too many year ago my constituency have the stockton and darlington railway which begin the passenger railway since the election after year of tory dither and delay we be proud to have have million put into world class train factory do my hon friend agree that with the right investment by an active labour government the industrial area that power our past can really power our future totally agree with my hon friend that be the way in which we supercharge our constituency it be about recognise their strength and work with the local community local government and our mp to ensure we get the investment we need we also have to focus on the fact that previous government have consistently rely on treasury methodology to determine their priority apply cost benefit analysis framework that always result in the city and huge conurbation score highly open up wave of funding for infrastructure and investment it be formula that be apply across government influence wide range of decision include where flood alleviation scheme go and where sport provision and support for heritage and the art end up it be not just red wall area that be impact by that methodology and welcome the fact that hon friend from scotland and cornwall be in their place and northern ireland as well and northern ireland of course will never forget the hon gentleman it go without say the treasury use of that formula be the simple explanation for why we have leave behind town across the whole of the uk value and welcome the fact that the government have listen and have resolve to overhaul the green book and use place base analysis as an integral element of the formula in future thank my hon friend the member for rossendale and darwen andy macnae for his work with ministers on this issue that change be fundamental because be leave behind mean failure we have government who be only interested in the easy solution and be willing to see part of the country become no go area for new industry and new opportunity thank my hon friend for the acknowledgement the green book review have rightly identify issue of capacity and capability when it come to business case development in certain area and of course the spending review allocate lot of money to area with high capability such as manchester and liverpool that highlight the opportunity that devolution will eventually bring to place such as lancashire which have be leave behind for too long but do my hon friend agree that we can not wait we need to see proper investment in develop the capacity and capability that lancashire need to bring forward its own business case now totally agree with my hon friend this be absolutely urgent which be why we stand to be mps and why we be champ at the bit for change it be why we be all in the chamber tonight congratulate my hon friend on secure this debate and think the fact that so many member be in the chamber for an adjournment debate show the importance of this subject while she be talk about the immediate output need can make my usual plea to member on the treasury bench via you mr speaker when the industrial strategy which be so important to all our community come it must address the chronic crippling effect of industrial energy price which be hurt so many of the manufacture sector we have mention today whether it be in bassetlaw in stoke on trent or even in chorley there will be business that be struggle know that my hon friend agree but when the minister address we later hope she will be able to confirm that industrial energy price will be deal with in the industrial strategy to benefit we all have hear from all my hon friend from stoke on trent who be currently see the demise of the ceramics industry that can not go on and the cause be high energy price the most recent datum from show that of manufacture job in stoke on trent be in ceramic ceramic especially advanced ceramic be critical to strategic industry such as defence nuclear energy and steel do my hon friend agree that the industrial strategy must recognise the foundational industry of ceramic which be vital for the future not only of stoke on trent but the country thank my hon friend for her contribution hope that minister be listen as the product produce in the three constituency of my hon friend from stoke on trent be critical for our industrial future my challenge to government be to bring forward an industrial strategy that allow the whole nation to grow but also resource and target the town that be cry out for change begin by demand skill revolution in our post industrial area for much of the past century area such as mine be dominate by key industry in bassetlaw we have thousand of man work down the pit while their wife sister and mother head into the big textile factory the history of key industry be not exclusive to bassetlaw there be vital and historic british industry with their root in many red wall area ceramic fishing automotive steel and shipping all dominate the midland and the north of england while some still remain they be struggle fight an ongoing international race for cheap labour and part with successive government fail they time and again in bassetlaw as the mine close and the textile factory move to country with cheap labour the employment opportunity shift with warehousing and logistic spring up on the old pit site at that time skill provision under the auspex of the manpower services commission develop into simplistic system it be literally control by the main employer who want to mould the workforce into their own need from age in bassetlaw it be tony wilkinson of wilko and richard budge of budge mining who run the system for small number skill training be via the university route with most never return the middle ground between the two be low priority for government and the lazy solution have be to import the skill we need that be the history of the past year where cheap import skill have be use to meet industry short term need methodically sideline local young people and add to soar legal migration we have the kernel of an alternative with high skilled apprenticeship but they be not yet ingrain across the system or the country as chorley rossendale and darwen have have mention feel it be only right that the member for blackburn should speak do the hon member agree that we need to invest in our people in local business and in small business our people in blackburn and the surround area have the ability and the creativity all they need be bit of investment bit more support and push totally agree with the hon member an industrial strategy have to support the sme because they have to be part of the supply chain they have to be part of that engine of growth because they be an integral part of all our community want to see they benefit when there be big industrial investment they be part of that chain and they can grow with it rise the final intervention on the point of skill there be risk with non mayoral area that we do not get the same level of investment as go into city mayoral area do my hon friend agree that it be important that we see that money flow into all our community across the united kingdom again totally agree with my hon friend be fortunate as have new mayor the mayor of the east midlands can already see the benefit of have mayoral combine authority that partnership with local government the mayor and be critical for investment have conversation with she on saturday and talk about my hon friend area because area like his will get leave behind if they do not have the opportunity to have combine authority and mayor it make an incredible difference and my ask of government be to move fast and get that sorted interruption need to wind up be be tell so will go to the end of my speech to give the minister the opportunity to wind up as the debate be wind up just want to give the good people at hansard an opportunity to record the fact that not single conservative or reform mp be here in the chamber to listen to this important debate come on this debate be far too important to start score

proud coalmining area for year with textile and heavy industry make the town an economic and industrial force to be reckon with however our town be show the neglect of year of the tories and year of
