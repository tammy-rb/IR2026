we be take every step we can in relation to the steel industry because it be vital that we give it the support that it need we need steel in this country we need to steel make in this country and our plan and our mission mean that we be go to need more steel not less it be the duty of the government to ensure that job community and people be not ignore in the transition and that job be protect the business secretary will provide an update to the house this afternoon be grateful for that kind offer of course will readily accept visit to burnley perhaps through the lens of my role as the local growth and town minister we could have very interesting visit and would be glad to do it be conscious of the time be go to run out of it unthinkably we may have to pick up any further intervention in different form because want to get to the point about building insurance lending and service charge raise by my hon friend the members for runcorn and helsby mike amesbury for eltham and chislehurst and for newcastle under lyme adam jogee one thing we know be that there have not be enough change in this space over the past seven year but there have be change in the insurance bill that many leaseholder have be face we understand the financial and emotional impact that extreme insurance premium have be have on leaseholder affected leaseholder have be burden with pay too high premium for too long assure colleague that we be work actively to reduce premium for leaseholder and we be review how well to protect leaseholder from cost and push for fair premium for leaseholder in building with fire safety issue colleague have talk about buying sell or remortgage home we have see improvement in that space but we remain vigilant we will continue to hold particularly the large lender to account follow their commitment to lend on property even where remediation be not yet complete they must keep that promise on service charge by law variable service charge must be reasonable as colleague have raise that have be stretch significantly by some of the practice we have see the leasehold and freehold reform act contain measure to ensure that leaseholder get key financial and non financial information so that they can scrutinise and hold to account the organisation that they be work with on service charge not all of that legislation have be commence secondary legislation be require but we be work on that actively we just want to get it right my hon friend the member for read central matt rodda talk about the pace of remediation again we accept that the pace be too slow we have say that throughout and what we have see in dagenham and slough be horrific reminder of the risk that unsafe clad still pose to far too many people the deputy prime minister have be very clear on her intention to drive that forward again there be that political will and to get more action out of manufacturer freeholder developer and organisation with responsibility for make sure that building be safe too many building owner be still not act quickly enough so we will investigate pursue the most egregious actor who be create unacceptable delay and hold they to account the message from this dispatch box and from this government be clear use the route we have create to get your building fix and get on with it now turn to the point make by the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn and the hon member for coventry south zarah sultana about the inquiry the right hon gentleman express concern that the report would be shelve and the hon lady be concerned that it would just be word so again let make the commitment this speak to the response give to my hon friend the member for brent west barry gardiner that the report recommendation must be consider with the seriousness that this tragedy deserve we will look at all recommendation in detail there will be debate on the floor of this house we will respond in full within six month and we will be listen to the community throughout the process we will update parliament annually on our progress so that we can be hold to account but we will also get on quickly with the thing we can do whether that be speed up remediation or reform construction product the change have not be at the pace that it ought to have be but it will get well can commit that the report will not as the right hon gentleman have say just be shelve far from it the hon member for surrey heath dr pinkerton and for woking mr forster mention building under metre our approach to clad remediation have be to prioritise the risk of loss of life it be generally accept that the risk to life be proportional to the height of building so the risk to life be usually low in building under metre and they be very unlikely to need the same costly remediation build safety remediation work may be require in very small number of those building but so far our casework as department over the past couple of year show that of the more than case that have be raise only three have fall into that category as such we think that be an appropriate distinction to draw my hon friend the member for alloa and grangemouth brian leishman make point about raac this issue be different in scotland than it be in england scotland have its own responsibility which the scottish government must work within and as say to my hon friend we will work within the good practice too it be the duty of building owner include local authority if they be the owner to fulfil their duty to manage building safety and performance risk of all kind include raac in proportionate manner the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds talk about personal evacuation plan or peep we must ensure that the most vulnerable in our society be protect on september through write ministerial statement the government announce that the home office will bring forward in the autumn proposal to improve fire safety and the evacuation of disabled or vulnerable resident in high rise and high risk residential building in england those proposal will be call residential peep through they resident with disability and impairment will be entitle to person centre risk assessment to identify the appropriate equipment and adjustment to aid their fire safety and evacuation as well as residential peep statement that say what vulnerable resident should do in the event of fire the government have commit funding next year to begin that important work by support social housing provider to deliver peep for their renter the shadow minister also mention product hallmark we stand by what be say in the write ministerial statement would have hop that give enough confidence but for clarity this be about strong standard not weak standard hope the hon gentleman can take confidence from that
