bletchley park last year to tackle the risk of artificial intelligence whether it be ai quantum life science or the next generation of advanced telecommunication we be make the uk science and tech superpower back by the high ever level of spend on research and development our plan be work and our scientist and entrepreneur can not afford to go back to square one with labour the uk research and innovation chief executive have announce that they be step down in june next year the recruitment process normally last eight month yet the government be speed up that process be that because they be worried about the outcome of general election this government be focus on delivery every single day and make no apology for crack on with the process of make sure that our brilliant research institution have the fine leadership that the good and bright in the world deserve in recent year government policy lead by the minister for data and digital infrastructure have result in big improvement in broadband and mobile connectivity on the welsh border both in my constituency of clwyd south and across the border in neighbour north shropshire but there be still some poor area of

friend for his brilliant work on connectivity in the border as you know we do not allow clapping but this be an exception please allow to say welcome back to my hon friend the member for south thanet

constituent call shadow minister matt rodda it be good to see the hon member for south thanet back in his place last year the uk host the ai safety summit and set up the ai safety institute however since then developer of frontier ai have refuse to share information with the safety institute leave it toothless labour have repeatedly call for bind regulation to support safety with the secretary of state discuss the future of ai this week be it not high time for the government to finally agree to bind regulation do not agree with that categorisation the truth be that the bletchley summit be world lead summit we take front foot approach and we be co host the seoul summit which be bring together ai nation ai company and top expert in academia and civil society we have always be clear that we will ensure that our regulator do the job that they need to do and of course at some point we will legislate we have plan and our plan be work the labour party can not tell we what it would legislate for it do not have plan do the minister agree that the large sum of taxpayer money channel to organisation such as the arts and humanities research council for woke drive project should be spend on other high tech project such as for example the tagging of illegal migrant in this country so that we can quickly locate and deport they start in dudley funding council must be accountable for their own individual decision my hon friend no doubt reflect the concern of his constituent who expect in return for our record expenditure on research the discovery of life save medicine or groundbreake technology that be what they expect in return for hard earn taxpayer money representative of the world economic forum tell the audience at davos that we own the science what step be the government take to ensure that scientific research in the uk be impartial objective and ethical regardless of who be fund it that be absolutely right it be intrinsic to the scientific method that

awful attack she be campaign for martyn law which we must make reality as soon as possible the infected blood scandal reflect profound failure across almost every part of the british state in our apology on monday and on the question of compensation yesterday this house be unite however we have too many time hear similar sentiment from that dispatch box and this one there be many hard yard to go do the prime minister agree that we will make real progress only if we finally tackle the lack of openness transparency and candour that sir brian langstaff identify as have prolong the victim suffer for decade the inquiry be establish to get to the truth and provide answer and this week report represent hugely significant moment for the community this be an appalling scandal be sure the whole house be grateful for the diligent work of all those who have support sir brian langstaff and the work of the inquiry also pay tribute to the bravery of every individual who have come forward and tell their story in their fight for justice their voice have finally be hear agree with the right hon and learn gentleman we will listen to they and ensure that nothing like this can ever happen in our country again the infected blood scandal be truly shocking but it be not unique the story be familiar concern raise but ignore report write but not act on victim and their family campaign for year just to be hear if may want to focus on the duty of candour or lack of it that have be failing in scandal after scandal and injustice after injustice from grenfell to horizon hillsborough and now the infected blood scandal have read that the government have call for evidence on the duty of candour in health but can not think of single example where that duty of candour should not apply to all public servant across the board do not think it be possible for any of we to stand at these dispatch boxes and honestly say never again unless we address that do the prime minister agree that the time have now come for the duty of candour to be clearly enshrine in law across the board be of course aware of the recommendation make by sir brian langstaff in the final report of the inquiry on the duty of candour and accountability indeed my right hon friend the secretary of state for health and social care previously introduce the duty of candour to the health service it be important that the government take the time to fully digest the gravity of the report finding the wrong that have be commit be devastating and life alter for so many and ensure that nothing like this ever happen again be priority we be sympathetic to that and be go through the recommendation in detail at the moment before provide comprehensive response of course give the situation and the gravity of the finding it be recommendation for which there be an enormous amount of sympathy understand that the prime minister want to look at the recommendation in detail and to come back to they in due course but we can not look away on this duty of candour can ask the prime minister at least to expand the call for evidence on the duty of candour beyond health we owe it to the victim of hillsborough and horizon to work across the house to establish far reach and bind duty of candour as quickly as possible the right hon and learn gentleman will remember that on monday say very specifically that the pattern of behaviour we have see in this appalling tragedy have be replicate in other and mention hillsborough specifically so be very aware that there be structural and behavioural cultural problem that we need to fix there be an enormous amount of support and sympathy for the principle of the duty of candour he will understand that we be digest the full content of the report but of course we want to right the wrong of the past and crucially ensure that nothing like this happen ever again in his report sir brian identify number of individual failure even cover up but alongside that he also find equally important and hard to reach institutional and cultural failing include in the nhs defensive attitude that refuse to acknowledge problem the silencing of those who raise concern and total failure of leadership when face with the truth the nhs do remarkable job every day but those failing be indefensible do the prime minister agree that the very culture of the nhs need to change yes mr speaker discuss this issue on monday in my response to the question ask by my right hon friend the member for bromsgrove sir sajid javid the nhs provide lifesave care to so many people every single day for which we be enormously grateful but the report make it crystal clear that there be significant failing the nhs fail it fail people and it let they down it be right that the nhs be hold accountable for that and learn the lesson there clearly have be improvement and change in medical practice since that time but go forward we need to go through the full recommendation of sir brian langstaff report and hold the nhs to account for bring through the change that be necessary we need reform we need change see at first hand how important reform be during my time run the crown prosecution service but also see how hard it be particularly on cultural issue it require brave and difficult decision eleven year ago as health secretary the now chancellor say the era of gag nhs staff from raise their real worry about patient care must come to an end eleven year on from that and month on from the lucy letby case there be still clear example of nhs manager still gag staff and then be move on instead of be move out will the prime minister now commit to ensure that those who gag and silence whistleblower will no long be able to work in the nhs of course the behaviour that the right hon and learn gentleman describe be wrong and believe already illegal under our law but we will ensure people have the ability to raise concern one thing that know have give many of those who have be impact by the scandal some reassurance be the appointment of sir robert francis to be chair of the inquiry obviously he be someone who do not just have wealth of experience deal with this particular set of issue but have long track record of work with the nhs on the issue that the right hon and learn gentleman raise sir brian report be victory for all those campaigner and victim who fight so hard for this moment include my right hon friend the member for kingston upon hull north dame diana johnson but it be also one of profound pain anger and sadness for so many there be chance for we to make real progress on this issue and we must do that with victim in mind give the degree of cross party consensus that we have already see on apology and compensation and give the government promise to ensure compensation by the end of the year will the prime minister also now promise to deliver on all the recommendation in the same timeframe by the end of the year of course we want to deliver on the recommendation as quickly as practically possible indeed our expectation be that we can do that before the end of the year as say sir robert appointment will bring wealth of experience it be crucial that the chair have the knowledge expertise and familiarity with the issue his support for deliver the scheme and ensure that compensation can be pay by the end of the year will be invaluable the right hon and learn gentleman talk about the community over the next few week sir robert will seek view from the infected blood community specifically on the propose scheme to ensure the scheme will well serve those it be intend for our shared priority be deliver compensation to all those infected and affect with absolutely minimum delay and begin bring justice to all of those impact in the public vote in what they be tell would be sort of continuity conservative government the same policy but with different face instead what they get be record immigration constitutional vandalism and broken economy do the prime minister agree that with the economy now roar back to life under conservative government the last thing we need be return to the fail labour recipe of high taxis open border and employment law that destroy job my hon friend give superb and passionate economic diagnosis he be right inflation be now back to normal and indeed low than that of france germany and the united states inflation be at its low level in year our economy be grow fast and wage be rise which be why we need to stick to the plan that be work he be right to point out the risk of what the labour party propose new law new law labour have cave in to its union paymaster and what do that mean it mean that it will cost job and damage our economic recovery call the snp leader may begin by also welcome the hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay back to the chamber he be indeed an inspiration to all of we mr speaker speculation be rife so think the public deserve clear answer to simple question do the prime minister intend to call summer general election or be he feart as have say repeatedly to the right hon gentleman there be spoiler alert go to be general election in the second half of this year at that moment the british people will in fact see the truth about the right hon and learn member for holborn and st pancras keir starmer because that will be the choice at the next election it will be party that be not able to say to the country what it would do party that would put at risk our hard earn economic stability or the conservatives who be deliver secure future for our united kingdom the prime minister continue to play game with the public so while he do that let we get back to some serious matter be take aback this week when former prime minister speak some sense alas it be indeed david cameron what he say in relation to graduate route visa be that if any restriction be implement it would lead to job loss university closure and reduction in research university scotland outline that billion of economic value be at risk so may ask the prime minister do he agree with the foreign secretary the foreign secretary also say that the level of legal migration to this country be too high that be what also believe which be why it be right that we be take decisive action to bring down the number and that plan be work in the first three month of this year the visa issue be down by and migration be on its way to be return to more sustainable level appreciate that that be point of difference between the right hon gentleman party and indeed the labour party and we we believe that that level of migration need to come down to more sustainable level so that we ease the pressure on public service everyone who come to our country must contribute economically that be the migration system that we will deliver on the welsh border we be incredibly proud of the veterans orthopaedic centre at the robert jones and agnes hunt orthopaedic hospital in north shropshire which treat veteran not only locally include from my constituency of clwyd south but from across britain as it be the large hospital base veteran service in the uk will the prime minister help resolve the centre current funding crisis cause by change in the nhs funding formula last year give the fantastic treatment provide by lieutenant colonel carl meyer and his team for our amazing veteran community across the uk thank my hon friend for raise that important issue we be committed to make the uk the good place in the world to be veteran and to ensure that they have access to the appropriate physical and mental health support that they deserve that be why we have roll out operation restore op courage and op nova nhs england have be introduce suite of health service to work more closely with orthopaedic service know that my hon friend have raise this issue of funding with the minister for veterans affairs who will be write back to he with an update in due course join other in welcome back to the house the hon member for south thanet craig mackinlay we admire his courage and send our good wish to he and his family also join other in remember all the victim of the bombing at the manchester arena amanda claim carer allowance when care for her mother but the department for work and pensions be now hound she to pay back karina whose daughter require round the clock care have be hit by bill for victoria be be force to pay back month they be just some of the ten of thousand of carer who be victim of the dwp flawed system punish harshly for go sometimes just few pound over the arbitrary earning limit family carer do remarkable job they should not be penalise for working or for the dwp own failure do the prime minister agree that the government should be support carer not persecute they the government recognise the contribution and sacrifice that carer up and down the country so often make to care for other that be why we have increase carer allowance by almost since it be why we introduce carer leave and it be why the well care fund fund respite care break for carer which know have be warmly welcome and use in the rare number of case where individual have not appropriately inform the dwp about change in their circumstance the dwp have then rightly seek to recover overpayment as it would be expect to in order to ensure the integrity of the system and protect the taxpayer but of course it will work with anyone who be struggle with their repayment term and will always look to negotiate an affordable repayment plan too welcome back my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay the billion make available by the government for the repair of road and pothole be very welcome however some local authority such as cambridgeshire county council and peterborough city council which serve my constituency sometimes use inferior material so the work need to be do again in few month time that be an issue that apply to many constituency across the country so will the prime minister use his influence to ensure that there be tough quality specification so that the repair can last much long be proud that we have announce an additional billion for road resurface over the next decade money make available through the reallocation of funding that will mean few pothole and smooth safe road across our country but agree with my right hon friend that it be of the utmost importance that these repair be complete with high quality material join he in call on cambridgeshire county council and peterborough city council to make sure that they deliver that for his resident in the wee small hour of saturday morning receive an email apologise for the language mr speaker call fucking parasite rat and piece of shit this come in response to my challenge the appropriateness of us citizen michael franzese do tour in the uk as part of which he be advocate publicly for the self proclaim misogynist influencer andrew and tristan tate who be encourage toxic attitude among young man in this country the prime minister have speak about ban hate preacher from enter the uk will he extend that to misogynist those who seek to divide we undermine our value and indeed intimidate and threaten other have no place in our society and we will not hesitate to use not just the full force of the law but our immigration regime to make sure that we have security and cohesion in this country the population of maldon be rise rapidly and for over year my constituent have be promise new hospital

craig you have inspire each and every one of we thank you arrest and prison capacity pm urgent question to ask the home secretary to make statement on the impact on public safety of the request to chief constable to reduce arrest in response to the prison capacity crisis be delighted to have the opportunity to talk about public safety about the record number of police officer in this more than under the last labour government and about the fact that accord to the crime survey there be less than half the crime today than there be under the last labour government there be homicide in the last year of the last labour government compare with in the last year be delighted to talk about all those excellent criminal justice result believe this urgent question be prompt by letter circulate about week ago by chief constable rob nixon in his capacity as criminal justice lead for the national police chiefs council in which he refer to short term prison place pressure over period of eight day expire tomorrow have speak to chief constable rob nixon in the last half an hour and he have confirm to that the contingency refer to in the letter be not require he say the contingency be not require because the prison place situation in practice do not merit it he say there have be no delay to arrest that he be aware of and he have say that while small number of people be convey to court in police car and there be small number of delay to arrival at court no one who should have get to court do not do so be delighted to confirm to the house that the contingency reference in the letter do not materialise and that the short term fluctuation reference in the letter will be over tomorrow have to say that the minister response be shocking tell people they have never have it so good when face with this crisis in the criminal justice system show just how out of touch he be the state of crisis in the criminal justice system after year of conservative government be now so dire that police chief be ask to arrest few people because the system could not cope at the operation safeguard silver update they be ask to consider pause any plan operation where large number of arrest might take place to ease the pressure within the criminal justice system because this tory government in power for year have so catastrophically fail to manage the criminal justice system or build the basic prison place promise last week alone there be prisoner in police cell overnight we have get early release massively expand start tomorrow include for domestic abuser and now this serious impact on public safety of operation early dawn tell the prisoner escort service not to collect prisoner from police station to take they to court because there be not enough place with police force have to pick up the piece instead the npcc say in its letter in the strong term that that be unsustainable and that it risk public safety will the minister tell we what assessment he do when these letter go out and when the crisis reach this point of the scale of the challenge who in these circumstance do he think it be acceptable not to send to court because of his government abject failure on law and order violent criminal domestic abuser repeat shoplifter and which big operation involve lot of arrest do he think should be pause in these situation crackdown on drug ring or groom gang swoop on people smuggler and when should they be pause until where be the government plan arrest have already halve since the tories come to power and charge rate have already drop through the floor the legacy of year of tory government on law and order be more criminal let off more victim let down britain deserve well the right hon lady like to pontificate in an animate fashion but the fact be that accord to the crime survey crime have halve since the government of which she be part leave office she feign indignation about the early custody release scheme but she forget to mention that under the last labour government it run for three year and see people release early the right hon lady reference the letter from last week have message here from chief constable rob nixon send to about minute ago update on the actual situation so let just read out to the house what it say the national police chiefs council criminal justice lead say there have be no delay to arrest he say there have be some minor delay in get people to court but everyone who need to got there small number be convey by police but there be limited operational impact he say there have be no compromise to public safety and the contingency of delaying arrest be not activate as it be not necessary that be from the national police chiefs council send minute ago those be the fact and suggest the right hon lady stick to they interruption call sir robert neill and hope there will be more calm do my right hon friend agree that this important debate which touch upon not only public safety but the whole way in which our justice system operate be well deal with in calm fashion it be perfectly reasonable to adopt contingency measure which we hope be often not need but the most important thing be to ensure that all party in this house commit to consistent and sustained investment in all aspect of the criminal justice system because we can not decouple police from the court prison and the whole of the process that be the sensible debate that the country need to have my hon and learn friend as always put it very well he be quite right that investment be important that be why there be record number of police officer it be why prison place be in the course of be construct of which be currently operational and of which will be operational by the end of next year it be why more money be be put into the crown prosecution service it be why my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor who be here on the front bench be ensure that legal aid be properly resource as be the criminal bar those be all extremely important initiative to ensure that the public be protect the ultimate measure of public protection of course be the overall level of criminality which as have say once or twice before have halve since the labour party leave office call the chair of the home affairs committee obviously public safety be paramount in all of this and do want to say to the minister that the fact that contingency plan be be draw up be itself worry accept what the chair of the justice committee the hon and learn member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill say about this be sensible step to take but it be indeed very worrying that we have to have contingency in place if in the future these contingency plan be activate what happen if the police decide not to prioritise an arrest and in the meantime that person go on to harm someone be think of non contact sexual offence and in particular retail crime which the home affairs committee have be look at recently the right hon lady be right to say that arrest of offender of the kind she describe be extremely important and at no point would ever expect even in the contingency outline in fact it never come to pass as have set out that offender of the kind she reference would not continue to be arrest that be critically important the ecsl measure end of custody supervise licence for up to day which come into effect tomorrow be design to ensure that such scenario never come about because as policing minister want to make sure that we never see the situation she describe will my right hon friend accept that the action by the leader of the national police chiefs council be against the separation of power principle we make the law in this house and we expect it to be implement and administer without fear or favour what seem to be happen be that unelected chief such as the npcc leader be interfere with the administration of justice do my right hon friend agree that thing would be lot well if the criminal justice board have not fail to meet for two year which be apparently what have happen will he accept that we need to start put thing right the times today describe it as failure of administration be happy to confirm that the criminal justice board chair by my right hon and learn friend the lord chancellor meet very frequently indeed attend its most recent meeting just three or four week ago with the lord chancellor other ministers police lead senior member of the judiciary and the crown prosecution service and many other so can categorically confirm that it do exist and it meet regularly on my hon friend question about the police the police be rightly operationally independent it be not for minister to direct how they discharge their duty they discharge their duty appropriately with their professional standard and professional judgment and we support they in do so operational independence for the police be important as be sure everyone on both side of the house respect it be obvious from the minister demeanour that he do not like to be call to account but he should reflect on the fact that the mere fact such letter be write and in the circumstance in which it be write be cause for concern which he should be take seriously it be symptomatic of wide malaise in the english and welsh criminal justice system last year burglary go unsolved across england and wales an average of day be that not something the minister should be address rather than get little bit work up with the shadow home secretary may have get work up because the allegation be make be in my view unfounded and unsupported by the fact be simply try to put across the fact both the number and also the quote from the relevant policing lead which flatly contradict the dystopian picture that the shadow home secretary characteristically be seek to paint to answer the right hon gentleman question we of course take such matter seriously the lord chancellor be work night and day to increase prison capacity both by build new prison expeditiously and by pull every lever at his disposal to build more capacity within the exist estate the prison be pretty full because the police have do good job at identify catch and incarcerate dangerous criminal thoughtful approach of the kind call for by the chair of the justice committee my hon and learn friend the member for bromley and chislehurst sir robert neill have be take that be why with the implementation of the end of custody supervise licence tomorrow the issue and contingency provide for in the letter of last week will no long be require it be an eight day period and thankfully those contingency be not in fact require it be reassuring to hear from the minister that the contingency be not require but also interesting to see that the letter be actually issue give his reaction here today to that what process have he put in place to ensure that he be consult before any such instruction or suggestion be issue as former home office minister my hon friend have great deal of experience in this area the police be operationally independent but we liaise closely with they and the national police chiefs council have regular discussion with gavin stephens who chair the npcc and in relation to this matter with chief constable rob nixon who be the criminal justice lead and with deputy chief constable nev kemp of surrey who be the lead for custody will take this opportunity to place on the record my thank to police up and down the country for their careful management over the past seven day which have ensure that our fellow citizen have be keep safe north yorkshire and west yorkshire police have just arrest people in county line operation they seize sword machete and crossbow and take kg of cannabis crack cocaine and heroin off the street alongside the misery and violence that characterise county line gang be so grateful to they for that work but be the government suggest that they should have allow it to continue until further notice under these contingency plan all because the government have so mismanage the criminal justice system and the collapse in prison place first prison place have not collapse think there be more prison place now than in the recent past congratulate north yorkshire and west yorkshire police on that operation which the hon lady say lead to arrest of dangerous criminal as have say none of the contingency reference be activate and there be never any question of dangerous criminal of that kind not be arrest that be exactly the kind of operation we like to see be speak from memory but think we have close down something like county line in the past four year be delighted to see such operation successfully put dangerous criminal where they belong behind bar be glad to hear that the contingency contain in the letter be not require we can tell how tough this government be be on crime and criminal by the very heavy population in our prison estate the long term solution be to build more prison can the minister update we on when he estimate the prison building programme will catch up with the prison population the justice secretary and the prisons minister my right hon friend the member for charnwood edward argar who be also here be build prison capacity rapidly by the end of next year they will have add prison place include at site such as hmp millsike which will be open shortly we be embark on huge prison construction programme which be on top of the fact that we already have record number of prison place the fact that we have fill those up with criminal serve typically long sentence be testament to the successful approach to law and order that this government have take last friday attend community meeting in my constituency with group of resident our local safe neighbourhood team and some of our elect councillor it be in response to fatal shooting of young year old the resident speak about have the reassurance of know that the suspect have already be arrest thank to the work of the local police what be the minister message to my constituent and many other across the country where suspect will now not be arrest as result of this guidance first pay tribute to the hon lady local police for the work they have do gently refer she to my previous answer there have be no arrest that ought to have take place but do not as result of this contingency the way she frame her question completely ignore the answer have previously give the contingency refer to in the letter be not in fact require so her constituent and everybody else can be assure that the police be continue to do their job of arrest dangerous criminal thank my right hon friend for the update to the house in london we have the challenge of the metropolitan police fail to meet their recruitment target the police be under incredible pressure at weekend police hate march and other demonstration in central london police be be draw in from outside london to carry that out now that the mayoral election be over what action be my right hon friend take with the mayor of london to ensure that the met police meet their recruitment target and that the police be train properly and can get on with the job of catch criminal my hon friend be right to raise the question of police number in london whereas across england and wales as whole we have record police number and of the police force meet their recruitment target there be one that do not the metropolitan police under sadiq khan in fact its number unfortunately have shrink in the past year rather than grow therefore attend the police performance oversight group which be the special measure group chair by the chief inspector just few day ago attend by the commissioner and the deputy mayor sophie linden unfortunately sadiq khan do not see fit to show up to that meeting one of the point make forcefully be the importance of grow police number in london it be the only force in the country to miss its target and that must be turn around let get this right the government be boast that they appoint extra policeman and woman to prevent crime and protect the public criminal create and undertake crime and an instruction be give to the police not to arrest they because the prison be full the government defence be it all right the instruction be never act upon can the public have any confidence if it be possible for the police to give instruction today and maybe again next week not to arrest criminal can we really believe that crime be be take seriously in this country crime be take very seriously which why it have fall by in the past year and since the right hon gentleman refer to period of just eight day when contingency be consider but not use the lord chancellor rightly and in thoughtful and measured manner have take step that will take effect tomorrow to ensure that such contingency be not require in future that be responsible way of handle the situation the minister have stand in front of we today and say it would never be any of the kind of crime you talk about the prime minister say last week at prime minister question no one would be put on the scheme the early release scheme if they be deem threat to public safety official report may vol the minister be basically say the same today yet my inbox be full of case of where perpetrator of domestic violence rape sexual violence and child abuse against multiple victim be be release early from prison do he think that someone who have rap someone go to prison come out and do it again be not deem threat to the public can answer the hon lady question specifically the early release scheme that the lord chancellor establish expressly exclude serious violence and sexual offender include rapist there be an additional safeguard which do not exist in the previous labour government equivalent scheme governor veto of early release if they believe there be threat to public safety be glad that the minister have bring the lord chancellor and the prisons minister with he as they can explain how day early release operation early dawn mean that criminal either will not be lock up or be be let out early be the truth not that he be preside over operational failure in policing the court and the prison system and be respond to they with ad hoc panic measure the police be successfully reduce crime for which thank they in the last calendar year the most recent year for which figure be available there be more successful outcome which typically mean prosecution than the previous year the court and prison system in england and wales as in scotland and around the world be under pressure candidly speak largely as result of the post covid environment and delay that build up in the system during covid which have not yet clear that be not unique to this jurisdiction those people release accord to the criterion that mention be closely supervise under licence and subject to recall should they breach that licence my constituent johnny wood sister jackie be tragically kill by four man drive steal lorry in they be convict of dangerous driving but one of they have be release from prison have serve only half his sentence just five year he be report to have break his ban order from the local area while under supervision from the probation service johnny and his family have be let down by every part of the system over the last six year what be the minister message to johnny and what specifically can he do to help in this case have every sympathy for victim such as the hon lady constituent and the truly tragic case that she outline if she would like to look into particular policing aspect of that case would be happy to help if it be prison probation or sentencing relate issue my right hon friend from the ministry of justice stand ready to help she and her constituent in relation to automatic release on to licence under the last labour government all offender end up get automatically release at the halfway point this government have substantially reduce that include for offence such as rape recall in bill committee couple of year ago that labour mp vote against measure to keep rapist in prison for long over the weekend be almost in tear read letter from local primary school of an account of one of their young mum who feel so intimidate by antisocial behaviour on her estate that she be unable to walk her young son to school in the morning the school try to provide social worker to escort she but they also feel intimidate what message do it send to the school the mum and her child about the safety of our street when chief constable feel it necessary to deprioritise arrest on the minister watch case of the kind that the hon lady describe would not have be in the scope of the contingency outline in the letter of week ago the antisocial behaviour that she describe be completely unacceptable be sure that many member be parent and would want their own child to go to and from school safely the government have launch an antisocial action plan one of the element of which be fund scheme for antisocial behaviour hotspot patrol that start just few week ago so would urge the hon lady to speak to her local police and crime commissioner think newly elect one in northumbria if memory serve correctly and to ask that one of the fund hotspot patrol be set up in the vicinity of that school to try to tackle the issue that she describe because no parent should have to face that figure publish last month show that bedfordshire police have the slow response time to call because of understaffing do the minister realise how ridiculous it sound to ask the police not to police and to arrest few people because his government have break the justice system and be allow criminal to get away scot free that be completely inaccurate characterisation of the situation the eight day period provide for contingency that be not require have read to the house an assurance from the relevant national police chiefs council lead that arrest be not forgo or cancel as result of the contingency more widely as have say we have record police number and low crime than year ago and would have think that we would all welcome that the issue with prison capacity be partly crisis of reoffende dartmoor prison be subject to an inspection last year and be award only one out of four because of inadequate education and work opportunity hmp dartmoor hold large number of people convict of sexual offence but the report say that there be no accredited programme for rehabilitation sexual offence in devon and cornwall rise by in the year to do the minister accept that the prison capacity crisis be partly about reoffende and what be he do about it the justice secretary have assure that dartmoor be well run and well regard prison one of the reason why my colleague in the ministry of justice here on the benches be preside over such large increase in prison capacity be to ensure that prisoner be well rehabilitate in the prison estate the hon gentleman rightly mention reoffende prevent reoffende be critical much offending be connect with drug addiction some estimate suggest nearly half so get more people into treatment be important both in the court system and in the prison estate it be critical that as people leave prison and re enter the community the drug treatment they receive in prison continue in the community we call it continuity of care and it have increase quite dramatically recently would like it increase even more that be one of the way that we will reduce reoffende which as he say be an important policy objective on point of order madam deputy speaker wonder if you could help to get some answer the minister say during the urgent question that certain criminal who be risk to the public would not be release unlike charlie taylor the inspector of prison who say that high risk prisoner be be release under the scheme have hear of case where it take the court month to hold sentencing hearing on actual bodily harm against two different people as part of domestic abuse situation the prisoner be sentence to four year and be deem to be such risk because of previous sexual violence conviction that he be put on remand on the day of the sentencing hearing he be release immediately because he have be identify as suitable for early release yet the minister tell today that no one with history of sexual offending who be risk to the public or who have commit domestic abuse would be release that be just one of many case wonder whether the prime minister or the minister have mislead the house could you advise how could take that up thank the hon lady for her point of order be sure she mean to say that she be indicate that any misleading of the house would be inadvertent be not responsible obviously for response from ministers but the minister who be still here will have hear her comment as will have those on the treasury bench do the minister wish to speak far to that point of order far to that point of order madam deputy speaker the hon lady raise an individual case and be sure the lord chancellor would be happy to look at an individual case for she she mention someone release on sentencing of course the court or the probation service will look at time serve on remand already so prisoner may have be on remand for quite long time at the point that they come to sentencing hearing to repeat the more general rule which be ministry of justice policy the release under licence up to day prior to the ordinary release point do not apply to any prisoner serve sentence of more than four year it do not apply to any prisoner serve sentence for serious sexual or violent offence and the prison governor can veto the release of prisoner consider to be danger those be the safeguard but if the hon lady want to debate the matter in more detail be sure my colleague the lord chancellor would be very happy to do that thank the minister for state his position suggest that perhaps the offer of further discussion with the lord chancellor would be appropriate be sure the hon lady will come back after that if she feel there be further point she wish to make she be very experienced in know how to make her view know in the house so be sure that that be probably the good way forward for now the economy with permission madam deputy speaker would like to make statement on the economy follow the release of inflation datum by the office for national statistics this morning and the conclusion of the international monetary fund annual article iv mission to the uk on tuesday the ons datum release today show that consumer price index inflation have fall to return to normal level last see before the pandemic and russia invasion of ukraine early this week the imf say that the uk economy be approach soft landing it upgrade its forecast for uk growth in have see low inflation accompany by strong than expect growth in the first quarter these development be proof that the government plan be work the difficult decision we have take be pay off and the uk economy really be begin to turn the corner let start with the inflation figure when the prime minister come to office less than two year ago inflation be over the fall to mean that we have see the fast fall in inflation in nearly half century the uk now have low inflation rate than the united states france and germany food inflation be at its low level since november have fall for consecutive month and staple such as milk cheese and egg be now cheap than they be this time last year although there be more to do energy bill have also come down with the price cap for the typical annual bill now over low than year ago although they be still above where they be in the fall in inflation have not happen by accident the government have have to make difficult decision to get we to this point as well as support the bank of england as it have act to bring down inflation sustainably we have reduce borrowing which be now forecast to fall in every year to and we be act to boost growth without generate inflation we have freeze fuel and alcohol duty which the office for budget responsibility estimate will reduce inflation by in this financial year moreover in the face of widespread pressure we have reach fair pay deal for public sector worker instead of do what the labour party would have do cave in to inflation bust pay demand we must always remain vigilant when it come to inflation but today number show the benefit of stick to our plan we know that recent year have not be easy for people but with wage have now grow fast than inflation for month in row family around the country will start to see their money go far and we be do more because on this side of the house we recognise that while the tax rise of recent year may have be necessary at that time of crisis they should not be permanent we will do the hard work to bring taxis back down because we know that to do so will lead to more growth for our economy my right hon friend the chancellor have already deliver tax cut worth for the average worker since the effective tax pay by somebody on an average salary have fall under conservative government from to combine with national living wage increase that mean the after tax income of somebody on the low legally payable wage have go up by in the same period labour approach be different all labour government since the have increase the tax burden in both good time and bad give the fiscal rule labour have set the only way for it to pay for its spending commitment would be to raise taxis by considerably more than the billion of tax increase they have already outline will now turn to the imf annual article iv mission to the uk and what it say about the government other economic priority beyond inflation to deliver growth and opportunity for the whole united kingdom the imf message be overall positive one we have see growth of in the first quarter of this year that be strong and more broad base than many independent forecaster expect and no other country have grow fast in the first quarter on quarter by quarter basis the imf have upgrade its forecast for the whole of this year from to and in april say that the uk be expect to see the fast cumulative growth of any major european economy over the next six year that be partly the result of our focus on area that the imf say be critical to deliver sustainable economic growth boost job boost the labour supply and increase business investment we already have proud record on job the president of the cbi recently describe the uk as job create factory that be because over the last year we have build one of the most flexible dynamic labour market in europe but we can not take that for grant and we can not let the labour party impose new burden on employer which would turn job create factory into french style inflexible labour market unemployment in france as it so happen be nearly double that of the united kingdom indeed not far off where it be in the uk under the last labour government we must not turn the clock back the obr estimate that cut in national insurance will bring the equivalent of more people into the workforce enough to fill nearly quarter of the vacancy in our economy we be reform welfare labour have say it be against welfare sanction fair enough that be its position but that will mean more people on our welfare roll not less the reform of the secretary of state for work and pensions will help million people move from welfare into work at cost of billion meanwhile the introduction of full expensing the big business tax cut in decade will boost business investment by billion in the come year and give this country the most generous capital allowance in the oecd there be more to do and the imf be right to point out that further bold reform will be need and that boost growth and productivity be the key challenge for the united kingdom however in the word of the imf managing director the uk be in good place inflation be back to more normal level growth be pick up wage be rise and we be cut taxis the plan be work and the difficult decision that have be take by the government be start to pay off now be not the time to change course because give labour policy on job welfare reform and tax we know that the difference if it be elect will be profound and damage for every family in the country thank the minister for advance sight of his statement of course it be welcome that the rate of inflation be finally slow after three year of the government miss every single target but the tone deaf victory lap we be see from the government today will feel like slap in the face to the british people who after long year of conservative chaos be still significantly bad off while conservative ministers be pop champagne cork over the rate of food price rise the cost of the typical family shop have go up by nearly since so those family will not be celebrate and while the chancellor and the prime minister gaslight ordinary british family by suggest that the cost of living crisis be over the cost for two earner household be more than week high than they be before the last election the minister claim that the economy have turn corner but in reality the conservatives record on growth have be nothing short of pitiful if the uk economy have grow at the average rate of the oecd in the last year it would now be billion large that be not just about line on graph it would have mean an additional billion in tax revenue to invest in our public service and more money in work people pocket note with interest that the minister quote selectively from the imf report in that report which he cite so triumphantly the imf confirm that under the conservatives the uk be suffer from the low growth in the and just this week the imf say that the long term growth prospect of the uk remain subdued this be the conservative party legacy poor britain work people bad off and the public realm in disarray think the minister may also be slightly confused about his government record on tax on the conservatives watch the tax burden be the high in year and under the prime minister tax plan household will on average be bad off by those be the statistic that the minister miss out in contrast to the conservatives who have consistently fail to explain how they will pay for their billion unfunded commitment to abolish national insurance we in the labour party have ensure that all our plan be fully cost let also make it clear that labour government would not be celebrate the inflation target finally be meet for the first time in year we would not be do tone deaf victory lap for oversee decade and half of stagnant growth instead we have pledge to deliver economic stability with tough spending rule so that we can grow our economy and keep taxis inflation and mortgage as low as possible the choice at the next election be clear five more year of chaos with the conservative or stability with change labour party that be why the government be run scared time after time they have choose to bottle it rather than go to the country but hope that today of all day the prime minister will do the right thing it be time for this exhausted and fail government to step aside in the national interest call an election and let the responsible party take charge let start by welcome the shadow minister remark and by say that no one on the government benches certainly not feel that time be not still tough for many million of people we be acutely aware of that which be why we have work so hard over the last few year to make the difficult decision that be require for we to guide the country through the difficulty work by covid the big pandemic in year and by the energy shock from the war in ukraine no one on this side of the house minimise the difficulty that people have go through and that many be still go through let pick up couple of point of fact the hon lady quote the imf and she mention selective quotation be afraid that she win the prize on that one the imf be very clear about the fact that over the next five or six year the uk will be the fast grow country in the apart from north america she also mention confusion think that she and her party be the one who be confused they be confuse on the question of taxis we have score labour tax plan and they amount to an extra over four year for the average person labour member say that they want to grow the economy and they say that they be pro business at least that be what they tell business people outside the house but they be put in place worker plan lead by their deputy leader that will impose new regulation on small business far more power for trade union and day one right on employment and will ban flexible working it will damage many of the thing that make small business in this country successful let end by say this if we want government who will cut inflation far and grow the economy we should not increase borrow and increase taxis like the labour party call the chair of the treasury committee welcome the minister statement which be cram with useful fact and statistic yesterday our committee meet representative of the imf in private and we have very interesting and informative discussion as for yesterday report the imf point out that none of this good economic news would be happen have it not be for decision make in previous budgets in particular it state that the government have deliver several helpful measure over the last three budget investment tax relief for business to boost investment an expansion of childcare and active labor market policy this good news be not happen by accident it be happen because plan be in place and the plan be work do the minister agree do agree but let draw attention to specific point that be often ignore the chancellor decision over the last two fiscal event have set the country up for growth in the future my hon friend mention the policy on business expensing that be billion tax cut for business she mention childcare policy those have help million of work family up and down the country it be because of the cumulative effect of series of important measure that we be able to stand up here today and say that while we be not there yet the economy be start to turn corner call the scottish national party spokesman too thank the minister for advance sight of his statement the government understandably would like to paint the late inflation figure as win but think the house will forgive if do not join they in their victory lap the reality for numerous household across scotland many of whom be continue to struggle be that the cost of living crisis be far from over and people be still feel the pinch in their pocket food bank usage be skyrocket and mortgage rate be soar for people in scotland that be the cost of live with westminster the inflation of the past three year have see price rise by when they should have rise by of course fall inflation do not mean that those price will now fall with figure like this it be little surprise be it not that polling this week show that just of people across the uk believe that the cost of living crisis be over on friday attend food bank drive at asda in parkhead where resident be donate in their drove to glasgow ne foodbank in recognition of the fact that many of their neighbour simply can not afford to eat have one simple question for the minister do he not realise that today statement and all the fantoosherie that go with it absolutely fly in the face of the reality for many people who be still struggle today in century britain my response to the hon gentleman whom respect deeply be twofold first we be at an inflection point and the job be not complete we know that many million of people be suffer which be why we be continue to improve their income through cut their taxis it be why we be continue to make sure that small business around this country can thrive and why we be continue to put more money into our public service and indeed to reduce inflation we know that the job be not do secondly many people have have to suffer as result of the difficult decision that have to be take over recent year because of the generationally unique shock that we see it have be up to this government to guide and help the country through that which be what we will continue to do in the week and month ahead inflation be now low than in france germany or the eurozone growth have be upgrade by the imf and britain have become the world fourth big exporter overtake the netherlands france and germany employment be at historically high level and the uk be the third big destination for inward investment globally on financial service investment we be top attract project last year compare with france and germany wonder whether my hon friend can correct or do miss the post brexit apocalypse that many include the treasury predict my right hon friend have put that incredibly well very good thing have happen to our economy over recent month particularly in my own area of financial service would add that many member on both side of the house be concern about the impact of brexit on the british economy as he suggest our record show that this government have be able to guide the country through the post brexit period and towards well time than ever sometimes this house really be theatre the minister have come to the dispatch box all jubilant but my constituent queue outside food bank for hour from nine in the morning until nine at night price be more expensive than when the tories first take office this government have have year and they have destroy the economy people be pay more month on their mortgage accord to the bank of england can not believe that the minister be say that thing be go to get well ultimately hope that in few hour the prime minister will be outside no and call general election people can then make choice and vote labour my response be that this parliament have see an unprecedented hit to people living standard because of covid once year impact might remind the house that this government spend billion in support the economy we support people through programme such as furlough support small business through discretionary grant and support the nhs there be so many thing that be oppose by the opposition labour members mention borrowing and taxis if it have be up to they we would have be in lockdown for long if it have be up to they we would have borrow more if it have be up to they they would not have make the decision that we have to make tough decision on public sector pay that mean that by work in partnership with the bank of england we could bring inflation down we be at an inflection point and not everything be complete we be not there yet but the economy be start to turn corner through the leadership of this government over recent month we have have number of statistic on the economy that have be unalloye good news for this country it be good news that the economy be do well that inflation be down that growth be up and that trade be up that make we all rich and provide more job and employment which should be rejoice in by everybody in this house include the opposition who might actually end up in government and inherit the benefit of some of the thing that this government be do in truth be always little surprised by how miserable the opposition get when good news come along my hon friend make an important point about those on the labour benches must admit that disagree with he on one key point the idea that they might inherit this we be not complete yet we know that the economy still need to continue to turn and that inflation need to come down we hope that that will lead to fall interest rate in due course and that the measure we have put in place will come to fruition over the next parliament the uk economy be small now and living standard be low now than at the start of this parliament the first time this have ever happen do the minister agree that it be sign of the tories increase desperation that they consider it cause for celebration that the uk economy have stop shrink growth be still low than in europe asia the americas and australia and we continue to pay the price of brexit and tory incompetence be afraid disagree with the hon lady on point of fact have already set out so many statistic that show that thing be significantly improve in the economy and at fast rate than that experience by most of our competitor in europe completely disagree with her assessment the minister be right to update the house on the positive progress that we be make with inflation right to make the point that people be continue to find economic difficulty and that we need to stick with the prime minister plan right to point out the terrible risk to the economy pose by the labour party police on labour market and taxis and right to say that there have be external factor and that policy to tackle one off external factor be different from one policy look forward this government have end the period of quantitative easing or print money and move to quantitative tightening or pay back money the imf report say that by the balance sheet for the bank of england should be settle will the minister look at the long range forecast that the office for budget responsibility have put out and see what flexibility they provide for the government to cut taxis or increase expenditure thank my hon friend for characteristically thoughtful and informed question will indeed look at what he say about the bank of england balance sheet be settle by and will talk to he about that in due course like the chancellor the minister like to talk about the difficult decision that conservative administrations have make the cost of family shop have rise by since the last election the difficult decision be the one that family in newcastle have to make every time they go to supermarket be it not the case that the decision that his party have choose to make austerity stealth taxis on work people and crush growth out of the economy before crash it altogether be why my constituent be bad off be afraid disagree with the hon lady it be very important that this house recognise and admit that because there be once in generation pandemic that cost the government over billion in support people it be necessary for the tax burden to rise for time to help pay for that that be difficult and responsible decision now that we have move into period of relative calm there be choice about what we want the economy and our fiscal position to look like over the medium term on this side of the house we choose high business investment high growth and low taxis on work people whereas the opposition choose more union power high borrowing and high taxis think the british public be go to stick with we the late uk economic datum be welcome news with inflation fall again real wage rise and the uk forecast to grow fast than many of its peer the international monetary fund be now recommend that the bank of england cut interest rate and agree what do the minister think of the imf view as my hon friend know it be for the monetary policy committee of the bank of england to determine the policy on interest rate but we hope that work in partnership with the bank of england to cut inflation will mean that at some point later in the year interest rate will start to come down as the imf have suggest as result of inflation be at target in response to the minister last reply even if interest rate be cut later this year that will not make an impact for number of my constituent in vauxhall accord to the bank of england people have see their mortgage and rent go up by over month as my hon friend the member for brent central dawn butler say over million people be fall behind on their bill accord to research by stop the squeeze the resolution foundation have find that annual bill in be now high in real term than in this be not time to celebrate know that at my advice surgery in week time my constituent be go to come to raise these issue the fact be that they can not afford to heat their home or keep up with their bill yes these statistic may look good but will the minister accept that for real people this be another slap in the face what will certainly accept be that there be million of people in this country for whom the cost of living crisis be still real that be why we be take the action that we be take that be why work as result of cut national insurance person on an average salary be well off than they would have be year ago that be why we be focus hard on make sure we bring down borrowing rather than increase borrow as plan by the labour party what would say to the hon lady constituent if be to speak to they at her surgery be that the economy be on the right track that we be at the point where the economy be start to turn the corner and that if they go with labour leadership thing be go to get lot bad that be why we need to keep on the plan that we have set out thank the minister for the encouraging economic update it be so disappointing when we get good news on the economy and it be talk down by the opposition inflation come down to really show that the economic plan from this government be work with national insurance reduction pension increase boost job and grow economy do he agree that it be only the conservatives that can be trust to manage the economy soundly agree with my hon friend who be fantastic champion for his constituent in this house as everybody in this house know the only thing would add to what he have say be that we on this side of the house know what it be to take responsible decision and take they for the long term give the global macro shock face during this parliament particularly the pandemic and the russian invasion of ukraine it be quite remarkable that we have get inflation back down to it be testament to good fiscal policy and we be lead the way within the do the minister agree that for those constituent live in bracknell forest who want low inflation high employment high wage and high growth stick to the plan be absolutely the right thing to do my hon friend be brilliant champion for bracknell forest part of the country that know well and completely agree with his remark this positive economic news be extremely welcome and have also welcome the action take by the government to reduce the amount of tax on work family give this positive economic outlook will my hon friend speak to the chancellor about increase the personal tax allowance particularly to help work family but also to take more pensioner out of pay tax as my hon friend know the chancellor keep all taxis under review will ensure that he have hear my hon friend comment and plea do my hon friend accept that today good news would have be even well if the government have implement the public sector exit payment restriction that be legislate for in and be the subject of consultation that end month ago in respect of which they be apparently unable to agree response surely the government should be able to do something about this and save the billion that this have so far cost be not this an example of proposal be sabotage by the civil service have be in correspondence with my hon friend few month ago on this very question and would be happy to engage with he on it again thank the minister for his statement political violence and disruption walney report with permission will make statement on lord walney report entitle protect our democracy from coercion lord walney be appoint in to advise the government on political violence and extremism throughout the course of his review lay before parliament yesterday and available on he have consult an extensive evidence base and engage government public body international partner academia civil society and those personally affect by violent disruption and extremism lord walney timely and compelling report identify rise tide of extremism in this country its central finding be that political intimidation and the incitement of hatred by extremist group and individual be infringe on the essential right and freedom of the british people and those they choose to represent they in politic in recent month we have too often see intimidatory and aggressive protest activity with frequent disruption to our democratic process be that protest outside mps home and council meeting or shut down event where people from both side of this house have be speak lord walney eloquently describe the threat pose by the extreme right as well as the extreme left whose activist in his word systematically seek to undermine faith in our parliamentary democracy and the rule of law this have very real impact on the elect representative who choose to dedicate themselves in service to the public lord walney highlight the local government association survey find that of local councillor feel at risk at least some of the time while fulfil their role it also have an effect on the public servant work to make their community well place up and down the country be particularly strike by the section on protest at school the purpose of school as be sure we can all agree be to educate our child and to teach student how to think not what to think our teacher must be free to do this without fear or favour while it be right that school consult parent on sensitive issue it be not their job to appease pressure group self appoint community activist or religious institution that be why be deeply concerned by the aggressive protest target school detail in lord walney report it be unacceptable that in birmingham one assistant head have to be escort in and out of their school for their own safety it be unacceptable that in batley teacher and his family be reportedly still in hiding after be accuse of blasphemy there be no right not to be offend in this country no religion or belief system be immune from criticism or exempt from our liberal democratic tradition blasphemy law be incompatible with british value and principle the effect that these incident have have be utterly unacceptable every politician and public servant at all level and across all party must be able to perform their duty without fear this transcend party dividing line we must all stand up for our share democratic value and freedom this government will take every possible step to safeguard the people and institution upon which our democracy depend we recently commit an additional million to bolster the protection of elect representative and our democratic process an investment that will be use to enhance police capability increase private security support for those face high risk and expand cyber security advice this investment be underpin by the defend democracy police protocol agree with police chief to ensure robust policing response to disruptive activity include the provision of dedicated name police contact for all elect representative and candidate to liaise with on security matter as lord walney set out it be vital that we take action to manage and limit the impact of protest that descend into violence and disruption these have not just result in vile display of antisemitism on our street and aggressive disruptive tactic deploy by some protestor they have also drain police resource as officer be redeploy away from their frontline duty to protect the british public from criminal who target they with fraud theft and violence we must not forget that it be the british people who pay for this we must not permit the selfishness of an extremist minority to deprive they of the service they be owe and should rightly expect that be why over the come week the government will look carefully at lord walney recommendation on public order and will look at change the threshold for impose condition on protest and the way in which they be apply this include amend the threshold to prevent protest from go ahead on account of the cumulative impact of serious disruption or where there be the threat of intimidating and abusive conduct base on the persistence of previous arrest in addition we will consider lord walney recommendation for put great responsibility on protest organiser to limit disruption and to allow the police to account for demand on their resource in set condition to ensure wide public safety in their jurisdiction beyond protest the home secretary the policing minister and will be consider the merit of these suggestion over the come week the government be already introduce measure through the criminal justice bill to crack down on dangerous disorder many of which be inspire by work closely with lord walney over recent month the government have also introduce serious disruption prevention order to allow court to place requirement or prohibition on an individual age or over that they consider necessary and proportionate to prevent that individual from cause serious disruption we must go far in tackle the root cause in this vein the government have update the definition of extremism to be use by government departments and official alongside set of engagement principle this be to ensure that they do not inadvertently or otherwise provide platform funding or legitimacy to group or individual who attempt to advance extremist ideology that would deny our fundamental right and freedom thank lord walney for his tireless effort in bring the report together and we will continue to work closely with he to ensure that his finding inform ongoing policy development we will of course update parliament on our progress at the appropriate time there be no doubt that extremism pose threat to our democracy leave unchecked it would eat away at the very foundation of our society and the liberty of our people this government will not allow that to happen we will hold ever fast to the value of freedom and tolerance that make our country great we will use every available tool to combat those who seek to divide we and the poisonous ideology they espouse and in the end we will defeat extremism in all its ugly form commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for his statement and for provide advance sight of it join he in thank lord walney for his work on this report it be important to say from the outset that the opposition absolutely respect the fundamental freedom to make legitimate peaceful protest but when that freedom be abuse to intimidate harass and harm other safeguard must be put in place to protect the public and our democratic system as whole we have see in recent month that people have be intimidate and have feel threaten due to protest activity therefore agree with the minister that this be totally unacceptable and there must be no no go area in our country that be why we have be crystal clear that where there be public order offence hate crime offence or terrorist offence on march and demonstration they must face the full force of the law the police have our full support in take swift and robust action furthermore we have be crystal clear that our police force need the utmost clarity and support to carry out sometimes complex police operation around protest the walney report on political violence and disruption deal with some of the most fundamental and sensitive cornerstone of our democratic society the opposition will therefore go through and consider the report recommendation very carefully with an approach that our long and proud tradition of the right to peaceful protest must never be undermine by criminal or threatening activity on britain street in the first instance will touch on two point discuss in the report before ask the minister couple of question the first point relate to whether the police should have more power to ban protest that be intimidate or disruptive it be important to note that the police already have power under the public order act to place condition on protest include amend route and timing they also have the power in case where there may be serious public disorder to apply to the home secretary to prohibit particular protest from take place in addition we have already have several new piece of public order legislation in recent year that in some case police force be still get to grip with with this in mind we believe the focus should be on make the exist framework work to make sure that the police can take robust action against those engage in hateful or criminal behaviour on our street that say we will look at this recommendation in more depth and see what the government bring forward because it be vital that everyone in our country feel safe on our street the second point relate to protest organiser pay policing cost the report recommendation raise series of practical consideration about which organisation would be force to pay and under what circumstance again we think the focus at the moment should be on make exist legislation work but as with the rest of the report we will examine these recommendation in more depth and see what the government bring forward before ask the minister couple of question welcome that the report raise serious concern about the grow intimidation of member of this house and local councillor the minister know that through the defending democracy taskforce we will continue to support the government in their important work he also know that stand ready to work closely with he to support his vital work in this area the report have be publish amid activity across government to counter extremism bolster community cohesion and protect our democracy from malign force not least the work under way in the department for levelling up housing and communities after the definition of extremism be publish in march and the work of the defending democracy taskforce therefore ask the minister to explain how other relevant ministers in other relevant government departments will be involve in the preparation of the government response to the walney report lord walney work start in and entirely understandably have to be revise in the aftermath of the october attack although there have to be proper consultation and careful thought apply to such important matter do the minister think it would have be helpful if the report have be publish soon also point out to the minister that the counter extremism strategy be nine year out of date while the hate crime strategy be now four year out of date what plan do he have to update they to conclude let be clear that we on the labour benches will work to ensure that these threat be counter we will work to defend the value of freedom and tolerance that be the cornerstone of our democracy and we will work to defeat all those who seek to harm and undermine our way of life in that we will be unrelenting thank the hon gentleman for his comment and the way he have approach this matter he have always be extremely pragmatic in area of national security and have certainly be very capable partner with whom have be able to work be grateful for his approach today be particularly grateful that the hon gentleman be open to look at certain area of this report seriously such as the question of where cost should lie football club have to contribute to the cost of police match and wimbledon have to contribute to the cost of police tennis and yet here be organisation cost ten of million of pound in police cost each year and do so as though this be their own private fiefdom it strike as very odd way of behave also welcome the hon gentleman approach to the defending democracy taskforce and the support he have offer for it today let just answer the hon gentleman question briefly we will be discuss with dluhc as he know it be an important participant in this discussion and other relevant department include the ministry of justice how to take these recommendation forward and which to adopt be sure he understand that will update the house in the usual way at the appropriate time be also grateful for his support on that call the chair of the intelligence and security committee personally find it reassure that this matter be be debate by two gallant hon and right hon member my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat and the hon member for barnsley central dan jarvis who first meet believe fight extremism in foreign country wish to draw particular attention to lord walney recommendation on require the organiser of repeat protest march to contribute to the cost of police last sunday the relative of the wartime telegraphist air gunners hold their commemoration service in nearby church rather than at the fleet air arm memorial on the seafront at lee on the solent because to do the latter would have involve road closure and policing for which their little association would have have to pay even if one say there should be wide regime where political protest be concern after one large protest on particular cause the repetition of the same protest week in week out possibly for intimidatory purpose should certainly not be cost free to the organiser the challenge we be see with different church and community across the land be where individual organise protest surround area that be use for different purpose and that be exactly why this report be so important when people assemble at site that should otherwise be free for group to associate in whether that be church or village hall the important thing be that our democracy be able to be perform there what my right hon friend speak about may not sound like part of the democratic process in the sense that it be not party political it be not ballot box or an election but it be part of that process because it be about people get together with people able to associate together feel place in our community and know that they be part of rich tradition all the way from those fleet air arm telegraphist to those serve today that be why this report be so important and why we will be put so much effort into it call the snp spokesperson on the snp benches we stand firmly against intimidation violence and extremism anywhere we stand against antisemitism islamophobia and hate in all its pernicious form but this report go nowhere near tackle the cause of hate and violence to recommend as it do in many different way clamp down far on people right to protest be entirely inappropriate just yesterday liberty win notable victory at the high court the tory anti protest law have lead to substantially increase exposure to criminal sanction on the part of protester exercise their civil right and the court find that the home secretary have fail to consult group who may be affect last year when we debate the statutory instrument on which that court case be found criticise the wide and vague definition within that si which lead the government to that challenge we certainly do not need more illiberal legislation that go against our democratic principle do it not it be in that context that we have lord walney doorstop of anti democratic measure in front of we today note that lord walney have serious conflict of interest in this matter as pay adviser to defence and oil and gas interest matter of public record to say that there should be further restriction on group such as just stop oil or anti war demonstrator smack of conflict of interest it certainly strike as somebody who have be on many protest over the year that the author of this report must have be on very few base on his lack of understanding of such protest how they be organise and the type of people who attend they also ask the minister if he will take this opportunity to clarify what the prime minister say the other week when he put people who support the democratic self determination of their country in the same bracket as those who support extremist regime around the world scottish nationalist be not extremist we have be ask for our independence for very long time and in democratic way also wish madam deputy speaker it be very long report also wish to criticise in particular recommendation which say serious incel relate violence in the uk should not be routinely categorise as terrorism which think be extremely worrying would ask the minister to reconsider that in the online space also feel there be lot of contradiction as the report say that platform should not use artificial intelligence but that the police should be empower to do so the hon lady and have slightly different perception on many thing that be true but certainly on liberty over the past few week and month have see member of our community terrify to walk the street of our country have see people particularly from the jewish community but from many other as well fearful that the radicalisation and violence threaten by some of the protest be threaten they have also speak to friend in the muslim community who be terrified that their child will be radicalise into group that advocate violence think it be the job of this government of any british government to defend the interest of all our citizen make absolutely no apology for stand up against extremism whether it seek to target jews young muslims or anybody else it be simply unacceptable the suggestion that lord walney have set out be just that suggestion they be suggestion that the government will look at consider and come back to and will update the house as soon as we have be able to do that however if liberty mean anything it mean the ability to travel freely to the synagogue on saturday to the mosque on friday and to the church on sunday it mean be free from intimidation it mean the ability to enjoy life in the united kingdom free of those pressure and terror this government will always stand up for those freedom have organise number of demonstration myself be nervous at the prospect of be invite to contribute financially to their policing nevertheless clearly there be public order issue and issue of great public nuisance not least to retailer commercial business and ordinary people go about their business when there be repeat series of demonstration may suggest that the government explore the possibility of confine they to static demonstration be it at speaker corner or elsewhere my right hon friend make good point touch on some of the issue cover by lord walney report he highlight the important aspect that time and again we have see protest stretch and spread and be allow to effectively close down large area of city or town when in reality the point be make long before the march the minister know that have fight extremism since have be in this place and will continue to do so fight against it in birmingham over the trojan horse school matter and continue to do so deplore right wing extremism have have death threat make against have go to the police to the house and to the independent office for police conduct the late report from the west midlands police say that they be not prepared to take any action so will proceed far with the iopc the report raise the issue of the protection of members when member do not get protection as we see outside school in birmingham hall green or when candidate be intimidate in batley and spen it be not appropriate hope that the report will lead to some conclusion on that pay huge tribute to the hon gentleman he have be voice of sanity and courage for many year on many of these issue his leadership on the trojan horse scandal be inspirational and his voice of clarity stand up for member of the british public who do not wish to see their child or themselves push into support extremist ideology have be an example to many of we be enormously grateful for his support and would be delighted to work with he on the appalling issue he have face himself lord walney have come up with marvellous report be not surprised know he when he be member of parliament and he be an excellent member of parliament too his report talk about prevent protest from go ahead on account of the cumulative impact of serious disruption he be right to identify that it be intimidatory and as my right hon friend the minister have already say many jewish people muslims and other be frightened of go on the street because of it if the report now lead to more legislation by this government how certain be the minister that individual police force in particular the metropolitan police will implement those new law my hon friend will be delighted to know that the noble lord walney be still member of parliament but he have the misfortune to sit in red not green the truth be that many police force be take effective action already it be sad that some of those who hold the office of police and crime commissioner do not always feel that it be their role to insist that that leadership be offer in that case we be of course speak of london we may need legislation but not necessarily at the moment we need decision where there be threat to democracy and to people give service in public life surely the most effective response will always be one that command the support of all those who be part of that democratic process we can only do that by build consensus the government have table late amendment to the criminal justice bill involve the policing of demonstration some of which include the removal of defence of lawfulness we do not have consensus around those amendment will the minister go back to the home office get the agreement of his department to pause the amendment and convene talk involve all party to see if we can build genuine consensus in this house and beyond that be surely the good and most effective threat to the extremist be rather enjoy the idea that the former deputy chief whip be now tell that we need to build consensus that be certainly not the impression get when he hold that office interruption the recovery be go extremely well if that be the case in reality of course we try to work across all part of the house and try to build consensus but be here to serve the british people not the whim of other hon member welcome the report and thank lord walney for his excellent work it contain reference to social medium which of course have be instrumental in allow extremist not only to organise but to spread their message the social media algorithm reward radicalism fake news and division lord walney make some excellent recommendation but do the minister agree that it be the anonymity of online account that be particularly pernicious when we speak in real life our free speech come with accountability but that be not the case online because there be so many anonymous account should the government look at whether anonymous account be appropriate in democracy as support by my hon friend the member for stroud siobhan baillie crack down on such account would go long way towards sort out the problem welcome my hon friend approach to this and to many other aspect of social medium and online harm she have be an example to many of we in how campaign can be lead to include not exclude and she have make her voice hear extremely clearly all of we in this house will have have that jekyll and hyde experience of meet someone in person who have previously be utterly vitriolic online like see country parson walk down the lane and then discover from their social medium that satan himself could not have come up with more bile it be quite remarkable my hon friend make very good point that we need little bit of recognition about who we all be not just elect member but other who be campaign in favour or against political issue by and large people approach issue in our democracy from position of interest in the common good and support for each other their family community and neighbour but the treatment that somehow come out of people when they be anonymous can be simply vile early this week meet female chief fire officer who explain to some of the intimidation harassment and abuse that she have experience alongside some of her female colleague in senior leadership role in our emergency service up to and include credible death threat as far as can tell that be for no other reason than that they have the audacity to be woman in senior leadership role in our emergency service the walney report consider the intimidation of academic and journalist but urge the minister to speak to colleague across government to see what other protection we might need to offer those people do incredibly important work who under no circumstance should be subject to that type of intimidation welcome the hon lady comment she make some very good point yesterday be talk to festus akinbusoye about the racism he face as police and crime commissioner whether people be in public face role in our emergency service our ambulance police or fire crew for example or they hold an elect position from prime minister to parish councillor the idea that they should face any hostility at all be unacceptable but the idea that they should be target because of their sex race gender or religion be even more unacceptable this country be extraordinary for many reason one thing that love about it be the fact that many people from many different background have find their home here and have find their voice here and make it strongly the transformation that have make to our country for the good be remarkable be hugely proud of that to see that voice silence by people as the hon lady say because they happen to be female fire officer be simply unacceptable and will certainly talk to the minister for crime policing and fire to see what more we can do do my right hon friend accept that at the next election it would be wrong for parliamentary candidate to be intimidate into not disclose their home address on their nomination paper if we change the convention on that we will be give in to these threat do he also accept that if person hire public hall for protest meeting they be liable for public liability insurance might it not be well to say that if someone be organise large public event in public open space they should also be liable for public insurance would that not be well way of do thing rather than expect fee to be pay to the police as usual will listen very carefully to my hon friend suggestion as for address do not think the election system will change between now and the second half of the year as we have now learn look forward to stand in that election whenever it come and for my address to be record as an address in the tonbridge constituency there be aspect of this report that welcome for example the careful cataloguing of the harassment and intimidation of gender critical feminist across the united kingdom be valuable contribution to our public debate however consider the recommendation to be largely far too draconian the joint committee on human rights which chair have repeatedly stress that public authority include the government and the police be under negative obligation not to interfere with the right to peaceful protest and positive obligation to facilitate peaceful protest yesterday high court ruling which be mention by my hon friend the member for glasgow central alison thewliss give very clear message that in regulate protest the government must act within the law and they must not pursue an anti protest agenda at the expense of human right particularly freedom of expression and freedom of assembly would like cast iron assurance from the minister that protection of freedom of expression and freedom of assembly and the right to protest will be at the heart of the government consideration of the report recommendation pay tribute to the hon and learn lady for her courage in speak out on woman right which she have do with enormous dignity and integrity when other have seek to silence she by shout she down close she out or use genuinely quite vile language against she she will hope excuse when say that have have the misfortune to see what some people have say to she on social medium and they be thing that should not be say to anyone the hon and learn lady approach be pragmatic as usual and be grateful for that this be challenging report the point that she make about our have the civil right to assemble debate and discuss be correct this government be not try to and never will try to silence the british people hear the voice of our fellow citizen in the way in which they choose to express they be of course part of democracy but the way in which they choose to express they be also mitigate by the way in which we choose to live as community those choice we call law as she know my hon and learn friend be absolutely right in hold all of we to the principle that we have agree in advance what we be look to do be ensure that those prior agreement those law reflect the reality that everybody have the right to express their view and to live freely in our society and that extremism and extremist have no place in it this be welcome statement have previously discuss some of these issue with lord walney he be an incredibly thoughtful individual and this be an incredibly thoughtful report some of those ridiculous smear that we hear early be completely unnecessary as somebody who believe in freedom of protest do believe that there should be an unlimited totally unfettered right to cause huge disruption to the majority of people who just want to go about their life no matter the economic cost that include for example suffolk constabulary have its resource pull to help out with the management of these protest no do not think that there should be totally unfettered unlimited right so would welcome it if this report could help to address that do my right hon friend agree that when it come to hate be that anti muslim hate or some of the antisemitism we have see in recent month it should be tackle and be see to be tackle as it be happen not simply after the event my hon friend be right we have see the police take some very good action on some of these protest think about or people might be slightly out on the number so forgive have now be arrest follow the protest that we have regularly see on these weekend about or so have be arrest under the terrorism act which be just to say that these be not small arrest but serious crime with which the police be deal would like to make my next point extremely clearly it be point that be make to by middle class muslim family not in my constituency who have be friend of mine for many year one of they say to something that strike home very hard they have be try to protect their teenage kid as we all do from the kind of hatred and inspiration to hatred that be now all too prevalent online through social medium and sometimes other mean they do what responsible parent do they make sure that their kid be home at reasonable hour and that they be part of community group that support their lifestyle and value then they see broadcast on national medium the kind of despicable hatred that inspire people to radicalisation and extremism and sadly they say it be not your son who be likely to be radicalise into islamist hatred it be mine be afraid that he be absolutely right it be the responsibility of this government and any british government to protect the interest of every british citizen frankly it would be racist and deeply unacceptable to consider that the radicalisation of one child be worth more or less than that of another it be not and it be wrong that be why we will stand up against it that be why as my hon friend say some of these protest be not just public order offence but incitement to radicalisation and hatred and they should be treat as such immediately wish to put it on record that thing have be say today on both side of the house with which agree but that fundamentally disagree with this report also wish to put on record my commitment to the protection of democracy and to the hard win right that we enjoy today but this report contribute nothing to those right in fact it undermine they this morning speak to legal mind and expert on these matter who last night have the pleasure of read all page of the report he tell that it be broad sprawling poorly write litter with error not proofread entirely confused and frankly ludicrous shall provide an example on which the minister may wish to comment on paragraph of the report say the government can convene process to examine the potential issue of jury acquit defendant and judge apply law differently when they be transgress in the name of progressive cause like climate change and anti racism we have enjoy the right to trial by jury in this country since before magna carta and this report be undermine that it be sham report and hope the government understand that as the hon member will understand will not answer every single page of the report at this stage will look at all the page that have be submit in fact have look at many of they already the reality be that this will take little bit of work so hope that he will understand the minister talk early about the difference between online and offline but for many of we there be now no distinction in the intimidation and aggression that we face if liberty mean anything for elect official it mean be able to take time off and go to the park last week man make my toddler cry because he would not leave we alone in the street and be instead determined to call child killer in front of she because he do not agree with my view on abortion matter that have debate with many other in my constituency should say that he be not constituent be not alone in be target on my own many member present have talk about it but the parliamentary police tell that such behaviour be completely normal and acceptable within democracy that this man have right to express his opinion that mps should expect to be contact wherever they be in the street and whoever be with they and that if our family be distressed that be just unfortunate the report talk about speaker conference we have an election in the offing many of we have spend year encourage diversity of candidate to come forward particularly woman with child do the minister agree that we need an urgent speaker conference to get the balance right in how we can all protect our family because we be parent and carer as well as politician offer my deep sympathy to the hon lady because that be completely unacceptable would be happy to take that up with she afterwards and have specific conversation about it do not think that speaker conference be necessary right now because we have set up the defend democracy taskforce and the hon member for barnsley central dan jarvis and hon member from other party be already on it as be mr speaker represent through the parliamentary head of security alison giles we have effectively the same thing be assemble with the ability to draw on information from the intelligence service gchq and the police while agree entirely with the spirit of the hon lady suggestion merely argue that we be already do it and know that the hon member for barnsley central and other will pull up if they do not think that we be get it right stand against extremism hate and violence in all form but still think that the report be extraordinarily dangerous draconian and undemocratic the pretence that it be in any way independent be totally undermine by quick glance at the entry in the register of lords interest of its author who work for lobby company that represent arm manufacturer and fossil fuel company will the minister at the very least reassure we that the government will reject recommendation which undermine jury trial in case relate to climate change and anti racism and instead uphold our great legal tradition of allow jury to decide as they see fit will he also accept the high court judgment in liberty case against the home office and abandon any further restriction on the right to peaceful protest and instead protect all our right to freedom of expression and association we be review the decision in the court yesterday and we will look at whether or not to appeal thank the minister for his kind word about lord walney who remind friend to many on the labour benches include london bear disproportionate burden of the protest and counter extremism so how will the minister ensure that the met operational cost be meet by this government for the rise challenge outline in the report also he mention protect all british national will he meet with people from hong kong who have british national overseas status who be increasingly the target of chinese communist party agent in the uk include with those who live in my constituency who be very concerned about their safety and security the hon member know that he and share strong interest in the bno community in the united kingdom hongkonger be target by state actor be deeply wrong one of the thing that have focus on in the period for which have be the security minister be the threat of foreign state here we know that china have act deeply wrongly by threaten individual here in the united kingdom and we will never stand for it we have be extremely clear that hongkonger or bno be first and foremost british national we will defend their right as we will defend everyone right have already meet they and will continue to meet they they be fantastic member of our society and they be welcome thank the minister for his statement completely agree with lot of what he say as somebody who have be harass lot be against harassment discrimination and all of that but let ask question on procedure because think his response today be superior to the report itself query the table office about unopposed return and be tell that they be essentially way for the government to publish document or paper so that accord to paragraph of erskine may they can be protect by statute unopposed return can not be debate or vote on and there be no opportunity for member to object will the minister explain to the house why the government use that procedure and be they scar that the report will not stand up to scrutiny whether from the public or within this chamber thank the hon lady for her very kind comment about my response be somewhat surprised to hear they but be delighted none the less laughter see be not alone in my surprise it be perfectly standard to introduce an independent report conduct in order to help the government through this process in order to prevent any form of vexatious prosecution we be not expect any this be merely formula that be very often use to afford parliamentary privilege to report thank the minister for his statement know that he take the issue seriously and hope that he will agree that liberty also mean the right to protest that be cornerstone of our democracy and people have the right to protest in peaceful and respectful manner number of these protest go through my vauxhall constituency and police be often abstract to cover they we know that protest can be difficult and complex and remain an operational issue note some of the report recommendation but do he agree that for this to work ministers and politician must respect the operational independence of all police force the hon lady be right that the police be operationally independent but they be not independent of the consideration of the people they serve in her case the people of vauxhall she know that the people she represent have legitimate voice in discuss policing and have their representation hear indeed she champion they in this place and the mayor of london be suppose to champion they through the police body as she also know it be important to balance different right of course there be right to protest people have fundamental democratic right to raise their voice in opposition to thing that they find objectionable people also have simple right to be able to feed their family take their kid to school or attend place of worship when the two be in conflict it be right that the police set reasonable balance think lord walney be suggest that that balance should be look at carefully point of order on point of order madam deputy speaker today the equality and human rights commission the country equality watchdog launch an investigation into the department for work and pensions over its potentially discriminatory treatment of sick and disabled people within the social security system this be absolutely unprecedented the investigation have be escalate follow two year of the ehrc try to agree remedial action with the department follow the section notice issue to it by the ehrc regard potentially discriminatory action against disabled people the ehrc will investigate whether the department have act unlawfully by fail to protect disabled people over number of year include by fail to prevent their death by suicide or other mean with recess fast approach the next dwp oral over month away and discussion this week in the chamber about the importance of duty of candour for all public servant have mr speaker been give information about when we can expect to question the government regard this thank the hon lady for give notice of her point of order she raise the issue of whether minister will come to the house to make statement be not aware that mr speaker have receive any such notification but the hon lady have put her view on the record and know that those on the treasury bench will feed back her comment on point of order madam deputy speaker the dwp permanent secretary tell the work and pensions committee this morning that he be unaware of the nature of the equality and human rights commission challenge to his department but in january last year he tell the select committee that the negotiation with ehrc be go well and an agreement would be secure the secretary of state also tell the committee in november that negotiation be constructive and that he expect agreement to be reach it be wholly unprecedented that full formal investigation be now under way the ministerial code make clear that the secretary of state be responsible for correct any inadvertent error at the early opportunity and that minister should require civil servant who give evidence before parliamentary committees to be as helpful as possible in provide accurate truthful and full information have the secretary of state request statement to set out why the house have inadvertently not have access to an accurate representation of the negotiation how can we as member ensure that the house be update on why those negotiation have fail and on the impact for disabled people and for the treasury of this full ehrc investigation be grateful to the hon member for his point of order and for give notice of it obviously the chair be not responsible for the accuracy or otherwise of evidence give to select committees again know those on the treasury bench will take on board his comment about minister come to make statement the other way that he may wish to get further clarification be through the select committee itself give what he have say about the evidence be give to it on point of order madam deputy speaker with apology use some figure be not entirely sure of have now have they confirm and just want to correct the record very slightly say that there have be more than arrest from those protest and that be correct but it be not under the terrorism act my apology be grateful to the minister for correct the record so quickly thank you immigration and asylum motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision for the annual approval by the house of commons of maximum number in respect of immigration and asylum to provide that asylum may only be grant to individual identify as refugee by the un refugee agency other than in specified circumstance and for connected purpose be delighted to be bring in this bill the british people want parliament and their representative to get to grip with immigration both illegal and legal that be widespread conviction hold by constituent across party and across region accord to yougov of voter think immigration have be too high over the last year and only believe it have be too low on the island accord to my most recent survey of constituent it be the second most important issue after the nhs my bill help to reinforce parliamentary sovereignty encourage transparency in decision making and focus responsibility on members of parliament and in do so help to restore faith in government and in parliament we have make considerable success of immigration in the past year in the post war period and there be an accepted case that moderate migration be good thing for our country be hugely proud to be english and british but be half immigrant myself do not necessarily think of myself often in those term but my mum end up in dresden in displace person camp after world war two for two century her ancestor come from the russian empire they be mix of german and as understand it polish and ukrainian ancestry and farm near zhitomir mile west of kyiv the other half of be solidly english wherever we come from however there be shared sense that migration should be moderate and control this government be do more than any other in recent year we hear today that the removal of illegal people be up the rwanda scheme be due to start later this year whatever people think of it and we have grow number of return agreement with other nation but think we need something more permanent because all of that require political will for the only way that ultimately we will solve this issue and give our voter and our constituent confidence in it be for parliament to take responsibility on itself to set annual legal limit for legal migration include for asylum the only way mps will be serious about this issue be if we have to look our constituent in the eye and explain our action there will be no hiding behind quango or behind agency my bill would require the government to present figure or range of figure to parliament mp would have access to the same datum so that we and the british people could see what each figure would deliver in term of cost and benefit and what the effect would be on housing on public service on the economy and on social cohesion it be extraordinary that the debate have happen thus far without reference to many of those important issue as if somehow immigration can be debate without talk about housing education or healthcare provision either way at the end of the day mps will own that figure and they will have to explain it to their constituent that be call democracy and in my mind it be good thing if there be emergency such as hong kong or ukraine ministers can come back and ask for waiver for specific number in line with our international obligation the critical point here be that be not stipulate figure or pluck one out of thin air this be the principle of parliamentary sovereignty which would have think we should all as parliamentarian want to support in theory the labour party could say we want million plus year on migration the lib dems they be mean to be here to oppose this bill but they be so concerned about it that can not see single one of they here to speak in opposition or the snp who be here in force could suggest million in theory parliament can decide what it want this bill be about give power back to parliament for this debate touch on wide issue about parliamentarian pass their power and responsibility to other in scandal after scandal we see expert fail and politician effectively have to cover for they whether it be the post office scandal or the contaminate blood scandal the answer be not less power to parliament or more quango or expert it be more debate more scrutiny and more transparency so that people can see what be happen in their name and they can test and judge the people who make those decision grant if there be conservative government the practical outcome of my bill would be to lower legal migration from its current level to something dare say it in line with our manifesto commitment however it would also allow great thought on what our nation want and need my hon friend the member for harborough neil and my right hon friend the member for newark robert jenrick in their excellent centre for policy studies report demolish many of the lazy argument about migration such as that it be automatically associate with economic growth arguably the era of mass migration have see slow economic growth per capita we know it exacerbate pressure on social and other housing and health service by historical standard our build rate be pretty healthy at the moment but it be dwarf because of the high net migration my bill would force we to think whether we really need to grant visa for job british people could do with encouragement or high wage one of the great irony of this debate be that large scale immigration come at the price of suppress wage of some of the poor people in this country one would have think that the snp the lib dems and the labour party who profess to care for work people would consider some of those argument rather than hoover up computer programmer doctor dentist and care worker from other country why not train up some more ourselves my bill would also make civil servant think more carefully about get the number correct the department of health and social care forecast that people would use the health and social care visa route in fact people do last year with dependant population one and half time the size of portsmouth we need to think about the impact of the decision we be make when civil servant be get the number so phenomenally dramatically wrong would like to touch briefly on asylum as well we have grant asylum to nearly half million people since an extraordinary number there be nine safe and legal route into this country there be at the time because that include syria however to prevent pull factor and to ensure that people have confidence that refugee be refugee would like this bill to have all refugee come via united nations programme do not think that the united nations high commissioner for refugees behave particularly well on the rwanda ruling but it be still the only global body that look after refugee my plan would see our country take only bona fide un approve refugee that come from genuinely war tear area again that would strengthen people confidence in the system and give the add benefit of cut back on our own asylum system which be sad to say be increasingly unfit for purpose what sane system give of people from albania asylum when they come from safe european country it be simply not credible my bill enhance democracy accountability and transparency that be certainly its intention be grateful that snp members have turn up and wish the liberals have apparently they be also go to speak against the motion but say respectfully to those who oppose the bill that they be oppose parliamentary scrutiny oppose the handing back of power to member of parliament and oppose transparency and they be set themselves against the will of the people of scotland and britain we need more transparency in our national decision making we need to question civil servant and expert more not less and we need great scrutiny and big role for parliament to allow mps and the public level of scrutiny that enable good government that be the purpose of the bill to give parliament the power to set migration number the british people want fair but robust immigration system they be right my new law would deliver that and ensure that we member of parliament be answerable to our people stand to speak to this motion on behalf of the snp but not on behalf of the lib dems who have clearly chickene out and run away and not for the first time be very proud to say that support immigration which be an economic good we thank people for come here and contribute their good talent and skill to this country they contribute so very much it be an act of absolutely bizarre economic damage to try to restrict their number in the way that the hon member for isle of wight bob seely have set out in his ten minute rule motion the issue that we have have for many year in scotland have be emigration not immigration immigration be an essential part of thriving economy scotland be set to experience considerable population decline in the absence of net international migration and that will have significant impact on our economy because the people who come to work here contribute they pay the pension of our old people they look after people and they contribute and bring their skill to our economy they be welcome and we should not tell they otherwise the hon member bill in seek to put cap on the number of people come should really be entitle the cut off our nose to spite our face bill cap on number be entirely illogical and impractical if he say the cap be people he would shut the door on the regardless of what talent and skill they may bring and the economic benefit or otherwise they may generate that be absolutely illogical he mention that people bring he their concern about migration but the evidence be that people consistently get migration number wrong it be our job as mps to inform people not to pander to some of their bad prejudice it be also the case that people in area with the low migration seem bizarrely to fear it most whereas those who be fortunate enough to live in constituency such as glasgow central welcome migration because they see its benefit it be absolutely bizarre in work publish in recent day migration policy scotland say that people view of migration remain more positive than negative the hon member do not speak for we when he talk about the will of the people of scotland he do not and can not speak for the people of scotland who thank those who come here to work and contribute in whichever way they do the hon member also talk about pressure on health service again the reality be that we be more likely to be treat by migrant than to be in the queue next to one people come here to work in our health and social care sector and we thank they for it because the sector face significant shortage and we need they desperately it be not the case that people migrate to this country suppress wage growth in fact country with high immigration than we have high wage growth than the pathetic and insipid wage growth that break brexit britain have have so he be wrong about that we have significant labour shortage in the uk as result of the conservatives ridiculous brexit policy the office for national statistics say that third of uk business be experience labour shortage which have an impact on productivity sector such as hospitality farming health and social care professional service and scientific and technical service be cry out for skill skill that we do not have if the hon member have come here to argue for further investment in education and university which the tories have cut back over many year would have be interested in that argument but that be not what he be say he be say turn off the tap and everything will be fine which could not be further from the truth let turn to the point about the graduate visa and international student my glasgow central constituency be the one that most benefit from international student see very clearly that international student bring significant benefit there have be much chat about the graduate visa and although the migration advisory committee do not approve of its introduction in the first place it have say that the uk government should keep it unlike any other uk government policy that one have actually be roar success have meet and exceed its target so of course perversely tory members want to scrap it you couldnae make this up the change that the conservatives have make in remove dependant from visa have already knock off our gdp if they continue down that road they will see further economic damage as well as significant damage to our educational institution because the fact that those institution require international student have be build into their model over many year the policy also benefit our student who can sit next to international student in class and learn from they and grow international student bring so much by way of their experience as well as help financially the uk be already worker short as result of the conservatives damage brexit policy that shortfall be not be make up because of the poor decision that the government be make in pursue the end of free movement which the labour party also believe in they be damage the economy of scotland which do not vote for brexit because of their ideological obsession the hon member have talk about the role of the unhcr be not sure that he have actually speak to the unhcr because what he have describe be not its job that be not what it do its role be not to determine who be refugee and who be not in very limited circumstance the unhcr operate resettlement policy but it say itself that resettlement be the rare exception it be available to few than of refugee worldwide and very small number have arrive in the uk through resettlement programme that be why we have an asylum system in the country just now it be very poorly run and if the hon gentleman want to make an argument about reform the home office and its terrible policy would support he but that be not what he be say he seem to be suggest that the home office immigration policy area should be remove altogether and hand over to an international organisation to determine again do not think that be quite what he mean but that be what he be say the unchr have very important role it carry out international function it have also very damningly criticise the uk government immigration policy include the rwanda plan and other however the hon gentleman be ask the unhcr to do job that be not its job which just point to the ludicrousness and unenforceability of the bill that he seek to introduce today it be simply not practical the bill speak to very small and narrow group of people within the conservative party and in the rest of the uk people who want to close the door pull up the drawbridge and let nobody into little brexit britain the hon gentleman do not speak for scotland scotland want to be part of the world and to decide these policy for ourselves yes to have migration policy that decide who come in and who do not but not to shut the door nor to pretend that by do so britain will somehow be some special little land that it once be britain have always welcome people from around the world and also have legacy of go out into the world empire and everything else we have those link we want scotland to be that international country but britain be hold we back prevent we from allow people into our country and have the migration policy that we need have support the devolution of migration policy but can not wait for the day when we get full control over all policy so that scotland economy and future can be in scotland hand rather than those of westminster government who do not see our need do not recognise what we as country want and do not speak for we either at home or on the international stage question put standing order no lee anderson caroline ansell sarah atherton bob blackman jack

to order that bob seely robert jenrick danny kruger marco longhi lia nici nick fletcher dr caroline johnson sir edward leigh and henry smith present the bill bob seely accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill prevention and suppression of terrorism beg to move that the draft counter terrorism and security act risk of be draw into terrorism revised guidance regulations which be lay before this house on may be approve this instrument which be lay before parliament on may relate to prevent in scotland after the approval of both chambers last year the prevent duty guidance for specified authority in england and wales come into effect on december as many member will know prevent be one of the pillar of the contest strategy the united kingdom counter terrorism strategy which have be replicate around the world the aim of prevent be to stop people become terrorist or support terrorism it also extend to support the rehabilitation and disengagement of those already involve in terrorism put simply prevent be an early intervention programme to help keep all of we safe to do so effectively it require frontline sector across society include education healthcare local authority criminal justice agency and the police to support this mission that be why we have the prevent duty set out in the counter terrorism and security act it sit alongside long establish duty on professional to protect people from range of other harm such as involvement in gang or physical and sexual exploitation the prevent duty help to ensure people susceptible to radicalisation be offer timely intervention before it be too late my right hon friend will know that be the security minister who introduce the prevent duty he have just set out the first time there be legislative requirement on the organisation he describe to participate in that programme he will also know there have be review of prevent by mr shawcross and that that have make some useful suggestion about how it can be refine my right hon friend may well speak about that in his speech but would like he to focus particularly on how that affect the prevent duty perhaps the good way for to start this response be by pay tribute to my right hon friend who be instrumental in ensure we get the contest strategy through and in hold the department to account to make sure that it not only deliver when it begin but that it continue to deliver it be hugely important part of our protection and will indeed be come on to sir william work it be worth say that sir william be fantastic public servant who have do brilliant work for our country in many way and his recent review be one of those many area in which he have contribute it be great pleasure for to be able to put on record my tribute and thank to he for all his work as have say the prevent duty help ensure people who be susceptible to radicalisation be offer timely intervention before it be too late none of this be easy because as there be no single track to person be radicalise there be many factor which can either alone or combine lead to someone subscribe to an extremist ideology which in some case can lead to terrorism these factor often include exposure to radicalise influence real and perceive grievance and an individual own susceptibility the prevent duty guidance exist to help those work in frontline sector to navigate these challenging situation the act require specify authority to have regard to this guidance it be challenging but we must always strive for excellence the government be commit to ensure that prevent be effective the report of the independent review of prevent the irp be publish on february and set out sir william shawcross recommendation all of which be accept by the government in response last year we implement the prevent duty guidance for england and wales respond to several of sir william recommendation the update guidance for scotland which be the subject of this statutory instrument be issue on may and it will ensure that scotland too can benefit from update guidance and good practice the home office work quickly with the scottish government to ensure that the update prevent duty guidance for scotland be closely tailor to the scottish context it be worth say that all part of the united kingdom face slightly different challenge on prevent because different political view and ideology affect different community in all part of the united kingdom and that be as true of scotland as it be of anywhere else the guidance have update prevent objective to make it clear that prevent should tackle the ideological cause of terrorism it set out requirement more clearly articulate the need for high quality training so that risk can be identify and manage it provide an update threat picture and give detail of the strategic security threat check which help prevent recognise and respond to the great threat this will ensure that prevent be well equip to counter the threat we face and the ideology underpin they as well as respond to the independent review of prevent recommendation the guidance reflect current good practice it support and exemplify the excellent work that we know take place across the country to keep we safe and help prevent people from become terrorist or from support terrorism the guidance will assist specified authority in scotland to understand how good to comply with the duty it include detail of the capability they should have to be able to identify and manage risk it also advise on how they can help create an environment where the ideology that be use to radicalise people into terrorism be challenge not permit to flourish people with responsibility relevant to the delivery of prevent be consult on the guidance range of key scottish governmental partner be engage throughout the development of the update guidance and their feedback have be positive the government have be work closely with these partner to roll out the guidance and support its implementation subject to the approval of this house this statutory instrument will bring the new guidance into effect on august replace the guidance it will strengthen the prevent system and help to keep we all safe which be why commend it to the house call the shadow minister thank the minister for his remark it be always good to see he in his place at the outset want to put on record that we on the opposition benches believe national security the defence of our homeland be an issue that as much as possible should rise above the political fray and unite we in common cause give that this statutory instrument relate to scotland think it be right that we take the opportunity to pay tribute to the extraordinary scottish man and woman serve in government our intelligence service our police and our armed force who work tirelessly from land end to john to keep scotland and all of the united kingdom safe these man and woman protect our country must of course work within legislative framework today we be debate the counter terrorism and security act risk of be draw into terrorism revised guidance regulations in the chamber some seven month as the minister say after we debate fairly similar statutory instrument to update the prevent duty guidance in england and wales before turn to the detail of the statutory instrument before the house on the update scottish prevent duty guidance want with your indulgence madam deputy speaker to very briefly put on record my great affection for scotland home to beautiful highland countryside from glen affric to glen urquhart breathtake coastline from the mull of galloway right the way round to st abb head and bustle city on the clyde the forth the dee and the tay scotland be truly special place add to that the fact that scottish people be some of the most warm hearted and generous people anyone could wish to meet and be so proud that scotland stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of our united kingdom to counter the threat of an increasingly more volatile and polarised world be slightly hesitant about interrupt this eulogy to all thing scot but have the hon gentleman note that scot have just take the chair have make that observation and that in part give the confidence to continue go perhaps long than otherwise might have be the case sense give the beady eye you have on madam deputy speaker that should probably it be okay with madam deputy speaker say it be fine to keep say nice thing about scotland but be slightly conscious that the minister may have somewhere to go in the not too distant future do not want to detain he for too much long give that there be apparently quite an important meeting take place at at at the minister have admit it but although would like the opportunity to spend even long talk about what fantastic place scotland be should probably begin to turn to the substance of these matter do so by say that we on the opposition benches support the update to the scottish prevent duty guidance although there be some question about how it sit within broad effort to counter extremism and terrorism which will come to in moment regardless of where in the uk extremism rear its ugly head it be fuel by fear and hate and stoke by malign individual whose motif be abhorrent to the vast majority of decent people in scotland and the rest of the united kingdom we have feel the devastation that extremism can cause through terrorist attack around the world and in our country with every act of terror there be path start with radicalisation and end with life lose and life change forever at this point want to take the opportunity and be sure the minister will join in do so of pay tribute to figen murray she be the mother of manchester arena bombing victim martyn hett and she be campaigner for martyn law just today she have complete her walk down from manchester to london to meet the prime minister and the leader of the opposition the dignity and tenacity show by figen remind we all of the painful legacy leave by terrorism that be face by too many people in our country that be why prevent practitioner in scotland and across the uk need confidence and clarity in prevent duty guidance as this guidance should ensure that the right intervention be take place at the right time to detect disrupt and defeat extremism wherever it present itself these intervention save life and we should not understate the crucial role play by prevent practitioner we therefore welcome change in the guidance to improve the quality of prevent referral to multi agency panel in scotland by give clear advice on how to understand and manage risk include through training and risk assessment and reduce permissive environment as key theme to tackle the ideological cause of terrorism and broad radicalising influence these be important step as there can never be any excuse for extremist violence anywhere on britain street or the glorification of any violence link to any ideological cause as the extremist threat landscape continue to shift across the uk there must be full confidence in prevent work in scotland would be grateful if the minister could answer the follow question first since we debate the prevent duty guidance regulation for england and wales the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities have publish the uk government new definition of extremism an update from their definition that the scottish government do not adopt can the minister outline what discussion he have have with colleague in the scottish government about adopt the new definition to what extent can he say whether it be discuss as part of wide discussion on community cohesion at the inter ministerial standing committee meeting on march secondly and still touch on the intergovernmental work sir william shawcross state in his review his concern about the lack of oversight and support for prevent delivery in the scottish education sector he recommend that the scottish government restructure prevent in line with the wide uk model although guidance for high education institution in scotland be publish alongside the update scottish prevent duty guidance it would be helpful if the minister could explain what feedback be receive from the scottish education sector ahead of publication what will the next step be with the scottish government regard prevent and the scottish education sector furthermore sir william say in february this year that ministers have ignore some of his key recommendation have the minister discuss those concern with sir william thirdly in his review sir william challenge the perceive extremist threat landscape in scotland as identify by scottish official and recommend that more frequent assessment be make to enhance understanding among practitioner and official alike it be not clear in the uk government response to this recommendation that they would work with the scottish government and police scotland on increase the frequency can the minister outline what be be do to improve this vital intelligence gathering work in scotland to conclude the opposition will work constructively with the government as much as possible on these important matter and know that the minister will take my point and question in that spirit all of we on the opposition benches want to ensure that the scottish public and the wide uk be spar the terror of extremism and shield from the depravity of terrorist violence we will work closely with the uk and scottish government to ensure that they succeed in that vital task thank the labour front bench spokesperson the hon member for barnsley central dan jarvis for his kind word about scotland be rather worried give the length he be go to that might not get back to scotland this evening in respond to this statutory instrument today very much welcome the engagement that the home office have have with the scottish government and partner and organisation in scotland we have be able to tailor prevent to the scottish context and it be important that we do so because some of the threat we face be not quite the same as have be acknowledge will also take this opportunity to thank figen murray for all the work and advocacy she have do follow the manchester arena bombing ask the minister for any update he can give on the status of the propose legislation we would all like to know what exactly the government be plan for that in that light also pay tribute to eilidh macleod from barra who also lose her life in that bombing and remark on the wonderful work that the trust in her memory do to develop youth music as lovely legacy from something so terrible the scottish government have tailor prevent to emphasise early intervention safeguard and prevent people from become alienate or isolate with the aim of reduce vulnerability and increase resilience to toxic extremist narrative accord to the review understand extremism in research finding be publish in july last year stakeholder public sector practitioner and member of the public often find it difficult to articulate precise definition of the concept of extremism when ask extremism be often depict as view or behaviour in opposition to societal and cultural norm value and moral the use of advocacy of violence to promote viewpoint or in pursuit of particular aim be also common feature of the definition find in that research broadly in that research public sector practitioner feel that because there be small ethnic minority population in scotland as compare with england the response be slightly different people may feel less marginalise in scotland less susceptible to some of those message and less vulnerable to radicalisation it would be negligent of not to mention the wide concern about prevent few month ago meet amnesty which have concern about prevent and have produce report it be worry by some of the extreme example where prevent have go horribly wrong and people have end up stigmatise people with neurodiversity or learning disability have sometimes be catch up in prevent for example what safeguard be the government put in place to prevent the awful thing that have happen to people and the impact that can have on their day to day life people who be no threat should not end up in prevent because of misunderstanding by someone who have the right to report they let reflect on my wide concern about the walney report and some of the comment of the levelling up secretary early this year some in the community feel that they be be stigmatise undeservedly worry that their involvement in group may push they towards radicalisation and prevent when they should not be we should try to draw people away from be stigmatise repeat what say early we should think about the far right in our definition of extremism because it be serious worry for and many other we should also be concern about extreme british nationalism many of the people who come after on social medium have union flag in their profile they be not any other kind of extremist but definitely british nationalist who come at because believe in independence for my country those people should be acknowledge in the report encourage the minister to go far on misogyny and incel extremism because that be clear and definite threat to woman our young people be at severe risk of radicalisation and be already be radicalise as the mother of teenage boy be deeply worried by the kind of thing that teenage boy see on their social medium feed will the minister to do more about that within the prevent strategy the scottish government will continue to work with the uk government on prevent develop the necessary guideline co operate with anti terror police and tackle extremist violent threat wherever they reside the number of people refer to prevent in scotland have be small do not want the number of report to increase greatly because that would cause wide concern about where we be go as society urge caution and the need for community cohesion because that be the very good defence against people be draw into extremism if the community stand around they and they do not feel isolated and exclude but part of something rather than feel marginalise and drive apart let start with some of the point that the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss make want to make it absolutely clear that incel violence be form of extremism that draw on an ideology base on the hatred of woman it be completely unacceptable and sadly it have lead to terrorism not just here but in other part it be utterly vile and it be as serious and pernicious as any other form of terrorism or extremism it be not quite as prevalent as some other form that be to be welcome but it can be keep down only if as she say we include people in our community and cut off the route to hatred before they emerge and become passage the hon member for barnsley central dan jarvis as usual have approach this in calm and professional manner it have be pleasure to work with he on this as it have be in many other area it have be an absolute joy to work with figen murray on another area she have be remarkable advocate for individual across our country who have be victim of terror seven year ago almost to the day she lose her son martyn know we all pay enormous tribute to she for the dignity and professionalism with which she have approach her campaign one that have lead to an awful lot of support include from the prime minister and other be very grateful to the hon gentleman for his approach to this sadly can not offer any update at this stage as he know we be go through the necessary consultation process will bring forward further update as soon as can but that will be in due course be afraid the hon gentleman raise an interesting question about dluhc conversation with the scottish government forgive but will have to leave the dluhc secretary to speak for himself on that as be not aware of his conversation speak regularly to the scottish government on these area some of which be reserve matter as he know national security be reserved matter and therefore the responsibility of the uk government that say there be an awful lot of co operation not just with the scottish government but with other administration in scotland include different council in different county while we be on this matter the hon gentleman paean to scotland would not have anything to do with his desire to get in campaign mode would it so cynical appreciate what he say but for somebody who decide to throw himself out of aeroplane in the south of england rather than join our great and glorious core training in arbroath that be just very strange thing to have do for who claim to have that unbelievable love for the north it be huge privilege to tease the hon gentleman we have be friend for far too long for to miss the opportunity it be always pleasure to be in scotland and to see the extraordinary achievement make by the scottish people not just in this area but in many other this be one of those area where just want to pick up on something the hon gentleman speak about the way in which scotland be deal with these case want to pay enormous tribute to those who be gather together in gartcosh over different agency include everybody from police scotland to his majesty revenue and customs and various environmental agency it be absolutely extraordinary to see what they have bring together it be real power centre not just for keep scotland safe but for fight crime and disorder all across the united kingdom it be fantastic resource and really impressive if we be give this paean to scotland should also say that the head of whose scottish tone have inform of some of the bad abuse of humanity in this country demonstrate the level of commitment that many have place on record my extreme gratitude to all officer counter terrorism police and the national crime agency who do huge amount to keep we safe alongside the territorial force whose work be absolutely essential none of that would work unless there be the underpinning and the underpinning be make sure that society do not breed more extremist the way we avoid that be by make sure that people be part of our community the prevent programme be absolutely essential to make sure that when somebody stray they be assist to come back into the fold this be the work as be say of the good shepherd that be what be so important today make sure that we keep people in our society and within the fold able to contribute and able to feel part of wide whole that be absolutely essential apologise for miss the minister opening remark as someone who take huge personal interest in our counter terrorism capability want to put on record the fact that we be work cross party that be very welcome indeed do the security minister agree that while state on state aggression be back at scale that we be now have to advance our defence posture the threat of non state actor and extremism be very much there in particular we be see the rise of isis and potentially overtake the scale of threat that al qaeda pose it be now out of control take advantage of recruitment indoctrinate and task in afghanistan and elsewhere do he agree that we should all be concern about isis my right hon friend be absolutely right that isis name that area of afghanistan after the old arabic name khorasan for that region be pernicious threat and it have be spread in afghanistan sadly we have see it act include most recently in moscow it be deeply pernicious force and one that we be acutely aware of the agency cite early be extremely cautious to keep very close eye on it the tragedy be that these organisation have the ability to form and organise under the taliban that hateful organisation which have take over the territory of afghanistan and be not only bring violence pain and suffering to million of afghans but ensure that woman and girl do not enjoy the liberty that they should that they be deny education prevent from work and prevent from see the progress and opportunity that we would all hope for other around the world scotland now have prevent adviser which bring it into line with england and wales the adviser work be extremely important to ensure that we be all work together as have say while it be certainly true that extremism have local characteristic it be not the same extremism that we see in london birmingham bristol glasgow edinburgh cardiff belfast or any other place where we might be campaign in the second half of the year to answer the point make by the hon member for barnsley central the effort we be make in all part of the united kingdom be essential because keep the united kingdom safe together and whole be this government priority and one that we will never stop work on say that as passionate be sure that the hon member for glasgow central alison thewliss will understand that we may disagree on that even though we work together in this regard be grateful for the contribution make today and be grateful for the support of member in all part of the house for this statutory instrument let just reassert that the core objective be to strengthen the prevent system which be vital component of our counter terrorism operation question put and agree to licence and licensing beg to move that the draft licensing act uefa european football championship licensing hours order which be lay before this house on may be approve it be genuine pleasure to speak about this motion it be certainly much great pleasure than answer the urgent question early this afternoon but admittedly the bar be set fairly low this summer the euro football championship will take place in germany be delighted that both the england and the scotland man national team have qualify to take part although be sure the house will share my sorrow that the northern irish and welsh team do not on this occasion hopefully they will be join england and scotland in this draft contingent order seek to extend licensing hour for venue across england and wales in the hope extremely likely event that england or scotland reach the semi final or the final of the upcoming tournament be extremely confident that one or even both of those team will make it to that stage in fact confidently predict that it will be an england scotland final when it come around that be probably about the only thing that it be safe to predict at the moment give the fevered and febrile speculation that be currently under way in these part if england or scotland or indeed both team reach those stage the order will extend licensing hour in england and wales from pm until be on the day of the semi final which be due to take place on and july and the final which be schedule to take place on july have no idea whether any other significant event may be take place around that time as well people will want to watch those game in the pub and if there be extra time or there be penalty or indeed any recount they will want to be able to enjoy drink while the penalty or indeed the recount take place my own experience of recount in when lose parliamentary constituency by vote be painful one that be not look to repeat anytime soon know that pub in my constituency will appreciate be able to stay open bit long pub such as the wattenden arms the pembroke in coulsdon the tudor rose and the fox be just talk to my hon friend the member for north cornwall scott mann who say that pub in his constituency would like to stay open too although apparently some of they sometimes show rugby as well as football he be great champion of pub in north cornwall and know that all of we in this house want to support pub in our respective constituency be very pleased to see the motion before we today wonder whether the minister share my slight disappointment that the quarter final be not include in this order give that the first quarter final be on friday july and there may be other thing to celebrate on that day possibly new government well we have to strike the right balance these type of order can be use only for event of exceptional significance and we have choose to draw the line at the semi final and the final as for other event of significance that may be occur around then be afraid be as much in the dark as the hon gentleman be but know that he will join in wish pub in his constituency well hopefully they will be able to enjoy the euros in spirit of conviviality as the tournament unfold know that my hon friend the member for dudley south mike wood former chair of the all party parliamentary group on beer send his good wish to pub in his constituency and to those up and down the land as the house will be aware under section of the licensing act the secretary of state can make an order relax licensing hour to mark occasion of exceptional national significance which be the very high threshold to which refer moment ago the decision to lay this draft order stem from consultation that the home office conduct early this year over of respondent be in favour of extend licensing hour for the semi final and final if one of the home nation team reach those stage respondent agree with the propose duration of potential extension which as have set out would extend licensing hour until be the follow morning and they agree that the order should apply to both england and wales respondent also agree that it should apply only to sale of alcohol for consumption on the premise rather than off it this order will ensure that premise will be allow to remain open until be without have to notify the licensing authority typically the local authority via temporary event notice benefit both business and local authority business will save time and money by not have to give temporary event notice while licensing authority will save time and money by not have to process they of course temporary event notice can be apply for but it be somewhat bureaucratic process later closing time will be welcome boost for pub and bar at busy time should either england or scotland be involve in the semi final or final as have say already fervently hope that both england and scotland make the final give that be passionate unionist it be right that acknowledge that the police have express some reservation about extend licensing hour indeed they say that they be not in favour of it give the potential for increase crime and disorder we have carefully consider those representation and although police deployment and resource be operational matter for police we know that police force will put in place plan that will minimise the risk as they have do in the past it be worth note that there have be no significant large scale disorder incident link to licensing extension during previous tournament which be testament to the fact that force be well verse in manage these matter and be sure the house will join in thank police force up and down the country for everything they do to maintain order and reduce the risk of crime also emphasise that this be limited two hour extension to licensing hour which be proportionate approach mark these event and that the contingent order we be consider only cover sale for consumption on the premise after pm it do not cover premise that sell alcohol only for consumption off the premise such as off licence and supermarket before finish normally the most popular word in any speech give will make just two further point of clarification the first be that if either england or scotland be successful in reach either the semi final or the final this extension will apply only to license venue in england and wales this be because licensing be devolved matter and it would be for the scottish government or the northern ireland department of justice to make arrangement for extend licensing hour in scotland and northern ireland which would strongly encourage they to do hopefully they need very little encouragement to do that secondly if neither england nor scotland reach the semi final normal licensing hour will apply on and july if either or both team reach the semi final but neither team be in the final normal licensing hour will apply on july the date of the final the house will be aware that the hon member for south shields mrs lewell buck be sponsor private member bill which think have its report and third reading stage just last friday and which the government fully support to make order such as this subject to the negative resolution procedure in the future this would of course rob the house of the opportunity it be currently enjoy to hear my word on this topic which be sure would come as sore disappointment but if that private member bill complete its passage through the other place debate such as these will not happen because we will be use the negative resolution obviously that law be not in force now so we be debate this today in the normal way however if as we hope and expect this order currently before the house command universal support perhaps even enthusiastic universal support and we will find out in just moment when the shadow security minister stand up and we be able to determine his level of support and enthusiasm it will give weight to the point that the hon member for south shields and other have make that debate these order be not necessarily the good use of precious parliamentary time give that they be pretty uncontentious and generally matter of unanimous assent and sometimes even enthusiastic unanimous assent in conclusion we have bring forward this order in recognition of the huge interest there will be in the euro tournament and in particular the huge interest in the fortune of england and scotland which know be dear to the heart of many member and member of the public up and down the country like all england fan be hopeful that this will be the year that football finally come home again and be sure that many member will want to join in express encouragement and support to gareth southgate and his team and also of course to the scottish team who hope also do very well in the tournament with that thought commend this order to the house can begin by thank the minister for his remark my hon friend the member for nottingham north alex norris unfortunately can not respond today so have be bring off the substitute bench to cut to the chase be pleased to be able to confirm to the minister our enthusiastic support for this motion football be positive powerful force that bring people together whether it be the european championship or the world cup international tournament can bring our nation together the euros this summer will be another focal point and will be watch keenly by million across the country and indeed around the world each of the nation of the uk will have fond memory of support and celebrate its national team and in world that can sometimes seem pressurised and stressful these moment have be genuinely joyous it be no wonder that england and scotland and sense that would be push my luck if try to say anything more positive about scotland order for the sake of clarity the hon gentleman would not be push his luck while be in the chair he may proceed thank you madam deputy speaker scotland fan along with england fan will be particularly look forward to this summer tournament and hopefully celebrate great success we therefore welcome this statutory instrument to extend the licensing hour of premise by two hour should home nation reach the semi final or final of this summer euros many will welcome this change to allow people to come together to get behind their country and pub club and the wide hospitality industry across the country will also appreciate this move the hospitality industry struggle immensely during the pandemic and many be still suffer with the effect of that unprecedented disruption sadly dozen of pub continue to close each month across the uk these will have be community hub place to meet friend and family and ever more important social space when society can sometimes feel increasingly atomised pub bar and social club be part of our country serve an important function that we must work together to protect and support the opportunity to extend opening hour during what promise to be very busy period for the sector will be sure be greatly appreciate so the opposition be pleased to support the order seek assurance from the minister on few point have the government consult trade body to ensure that the hospitality industry be well place to reap the reward of this change it seem sensible to bring they into the process to ensure that this be do in the good possible way to support the industry many will also have concern about how this change will be police and the minister touch on that the recent netflix documentary the final attack on wembley again bring into sharp focus what happen during the euros in with public disorder shameful feature of the latter stage of the tournament so have the government have discussion with the police or local government to hear any concern they might have on these matter how do the government intend to respond in such circumstance should those body require any assistance they will be on the frontline of this change so their assessment of the situation be of course invaluable finally on point of process many be disappoint that an extension of licensing hour be not agree in time for the lionesses appearance in the woman world cup final last year indeed many business say that they miss out on increase trade due to the extension not be agree the process of agree temporary relaxation of licensing law be perhaps over bureaucratic and potentially not flexible enough to allow quick relaxation to be agree in time for sporting occasion the minister helpfully mention that last friday my hon friend the member for south shields mrs lewell buck steer her licensing hours extensions bill through third reading with government support her bill will dramatically improve the process for make temporary extension to licensing hour make it less cumbersome wish she every success as the bill now progress to the other place and hope the government will continue to support it to become law in the meantime the government football fan and the hospitality industry can all be assure of the opposition support for the order wish both england and scotland all the very good for the forthcoming tournament thank the shadow minister for his support be not sure that it be enthusiastic support it be intend to be certainly take that in the spirit in which it be intend who know perhaps this be the last time we will face each other over the dispatch box for while yes for while know that barnsley central be close to the top of our target list be ever the optimist the shadow minister ask one or two question about the consultation and the hospitality trade which be include in the consultation we have study it very carefully and it be in favour think much of that enthusiasm come from the hospitality industry itself which see this as an opportunity but of course hospitality venue need to ensure that they be responsible in the way they look after and serve football fan in their pub and bar the hon member mention the disorder around the euros final three year ago particularly around wembley and in central london of course we be talk about license premise rather than stadium so we be confident the police will be able to operationally manage the extension of license hour to am should the extension be activate on the actual event itself we be work very closely with the german police and have good policing plan in place to ensure we deal with any english fan who we think may cause problem there be also good policing plan in place for the champions league final which will take place at wembley in couple of week between dortmund and real madrid the policing of those tournament football game be be very carefully attend to be glad that we have unanimous consent believe on this topic it be nice moment of harmony on which to conclude the debate question put and agree to holocaust memorial bill

know what the government know which be that be there to be many vote it would squash the time between the remain stage and third reading that be why will not take time now we be use the time that be there however hope that during the debate government can put on the table first the specification lay out by the government and their agency in september say what they want the memorial to do and to be and the fact that they want the local authority to support it secondly hope that the government put on the table an up to date estimate of the capital cost of the memorial and the recurrent cost as the house will remember on second reading information be place in the library state that in the previous month the cost have go up from million to million in one year thank the hon gentleman emphasise

would require the government to carry out review of potential site for holocaust memorial or learning centre and lie report on its finding before decision be make in relation to the final site when someone ask if there be go to be general election soon think they must have read the carry over motion for the bill and that have mislead they into think we be about to have an election perhaps by the end of the debate we will know whether that be right or wrong in one of the explanation of the present proposal to put box with fin in the middle of victoria tower gardens design that be not accept for ottawa before it be submit for london we be tell that people would come out of the experience look at parliament at democracy in fact if it happen they will come out and look at the house of lords although the house of lords be an important part of our democracy it be not necessarily democracy itself it have the remain hereditary peer as well as people who be appoint the house of lords will have the opportunity to consider the bill if it reach their lordship house and believe it will pick up the point make in the select committee that consider the hybrid bill in more depth than this house will in the specification in september the government and their agency make plain they do not want most of the money spend on construction and building they want most of it spend on education in term of education about the holocaust we be in difficult time protest in london mean the exist holocaust memorial get cover up for protection and if the present proposal go ahead it will be quite often be close on security ground other hon member will speak to the security consideration that be hear in front of the select committee when the government put forward their proposal the indication be it would cost million from government and million raise from charitable source since then my guess be hope the minister will correct that million have already be spend without anything be achieve as the select committee set out the cost go way above the million plus contingency indicate year ago believe the government should recognise that they go off on the wrong route when they consider the site option propose by consultant that be put forward after the consultation start in september when the government respond to that early in they do not co locate the learn centre with the memorial as ministers and those advise they know in the consultation and specification in september there be no mention of have the memorial close to parliament at all page of the specification document show map of what the foundation regard as the acceptable area of central london it go from the west of regent park to spitalfields and down to the imperial war museum in the eight or nine year since then the imperial war museum have totally reorder and expand its holocaust galleries the jewish museum have close and the wiener collection be in some difficulty if the government be serious about get most of the money spend on education they would have already divert money to the wiener collection and the jewish museum and they would have charge up the holocaust memorial trust with money last year the trust have an income of and spending of which be apparently dedicate on the presumption of get the government proposal through if they be serious about education the government would not have wait to get some kind of memorial up and possibly some kind of learn centre associate with it before they start to get on with the educational work when the holocaust commission be set up its purpose be to get education go now its work be take over by the foundation and then pursue by government ministers we have use up eight year because the government have make mistake after mistake after mistake the most recent one be to believe that their bill to overcome the london county council improvements act be in some way not hybrid it clearly be hybrid the next mistake they make one they make both before and after be not to say there have never be comparison between the present proposal and the good alternative it take three year to discover that they have not do that if be wrong the minister can lay that on the table and hope that he will do so now it be the only time in modern time when the government have bring forward proposal without show why it be well than the alternative they commission consultant who come forward with scheme three of which would have be put to the government but in moment not of genius or necessarily of madness but of peculiarity those who be make the decision choose not to pay any attention at all may just clarify something that my hon friend have just say he state that million have already be spend on scheme that have not move forward in any way think that be the right figure but the minister will know be just back bencher and have be for quite some time but think that be the figure believe that it be between million and million that could have pay for prominent memorial and we could then have enhance the learning and educational facility the argument against use victoria tower gardens be clear it be an area of quiet recreation for people who live locally live nearby it be place where people who work round here can quietly enjoy the open space thank the father of the house for give way he be make an important point about how victoria tower gardens be local park do he agree that there be thousand of social housing tenant live or minute walk away who benefit from have the green space that victoria tower gardens offer and would be concerned if it be overtake by memorial and an education centre my hon friend be right she have the advantage of have lead westminster city council and will not need remind that the government originally say that they want their proposal to have the support of the local authority when they gain the impression that on merit the local authority be not likely to give its approval they take the proposal away from the local authority on number of occasion the king counsel lead for the government in front of the select committee say that what have be consider by the committee be not plan permission he constantly say that planning would be deal with in the normal way the normal way be for an application because the present one have be squash to go to the local authority the government can if they choose to do so call it in if they think that the local authority have get it wrong or it be of national importance they should not in this case have regard it as of national importance to stop the local authority have the option of consider the interest of local resident as my hon friend have remark between vauxhall bridge and victoria street or birdcage walk there be no other large green space open to the public the minister will know that he will have walk around victoria tower gardens as many time as have he may also have walk the extra yard to the imperial war museum where there be big park dedicate to peace why be the imperial war museum not allow to put forward detailed proposal and why do the government then turn round and say because it have not put forward such proposal it could not be consider we all know that massive pressure be put on the imperial war museum trustee and that their chair be make member of the foundation do not think that the government have approach this in the right way let put the government word on the record the united kingdom holocaust memorial be seek prominent location in central london with significant exist footfall so as to draw in and inspire the large possible number of visitor under the present proposal we will not be able just to walk in we will have to be clear by security and that at time of heighten security the memorial will either be close or there will be airport style security which be not the point of memorial to the victim and to the dedication that it should not happen again to return to the government word the site will support several feature and activity the number and extent of which will depend on the size of the space available site capable of accommodate sqm of build space for the ukhmf over no more than three contiguous floor will be consider that be not what be be propose but the proposal would in effect take over about third of the park regardless the government claim that it would be much small proportion but if we take all the associate part of the proposal it would be much more than the government say the final sentence of that section say in order to achieve the maximum benefit for the public the ukhmf need to allocate as much of its fund as possible to educational purpose rather than to land and construction and so the site must be highly cost effective the only cost effectiveness in this site be that the government believe that they can get it for free they have not factor in the additional cost of build box by river and by main road where people be try to enjoy the park some estimate suggest that the park will be basically out of action for up to five year if the government say you should believe that kind of estimate will tell they that for the past month it have not be possible to walk along the river walk in victoria tower gardens because ministers who be responsible for the state of repair of the buxton memorial fountain have allow contractor to barrier it off way beyond what be need to stop people go over the fountain itself we could have have fantastic beautiful move memorial roughly the same size as the buxton memorial or the memorial to the abolition of slavery or to the campaign for woman vote eight year ago if only the government have not persist with the crazy idea of an underground learn centre in totally unsuitable location my right hon friend be right and most people will agree with he even if their job be to stand up and say something different will not spend much time on the planning permission because it be not the subject of the bill when the inspector report be receive by the government and consider this be the conclusion under the signature of the planning casework unit this decision be make by the minister of state for housing in line with the publish handle arrangement for this case and sign on his behalf in particular those handle arrangement state that christopher pincher mp the housing and planning minister will be responsible for exercise the function of the secretary of state under section and of the town and country planning act and so on who here believe that minister of state would on merit turn down an application by their own secretary of state will give way to anybody who want to make that suggestion it be just incredible it would not happen will now change tone bit during the select committee hearing the government counsel suddenly switch from say who the lead designer and architect for the proposal be the government press notice announce the winner contain reference to sir david adjaye now order of merit four reference to ron arad and no reference to asa bruno proper tribute have be pay to asa bruno it be true that he be the one who put number of point to the inspector he be recognise as lead designer and his obituary which refresh my mind on just now show that he be startlingly good person however when the government announce the lead designer and architect for the proposal they name sir david adjaye who could hardly be mention by the promoter at the select committee for reason that will not go into now they be well known and in the public domain let we turn to the point that the government make to the select committee after raise that issue on january in debate on the business of the house col sir peter bottomley mp refer to the proceeding at the seventh public session of the holocaust memorial bill committee and suggest that counsel for the promoter may have inadvertently tell the committee thing that be contradict by the fact in relation to responsibility for the design of the memorial be then tell that what be say be right think that that lead counsel over and over again be try to write sir david adjaye out because of the embarrassment to government if it be asa bruno who be responsible for the ottawa proposal so be it but that be not what government say seven year ago in public be go to go on fight this but not so long this evening because my colleague have more to say say to those watch the proceeding look into the detail of what have happen commend to they early day motion table on may and table on may in particular the latter regret that the promoter that is the government have fail to understand the justify request for detailed comparison of the present unsatisfactory scheme with the alternative study by the government consultant far regret the continue lack of update costing for capital and recurrent cost disagree with the suggestion that plan permission and all other necessary consent be obtain in the usual way regret there be no know plan to spend more available resource on education rather than on construction far regret that know and grow security restriction be not be adequately address and believe the promoter be not meet its obligation to achieve an appropriate memorial at justify cost in suitable location associate with opportunity to learn and to understand the holocaust and to reduce the likelihood of repeat of the atrocity of the holocaust end with word from the holocaust survivor who give evidence at the committee who say in summary that the proposal be too big for the garden and too small for its purpose call wera hobhouse excuse madam chair but wish to speak only on third reading certainly be call the hon lady because she be the only member on the opposition back benches who have indicate she wish to speak but there be no need for she to contribute at this stage we will save her contribution for third reading and continue with the committee stage with the chair of the committee that have examine this bill john stevenson thank you dame eleanor wish to speak to amendment and new clause and take the opportunity to speak to some of the other amendment pay tribute to my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley for his contribution and his dogged determination and for cover many of the issue that be relevant to this discussion before make my other remark would also like to say that fully support the idea and concept of holocaust memorial and learn centre indeed vote for it on second reading recognise that this be an incredibly important project and one that be probably as important now as it ever have be in the past the idea of specific memorial be entirely appropriate but the concept and idea of learn centre be in many respect vital and in my view the most significant part of the project it be come up to year since the end of world war two and there be few people who have direct link with that time or indeed with what happen during the second world war therefore it be even more important we do not forget and that we ensure that we learn from what happen then and educate for the future please be in no doubt therefore of my support for an appropriate memorial and worthwhile learning centre something that be sure the whole house will support however have have the privilege and responsibility of be part of the holocaust memorial bill select committee have conclude that there be some serious issue that need to be properly address before this specific scheme potentially proceed if it do at all my advice to government would be to take step back and pause be this really the right scheme be it really the right location what about the appropriate cost involve we all want to see successful scheme we want to see it construct in timely fashion and arguably too long have already pass we want it to be build in the right location and at cost that be realistic and fair if may be so bold would suggest that such scheme could be build quite quickly at the imperial war museum and fulfil all the ambition and wish of the original committee and everybody in this house let turn to the bill and the various amendment four key issue arise but will touch first on planning on which be sure the minister will respond time have pass and circumstance have change what be the issue relate to air quality and flooding the change to the area in traffic management term and the prospect of thousand of visitor to such site be new planning application now require to go back to the proposal origin or should we just consider update the current version and if so what be the requirement for that the planning application touch on security but circumstance have fundamentally change will come back to that point in due course as it relate to my new clause secondly there be consultation which new clause touch on it be something that the select committee pick up on very early the original committee have instruct consultant to seek an appropriate site recommendation be make and site be locate and consider the holocaust commission itself come up with victoria tower gardens understand that it have be say allegedly at least that that be lightbulb moment what find extraordinary however be that no further consultation on that particular site be take have such consultation take place it may have reveal the issue relate to the london county council improvements act the reason for our deliberation today and because that issue be miss the amount of time spend on this whole project have be extend that consultation may or may not have show that that be the correct site but at least there would have be proper consultation people would have have the opportunity to consider the merit of the site and perhaps whether it be inappropriate and it could have be compare with other location it be very tell that the counsel for the promoter and the government all but acknowledge that consultation should have take place and that it would have be well if one have in my view that be serious error of judgment appreciate that the government will argue that there be consultation during the planning application but would dispute that it be the one that should have be carry out let turn to my two amendment amendment would address the overall cost the original amount set aside by the government to kick start an endowment fund be million as set out in by the then prime minister david cameron by the figure quote be still million but then the cost start to increase in they have rise to an estimate million of which the government would fund million and private donation the rest we now have cost estimate of around million but be we really suggest that when the digging start in victoria tower gardens the cost will remain anywhere near that suspect that they will escalate considerably to much high figure it do not end there in the then minister announce that entry to the site would be free the estimate annual running cost be at that time million per year in they have rise to somewhere between million and million and indeed they could go high of course we have still not consider the potential security cost which be in many respect complete unknown amendment would restrict the funding to the original amount which could be increase by substantial private donation might the minister advise the house on the estimate private donation to date and on what they be likely to be in future so that we have some indication of the private contribution that could be make to the overall project new clause be probably the most important of my two amendment security will become huge issue in the future we be already acutely aware of it give the circumstance of what be go on in gaza appreciate that some thought be give to security during the planning process and would be again but circumstance have completely change if the project go ahead and we build the memorial and learn centre in victoria tower gardens we do not want to see they be close most of the time because of security consideration do my hon friend agree that there be serious issue regard the security of victoria tower gardens if the memorial and education centre be build we have already see the current holocaust memorial that be base in hyde park cover up by the authority to protect it during recent pro palestine march that go through hyde park my hon friend be absolutely right security issue should be one of our key consideration as committee which be why think somewhere like the imperial war museum would be far well location will address the security issue in my speech but think it be all the wrong way round to make decision about where to place memorial to million murder people because some protester and activist might threaten it that be give in to bad behaviour security be one of the many consideration with regard to the site and think it be valid one to look at but what we want be somewhere that be actively attend somewhere that people go to on regular basis and be not hinder from do so because of security concern my new clause ask the government to get security review and bring it to parliament that review may well conclude that there be no issue and we should proceed or it may suggest to government that there be active concern and we should respond accordingly apologise if be take word out of my hon friend speech before he get to they but be it not lord carlile the government terrorism adviser who make the point about security very strongly my hon friend be exactly right he certainly do so at that time have table two amendment to this bill one be about cost and the other be about security overall the security issue must have priority and will certainly be look to push that amendment to vote but will just make some final comment on those amendment and indeed the whole project believe the amendment to the bill be sensible and appropriate and sadly feel that unless the government take step back and give serious thought to the propose project there can be only two ultimate outcome either at some point in the future someone will have lightbulb moment reassess the whole matter review where we be go with it and maybe draw back from the idea that be be put forward or we will press on and potentially create very expensive white elephant which will defeat the worthwhile aim of create the memorial and learn centre that believe we all want to see hope it be the former rather than the latter that prevail first thank the holocaust memorial bill select committee for its very hard work that committee be excellently chair by my hon friend the member for carlisle john stevenson and its report make for interesting reading it be clear that that cross party and impartial committee share many of the concern that and many of my constituent hold would go as far as to say that the committee finding mirror our own criticism of the government handling of the whole question of the merit of build holocaust memorial and learn centre in victoria tower gardens those be that no proper consultation or assessment take place of the merit of victoria tower gardens as propose location there be no grip on the cost to build it or to maintain it once complete specifically the cost to the public purse of the ongoing security that will be require and no thought have be give to security plan for protect the park its visitor or the child playground at time of heighten national security risk wish to speak to amendment and as well as new clause which stand in my name also wish to speak in favour of new clause and amendment table by my hon friend the member for carlisle and to which have add my name as we reach the committee stage of this hybrid bill on the proposal to build holocaust memorial and learn centre in victoria tower gardens small but much love park in my constituency of the cities of london and westminster wish to reiterate my long hold view that this be the right memorial but the wrong location say that as huge supporter of the jewish community not only in my constituency but across the nation have friend who would not be here if their family have not escape eastern europe during the and one of my close friend daniel astaire certainly would not be here because his grandmother be one of the final child on the kindertransport and she lose her entire family in what be now the czech republic have read last summer the outstanding book by lord finkelstein hitler stalin mum and recommend everybody read that brilliant book conclude that we really do need holocaust memorial in this country to remind ourselves of past event but also to pay homage to the many british jews still affect by the holocaust and who lose so many of their family this be not about be anti the brilliant idea of holocaust memorial but about its location only the select committee report conclude that no public consultation be undertake regard possible location for the memorial in fact victoria tower gardens come about as the idea of an unnamed individual we can not permit such precedent to stand that an individual and then committee can decide on location for such an important memorial without proper consultation new clause would require the secretary of state to carry out consultation on the potential merit of alternative site for the holocaust memorial absolutely believe and find it astonishing that no such consultation be carry out before victoria tower gardens be choose as the government prefer location when the holocaust memorial be first moot it be suggest as my hon friend the member for carlisle and the father of the house my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley have say that the imperial war museum less than mile from parliament would be an appropriate location have visit the imperial war museum include its outstanding holocaust gallery and exhibition numerous time and believe tourist school group and other would sincerely benefit from be able have visit the gallery to then spend time in garden of the imperial war museum which believe would make an appropriate location for the holocaust memorial remember the first time visit the holocaust gallery come out after what be very harrowing experience real human harrowing experience and feel want to sit down and reflect on what have see absolutely think that have the holocaust memorial in the imperial war museum garden would be appropriate because after visitor see the exhibit in the museum they need time to reflect and remember those who have be lose with such major proposal as the holocaust memorial and learn centre it be imperative that those who would be directly impact by the construction and then the continue existence of such an installation local resident local business organisation and relevant public body should have be and should still be properly consult we should also hear the voice of those who have be directly impact by the atrocity of the holocaust that take place across eastern europe during the and and the subsequent genocide across the world that we have witness since then indeed the select committee hear from holocaust survivor who express objection to victoria tower gardens as the choose location if we have consultation think we would confirm the public view on the merit of locate the memorial and learn centre at victoria tower gardens and allow for full debate on alternative location that may or may not prove to be more appropriate have mention the imperial war museum but it do not have to be there it could be anywhere across our capital or across the nation this be after all national memorial nevertheless if after consultation victoria tower gardens be choose be sure that the plan would receive more good will from local people be interested to note in the special report of the holocaust memorial bill select committee that many petitioner have voice their dismay at the lack of consultation it highlight their view that if proper consultation have take place about site and victoria tower gardens have come out on top it would have be consider more legitimate from my many conversation with constituent over the year since this memorial be first suggest as counsellor and now as an mp have find that what local people want be the confidence that this project be not be steamroller into be without due consideration and that full and proper consultation be undertake so much time have pass since the idea of holocaust memorial in victoria tower gardens be first moot that any proposal be more than likely to be out of date think have my first meeting about the proposal in as leader of westminster council and we be now eight year on the cost have clearly skyrocket with inflation and other pressure on construction the surround area have change and it continue to change dramatically for example the roundabout on the north side of lambeth bridge be undergo fundamental change which will have consequence for local traffic flow and management since the proposal be suggest we have see the development of residential area on that roundabout what be once office now house score of resident who would be immediately affect by have such an important memorial in their local park we have to take all sort of issue into consideration and there may also have be change to the water table after the past decade of our live with climate change obviously the security concern in this part of london have sadly increase in recent time which will speak about later after so much change in the past decade since the planning application for this installation be make consider that it be likely to be out of date if we be all honest new application should really be make to address the development that have occur since and to respond to many of the concern raise in the select committee report for all these reason believe complete review of the proposal be require combine with consultation on the location perhaps that be more important than ever before the special report from the select committee make it clear that local people be concerned about the environmental impact and have therefore table amendment which be design to reduce the damage to victoria tower gardens this park be special place for many people local resident of course frequent the garden as their neighbourhood green space but also many parliamentarian parliamentary staff journalist and other find much need solace in the park during lunchtime and after work have to tell the house that have be invite to victoria tower gardens this evening to do several interview which may not be do but it have always be favour place for the medium and journalist to undertake interview thank my hon friend for give way and for all her hard work campaign on this issue be on the select committee and what come to light as she know be that resident and significant number of petitioner from the jewish community include some holocaust survivor be against this location one of my big concern be that if this legislation be allow to go through it will set precedent by lift covenant on the garden that will mean they be no long there for people to enjoy for recreation it could have plan permission on it which could open up all sort of can of worm across the country do she agree my hon friend make an excellent point have read the select committee report it be clear to that there be genuine concern about the bill set precedent which will talk about slightly later the london county council improvements act be clear about protect public space in constituency such as mine in central london we do not benefit from huge amount of neighbourhood green space where family can just pop out on sunday morning after breakfast to give the child run around as have say thousand of social housing tenant live on page street regency street and in the peabody block just behind great peter street and they do not benefit from have their own garden and be desperate not to lose their local park have my hon friend have the opportunity to be in victoria tower gardens on saturday or sunday morning and see at the south end where there be developed play space large number of local mum with their toddler not always mum of course but often they be play in exactly the way we would hope in green space have see that it go back to the point that for many of we in this chamber this be workplace be obviously an exception because this be my constituency but for most member of parliament this be our workspace and then they go home but this be my home and know from local resident my neighbour that victoria tower gardens be much love and much use park it be not just workplace for people to do radio or tv interview it be also where people take their child and their dog for walk it be much use and much love and it would be an absolute tragedy if we be to lose an inch of it in my personal opinion but may be in the minority madam deputy chairman sorry mean dame eleanor this could be my last speech in this place so have to get that right let we not forget the array of statue situate in victoria tower gardens they carry special meaning and make it unique place and they include the buxton memorial fountain which celebrate and commemorate the emancipation of all slave in the british empire in it be in the centre of the garden and have the most amazing location for absolutely the right reason note that in the special report from the select committee mr richard buxton represent the buxton family and the thomas fowell buxton society highlight concern that the holocaust memorial and learn centre should not cause any degree of harm either actual or to the setting of any other memorial in victoria tower gardens thank the hon lady she for her amendment which be happy to support member of the buxton family live in my constituency so if the government be to agree to it that would go some way towards alleviate their concern do not realise the family connection with the hon gentleman constituency the buxton memorial be unique and should be protect we would not want any other memorial encroaching upon it it be also important to remember that half the entire park itself be gift to the nation from the newspaper retailer william henry smith the founder of whsmith who donate to preserve it as an open space on the condition that it would be place for recreation particularly for the child of westminster the government of the day agree to this day local schoolchildren and even young child continue to take advantage of this rare green space in central london the notion of charity may have be undermine by this proposal one may ask what it might mean for the future of other such bequest if other gift to be use as public space for the benefit of the environment and local people be similarly overridden amendment which stand in my name seek to limit the damage to the park to just the memorial should the proposal go ahead the bill in its current form do not provide for the location of the memorial and the learn centre to be on the same site and it be not stipulate as prerequisite in the prime minister holocaust commission report in remember that there be proposal for the learning and education centre to be in millbank tower as part of the redevelopment that do not see the light of day but it would have be good compromise we risk victoria tower gardens be completely overwhelmed as green space by this development spoil the setting of parliament the garden and the other memorial and in particular overshadow the buxton memorial it be my understanding that the learn centre will take up more space than the actual holocaust memorial and the bill do not state that the memorial and the learn centre be in the same place amendment would only lift the act restriction for memorial to be build not learn centre with the passing of the bill could it be that no park be protect from similar application in future that be real concern of the select committee my hon friend be make powerful point characteristically both passionate and knowledgeable on behalf of her constituent want to put on the record now one point about precedent give its importance she be right to highlight it so that it do not get lose in my remark when reply to this wide range committee debate this do not set precedent for the release of other designate open or leisure green space in london if it do would not be advocate for it any proposal need to be adjudge on its merit it do not create trojan horse it do not open pandora box say that from the dispatch box should anyone ever challenge it during planning inquiry planning committee or judicial review on an application for another parcel of green open space as designate either by the act or by other act the view of the minister and of the government be that it do not create precedent on which anyone could rely in law that be an important point to clarify and want to do so with your leave dame eleanor as clear and freestande point thank the minister for that clarification absolutely welcome that that be very powerful message to send to any future government or future minister who may be sit in his place he make very good point about any future planning application too my hon friend be be generous with her time it be not ha be not entirely sure what have amuse my hon friend the member for south norfolk mr bacon but there we be some people be easily amuse let just make this point that be not just bind statement on behalf of the action of subsequent government but for local authority the royal park and any speculative developer in the private sector do not carve it out as niche bespoke protection but as general blanket cover thank the minister once again for that very clear steer and clarification it may be too late for manuscript amendment to the bill to be accept by dame eleanor or madam deputy speaker if we get to the next stage but would it be possible for the minister to offer the house an assurance that when the bill get to another place assume it do the government will move an amendment to make plain what he say here thank my hon friend the father of the house for his intervention he make very clear point perhaps that could be take through in the lords on this whole question of precedent as anybody who have serve any period of time as local government councillor know it be the whole basis of our planning law and have be the case since the town and country planning act thank my hon friend for his intervention he may recall that the planning authority choose to not grant this application when it be first introduce but be then steamroller by the government via the planning inspectorate so do not think my constituent would be very happy with his comment amendment be design to ensure that any development of the holocaust memorial and learn centre do not exceed the current proposal of square metre in its current form the bill remove obstruction to any holocaust memorial and learn centre be build in victoria tower gardens rather than specific propose memorial and learn centre indeed one of the select committee concern be that without be attach to specific plan lift the obstruction would risk provide blank cheque for the memorial in victoria tower gardens to take radically different shape than have be anticipate there be genuine concern among local people that without the proper check and balance the memorial and learn centre may take up much more of the garden than be currently propose and it be unlikely that the current planning system be able to provide safeguard against that therefore consider the amendment be completely necessary to safeguard the garden from over development would welcome the minister view on the matter and assurance that if the bill be pass the propose square metre will not be increase finally amendment the final amendment table in my name be once again table to protect the future of victoria tower gardens from over development as mention early there be already treasure memorial in victoria tower gardens and we must do all we can to protect they the park be much love and much use public space and as have say thousand of social housing tenant live within to minute walk from it and greatly enjoy it it be local neighbourhood green space one of very few in my constituency be deeply concerned as be resident include the save victoria tower gardens group about the impact that the large scale construction of the memorial and learn centre will have amendment would ensure that work can not commence if other monument already in the garden be likely to face any harm whatsoever include harm to their setting or to that of the world heritage site that be the palace of westminster as say at the beginning of my speech also support the amendment table by my hon friend the member for carlisle amendment highlight real concern raise by the select committee in its report and share by and by many of my constituent about the lack of any proper scrutiny regard the overall cost of build the memorial and learn centre and equally important the ongoing cost of maintenance and security it seem that the true cost of this project and the ongoing maintenance and security cost have yet to be establish the government initial promise in to provide million of funding have prove to be completely inadequate be shocked to learn from ministerial statement that in the last month the cost have increase from million double the original figure to million and that the department for levelling up housing and communities have recently recommend provision for furth million in contingency cost which bring we to cost of million today what will it be tomorrow what will be next week what will it be next year understand that in the case of all project keep to budget be increasingly difficult but must ask whether we be really get value for money when we be spend hundred of million on memorial and learn centre rather than spend it on educate young people properly about the horror of the holocaust do my hon friend agree that that that cost be just one example of system that do not work effectively for the desire outcome virtually everyone in the country would want to see national holocaust memorial and national learn centre but this be be railroad through and that be not the way in which it should happen people need to feel that they be be take along rather than be impose on completely agree many of my constituent feel that this be be steamroller and impose on they without any consultation they have campaign so hard over the last eight year and pay tribute to they note with interest that the construction of the buxton memorial fountain cost little over in today money and have no idea why the cost of the current proposal run into hundred of million of pound give the increase pressure on public finance urge the government to take proper deep dive into the cost of this project and to consider whether it be still an appropriate use of public money new clause be also table by my hon friend the member for carlisle note the select committee recommendation in its special report for the review propose in the new clause to be undertake expeditiously before any planning application be progress believe it be imperative that review of the security arrangement of this proposal be undertake immediately that be not only financially prudent but necessary from national security perspective sadly we live in uncertain time and the dreadful event currently take place in the middle east be be feel on our own street perhaps nowhere more than on the street of westminster surround parliament let we remember that even if this memorial go ahead the playground and part of the park will continue to exist note that lord carlile the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation have express his own concern that the site propose for the memorial and learn centre present very real terrorism risk it would be unfortunate if due to increase security concern the authority insist that the area around the memorial and learn centre should be surround by railing and gate cut off wide part of the park from the public which would be contrary to the idea of victoria tower gardens as public green space that be accessible for all therefore support amendment call for full scale security review to be undertake before the proposal be permit to proceed to the next stage let we recall that the holocaust memorial locate in hyde park which mention early be cover up for its own safety during pro palestinian march only few week ago if the authority be so concerned about the safety of that holocaust memorial surely they would be equally if not more concerned about have major memorial adjacent to the houses of parliament absolutely agree that we need memorial to the holocaust but as the holocaust memorial bill select committee clearly conclude in its report and as reflect in the amendment table by its chair and by have read the report it be clear that there be more work to be undertake by the government on consultation the consideration of alternative location cost and security before the house can have confidence that this bill can be support it be pleasure to follow right hon and hon member who have make very important and serious speech that the house would do well to consider support this bill and the amendment table by my hon friend the member for carlisle john stevenson who make some excellent point about the cost of the memorial any project that the government support must make sensible use of taxpayer money so he be totally right to focus on the cost cap he be also right to call for review of security arrangement for all the reason that he say as former planning minister be extremely familiar with the labyrinthine process of consultation appeal and delay at various stage the difficulty of address the natural demand to protect an area that my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken speak about so eloquently and the importance of sit national memorial of this significance in the heart of london next to our parliament now that have be free from the duty of make such planning decision and someone else wear that mantle at least for now can simply say that the impetus for memorial at this time and in this place have never be great follow the october attack which be the large pogrom against jews since the holocaust be sure that no one be watch this debate because they will all be glue to twitter and look at what be happen at no but these issue will outlive we and our time in this place people may wonder why speak about the holocaust and they may say you be not jewish and you do not have large jewish community in redditch but even if there be only one jewish person in my constituency should speak up in support of the thing that matter most to they at this time yesterday the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities give an excellent first rate speech at jewish community centre in north london he speak about some thing that should shame we all he speak about the fact that it be now in an arrestable offence for people to be openly jewish near pro palestinian march on the street of london he remind we that there be only one group of people the jews who be tell that they be not tolerate in this country and he say that grow antisemitism be mark of society turn to darkness and in on itself it be parallel law that those country in which the jewish community have feel most safe be country where freedom and freedom of speech prosper and the memorial be vital part of bolster jewish people freedom of speech and their freedom to live in our country let we not forget that british jews who have live all their life in our country be the only group who be routinely hold up to blame for the action of foreign government we be all desperately concerned of course about the position of innocent palestinians catch up in the conflict and we all wish to see the humanitarian relief and lasting and safe peace in the middle east support and applaud the prime minister and the foreign secretary who be work tirelessly to achieve those goal but it should not be necessary to make those point and those caveat over and over again when speak about the position of british jews to do anything else except place the responsibility for this terrible conflict squarely where it belong on the shoulder of hamas who could even now put down their weapon release the hostage and stop the bloodshed and starvation of their own people would be simply play into the hand of murderous terrorist organisation that do not respect the right of israel to exist it be dedicate only to the elimination of all jews and the state of israel from the planet just as the nazis be dedicate to those same goal speak as practise christian in support of other people of faith and tradition speak about the vital importance of continue to stand up for the freedom of group of people to live their life in this country without fear of be persecute for the action of foreign government speak as someone who be appal and deeply concerned by the rise in holocaust denial order appreciate that the hon lady be deal with highly emotive subject and think that we would all agree with most or all of what she have just say but this be the committee stage of bill about particular structure in particular place it be not time for general speech about the geopolitical position of the world in general and would be grateful if she would confine her remark to talk about this bill which be short and to the point thank you madam chairman appreciate and value your guidance and will absolutely abide by it hope that the house will see that the reason make these remark about the general geopolitical situation be that wish to show my support for the importance of the memorial in this place at this time but will bring my remark to conclusion in line with your guidance wish to make it clear that believe that this holocaust memorial should be place in westminster next to our parliament that is of course the matter under consideration as outline by the select committee that be because this be where we debate foreign and domestic policy and of course it be right that we look at all the consideration that have be highlight by other member would like to ask the chair permission to make one final comment which be that the safety of the jewish community be the canary in the mine so let we build this last memorial with the education centre next to our parliament to focus on the existential threat to our jewish brother and sister rise to support the bill in its entirety and against the amendment which think will only delay through prevarication get the bill on to the statute book declare my interest as co chairman of the all party parliamentary group for the holocaust memorial and learn centre as well as an ambassador for yad vashem in jerusalem think there be universal agreement that there be need for holocaust memorial and that there should be learn centre as well it appear to that the debate today have centre around where this should be locate what condition should be impose and the funding for it which be the subject of the amendment we in this country be deeply involved in holocaust education it be requirement on our school to ensure that young people learn about the horror of the holocaust and where the ultimate destiny of antisemitism lead but the reality be that the survivor of the holocaust be get frailer by the day and the holocaust be fade into distant memory so it be vital that we capture those survivor testimony and ensure they have have the opportunity to speak to as many people as possible before they unfortunately pass on it be therefore vital that we have permanent national institution to preserve the collective memory of the holocaust we have to understand the history what go on and why the holocaust happen it be very difficult to contextualise the systematic murder of million people because they be jewish it be tough to impart that of course there be memorial and centre around the world include in washington paris cape town melbourne sydney hong kong new york boston berlin and of course jerusalem although we be not occupy by the nazis we be part and parcel of defeat they ten of thousand of jewish refugee come to this country to make it their home and of course our troop liberate bergen belsen and discover at first hand the horror of what have happen to the jewish population but that save countless life there be concern of course about britain role we should remember that child be almost orphan by the end of the war and their parent be deny entry to the united kingdom our role be not always to say how wonderful we be and some of the decision take at that time need to be explore why for example be the train track into auschwitz birkenau not bomb we have the ability to bomb they to prevent many people from be transport in the channel islands british police officer actually carry out german policy we have to recognise this and face up to it and the learn centre will give we that opportunity there be obviously concern about the site location take strong view that it need to be alongside the principal democratic institution of our time namely the houses of parliament it be clear that this will be nationally significant building and the monument will serve to remember those people who be murder during the second world war the history be that the then prime minister now the foreign secretary lord cameron have report from the holocaust commission that recommend the construction of striking and prominent new national memorial to be locate in central london the report recommend that the national memorial should be co locate with world class learning centre so the bill require co location there be cross party support lord pickles and ed balls who chair the commission commit the government to provide site in victoria tower gardens next door to the houses of parliament remind colleague that the conservative manifesto commit we to deliver the construction of the plan uk holocaust memorial planning permission for the memorial and learning centre be grant in but the high court rule in april that certain section of the london county council improvements act be an obstacle to construction and therefore quash the decision to grant planning consent this bill be specific in deal with the restriction to the siting of the memorial and learn centre importantly it do not grant planning permission which will still have to go through the normal process we have hear that some colleague be concerned about the appropriateness of victoria tower gardens the reality be that there will still be requirement for the garden to remain open to the public the bill disapplie only the relevant section of the act to ensure that it do not block the building of this memorial and learn centre in the garden would say that no place in britain be more suitable for memorial and learn centre than the garden next door to parliament the very institution where decision on britain response in the lead up to during and in the aftermath of the holocaust be make the point my hon friend be make now be not one put forward by the commission and it be not one put forward by the foundation would he agree thank the father of the house for that intervention it be clear that the site be choose by the commission it recommend this the reality be that the development of the planning application follow thereafter and obviously the impact on the garden have to be consider it be right that only parliament can change the law and it be right that parliament should consider whether the unique significance of the holocaust justifie seek an exception to the protection it put in place more than year ago the proposal for the memorial include sensitive landscaping that will improve victoria tower gardens for every user and more than of the area of the current garden will remain fully open after the memorial be build understand that my colleague be concerned about this but local resident and worker will be able to visit and enjoy the garden just as they do now the holocaust memorial bill lift restriction in relation only to victoria tower gardens no other piece of land and in relation only to holocaust memorial and learn centre and no other form of development the bill do not seek to override the planning process so all the argument about the use of the park can be properly consider against the benefit of the memorial landscape improvement to victoria tower gardens will ensure that this important and well use green space as have be mention by my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken be make more attractive and more accessible than ever before the new development will take about of the site all the mature london plane tree will be protect and additional planting and improve drainage of the grass area will increase the overall attractiveness of the garden alongside the riverside embankment wall new raise boardwalk will be construct help to make the seating more accessible and make it easy for everyone to enjoy view of the thames new pathway will link exist memorial and monument within the garden and additional seating will enhance the visitor experience the playground will be improve the objective be to ensure that all current us can continue after the memorial be construct all these matter be fully consider as part of the planning process during his consideration the planning inspector produce detailed report with careful assessment of the impact on tree traffic garden playground and all other relevant matter and then recommend that planning consent be give the construction phase of the uk holocaust memorial and learn centre be expect to last around three year the project team aim to make phased closure and reopening of different section of the park to ensure that as much of the park as possible be available for all user while the work carry on to produce this important memorial the learn centre will include powerful exhibition that will provide context for the memorial and encourage reflection on the relevance of the holocaust for britain today from visit really serious holocaust museum as have do in washington and berlin know that they be vast space this be story that take huge amount of time and space to explain the trouble be that the propose learning centre be really tiny space and it simply will not do justice to the horror of what we be talk about thank my right hon friend for that contribution be one of those who visit the original yad vashem in jerusalem before it be expand personally find the original yad vashem even more intimate and poignant than the current yad vashem understand what my right hon friend have to say but think this centre will be appropriate for what we be seek to achieve one aspect that have be discuss be security the learn centre will obviously have entry security arrangement similar to other public building in westminster know that the government look to the minister to comment on this when he contribute to the debate be work with security expert agency and the metropolitan police to develop the necessary level of security measure victoria tower gardens will continue to be freely accessible to all therefore the security threat should not be an argument against this memorial rather they be an argument for why the memorial be need in the first place as have say only of the land will be take up by the memorial at the very southern point of the park there will still be clear view of parliament from all other part of the park the buxton memorial have be mention with concern about overshadow do not want to be nit picking but the southern part of the park be child playground although some people say it will not be reduce in size other think it will be reduce in size by the figure be challenge by very many people but it be probably not the time to go into ground plan we can debate whether the figure be or but the key point be that more than of the park will be preserve the plan for the memorial be that it will be no high than the buxton memorial and its bronze fin will step down progressively to the east in visual deference to the buxton memorial the memorial be design by ron arad specifically for victoria tower gardens some suggestion have be make about the imperial war museum to my knowledge the imperial war museum support the memorial be situate in victoria tower gardens and have no wish for the memorial to be build in its ground detailed flood risk assessment be prepare as part of the planning application it conclude that victoria tower gardens be heavily protect by the river thames flood defence significantly reduce the risk of flood on site on the issue of antisemitism do not think anyone would claim this memorial will be the answer to solve more than year of antisemitism however it will be reminder to those in the houses of parliament of the potential to abuse democratic institution to murderous consequence in stark contrast to the true role of democracy in stand up and combat racism hatred and prejudice wherever it be find some hon member have suggest that certain member of the jewish community do not support the propose site as everyone know the jewish community be not homogeneous group and there will be multiple difference of opinion as within any community supporter of have the memorial on this site include the chief rabbi the president of the board of deputies of british jews the chair of the jewish leadership council and chief executive of the holocaust educational trust to name but few plus many holocaust survivor the fund assign to the project be for holocaust memorial the fund have not be divert from educational budget and there be no reason to think that abandon the memorial would mean fund be reassign to any other project the jewish museum be not consult before the joint letter from different member of the jewish community be write but the museum plan to reopen in central london location in the near future so its concern should be note the aim of the memorial and the jewish museum be complementary but not the same the memorial will set the holocaust within context that include the history of antisemitism include in britain and of subsequent genocide there have be multiple consultation with member of the jewish and survivor community at every stage of the planning inquiry individual and group have be able to give write and oral evidence the planning inspector take great care to allow all voice to be hear at the inquiry and he record all evidence in his very detailed report after take account of all view he recommend that planning consent should be grant some people say there be no rush the original proposal be make in we be now nine year on even if the bill make rapid progress and the development take place the memorial will take long to develop than the extent of the holocaust we owe it to the survivor to get on with the job as quickly as possible the survivor themselves be ask for that harry bibring speak to sky news back in but sadly pass away few day after the interview he say very much look forward to the completion of the new holocaust memorial in the victoria tower park next to the parliament which we go to have learn centre as well as just monument and do know whether live to see it but it in planning stage in westminster council and hope nothing go wrong manfred goldberg holocaust survivor say in may be when prime minister david cameron first promise we survivor national holocaust memorial in close proximity to the houses of parliament last month celebrate my birthday and pray to be able to attend the opening of this important project sir ben helfgott holocaust survivor and an olympic weightlifter who sadly pass away last year write in look forward to one day take my family to the new national memorial and learn centre tell the story of britain and the holocaust and one day hope that my child and grandchild will take their child and grandchild and that they will remember all those who come before they include my mother sara my sister luisa and my father moishe susan pollack holocaust survivor speak at parliamentary reception early this month be year old my dream be to see this memorial and learn centre finally build and to see the first coachload of school child arrive and ready to learn that be what it be all about and hopefully those student will learn what happen to and become beacon of hope in the fight against contemporary antisemitism end by express my hope that we can complete the committee stage of the bill get on to third reading and usher the bill rapidly through the house of lords so that those brave survivor of the holocaust will live to see the development of the memorial and the learn centre it be privilege to follow my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman give the news that have just break this may be the last time that speak in this chamber and the last time that anybody from the brigg and goole constituency speak give that we be be abolish and split four way if it be the last time that speak would like to say that it have be an absolutely huge privilege the privilege of my life to serve the people of brigg and goole and the isle of axholme it be also privilege to speak on subject such as this which be so close to my heart and something that feel so passionately about first let pay tribute to lord pickles and ed balls for the work that they have do on this memorial which be go to happen have absolute confidence that this memorial will be build be in the tent pavilion just couple of week ago when representative from the government and the opposition attend an event for yom hashoah both front bench team attend to confirm yet again in front of holocaust survivor and member of the community that this memorial will be build and that it will be build next to parliament be very grateful for that confirmation as be the member of the jewish community group and the survivor who be there also want to pay tribute to my hon friend the member for carlisle john stevenson do not necessarily agree with what he have to say but he do chair the hybrid bill committee as fellow chair of hybrid bill committee wish he every success because his bill actually make it back to this place on the bill which chair we spend year or more listen to petitioner as he have do but that turn out to be in vain we should not worry though because those three afternoon week that we lose be not without some value also want to apologise to my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken for speak on matter that be in her constituency suppose that it be the burden of represent this area would be very protective and my hackle would be well and truly up if have people interfere in my patch so although apologise for that be go to be hypocrite and now interfere in her constituency but may not be the first person in here to have engage in hypocrisy last night host an event here for terraforming civil society group from serbia refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests because recently visit that organisation in serbia we hold that event here in parliament to showcase the story of serbian jewry and what happen to they during second world war and the somewhat unique way in which serbia be divide up the process of the holocaust in serbia be very different depend on where in serbia the jewish community live but the result be of course the same the group be so proud to hold that event here in parliament the seat of the british government it mean so much to they to tell that story here that be why have the memorial next to this building intrinsically link to it emotionally and physically be so important as we tell the story of what happen to the jews of serbia be remind of the visit that make back in april on the anniversary of the deportation of the jews of novi sad in the part of serbia that be occupy by the hungarian fascist regime those jews be herd into synagogue on believe april hold there for two day without drink and food and then ship off largely to auschwitz and murder that synagogue still stand and we stand in it year to the day on which the jews of novi sad be round up and force into it again that remind of the value of have place to memorialise and remember what happen we be lucky in britain with the exception of the channel islands not to have have that experience ourselves so we do not have venue in which what happen during the holocaust take place that be why it be so important to have memorial close to the seat of government be probably the only person present who when have proper job which now may well have to return to teach the holocaust curriculum to our young people as history teacher such education be perhaps more important than ever as live memory of the holocaust fade people of my generation officially be but that may or may not be the truth have grandparent and family who be directly involve in world war two so the holocaust and the experience of world war two be live history for we for anybody who be below my generation that be not the case we have increasingly less living testimony which be why it be more important than ever that we create new resource and facility where that testimony can live on for those who be not connect in the same way that people of my generation be because of our grandparent or that the generation before be because of their parent as history teacher would have very much value have place in the nation capital to which we could have bring young people to not only tell they the story of the holocaust and its horror but then relate it to how this place and the decision that be take here play such an important role in ultimately demolish the machinery of murder that lead to the herding of human being on to cattle truck in the million their transportation to concentration camp and then ultimately their murder in gas chamber to have have place to bring my student next to this place which be so important in the story of how the nazi regime and the holocaust be end would have be so valuable despite the brilliant work of organisation such as the holocaust educational trust we sadly can not take all the young people in this country to europe to see the concentration camp that be not possible but the ability to bring young people to somewhere central in this country where we can tell they about not only the experience and the horror of the holocaust but the very proud role that our democratic institution play at that time be so important why be this now more important than ever before to answer that question it be important to remember how the holocaust start it do not start with auschwitz that be the end it do not start with gas chamber or with cattle truck it begin with the demonisation of people purely because of their racial and religious background its form be afraid to say be familiar in what we see today jewish student be ban from university campus and we see jewish student be question and be prevent from gain access to university campus across much of the west at the moment the holocaust begin with the demonisation of jews we see that now through the demonisation of the state of israel which be cover for the demonisation of jews it begin with boycott with people demand an end to purchase from jewish company and business shop window be smash and synagogue be attack synagogue in toronto be smash up this week for the second time it begin with attack on jewish community facility and we have see that across the west at this moment in time this week sit down with student from the union of jewish students who tell of the genuinely horrific experience jewish student be have on campus in this country at this time which have manifest in jews be afraid to wear anything that mark they out as jewish be proud to be reform jew and wear my kippah in synagogue but since october have deliberately wear it on public transit in this country to show my pride and my lack of fear of course be foot inch big overweight bloke so perhaps have more confidence in do that but have be proud to do that at time when very many people in the community be not be grateful to my hon friend for give way and glad to be hear what he be say both give testimony for himself and stand up for those who might be more frightened do he agree that those who want to see how the holocaust develop should go to the holocaust gallery at the imperial war museum where the display as my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken say be very impressive and very move they be indeed it be brilliant presentation be also very proud that every holocaust memorial day in my local community particularly in brigg the town council ensure that we have display at brigg heritage centre tell the story of the holocaust and how we get there that be really important however the reason have set out the comparison between what we have in the and and what we have today be that those parallel be genuinely frightening for jews in this country at this moment in time of course that precursor to the holocaust involve the marching of people through street in europe hold banner and sign single out jews for special treatment demand boycotts and othere the jewish community and that be exactly what we have see in these past few month that lead on to another argument that have be put in this debate about security make some reference to this when intervene little early but the idea that we should not build this memorial and learn centre next to parliament because of security concern be something have real problem with that be effectively say to those people who have seek since october and in many case well before then to demonise frighten and scare jewish people that they have win it be say that we be so cow as people as nation and as democracy by people who shout loudly and aggressively on the street that they get their way and we will put it somewhere else we will stick it over in lambeth do not think that be an appropriate or credible argument against put this facility next to parliament my hon friend the member for east east of course as someone from east yorkshire say east be always good my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman deal well with the security concern we bring young people here to learn about our democracy in the learn centre and they have to go through similar process so do not believe that should be an impediment we have hear about the loss of green space be not resident of the area so have no selfish interest in whether can walk my dog in the park as my hon friend the member for harrow east make clear the land take will be find it bit of strange argument to say do build this here because it take some green space away build it over there where it take somebody else green space away be not sure that buy that argument either we have hear argument about the jewish community some people have pray the jewish community in aid as be against the proposal but the jewish community be not homogenous so there will be very different view it be worth reiterate again that as my hon friend the member for harrow east very eloquently make clear jewish leadership in this country include the chief rabbi and those at the holocaust educational trust and the jewish leadership council whom we in government and parliament rely on and trust to be representative of their community have be clear that they support the memorial at that site again my hon friend steal some of my thunder by quote so eloquently well than could have do some of the holocaust survivor who so dearly want to see the memorial build fortunately some be still with we and hope they will see it build but other have pass it be clear that although there be not one homogenous view jewish leadership group and community leader absolutely support the memorial be build next to this place the father of the house my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley whom respect very much describe the proposal as box which do not think be an appropriate way of describe it and there have be other comment about the size of the venue do not believe that size should be an impediment to come away from the memorial have have truly move and educational experience as highlight by my hon friend the member for harrow east who be mention often have to be nice to he at last after year of we be here together yad vashem be an incredibly powerful place the part of it that find most move be the small memorial to the child and the room with the photograph which be so powerful and move do not believe that size should be an argument it seem strange to argue about cost and say at the same time but it not big enough maybe it need to be big but somewhere else which may result in it be much more expensive be conscious that the debate be time limited but want to make this contribution believe and hope that the memorial will be build at the moment we be see record rise in jew hate in antisemitism so it be more important than ever that the memorial and learn centre stand next to this place which be the thin blue line or red line or whichever colour we want to call member green line it be the thin green line and red line between mob rule and democracy over the past few month that line have be test in way it have not be test for quite some time that be why it be my deep belief that the location next to this place which be all that stand between we and despotism should be pursue as we see in europe in the and as we see even today in part of the world democratic institution be very fragile on that basis will be oppose the amendment this evening and look forward to the bill pass as member know everything must conclude by six minute past and want to give at least eight to minute for the front benchers to be able to contribute rather than impose time limit ask people to look at around the minute mark which will give everybody an opportunity of course sir peter get two minute right at the very end it be great pleasure to follow my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy if that be his last speech in this place and represent his constituency may say that he do it proud he do his constituency proud and he have do his constituency proud the house and his party be proud and his service to this house and his eloquence be know to all congratulate he on that will begin by address some of the point that have be make during the course of this debate and perhaps put to rest some of the suggestion that have be posit one be that this bill be in some way be steamroller which suggest can not be anything other than flight of fancy in fact this measure have take many year close to decade from its early formation it have not quite reach the dickensian jarndyce jarndyce level of bureaucracy and contemplation but do not think it be accurate to claim that it have in any way be steamroller also do not think it be in any way appropriate to say that security concern legitimate though they may be be good reason to countenance remove this important centre to another location we must stand up against the thug the violence and the vandal we in this house be thin green line and hopefully not that thin hopefully we represent the vast majority of people who defy those who would vandalise holocaust memorial and who hold in contempt those who would disgrace themselves and the freedom democracy and ancient history of this country by vandalise the memorial to the dead not only be that wickedness and blasphemy to those who have fall it be type of fascism that be disgrace to those who perform it and we must stand up against it we must say not go to refuse to build location of historic importance on particular site because some criminal may choose to graffiti it we defy you and we stand up against you we do not buckle to those security concern we need prominent memorial mark the holocaust because sadly recent event have show that we could see it happen again it be not fanciful to say that such thing could happen again there be voice in this house who have heckled member include myself when have speak out against antisemitism and there be voice outside who care about every nuance of other people right about microaggression but do not care about jewish woman and girl be brutally rap and savagely torture while hostage in the pogrom of october we have see refusal by respected authority around the world to accept that hamas be terrorist organisation and that what they do on october be unparalleled since the actual holocaust of to in defy that truth they show the world that it be not impossible that such an atrocity or something like it could occur again that be why we need memorial to those who ask why do it have to be here say that it have to be here because this be the seat of our democracy this be where our democracy fulcrum rest this be the burn location of that democracy where the fire of passionate argument have burn almost since time immemorial and victoria tower gardens be part of this historic site of course one must be conscious of local resident but one must also remember that this be to be national memorial it be of national importance protester come here every week in relation to myriad topic because they know that this be where the action be this be where democracy lie this be where people meet to make decision about the future for that same reason the memorial should be in location that be centre where people will not forget it as the great figure of the recent past nelson rolihlahla mandela mohandas gandhi and other tower figure of post war history have make clear it be not those who sow division and fan the flame of conflict who bring light and hope to the world those who use their oratory to promote division and hatred on the street or elsewhere be here today and go tomorrow they do not matter they be like wasp at picnic whose buzz spread momentary fear and perhaps whose sting be sharp but short live wasp produce an alarming noise but their presence be fleeting and their sting be temporary we must not let those people deafen we to the reality the cold hard reality of why such memorial in this location be necessary feel the need to cover up memorial or wish to cover it up be not good reason to place it elsewhere the spreading of hate the poison of sectarian hatred the language of conflict and the vitriol of division may easily arouse the weak minded the ignorant and the mob they always have do and always will do there be the twitter warrior the anonymous the fascist apologist but the force of light have always be strong than the force of darkness the chief rabbi the president of the board of deputies of british jews and the holocaust educational trust whose very job it be to educate the young generation about the holocaust all support this project that think be tell rise forgive the jewish people in this country be very small minority there be many constituency where there will be no jews at all literally none and many other where there will perhaps be only dozen or two jews represent only of the population of this country at around people in population of million in world of billion people there be only million jews small but strong jews love life and they seek peace they be not an homogenous group they do not all speak as one one need only look at israeli democratic politic for five minute to see the division within israeli society they be not all go to agree about everything just as all black people do not or all redheade people they be not an homogenous group but they love this country they be respectful to it and grateful for it and many seek to serve it as have try to do and hope that long continue say to those jewish people who may be listen look not to the noisy wasp to which have allude but instead to prime minister whose moral stance have be clear the prime minister be great hero to the british jewish community and not because there be many vote in it there be not for the reason have just give but because it be morally the right thing to do the same be true of our royal family for example the prince of wales recently visit synagogue and speak with an elderly holocaust survivor which be testament to the support of the monarchy and dare say would have make the late queen proud we need this memorial jews be not cower with trembling knee although maybe that happen in previous generation they stand in the face of adversity know that in this country there be many more of the christian faith the hindu faith the sikh faith the buddhist faith and the muslim faith who will stand with we and protect we and who will stop those who seek to harm and intimidate the jewish community we need memorial to remind people of that it need to be in this location because of its paramount and historic importance and to remind people why indeed the state of israel have to exist to those who have an unnatural and unforgiving animus towards the jews and who disguise it as hatred towards israel and in other way say that they be just twig crack in an empty forest or bird chirp on desert island because their voice will be weak and ineffectual if those of we in this house speak as one those tiny voice and crack noise in the wilderness will be drown out in crowd of million this memorial be need and must continue rise to speak in support of this bill and against the amendment however nobly argue and well intentione they be share the view of my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis and my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman that this have be long time in the making and further prevarication will simply mean that the objective of establish memorial get push out far and far which be not good reflection on this government determination to see it come about speak as commissioner of the commonwealth war graves commission and be very pleased that we have the opportunity to have debate in government time during war graves week last week as be make clear by member right across the house through every contribution the commission do magnificent job of maintain memorial to the fall in many country around the world many of those be very substantial structure that be build in the immediate aftermath of the first world war primarily with some follow the second world war think be right in say that the time it take to construct each of those memorial be less than the time it have take we to get this memorial legislation through the house that be shocking frankly and we need to put it right have visit many of the commonwealth war grave memorial and like other member have also visit some of the holocaust memorial notably in berlin so be aware of the pressure of visitor number for people who live in major city where the holocaust be commemorate or where there be memorial to the fallen those place become significant tourist attraction for visitor who wish to pay their respect and to recognise the suffering and the sacrifice that have be make therefore understand the pressure that this proposal will place at the heart of our city adjacent to parliament but it be right that any memorial should be in prominent location that be easy to access and at the heart of the nation so that it can have the kind of impact we wish to see if you will allow mr evans will stray just little off the immediate point of the amendment to read briefly from an article that write nine and half year ago in january in the week after the then prime minister david cameron with cross party support accept the recommendation of the holocaust commission to build national memorial with world class learning centre and an endowment fund to secure holocaust education forever what write then remain valid today and it be the reason be take this stance each year many member of this house across all party sign the holocaust educational trust book of commitment to mark international holocaust memorial day the book honour those who die during the holocaust as well as those extraordinary survivor of whom there be very few left today who have devote their life since their experience through the holocaust to educate young generation about what they endure this year holocaust memorial day take place on the anniversary of the liberation of auschwitz birkenau in that article write as the deadly concentration camp under the third reich the name auschwitz be synonymous with the holocaust one in six jews who die be kill at the camp approximately one million people but even for those who survive the scar of their incarceration both physical and mental would remain for the rest of their life few who do survive be still with we but their story be as important now as ever few year ago visit auschwitz with student from bridgnorth and it be an experience that will remain with for the rest of my life the site be haunt remnant of regime attempt to wipe an entire people from the face of the earth the sheer number of those who lose their life in concentration camp across europe be almost incomprehensible but the large pile of personal effect like spectacle or shoe take from those walk to their death really bring home to just how many be kill the collection of child toy be particularly heartrende that man be capable of such inhumanity base on an adherence to doctrine of hate be chilling thought but to shy away from retell one of the dark period of human history would be an injustice to those who lose their life instead it be essential we continue to educate the next generation so they be aware of what happen under the nazi regime and develop more tolerant society free from racism prejudice and bigotry the need for such memorial in the uk be no less now as we see increase report of antisemitism for reason that we can all understand rise be afraid will not give way because have already extend the patience of the chairman will conclude by say that we have to stop prevaricate and get on with construction support the bill and will not support the amendment to it know that everybody be glue to their mobile phone about the announcement of the general election but this debate be important because we be commemorate the great crime in history think my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis speak movingly about antisemitism and start my speech by say that agree with every single thing he say he say it so well it be brilliant speech this bill be tremendously important but want to speak in support of my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken and her amendment time be short so can not expand on the crime of the holocaust but want to talk about the detail of what we be debate amendment table by my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster sum up what have long be campaign for declare an interest as worker here for year live about mile away as we all do we all live locally and work here so we all take an interest have be argue as say in an intervention on my hon friend the father of the house that we could have sort this out eight year ago by have fantastic memorial in the garden of similar size to the slavery memorial also an incredibly important issue have never be in favour of the underground learn centre because this be such vital issue and we have duty to the jewish community the local community and everyone else we must proceed by consensus we should not cause division on this make one last plea to the government to proceed by consensus as my hon friend the father of the house and my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster be try to do the jewish community be not homogeneous but it be concern in letter to the times sign by eight jewish peer they express deep reservation about the project as it be currently propose and they know what they be talk about know that lord cameron as prime minister be work with the good of intention and understand the whole argument about the proximity to the palace and recognise the importance of what we be talk about but the decision be make without any proper consultation or investigation any further consideration show numerous flaw in this particular site we need to get into the detail the design call for significant underground portion even though it be locate next to river in june local property flood from underneath after heavy downpour it be build on thorney island the original settlement of london surround by ancient marshland in which the water table can rise alarmingly after sudden rainfall victoria tower gardens be maintain by the royal parks which have never support the memorial in that location its chairman lord grossman himself jewish say that there be concern about the potential risk of such building on the intrinsic quality of well use public park in an area of the city with limited number of open space this be such build up area and such well love park specifically make for the people of london as tiny oasis of green there be fear which the minister try to deal with that this could be use as precedent the park be protect specifically by an act of parliament in and those statutory protection be be undermine this small garden one of the small park in london in one of the most build up area can only really accommodate small memorial without damage its characteristic do not think that anyone have make the point so far that the design introduce an metre ramp wide moat would split the park and much of the exist broad swathe of grass will be replace by pave we want as many people as possible especially schoolchildren and young people to visit the national holocaust memorial exist pressure on millbank will only be compound by traffic seek to access it there be no plan to deal with the expect coach traffic and halting be sorry to go into such detail but it be central to what we be talk about no parking space or drop off zone be propose the local area thorney island society have object many other people have make fantastic argument which have be dismiss not deal with and not answer for most local resident this useful park and open space would cease to function as such many ordinary us of this neighbourhood park especially those relate to dog would be inappropriate if holocaust memorial be the focal point the restoration and renewal of the palace of westminster be on the board with you mr chairman be an ongoing project that we be still debate victoria tower gardens could play an essential role in work relate to the palace undoubtedly some part of the park will have to be take for that we need more flexibility the cost have rise exponentially take up large space for the holocaust memorial will limit the range of action for renovate the palace we be now talk on the restoration and renewal programme board about have new visitor entrance from the park again that be not be consider the most impactful holocaust memorial in the world such as those in washington berlin and israel all of which be visit be enormous they take up space far big than this chamber on many level as my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy make clear we have to tell the story bit by bit you move from room to room and you understand how hate build up we need to have proper museum proper holocaust memorial similar to those in berlin and washington where the whole story can be tell do not think that this small underground learn centre will in any way address that point will end on this point because know that time be very precious in his closing remark my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley the father of the house really sum it up this proposal be too big for this small park but it be too small for the gravity of the issue we be address order as say the conclusion of the debate be at six minute past seven there be clearly bit more time so perhaps time to take intervention and so on it be pleasure to speak in this debate on behalf of the snp it be perhaps slightly unexpected for some that be stand here but anyone who be aware of the area of interest that pursue here will be less surprised will go through some of the amendment and new clause and share some thing that think be worth pull out the comment make so far have be profoundly helpful in tease out some of the detail the hon member for worthe west sir peter bottomley speak very well about the importance of education that be the key point of amendment and something have speak about often in this place the necessity of focus on education and make sure that the testimony of survivor be capture in way that will ensure it be available to generation who come after we through initiative like vision schools scotland or work with organisation like the anne frank trust or the holocaust educational trust we can see the impact of education the necessity of marry up education with the memorial be profoundly helpful idea we will not be able to take the lesson of the past which we talk about so easily if we do not make concrete effort to make it reality when we say that we never want to see it again amendment table by the hon member for carlisle john stevenson make reasonable point which be that it would be sensible to be sure that the cost be properly account for and that there be an appropriate level of control that be key point this be rightly an ambitious project so his amendment be an interesting one his point about potential private donation be interesting in ensure the ability for the project to move forward in an appropriately ambitious way be sure the minister will share further information on all of that on amendment and the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken speak very powerfully about her local community as well as the jewish community how all those thing come together be very important she speak very passionately and sincerely about her desire for consultation understand why she be so concerned about that my own personal concern which weigh on slightly be that that would also mean more time would elapse her amendment make sense she be look to add some clarity to the specific such as where restriction relate to the land might be remove the minister be helpful in try to clarify that and what the overall footprint would be that will be allocate and it do matter regardless of where it be go to happen understand the need for clarity and reassurance for resident and other user of for instance victoria tower gardens and understand why the hon lady want that level of confidence to be provide for the people who live in this community imagine that give the kind of memorial that be locate in that particular park people in general would want to take comfort from the fact that they could be protect in an appropriate way surely though it be possible for we to have memorial and an education centre and to protect those exist memorial the hon member for worthing west speak early about the state of repair of the buxton memorial fountain perhaps there need to be big conversation about these issue as be clear from the bill extent commencement and short title it be an england and wales bill which be why some people might not have expect to see rise to speak it concern planning matter that relate to different country from my perspective so will not comment on the detail of for instance the planning and location issue raise by the hon member for carlisle what will say be that be here today only because think it profoundly important for we to see concrete proposal that can be implement as soon as possible to deliver holocaust memorial and learn centre we can not lose sight of that and it should not be lose among the admittedly also important detail the territorial extent provision in clause speak for itself so will not go there the hon member for carlisle talk about security none of we need to look too far to appreciate the need for we to think seriously about the security provision that will be necessary the world be increasingly polarise and we need to ensure that everyone be secure and that will be particularly important in this instance be not sure whether new clause be flexible enough to allow for the necessary measure which will surely change as time change to be amend without undue delay but no doubt the hon member think about that when he table the new clause be sure that other member share my concern about the spike in hate crime include the frightening spike in antisemitism incident we know that regrettably these spike have happen in the past as well and any security arrangement will have to be able to cope with changeable time as for new clause table by the hon member for cities of london and westminster we have be down this road many time and wonder whether the measure that she have propose will cause further delay some people may say that it would not be appropriate to rush in and of course that be true but do not think anyone could reasonably accuse this project of have be deal with in rush let say as scottish mp who have no jurisdiction in this geographical area that this be really important matter so by all mean let there be further consideration but can we just get on with it call the shadow minister before begin my brief remark about the amendment let restate the opposition support for the construction of national holocaust memorial and learn centre in victoria tower gardens give that this simple three clause bill do nothing more than remove pre exist legislative impediment to the siting of such memorial and centre in that location and make provision for and in connection with expenditure relate to its establishment we have not feel the need to table any amendment to it today we sincerely hope not least in view of the amount of time that have now pass since the idea be first propose in that the bill complete its remain stage and receive royal assent as speedily as possible so that the necessary planning application can be consider turn now to the amendment start with new clause which stand in the name of the hon member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken we fully appreciate that although we be unite as house in our commitment to establish national holocaust memorial and world class learning centre there be differ and sincerely hold view about the appropriateness of victoria tower gardens as the location for they in some case the objection extend only to the siting of the learn centre in that location in other it extend to both the centre and the memorial itself let be clear we believe that there be valid criticism to be make about the adequacy of historical consultation the holocaust memorial bill select committee be right to highlight that full consultation at the site selection stage would have not only leant more legitimacy to the final site decision but identify the constraint that clause seek to remove much early thereby potentially avoid much of the delay that have occur as result of its late identification point well make by the hon member for carlisle john stevenson that say we do not believe it would be appropriate to amend the bill which as the house know do not mandate the use of any particular location with view to use it as means of reconsider the location determine by the uk holocaust memorial foundation and confirm by the government in hon member from across the house may disagree with the decision but victoria tower gardens be identify as the preferred location eight year ago that decision have be the subject of considerable scrutiny through the planning process and in our view any attempt to reopen it risk significant further delay to the construction of the memorial that would be unacceptable the bill itself will obviously not authorise the construction of the memorial and learn centre in victoria tower gardens such authorisation must come via the planning process it be through the submission of new planning application to westminster city council it be my understanding that it must be new permission give the various policy change that have happen in the five year since the initial application be submit that the appropriateness of the prefer site for the scheme will be test again and the argument for and against any development revisit in the event that the new application be to be call in by the secretary of state for decision the planning inspectorate would have to undertake another public inquiry to consider all representation of support or opposition as well as the relevant local plan government policy and guidance and any other matter that it judge to be material to the case in order to make recommendation we do not believe that this bill should be use to reopen the final site decision and hinder the ability of the promoter to submit new planning application to westminster city council for consideration which would be the effect of new clause for that reason we would not support it if it be press to vote the scrutiny provide for by the planning process will likewise apply to the precise plan that will be submit to the local authority and to any specific condition that might be require include those touch on by amendment and namely the footprint of the memorial and learn centre and their impact on other memorial in the garden we therefore do not believe that either amendment be necessary the planning process will necessarily have to consider security arrangement the holocaust memorial bill select committee report be right to raise site security as concern and there be no question but that security measure need to be re examine in the light of how the threat picture have change since the previous planning application be consider five year ago however we do not believe that new clause which stand in the name of the hon member for carlisle be either appropriate or necessary first we have concern about the implication of put detail of sensitive security measure relate to the site in the public domain and specify they in regulation as new clause propose concern echo by the planning inspectorate in its april report secondly we fear that the effect of new clause would be to duplicate process that have be and will be undertake by the local authority or by the planning inspectorate in the event that the application be to be call in for these reason we will not be able to support new clause if it be press to division there be two side to this issue one of which people will accept that the hon gentleman be speak about sensibly we do not make all detail about security available to the public the second be whether the necessary security arrangement will inhibit the use of the park by local resident child and other the government continually give an assurance that that will not be interrupt but everybody believe that it will be that be why it be important to debate and if necessary vote on new clause hope the hon gentleman will agree with we that the impact on the use of the park be the thing that matter for the purpose of this bill thank the father of the house for his intervention certainly agree that that be one of many consideration that need to be take into account when determine the application but many of the contribution to this debate have raise matter that engage planning consideration and this bill do not engage planning consideration even though it will affect the ability to submit planning application in future however those be matter that should be rightly deal with by the local authority and by the planning inspectorate if the application be to be call in by the secretary of state turn lastly to those amendment that concern expenditure relate to the memorial and centre as authorise by clause of the bill the select committee be right to highlight that the true cost of the project have not be establish and to emphasise the need to consider the appropriate use of public money when progress it concern about expenditure have also be highlight by the national audit office which have make it clear that there be risk that the contingency be not enough to cover further cost increase perhaps most worryingly the government own infrastructure and projects authority have red rat this project in other word the government themselves be clear that quote here from the definition associate with red rating as thing stand successful delivery of the project appear to be unachievable and that it may to quote far from that definition need re scope its overall viability reassess while the opposition would not support the imposition of expenditure cap as propose by amendment it be clear to we that the government need to do more to ensure that the project will deliver value for money and to provide appropriate assurance in that regard in respect of both capital and recurrent cost as such would welcome robust assurance from the minister when he respond that the government have accurately estimate the cost of the project will apply proper cost control throughout the construction period and will ensure that run cost be sustainable today in this chamber we have be unite on the welcome return of my hon friend the member for south thanet craig mackinlay and the house have be unite on security measure on pub licensing for the euros probably not the most contentious piece of legislation before the house and now on this holocaust memorial bill for all the debate that we have have on the bill be grateful to all right hon and hon friend and member who have contribute to it we have be discuss how we have be discuss where and we have be discuss when but the house have never be discuss why for reason more than tellingly amplify by my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis my hon friend the member for harrow east bob blackman and other the why be clear and demonstrable that be sad fact but it be be grateful to the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook who speak for the opposition for his support as be to the hon member for east renfrewshire kirsten oswald shall reserve my general thank for the third reading debate let turn to the amendment urge my right hon and hon friend and opposition members to reject any of the amendment that might be push to vote for reason the hon member for greenwich and woolwich ventilate extremely well let set out why think that be the case might just pause here if may to remark that think be not necessarily an expert on these matter that this be probably the last substantive piece of innovative business that this parliament this parliament of the realm will be discuss it be an honour for to be take part in it on behalf of his majesty government because it allow to pay fulsome and personal tribute to three right hon and hon friend on my side who will not be seek re election to this place my right hon friend the member for ludlow philip dunne who do not know before come here in have be stalwart friend and colleague and he will be hugely miss across the house more than he will probably know because he be too modest to even consider that assessment likewise do not know my hon friend the member for brigg and goole but his wit his humour and his ability to cheer up any situation have warm many moment again he will be miss save for last but by no mean least my hon and darle friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken we have know each other since we be or and it be the joy of my life to see her join we here at the election she speak today in possibly her last contribution on the floor of the house in the same way that she have speak from her maiden speech onwards with knowledge passion clarity and certainty on behalf of all her constituent my three retire colleague have serve their community well they have run the race to the finish and hope that they enjoy the next chapter of their life to the full whatever it offer they education be key to this proposal to make sure that subsequent generation do not repeat the past as so many member particularly my hon friend the member for brigg and goole have note that be why the symbolic juxtaposition of the memorial and learn centre and this place be so important there be an emotional and romantic intertwining of parliament freedom and democracy and how dim those light be during the period of the holocaust many have rightly mention security which be key issue suggest to my hon friend the member for carlisle john stevenson that the hon member for greenwich and woolwich be right to say that it would not be sensible or prudent to put into the public domain either the security assessment or indeed the remedy for what it throw up it be slightly analogous to have burglar alarm instal in one home and post the deactivation code on social medium so will resist that amendment my hon friend the member for carlisle and other have speak to key issue the security and peace of mind of those who work in the centre of those who visit the centre of those who merely walk past and crucially as my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster and my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh reference of those who just use the park as park be paramount the overriding point be that the argument that we can not have the memorial and learn centre in victoria tower gardens because of security fundamentally undermine key tenet that support the proposition give the issue surround both the holocaust and the fairly fluid and dynamic situation in the middle east security will always be an issue for such an institution security would be an issue be it to be locate at the imperial war museum in the middle of hyde park or on the third floor of harrods security will always be an issue but entirely take the point which echo from the dispatch box if security concern fear of the mob and fear of those who seek to disrupt and intimidate suddenly become the trump card that be use to determine where and how we locate such facility the mob will have win and we might as well all pack up and go home now raise the white flag that be why think all of we in this house and particularly the two front benches although we be absolutely concerned about security be not prepared to bend the knee to bully thug and anti democratic mob rule doubt the minister intend to be the first to accuse of wave white flag on anything put it to he that the government say that the use of the park would not be interfere with by the proposal be there to be just memorial there that might be true but the proposal be for memorial and learn centre that will try to bring in half million people year when we know now there be great threat we have have the parliamentary bookshop barricade and as say the memorial in hyde park cover over can government say that with the present plan the use of the park will not be interfere with where be their assessment who know about it and be it true let say to my hon friend that there be no reason for use of the park to be disrupt be afraid that he slightly undermine his argument because he refer to the memorial at hyde park have to be secure we have have in the past to secure the statue of sir winston churchill and to safeguard the security of the cenotaph there be no learning centre attach to they they stand merely as memorial my hon friend say that he think the memorial would not come under attack for want of well phrase or require security measure and that the risk be only because the learning centre be attach to it do not agree do not have crystal ball but the whole security strategy will be try and test for every single scenario in the same way as it be in any plan for something with public use of course it will be and that be right it would respond to any scenario throw up would love to be able to give guarantee that unfettered access will be give to the park day year but if in the middle of some heavy protest or something it be the advice of the police that it be close in the same way as they might close road shop or facility suggest that it would be folly to ignore that advice where we be sit be an armed fortress we can not go anywhere without see policeman with sub machine gun this park have always be completely open there be absolutely no security every gate be completely open there be no security guard and no warden on behalf of the local community ask the government to assure the public that this park will remain completely open as it always have do and that they will be able to wander in and out of this green space my right hon friend raise valid point that be absolutely at the kernel of the plan on which this vision rest it be of course planning matter and be not the minister responsible for the planning process it be planning matter to be look at think have say all can say on that would like to correct one or two thing there be review of alternative site and the comparison be publish the imperial war museum be include in that analysis process the square footage of the development represent just of the overall surface area of the park the park be square metre while the development be square metre which include the memorial issue relate to air quality traffic management change in policy and water table among other be in the purview of the minister for housing planning and building safety my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley it be worthwhile quote if may an extract from the inspector report as we know from case in our own constituency the inspectorate be independent of government the inspector say that the development of the ukhmlc proposal since the publication of the hmc report have be very thorough this have involve site selection public architectural competition and after initial selection very detailed preparation of the proposal and their presentation with formal public consideration by westminster city council and ultimately the more detailed evidence present before the inquiry concur with my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis that to describe the process as flimsy or say that government and other seek to railroad proposal through within five or minute of the idea be in somebody mind stretch the definition on that point will the minister give way will my hon friend allow to make this important point know the seriousness with which he take the buxton memorial do not want to stray too far into the planning issue but he will know that the buxton memorial be list as result of be list structure it be material planning consideration when any new proposal to set something alongside it be take into consideration the design and the layout be entirely set out to ensure that the memorial be subservient to the buxton memorial give both its heritage and list status do not dispute what the minister have just say but previously he quote the planning inspector the inspector do not see the comparison between the top three site recommend by the consultant or the light bulb moment when someone involve write to member of the government say have you think about victoria tower gardens for the memorial not for the learn centre as well the inspector do not see that have not see it and the minister have not see it it do not happen the planning inspector do the work that statute place upon they to allow they to make clear recommendation back to government on how this application should be determine the inspector see all documentation that be germane to that appeal process and of course could have call for additional documentation if they so wish say gently and respectfully to my hon friend the father of the house that appreciate he do not like the outcome of the process and that he never will but try to cast whole variety of assertion about how we arrive at the outcome use question about procedure and process be not particularly helpful on an issue that clearly command the support of the majority of the house my advice to the house would be to tilt at windmill where they exist of course but where they do not exist do not seek to create they reiterate what say in response to the invention by my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster set aside the relevant section of the act be necessary to bring forward in land use and planning term the proposal that will eventually be before we it do not let say that again it do not establish precedent for any public body or government department nor do it create precedent that can be rely upon in law at judicial review or elsewhere for private sector developer or joint venture partner with the public sector to base their argument on the proposal they will not be able to say ah well this portion of victoria tower gardens be allow for this purpose therefore the government have open up pandora box to mix my analogy this do not create trojan horse either it be not trojan horse bear pandora box any application would need to be judge on its merit want to make that abundantly clear because know that it be an important point for my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster many question have be raise around cost which be not necessarily an issue for this bill per se will not test the patience of the house by say that the public sector be try and test and reliable with its letter of contract and contract manager but everything seem to overrun say politely to the house that of course cost have go up over the past nine year since this idea be first moot and of course cost will go up still far the long that we delay may make two philosophical point sir roger first whoever be monitor the delivery and the budget management on this will with due and proper cognisance to the public finance be as resolute as they can be to ensure that proper contractual obligation be follow and that budget be meet and not exceed one would expect to see contingency on something such as this and indeed those cost will ebb and flow as the cost of material rise and fall and the cost of labour change and the like do the minister not share my concern about cost it be million in it be now estimate at million he have already say that the cost be likely to go up even far be we really write blank cheque for this scheme my hon friend be right and will thank he properly on third reading but may just put on record at committee stage my thank to he for the work that he do chair the select committee that look into all of this it do thorough piece of work and be hugely grateful to he and to colleague who give up so much of their time yes cost have go up say this as somebody who have spend some considerable time look at development cost in the private sector sometimes we can look at thing in the public sector and say how on earth have they arrive at this particular figure but the national audit office the public accounts committee and other will keep very clear view on that and they be right to do so say this to my hon friend we want to commemorate and memorialise horrible period in our world history and ensure that education can be provide so that the mistake of the past be hopefully not repeat in the future do not make this point to be flippant but what cost can be put on that give the scale and the seriousness of the task that we have in front of we my hon friend will clearly be aware that when the original proposal be put forward back in the design of the memorial and the education and learning centre have not be consider therefore the budget that be set then before the design work be do be clearly go to be inadequate for the type of facility that we be talk about give that we be in those circumstance he be right that we will need to take clear position on keep to cost and keep to the contract price equally there be the provision of private sector investment to which my hon friend will no doubt refer do he agree with that in all these development until such time as spade go in the ground investor be very unlikely to make contribution until they see something really happen in broad term my hon friend be absolutely right in the way that he set out how these thing will work be grateful to he for make his point in the way that he do reference be make to some astronomical sum of money that have already be spend think hear the figure million total of million have already be spend do not recognise the million figure when it be utter by think my hon friend the member for worthe west so check with my official nobody in the department recognise that figure he may want to write to with the detail but it be not figure that we recognise my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster make an important point about the setting and environment other speak of the need to have quiet time to reflect have visit the education centre different people will be move and touch by what they see hear and read in very different way there be wonderful and compellingly attractive synergy to have the education centre and the memorial juxtaposed my hon friend the member for brigg and goole make the point that have the memorial adjacent to parliament make that linkage to democracy be key have it in space where there be tree and plant and the river close by so that people can come out of the education facility see the memorial and have time to pause reflect consider pray or just hold hand hug or whatever people may want to do to express solidarity with each other be also key the minister make an important point about how important it be to be able to have moment of reflection as say when visit the holocaust gallery at the imperial war museum personally come out of the museum feeling that need somewhere to sit and reflect surely that be one reason why as and other have advocate the imperial war museum be the right place for this memorial let say this to my hon friend before come to this place hear in my professional life have also hear this in my political life as be sure many of we you know what think this be fantastic idea gosh think it good and know an absolutely marvellous site two and half mile away from where you want to develop it it would be so much well there my goodness it would stand out absolutely beautifully but do do it here do do it in my backyard it be my hon friend backyard give that this be her constituency as say early there be comparison of site and victoria tower gardens be alight upon it be as close as one can get it to the heart of our democratic function my hon friend the member for worthing west say something that think be uncharacteristically tory wish my right hon friend the member for north east somerset sir jacob rees mogg have be in his place think he would have leapt to his foot as much as anybody of his age can leap to their foot will the minister give way let finish this point and then of course will my hon friend the member for worthing west dismiss in some cromwellian way say this slightly tongue in cheek the fact that the first bit of our parliamentary democracy that visitor would see be the house of peer as if it be in some way second tier part of our bicameral system hear hear we will have no heckling from the snp thank you very much it be where the throne sit it be where the power of this place emanate from parliament and the crown be interlink rise rise be go to give way to tory on point of order sir roger there be only two minute leave and have hop to wind up the debate just want to point out that be listen to my hon friend the member for worthe west sir peter bottomley carefully and think that he make an absolutely brilliant speech would have thank my right hon friend for that intervention but now do not think that will my apology think that have until six minute past to conclude when think the father of the house be due to wind up in that case draw my remark to close by urge right hon and hon colleague to oppose the amendment to move this important proposal through to provide suitable memorial and education centre not to give way to the mob and to stand up for the very good of what it mean to be british democrat if the figure spend already be million and not million accept that from the minister but wonder whether it be actually high than that if people say that it be only of the park garden that will be use it be or more of the green space those who use the figure should revise that and ask who be give they that advice if people say that those who want to protect the garden be in some way give way to vandal we be not if people want to put thing right the government should compare the present proposal with the good alternative from the consultant and then have proper consultation on the alternative before the planning process start again thank the opposition spokesman the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook for say that there should be new planning application to the local authority we will all agree with that question put

begin by thank you and your fellow deputy speakers for chairing proceeding in committee so expeditiously thank all right hon and hon member on both side who take part in the debate which be inform sensible probe and proper thank the official who have work diligently and with the efficiency and professionalism that anybody who have be minister now come to expect almost as matter of course from our wonderful civil service thank paul downie helen jones ruby hatton emma morrison and sally sealey for all that they have do during the progress of the bill particularly want to thank my private secretary james selby for all that he have do to ensure that everything be in order it would be remiss of not to thank ed balls and my noble friend lord pickles for all that they have do to progress this idea also thank those hon member who so willingly and diligently give of their time on the bill select committee my hon friend the member for carlisle john stevenson who chair it with his customary wit and professionalism the hon member for selby and ainsty keir mather and for kingston upon hull east karl turner and my hon friend the members for guildford angela richardson and for great grimsby lia nici the house owe they all debt of gratitude as do the government and repay that debt wholeheartedly and fully now also thank those who give of their time in prepare their case those oppose to the proposal either in whole or in part give of their time to appear before the committee and in so do they exercise the right to be hear without fear or favour and to be cross examine fairly by elect democrat in this place that be actually what all of this be about the triumph of good over evil of light over darkness the challenge real as it be that the cloud of nazism cast over the continent of europe and that the horror the nazis unleash against people merely because of their faith and belief come so close to extinguish those precious light of religious freedom and democratic institution as well as freedom of speech freedom of association and freedom of thought the holocaust memorial will stand as testimony to that visible beacon to specific visitor as well as to casual passer by it will provide time to pause and reflect and to redouble our effort and make again the solemn and precious vow never again those who make visit to the education centre hopefully many of our young but not exclusively our young will come away with renew determination to learn from the horror of the past to understand in some clear detail the depth that humankind can plummet against member of its own specie to make again that eternal vow of never again and to learn from the mistake of the past the synergy of the education centre and the memorial juxtapose to each other and adjacent to this sovereign democratic parliament be so important as be the setting in busy part of the city of westminster with bustling traffic pedestrian and as my hon friend the member for cities of london and westminster nickie aiken and other say in committee family and child enjoy the open space provide in central london that be victoria tower gardens what could be more uplifting than the laughter of child at play what could be happy sight than family enjoy leisure time together we will reflect when we think of those scene of the family rip apart by the holocaust of the child tear from their parent and the husband separate from wife to go into cattle truck of darkness not know where one be go why one be go or what in the name of all that be holy be happen merely because of sign of faith and belief in yahweh hope that all those who visit will as they see child at play and happy family think of how many family be destroy the imperative to deliver this memorial remain ever press those who either be part of the kindertransport think of lord dubs and other or be of the generation who have contemporary memory even from very young age be age and die it be so important even with small and dwindle cohort of the real time survivor that they can draw spiritual comfort from the fact that we do not forget that we do remember and that we do recommit not to repeat be grateful and the government be grateful to the opposition for their support during the bill progress the commitment be first make by the then prime minister my noble friend lord cameron of chipping norton way back in january the bill have ebb and flow but throughout those ebb and flow it have continue to enjoy cross party support and support from the range of political party of this place and elsewhere different part of civic society and huge variety of our faith community we acknowledge the concern of those who think there be well site and those who be concerned about the size of victoria tower gardens the impact the development may have on its character or the precedent the bill may create hope that address those point as good could in committee cognisant of the fact which it be probably worthy of remind ourselves of and which the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook allude to in his kind and supportive remark towards the end of committee that while many of the concern be totally legitimate they be germane to the planning process not the progress of the bill hope the house know well enough to take as gospel when say that the minister for housing planning and building safety my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley and have meticulously safeguard clear line of demarcation between progress this bill through the house of commons and issue relate to planning can say hand on heart that my hon friend and have not exchange single word about the bill the site or the proposal it be important to stress on third reading that we have clearly understand and respect throughout probity understand the difference in the various power and the quasi judicial function that sit behind the planning process as this be hybrid bill the select committee hear from petitioner against the bill and raise question in its report about how victoria tower gardens be choose we have discuss the cost of the project and we take seriously the security implication thank the committee for its report and hope that it welcome my response which be publish recently the security of our fellow citizen be one of our clear and primary duty have no doubt that there will be challenge in that arena and dynamic solution will be need for absolute certainty echo the point make so ably by my hon friend the member for brigg and goole andrew percy the day must not come when the decision of where and how we site our memorial be dictate to the whip hand be give and the fiat be acknowledge from group of unaccountable people who believe that those who shout loudest waive the most banner cause the most disruption and generate the most vandalism will prevail because the state have neither the nerve nor the spine to stand up to they to say what we think be right that we cherish it and that we will support it with all that we can make that commitment to the house and to the country today we will not be nor should we be dictate to by those who be fundamentally anti democratic who will not take no for an answer and will accept only victory and never defeat we say to they not here not now not ever to give ground on that would fundamentally change this place and our democratic function as we approach that most important of democratic function on july it be time for all of we who honourably wear the badge of democrats to stand up for our share value irrespective of political difference interruption think the hon lady for bath wish to intervene would like to make speech in that case will not let the hon lady intervene interruption who be that my hon friend the member for winchester steve brine chunter from the back benches up until the end think that we have lose sight of the fact that the proposal be consider at detailed and independent planning inquiry set against the thorough work of the committee and the time that have elapse since when the proposal be first give voice that fundamentally undermine the accusation of railroad by government the planning inspector consider great deal of the evidence and look in significant detail at matter such as the impact on victoria tower gardens and crucially the buxton memorial and other exist memorial the inspector conclude that any harm to heritage asset be outweigh the public benefit of the scheme the design and the layout will take the right approach to respect those exist monument particularly those which be list as have say the planning process be the correct way to consider these issue it be not necessary indeed it would not be right for debate on the bill to become concerned with the minutia of planning matter let say again on third reading that the bill deal with very narrow point in the london county council improvements act that be the only issue that be find to be an obstacle to construction in victoria tower gardens let say again for the convenience of the house and for the certainty of those outside the bill create no precedent in its alleviation of the clause within that act it set no precedent elsewhere in victoria tower gardens or elsewhere we regret to recall that antisemitism be at record level the devastatingly clear speech deliver by the secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my right hon friend the member for surrey heath michael gove just yesterday put that into very clear view great grandson of the survivor lily ebert have say when we no long have survivor like lily among we this memorial will help to ensure that their experience be never forget we can create the next generation of witness we must do that to ensure that the pernicious weed of antisemitism can be grub up and that the stain that it be on some section of society be remove let conclude as begin by express my thank to member for their contribution on second reading in committee and on third reading be grateful to the clerks of the house as always for support the smooth running of the bill and to the holocaust memorial team in my department for their policy and bill management support look forward to watch the bill progress in the other place from this place commend it to the house start by thank the clerks the house staff and library specialist for facilitate our debate on the bill also put on record our thank to all member who have contribute to our proceeding at all stage in particular offer our sincere thank to those who serve on the select committee for their work in oversee the bill petition period and all those who make petition against the bill lastly put on record once again the thank of labour members to all those who have be involve in advance the propose national memorial to the holocaust and holocaust education more generally over recent year there be far too many to name individually but must make specific reference to the past and present member of the uk holocaust memorial foundation include the right hon ed balls and the right hon lord eric pickles the holocaust memorial day trust the holocaust educational trust and of course all the survivor of the shoah who have not only campaign for holocaust education but personally champion the project include many who be sadly no long with we whatever difference might exist about precisely how we do so we be unite as house in our commitment to remember and learn from the holocaust it be imperative that we continue to educate future generation about what happen both as mark of respect to those who be murder and those who survive and also as warning about what happen when antisemitism prejudice and hatred be allow to flourish unchecked national memorial for remembrance of the holocaust will stand as permanent reminder of the horror of the past and the need for democratic citizenry to remain ever vigilant and willing to act when the value that underpin free and tolerant society be undermine or threaten as well as encourage reflection on the implication of those horror for british government and society as be rightly mention by several hon member in committee in the nine year since the idea be first moot the case for such monument and institution have become acute not only do anti jewish hatred continue to grow but the remain survivor of the holocaust become ever few and ever frailer we owe it to those who remain with we and to future generation to complete this vitally important project with that concern at the forefront of our mind we wholeheartedly support the passage of the bill this evening call the father of the house know that the hon member for bath wera hobhouse will need to get in so will try not to say as much as have intend to suggest that those who read this third reading debate particularly those in another place who may be consider the bill after the election look at early day motion which spell out number of the issue hope they will look with kindness on what have be say by my right hon friend the minister although there be other interpretation in respect of number of issue those who think there should be memorial do not necessarily think the learn centre should be with it while those who think there should be learn centre do not think it should be squash into what describe as box under memorial there be many who think that the memorial could be well than the design that be not choose in ottawa and think it be continue embarrassment to the government that the name of the person who be mention time in the announcement of the win design sir david adjaye be one that ministers can not say today refer member to the transcript of the select committee hearing on february let quote from paragraph many people will know sir david adjaye statement that disrupt the pleasure of be in park be key to the thinking but few people have hear the first part of that quote which be we have the opportunity to activate the entire site or what he have say previously there have be kind of picture paint that this be public garden it move from be just kind of public park to be much more ceremonial much more kind of order could also quote from paragraph and but will not do so however will quote from paragraph which state that if the learn centre be build the playground be actually go to be reduce by square metre that be by not about as notice and remark on by the inspector or in the figure give by baroness scott the minister in the house of lords in her parliamentary answer or even zero reduction as state by david adjaye misleadingly would say mistakenly to the inquiry loss can not possibly be say to be an enhancement or reconfiguration of the playground that be what chris pincher then briefly minister of state say in support of his planning permission approval for this project refer member to book by dorian gerhold victoria tower gardens which be subtitle the prehistory creation and plan destruction of london park what we be talk about here be not particularly the memorial have good memorial would be well than have bad memorial but victoria tower gardens we have this legislation because the government do not care about the act say to the government that well faith would have be acknowledge that the bill they be put forward be hybrid without resist that fact to the examiner in both houses we now pass the bill on the house of lords where believe that people will look again with fresh eye and fair eye at how we can commemorate those who die but do the good we can to educate people so that what happen be less likely to happen again the idea that particular memorial will stop it happen would be laugh at by those who be commemorate and mourn the yazidi genocide year ago the rwandan genocide and one or two other could name in other part of the world we have to do what be right let end by say this my first cousin once remove be one of the westminster medical school student who go into bergen belsen and be able to save the life of about half the people who be exist there at the time have work with people holocaust survivor and believe that we do well by do what be right in good way which be why welcome what the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook say about the normal planning process as my right hon friend the minister say and as christopher katkowski have say the normal planning process will happen let we look forward if the bill be carry over to planning process in which an application be make to the local authority and the local authority make the decision if the authority approve the application there be no problem if it do not the minister can call it in but the minister should not call it in before westminster city council have have chance to see any revise proposal that the government can now put forward be extremely grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate and be grateful to the father of the house for allow enough time to say what want to say hope that my colleague will bear with my mother family be victim of the nazi regime persecution my uncle be imprison in dachau in but get out with the help of scandinavian friend all my mother half brother and sister leave germany and except for one never return the persecution hang over my mother childhood every day and be never forget for the rest of her life be bear much later but have always have sense of shame and horror about the atrocity commit by the german state during the holocaust owe it to the million of jews who perish at the hand of the country in which be bear to convert this shame into political activity will always stand up and make sure that such unspeakable cruelty do not happen again the education receive in germany make sure that never forget the part that my birth country play in the suffering of million although britain have different legacy it remain important that future generation in this country be as just as inform and educate one of the most significant lesson that we can learn be about ensure that we identify the initial indicator of injustice we must remember that the atrocity of the holocaust begin by create community of division and hatred we must prevent the same prejudice from rear its head today there be no place more suitable for the memorial than victoria tower gardens have the memorial right at the heart of our democracy will serve as constant reminder of the deadly consequence of fascism and racism member of parliament and the public must be able to feel this history to ensure that the legacy of the holocaust do not end up in the periphery of our mind the rise in antisemitism in the uk be reminder that we can not be complacent when it come to education on the world old hatred holocaust denial be become more prolific with conspiracy spread on social medium and we must confront this at time when the holocaust move from live memory into history it be more important than ever that we protect the fact of the holocaust by create learn centre alongside the memorial as holocaust survivor become ever few and frailer it be vital that progress be make rapidly work have not start despite the memorial being promise eight year ago our beloved survivor be in their and and will not be with we forever we have to preserve their testimony and the memory of their family for future generation recently meet susan pollack mbe year old holocaust survivor to mark yom hashoah susan be an avid champion of holocaust education and still speak in school across the country to share her testimony she be especially supportive of the campaign to build holocaust memorial and education centre in victoria tower gardens and we owe it to she and survivor like she to make sure that she can see it open while she be with we sadly the building of the memorial and learn centre have be beset by delay it be important to make sure that local voice be hear but we politician must always consider balance of interest if we sincerely believe in the importance of this project we must get on with it now and not wait any long sir ben helfgott mbe who pass away last year will never be able visit the site he have look forward to take his family to the memorial and education centre as sir ben say before his passing the memorial will ensure that the memory of the six million jewish man woman and child who be murder by the nazis and their collaborator be never forget and that my story and the story of my fellow survivor can continue to be tell forever listen very carefully to the speech by my right hon and learn friend the member for northampton north sir michael ellis be not jew and do not represent constituency with big jewish community and note his point about the small number of jews in our country however like to know my history and know that my constituent across winchester and chandler ford do too so have follow the progress of this bill closely couple of year ago the then prince of wales come to winchester to unveil the statue of licoricia famous jewish figure from winchester and her son asher it stand in jewry street in the heart of our city as permanent reminder of what happen to know it and therefore to know the memorial we be discuss today which support be to never forget be not intend to speak today but have be move by some of the speech that have hear include the last one and think that to have this memorial and this centre be to never forget credit to lord cameron for start this would have never have be in this house without say lord cameron have listen to the various other speech include from the father of the house whom respect greatly and be tempt to say that this site be not perfect but also hear what the minister say about the synergy of this memorial be adjacent to this amazing palace of westminster and think that that be the point agree with the father of the house on the planning procedure which obviously must be do properly and know that it will be support this bill and have follow it closely as it be go through the house do my hon friend accept that there be some of we who feel absolutely as passionately as he and every other colleague in this house about what happen in the holocaust but who do not believe that this be necessarily the good place to site such memorial do he agree that it be now for their lordship to look really closely at whether the point make by the father of the house and other of we who support new clause should be look at carefully before any final decision be reach yes the one thing know from my year and counting in this house be that their lordship look at everything very carefully hear my hon friend but be not sure that do agree for the reason that have just give as the minister say the synergy of this memorial be adjacent to this palace of westminster be the point so if not here where this be good place for it and that be why support it there be another reason why support it always think that in life you can never quote lewis too often and my favourite quote from lewis be you can go back and change the beginning but you can start where you be and change the ending clearly we can not go back and change what happen but we can change the ending and make sure that people remember where we have come from as this could well be my final contribution in this place want to say thank you to the people of winchester and chandler ford for give four in row thank you to my team now and past and of course thank you to susie my wife and emily and william my child for allow to do this will close by say that have always try to hold in my heart in this place something that be teach by my grandfather and then by my parent it be nice to be important and there be many people in this place who be far more important than but think it be far more important to be nice be glad to be able to contribute today on behalf of my party on this important bill albeit that the bill seek specifically to build in london far from my own constituency and far from scotland it be also significantly planning relate issue for both those reason would usually rule myself out of contribute however the principle of have this holocaust memorial matter the opportunity to visit the memorial and the importance of diverse voice in support and the broad range of testimony be share be relevant to we all it be fair to say that this place have take its time to get where we be now my overwhelming feeling be that as the anniversary of the holocaust be within sight it be time to do this it be time to get on with it appreciate that there be some difference on the location understand and sympathise with the various concern and position but it seem to that we can either keep go round in circle or agree that it be time to move forward favour the latter approach we just need to do it be fortunate recently to hear the holocaust survivor susan pollack speak in this place at yom hashoah event she be remarkable woman have also be fortunate to hear other survivor include constituent whose testimony make such marked difference to the life of other that privilege of hear directly from holocaust survivor be of course now become less and less possible so we need to find way to preserve their testimony and to make sure that their story be capture and tell to those who come after we we also know that genocide do not end with the holocaust which in itself should be motivator to move forward with this bill that be why believe the plan to make sure there be an education centre as well as memorial be so vital be in awe of the people include survivor and their family who work so hard to educate other want to mention my constituent geraldine shenkin whose lovely mum marianne grant be hold in no few than three concentration camp but none the less show such courage she make such striking and beautiful art which will convey the horror of the holocaust for generation to come be very fortunate to have be give copy of the book of marianne art which be hugely evocative and an important part of the history of the holocaust the like of which we should see on display as widely as possible to ensure there be clear understanding of the reality of what happen be also in awe of my constituent steven anson whose father martin anson story be tell so powerfully through the gather the voices initiative and my late constituent ingrid and henry wuga both arrival from the kindertransport who make such an impact on my local community and across scotland in their retirement as they dedicate themselves to speak to our young people about their experience they change countless life their testimony their tell the truth of the holocaust have impact thousand of people we lose henry wuga recently shortly after his birthday it would be great shame if the wisdom and dedication he demonstrate be not part of the new memorial and education centre and sincerely hope that his voice and the other mention be among the many scottish voice that this memorial would benefit from amplify know be very lucky to have have these conversation to have hear these story and to have visit place include yad vashem and appreciate the impact it have have on but what about those who have not have that opportunity what about those in future year who will need to know the reality of the holocaust but who will no long have those brave survivor to hear from both the memorial and the education centre be vital in that regard we be also fortunate to have organisation and project include the holocaust memorial day trust lead by the remarkable olivia marks woldman my constituent kirsty robson do important work there too and the holocaust educational trust where karen pollock work tirelessly there be also gather the voices and vision schools scotland could go on about the ethos that shin through all their work the new memorial and education centre will be in position to deliver and learn from that great work they will be able to contribute to each other work which be increasingly important in an increasingly polarise world speak early about the shocking spike in antisemitic incident and the plan to move thing forward be very welcome all of that be why this holocaust memorial and education centre need to be build and it be why we need to give it the profile and broad possible support that it merit it be also why we just need to get on with it in the short time available we should remember that the holocaust represent the dark hour in human history when million jewish people be systematically murder by the nazis above all else the thing that impress about the survivor be their lack of bitterness it would be very easy for they to be very bitter and very angry about what happen but they give their thought and their education freely and without bitterness that be the key point as the survivor pass away we must ensure that we capture their testimony so that it be always available regret that when be at school we have no education on the holocaust our generation be largely ignorant the jewish population of this country largely do not want to talk about what have happen for fear of not be believe education be vital thank the minister and the successive ministers who have take this bill through the house to enable we to have learn centre and memorial also thank the holocaust memorial day trust the holocaust educational trust and all those wonderful body that have agitate for this to happen and who deliver education and learn every single day on cross party basis the house can bless this bill as we enable it to get on the statute book be sure the house of lords will bless

the local government association thank the minister for attend this evening and for his response appreciate that it have be bit of an unusual day so will not be implore he to make all sort of commitment from the dispatch box give the unusual circumstance in which we find ourselves would like to raise some important matter if be lucky or privilege enough to be return to this place by the constituent of north shropshire will continue to campaign on these issue on their behalf many hon member across the house have raise the issue of the crisis in local government funding in recent month wish to highlight some of the specific challenge face by rural council and in particular by my own council of shropshire which deal with the area of north shropshire most people experience of government be local as we know they drive on the road every day so they experience the pothole and the condition of the road they use the waste disposal service whether that be have their bin collect or take they to recycling centre they might use swimming pool they might have friend relative or love one in need of social care or they might need it themselves they might have child in local authority maintain school therefore local government be most people experience of government and it be the backbone of our community since council have see billion real term cut in the funding they receive from central government and that be drive deep inequality in our community and impact on people perception of the value they receive from the tax they pay shropshire council have to find million of cut in the financial year that just end and it be say that it will need to make furth million of cut in the come year that be an enormous cut and it will affect everyone in north shropshire but it will affect vulnerable people the most and that be my area of concern now why be this it be very tempting to stand here and say that shropshire be conservative run which be why it be in so much trouble but although believe that liberal democrats would do well job the reality be that the council spend around of its budget on social care that be more than the average of council across the country which spend about two third of their budget try to meet adult and child social care cost it mean that in shropshire for every pound that we give to the council for service only be spend on other thing whether statutory provision such as library or other big ticket item such as highway and it really be not enough money the problem be that the quality of social care be be affect as well early last year meet an elderly couple in ellesmere who have love and care for their disabled daughter all of her life when she become ill and go into hospital they be unable to continue that level of care when she be discharge because of their own health problem so they need more supportive arrangement the council find shelter flat for their daughter they pay for new carpet and be excited about she have that new arrangement but just two week before she be due to move in the flat be withdraw because it be consider to be too expensive cause huge amount of trauma and concern about the money that they have invest in the flat we be able to reverse that decision in that case but they be far from the only family in that situation in fact half million people in england be desperate for social care the reality be that shropshire council can not outrun the grow demand for social care it might make the million of cut this year and avoid section notice this time around but will it or indeed any other administration be able to do that in future give the increase level of demand think that any administration will struggle to achieve that every single person in shropshire have see and will see an increase in their council tax and what they be get in return be reduce service all the while adult social care need be not be meet as the public accounts committee recently confirm strongly suspect that be because we be try to fund social care through council tax which be regressive break tax that go nowhere near match the cost of the service that we be try to deliver with sensible revenue stream to fund it do not think that we will fix the problem unless we totally revisit how we fund social care and indeed how we collect council tax it be not just people receive social care who be feel the brunt of the cut it be all the service that we expect to receive last month our council announce the closure of two of the five recycling centre in shropshire two of which be in my constituency if either of those close some of my constituent will have minute drive to recycling centre be sure that they will make that drive we be all dependent on our car we do not have great bus service and be sure that law abide citizen will do their good to get their refuse to tip that be far away but north shropshire be beautiful rural constituency with mile and mile of remote isolate road and it be at high risk from fly tipper people be genuinely concerned that the beautiful countryside will be ruin by that criminal activity and it will cost the council even more to clean it up we seem to be take with one hand and spend huge amount of money with the other which might not have the desire outcome there be similar story on special educational need and disability local authority obviously have to pay for transport for send pupil and the rationing of that transport be become huge problem for some of my constituent be contact by shane and brad the foster parent of toby an year old with special educational need he move from norfolk to shropshire five month ago on special guardianship arrangement with the understanding that his education health and care plan would be transfer and the provision would continue not only can they not afford to transport he around to wherever specialist place might be available but because he be over they have not be able to find specialist place so poor old toby have not be to school since he move to shropshire five month ago the council do not have the resource to solve this problem there be not enough specialist teacher or educational psychologist or enough specialist place in state school as result young people face postcode lottery when it come to funding to support their ehcp in rural area transport for child with special need be particularly problematic because they have to be transport over large distance at great cost again the council be not deprive those people through malice or lack of care it simply do not have the funding to meet the demand perhaps less seriously although this still have huge impact there be problem with leisure facility whitchurch in my constituency have recently lose not only the town only performance space but its registry office drive test centre and library as well as room that community group can hire out for regular use because the civic centre have reinforce autoclaved aerate concrete in its roof we would think that the council would be able to fix the problem and find some money to repair the roof but that be not the case the council can not afford the interest payment and have say that the cost be prohibitive it be now try to find alternative which will ultimately lead to less space that be problem for resident who enjoy the use of those facility but it also have huge economic impact on the town centre with business already report to that they have reduce footfall that be of great concern there be real problem with library third of library have close in the past year despite library be statutory service because the comprehensive and efficient library service that be require be not define lot of council be cut library and their availability again that be drive deep inequality the national literacy trust have find that child who read at their expect age level be twice as likely to be library user as not to be if we want to level up it be really important that we give child from all background the opportunity to read access library and make the most of their education will move on to public transport which have talk about lot in this place shropshire have particularly poor public transport network and have lose the most mile of bus service anywhere in england since with few mile be complete by bus than in that be drastic decrease especially compare with place such as milton keynes where bus mile have increase there be definitely way of do it if we have the funding right poor public transport be problem for the economy because we can not transport worker around which give we labour supply issue it be problem for young people try to access college course because they do not know whether their bus service will be there next year and it be problem for old people who may be try to access the hospital because to get there by taxi be unaffordable again give that we be about to embark on general election this be possibly not the right moment to implore the minister to allow the franchising of bus service but put on record that if council could fund those service it would have huge economic regenerative impact it would be great to see bus be priority for all the party in the general election because they have such good impact on increase labour supply and on enable people of all age and all income level to live work and get about the community in conclusion want to make the point that rural area be struggle perhaps more than urban area despite the fact that we sometimes assess urban deprivation as bad than rural deprivation it be certainly more visible but the central government funding for local council have lose touch with reality on the cost of deliver those service and indeed to some extent on the level of need when we look at the impact on people whether it be social care or special educational need provision swimming pool or library or recycling centre all those thing be suffer and they all cost more to deliver in rural area want to state this case again to all political party because we do not know who will be sit in the minister seat after the general election sort out the fair funding formula be very important deliver in rural area be essential to regenerate the economy in those area one fifth of the population live in rural area they be underperform economically and we need to ensure that local council have the funding they need to provide regeneration and quality of life for those well deserve people who live in those beautiful part of britain thank the hon member for north shropshire helen morgan for instigate this debate be only sad not to see the hon member for strangford jim shannon in his place this may be the final adjournment debate of the session and feel personally hurt that he have not be here to intervene and to give strangford take on shropshire however be sure he be somewhere think of we and kick himself that he be not here the hon member for north shropshire be right to say that all politic be local she be also right to echo something that have say on many occasion most people exposure in our community be to the facility and service provide by local council for their community we agree absolutely on that want to place on the record my thank to all the councillor and officer of shropshire council and indeed to local government across the country for all that they do and strive to do they get out of bed in the morning to achieve for their community to deliver change to make place and to improve opportunity and living the hon lady refer specifically to library library be topic very close to my heart both as keen reader and as child an avid attender of our local library dorset council have do the most phenomenal work with its library in similarly challenging circumstance be rural council and the like be pretty certain that should her officer in shropshire reach out to those in dorset they would be happy to provide some advice or guidance call it what you will on safeguard the future delivery of those important service the hon lady be right that have acknowledge the government have acknowledge the challenge financial circumstance of local government bring about in whole or certainly in very great part by pressure on adult social care special educational need and disability and home to school transport around about of an upper tier council budget be spend on to of its population we just have to watch that balance to ensure that council tax payer feel that they be get something for their money as she will know have not commit on behalf of the government to root and branch review of the local government funding formula because my assessment be that it be all but break an analogue proposal for digital age that need rework from the bottom up have always ask for certainty and clarity from the local government sector and as government we have always be keen to deliver they in the next parliament they could well be deliver by have in the short term multi year settlement to give that security and then by parliament use that time and can not overstate the value that see in this to provide cross party sustainable solution for deliver on these issue do not say this flippantly because have think about it but the hon lady have speak in this chamber and in westminster hall about local government finance and local government issue more generally and have answer on many occasion her question and those of labour members and it suddenly strike early this morning do not know why it strike then that although they may identify problem have yet to hear their solution have yet to hear the genesis of an idea from the opposition party the labour party have have year to think about it and the hon lady party have have the past nine year but there be absolutely no idea she tell we jot down her word contemporaneously that we need to give consideration to how we fund social care and indeed how we collect council tax agree with she but she give no suggest solution to those press problem find that very strange give that opposition party really have nothing else to do than beaver away on policy to put before the electorate in just few week time although the hon lady be right to point out that she have no idea and no more do of what the result of the election will be it be very much my hope that may be stand at the government dispatch box set out the plan to which we have commit on the fundamental review and rewrite of local government finance shall leave that to the electorate of north dorset to decide and hope that they put their faith and trust in as they have do on the past several occasion let turn briefly to some of the figure have say they so many time now that get slightly bored of they but think it worthwhile to read they into the record the local government finance settlement for make available up to billion an increase in core spending power of up to billion or in cash term compare with we listen to the view of local government and many colleague from across the house include the hon lady who know how grateful be that she take part in the parliamentary level of the consultation that undertake which be the high level of take up that minister have deliver as result of listen to what we hear the government announce additional measure for local authority in england worth furth million include million of new funding for council with responsibility for adult and child social care what do that represent as far as the hon lady council be concern the settlement represent an increase in core spending power of up to million or make available whopping total of million in that be not small beer for shropshire council also recognise as the hon lady do the additional cost pressure and challenge of deliver quality service in rural environment with sparse population and long travel time which be why we have set such enormous store by the rural service delivery grant as she know because shropshire rank within the top sparsely populate area in england her council receive an additional million through the rsdg for on top of the other money have speak of in order to assist with the importance and the difficulty of serve dispersed population be it enough be it ever enough who know we always need more it be important that every year council take the opportunity to learn from other peer review and engage the local government association to help they modernise and seek saving through share service and other initiative know that many council do that but not all do as we know shropshire go unitary and glean huge amount of financial benefit from so do as do my council area of dorset there be thing that local authority can be do to reduce expenditure and to use the money from the saving they make to continue to deliver those service that increasingly people look to their local council to deliver in conclusion be grateful to the hon member for north shropshire for raise this issue she and share many thing include concern for make sure that our rural area be well represent in this place will continue to do that on behalf of my constituent hope the hon lady will not take it ill if say that hope my party will represent north shropshire after the general election but it have be personal pleasure to work alongside she over these past several month since have be deal with local government she have bring lot of engagement to the process be just sorry that her party have not bring forward any idea but let we share those idea cross party in the next parliament to ensure we have robust settlement rubric that will meet demand one that will be cost effective and affordable but will continue to deliver the quality of public service that so many in our community rely upon and rightly deserve question put and agree to house adjourn
