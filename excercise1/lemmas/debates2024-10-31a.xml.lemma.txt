it have be real privilege to share the debate with so maiden speech this afternoon something do not expect my hon friend the member for ribble valley maya ellis be not in her place just now but be sure her father would have be proud of she as will her husband have fantastic charity in my constituency call dads rock which support dad and give they confidence it sound like her husband be dad who rock it have be remarkable that margaret thatcher have be invoke quite few time it be quite unusual for her name to be mention so many time in my presence grow up in fife during the and be sure my hon friend the member for glenrothes and mid fife richard baker would agree that the impact that she have there be still feel today people still feel the impact of the rapid deindustrialisation of proud community be sure that my hon friend have casework still about the impact of that it be emotional yesterday to hear the chancellor deliver her fantastic speech be still little hoarse today from all the emotion this be the budget our country need and the imf agree which be incredible it be great news for labour mps to wake up to this morning expect colleague from other party be less happy the chance of my be elect be always slim but promise those meet on the campaign trail that labour would get our country back on track yesterday budget be proof that we be serious about that we have spend the week since the election clearing up the mess which be leave by other but the budget set down the foundation for what we want to do next it be transformative budget can not believe we be achieve so much in our first budget but it be only the start of real change for our country the budget will work for both the work people who call edinburgh south west home but also the young and retire people who deserve well fund public service the measure that we set out yesterday be re set establish the tone for the remainder of this parliament and for the come decade not just five year go be the irresponsible commitment without plan to follow through that we have be deal with since the election it feel like the grown up be now run the country we have budget that provide the stability to encourage growth and investment in our nation infrastructure and our public service after read through the detail of the budget it be clear that when my colleague anas sarwar say read my lip no austerity under labour he mean it the chancellor have deliver the budget will deliver for the people of scotland with record break billion for the scottish government budget in that have the potential to be entirely life change not just for my constituent but for people right across scotland the chancellor yesterday prove that when labour win scotland win with the measure announce result in more investment per head of population in scotland than in the rest of the uk the scotland office be now equip with budget for trade mission around the world sell brand scotland and bring in new investment and custom to countless scottish business some of the lowest pay scot will also feel the benefit in their payslip we will close the age band on the living wage which have always be unacceptable the budget have protect work scot and have lay the foundation for new era of investment and growth in scotland raise money from those with the broad shoulder with all that in mind find it rather embarrass that snp members talk with straight face about this be an austerity budget it be almost as if they write their speech before they hear the budget it be quite curious can only guess as other have comment none of they be here today that they be busy rewrite their line and think about how they be go to respond but think lot of people in scotland will find it unacceptable that no snp members be here today to engage in this debate be it not time when the uk labour government have give the scottish government their large ever fund settlement that the snp begin to take responsibility for its own mismanagement of scotland finance in government the snp have waste million on pet project rather than the service on which so many scot rely we have have ferry with paint window as speak hospital in edinburgh be be close as an emergency action because of lack of maintenance this be not small hospital the princess alexandra eye pavilion cater for out patient per week and it have be close almost overnight it be plan process but one that have be force it be absolutely incredible and shameful in parallel with that local authority have be starve of cash and our town and city have find their public service decimate on tuesday meet third sector group in my constituency who be prepare to make staff redundant due the pressure of snp cut to social care at past yesterday just as the chancellor be get ready to speak receive whatsapp message from gp serve one of the most deprived part of my constituency she describe the cut to social care service in edinburgh as catastrophic and devastating at quarter past last night receive an email from gp make exactly the same point the snp will blame westminster or howl austerity but in reality that be mince that be scottish phrase madam deputy speaker the scottish government own decision be to blame for much of the pressure face scotland finance that be not just my view but the consider view of the official economic forecaster in scotland the budget present the scottish government with choice they can use the record funding to own the problem that they create and get our public service back on track include the social care service talk about the only alternative to that be hand over power to anas sarwar in scotland because more guddle can not be an option but fear that that be what we be go to get if the snp be not up for that challenge scottish labour be ready to step in my constituent know more than most the impact of the snp cut and mismanagement because edinburgh scotland capital have the worst fund local authority in scotland with this additional funding it be high time that the scottish government do the right thing and stop starve our council of the resource it need councillor cammy day edinburgh council leader make that demand yesterday let we hope that the funding will be lifeline to social care provider in scottish voter will have the opportunity to elect scottish labour government that will work hand in hand with this uk labour government to continue to deliver for the people of scotland however until then we scottish labour mps and our colleague at holyrood and in council chamber will hold the scottish government to account for how they choose to spend the additional funding after all think we can all agree that the scottish government have not just need more cash they have need to get well at spend it we see yesterday what labour chancellor can do to turn around the life of work people even in the face of shocking legacy hand to we by the conservatives this government have give the scottish government all the financial tool they need to succeed just imagine how truly transformative it would be if we have scottish labour finance secretary work in partnership with labour chancellor here in london that be our goal
