beyond the statement to make it clear to the government of israel that their siege in gaza must end immediately and that humanitarian aid system can not be replace with military control one will he consider sanction and the cessation of arm and rule out any trade deal as child should not pay the price for the inaction of the international community my hon friend be right to raise the plight of child in gaza and indeed all those suffer from the lack of aid and the continued conflict this government have be clear that the ceasefire must be restore since the statement which she mention we have take the decision jointly with our partner to call an urgent session of the un security council give the gravity of the situation the loom famine in gaza be not natural disaster it be direct result of the deterioration of the ceasefire agreement it be deeply concern that this be put the entire population of gaza at critical risk of food insecurity and potential famine can the minister assure that this government be support every possible opportunity to get vital resource and humanitarian aid into the region can give my hon friend that assurance we be do everything we can to ensure that aid get in that hostage be release that hamas be no long in charge of gaza and that we get the ceasefire and path to two state solution that we so desperately need the un philippe lazzarini be right be he to say today that israel be commit massive atrocity by block aid to the child of gaza as well as the urgent need for aid the palestinian people need more trade with country like the uk will the minister explain how my constituent in rochdale can buy more palestinian good such as olive oil herb and date and support tech company and the many co operative that operate in the west bank and in gaza know that rochdale be the home of the co operative movement in this country and that there be many co operative in the occupied palestinian territories as well on april we sign memorandum of understanding with the palestinian authority that include pursue further co operation in exactly the area he describe include economic development and trade gaza face imminent famine due to the israeli government blockade and over million people face catastrophic hunger level what action be the uk government take to lift the blockade and secure the delivery of humanitarian aid to gaza this government have clear position on the vital importance of aid return to gaza that be why we be call an urgent session of the un security council this afternoon it be why the foreign secretary have make these point repeatedly and clearly to his israeli counterpart as indeed have how long will the uk walk by on the other side as palestinian child bleed and starve to death be it not time that this government and indeed his majesty loyal opposition show that they be supportive of israel but that that support do not necessarily mean they be supportive of particular government in this case the racist brutal regime of netanyahu let we not forget what this government have do we restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency after the conservatives freeze it we suspend arm export licence whereas the conservatives do not take action we have provide million in humanitarian assistance to the occupied palestinian territories we be not on the other side of the road welcome the right hon member strong view on this find his intervention last week very powerful indeed there be no one on the labour benches who do not understand the gravity of the situation that be why we invite the palestinian prime minister why we sign the memorandum of understanding and why we be call an urgent session of the security council this government will not be on the other side of the road from palestinian suffering last week the united nations issue report describe the situation in gaza as one of the most ostentatious and merciless manifestation of the desecration of human life and dignity the government have always insist that it be not for they but for the court to determine what be and what be not genocide but the minister will know that the genocide convention also put legal obligation on state to act to prevent genocide do he believe that the uk have fulfil its legal obligation under that convention to prevent genocide in gaza as say to the right hon member for the wrekin mark pritchard we be take action not just rhetoric but action to try to address the situation in gaza that include call the security council to an urgent session this afternoon alongside our partner we will continue to take the action that we think be need to ensure that the people of gaza get what they need we hear about the action that the government be take but unfortunately none of they be lead to the prevention of the starvation and killing of innocent civilian the late number which be only an estimate show that over child have die of starvation accord to official record we do not know how many have die but have not yet be record there be one step that the government have not take welcome the aid but when it stand on the other side of crossing and can not get to the people who need it it be useless some or month ago aid be airdrop into gaza why be the government not airdrop aid or provide it by sea and will they condemn the bombing on may of the freedom flotilla which go to provide aid as think the house know be familiar with the impediment to get aid into gaza go to the gaza egypt border to see the restriction for myself we have make these point in public and in private and we will continue to do so we be talk to our jordanian partner and other many in the region understandably have real concern about the lack of aid get in although we be consider with jordan and other what the alternative may be must be plain with the house there be no alternative to land route if aid be to get in at the scale that be require so we must be clear with the israeli government and all partner in the region that open those crossing be critical mr lazzarini have say that child in gaza be more likely to die of starvation than of an act of violence what do my hon friend expect from this afternoon session at the un what specifically will be ask for that would move the situation on israel can not be allow to continue use food as weapon of war think be clear about the government expectation in my previous answer those expectation be ground in israel international legal obligation ultimately this be week of diplomacy the president of the united states will be in the region and we will raise these issue in the security council hope that diplomacy will be able to make progress towards ceasefire and the restoration of aid call the liberal democrat spokesperson gaza have be starve of humanitarian aid for over day now minister have repeatedly express their disappointment but there be no evidence that the israeli government be listen or have any intention of reopen the supply route in march the foreign secretary withdraw his assessment that the blockade be breach of international law will the minister state how many day the blockade must continue before the government recognise it as breach of international law to make clear the uk support for palestine right to self determination and opposition to the extremist policy of annexation by force will the government commit to work with france towards the joint recognition of the state of palestine at the conference next month the foreign secretary have be clear repeatedly as have all ministers from the dispatch box that it be the long stand policy of british government that we do not make legal determination we make an assessment when we arrive that there be real risk of serious breach of international humanitarian law and that continue to be our finding give the event that many in this house have rightly raise we continue to make those assessment and include all those event in they on the french saudi conference in june we continue to talk with all our partner as say in my previous answer this be period for diplomacy ceasefire be desperately need and it be diplomacy that will get we through to the next stage kashmir what assessment he have make of the potential implication for his policy of the situation in kashmir the uk welcome the commitment make by india and

relationship have speak to my indian and pakistani counterpart four time since this crisis begin and stay in close touch with secretary of state rubio and my counterpart in saudi arabia and the united arab emirates in particular nation that have relationship with both country we will do all we can and we encourage both india and pakistan to maintain their commitment to hard win area of diplomatic co operation such as the indus water treaty follow the terrorist attack on april india and pakistan engage in military activity and india hit nine terrorist basis now that there be fragile peace which be still be negotiate today what effort be the foreign secretary make to ensure that the terrorist basis be remove from pakistan occupy kashmir let be clear that the horrendous terrorism we national strip and shoot be horrific and we condemn it we will continue to work with close partner to deal with this terrorist threat the hon gentleman be right all of we have to lean in and ensure that we be support effort on both side to deal with horrendous terrorism that be what in the end will maintain an endure peace the reality remain that the international community have fail to act on the plight of the kashmiris for over seven decade from the revocation of article and strip jammu and kashmir of its special status to the mass arrest and political repression in one of the most militarised zone in the world the attack on kashmiri human right and civil liberty be intolerable if we be serious about human right and long term peace and stability in the region the central issue of kashmir can not be ignore any long and must now get the attention it deserve will the secretary of state today reaffirm our unwavering commitment to the birthright to self determination of the son and daughter of kashmir let once again condemn the terrorism we see that begin this crisis and remind the house that since there have be six conflict and three war between these two great country the long stand position of the uk be that it be for india and pakistan to find last resolution to the situation in kashmir take into account of course as my hon friend suggest the wish of the kashmiri people my constituent in woking particularly those of indian and pakistani descent welcome the ceasefire will the foreign secretary urge both country to accept that the solution to the kashmir question be self determination not further violence as have say it be absolutely for india and pakistan to find last resolution to the situation in kashmir and of course it must in the end take into account the wish of the kashmiri people but all of we have responsibility to condemn terrorism wherever it occur innocent people be strip and shoot be intolerable and of course we condemn it call the shadow foreign secretary we all welcome the easing of tension between india and pakistan over the weekend and our thought continue to be with those affect by this shocking terrorist atrocity the house will be aware of the ongoing presence of terrorist infrastructure in pakistan and that should be concern for all of we last week at the dispatch box the under secretary of state for foreign commonwealth and development affairs the hon member for lincoln mr falconer comment that he have hold discussion with his pakistani counterpart on this very issue what further discussion have take place to secure commitment from the pakistani government that they will dismantle terrorist infrastructure and what role will britain play in support the removal of terrorist threat within pakistan because that be what will improve stability and security in the region be grateful to the right hon lady and may share my reflection over the last few day we do need proper communication between india and pakistan and that must happen not just on military channel but on political channel she will recognise that on this occasion those communication be poor we do need confidence build measure and to ensure that we be deal with terrorism where it act and of course the united kingdom will lean in to that above all we need dialogue the international community can play role particularly where country have relation with both country that be why we have be talk to the united states that be why we have be talk to saudi and that be why we be work with the uae us policy on iran what discussion he have have with his us counterpart on the policy of the us administration on iran what discussion he have have with his us counterpart on the policy of the us administration on iran the uk be supportive of us effort to reach nuclear deal with iran we have encourage iran to engage with president trump effort in good faith and to find diplomatic solution since the beginning of may have raise iran with us secretary of state marco rubio and the special envoy to the middle east steve witkoff we have discuss the range of threat that iran pose to the uk and our partner the islamic revolutionary guards corps be the terrorism export wing of the despotic regime in tehran why be we not join the americans in proscribe this organisation when we do proscribe the wagner organisation in russia be it possibly because the americans be pressure we to continue our tenuous diplomatic link with tehran remind the hon gentleman that on march the uk specify iran under the foreign influence registration scheme which target those who undertake malign activity in the uk of course we keep proscription under review we be look closely at the area of state threat that be traditionally very different from the sort of cell and terrorist community that we do proscribe that be why the government continue to look at this area very carefully our united kingdom and the united states be align in the view that nuclear armed iran would pose serious threat to global stability with nuclear negotiation currently under way between the us and iran can the secretary of state inform the house what outcome his department would consider to be success from british perspective crucially do he have contingency plan if those talk fail to produce an acceptable result iran be now produce roughly one significant quantity of highly enriched uranium every six week that be time above the limit in the joint comprehensive plan of action the deal that we strike with iran which have in front of report may vol correction be really crystal clear about this iran must never develop nuclear weapon it must reverse its escalation we have see that in its enrichment programme it must not carry out any critical weaponisation work and these term have to be fully verifiable unless we get that we will see snapback of the sanction regime that we strike with it year ago call the shadow foreign secretary the regime in tehran be responsible for so much of the appalling bloodshed and conflict in the middle east it pose direct threat to britain and on british soil as we have see from the recent arrest of iranian national in counter terrorism operation have the foreign secretary summon the iranian ambassador to express concern and to explain what have be go on on british soil what discussion have take place with our ally in addition to the nuclear talk that he have just refer to what be the position of our partner in the region on the very specific threat that iran be pose and demonstrate with its dissident on uk soil when will the government come forward with comprehensive and clear strategy on deal with iran the right hon lady be right on may counter terrorism police arrest eight individual

israeli report may vol correction as say on march we put iran on the foreign influence registration scheme we keep proscription under review we be fully engage with our partner and we be very pleased that germany now have government so that we can work with they together on the jcpoa and snapback and of course we be speak to steve witkoff humanitarian aid educational programmes if he will make an assessment of the potential merit of allocate of humanitarian aid to educational programme the uk be principled humanitarian donor we prioritise give humanitarian assistance to people in great need which include protect the most vulnerable by support access to education in emergency and crisis decision on future budget be subject to the ongoing spending review and resource allocation process accord to the education and development forum plan cut to the official development assistance budget could slash uk aid for education by more than by compare with level in gaza where of school be damage and child go without formal education uk back programme will be vital in restore hope provide stability and equip child with the skill to rebuild do the minister agree that education aid must be protect particularly in crisis response such as in gaza as the prime minister set out the uk will continue to play lead humanitarian role include in gaza where child must be allow to return to school in safety through our global funding the uk enable thousand of child to gain access to essential education service support recovery from the trauma of war and building skill and hope for the future in the past the minister have speak very positively about education what assessment have be make of the potential progress that could be make in reduce youth radicalisation by allocate aid to education programme as we have witness over the year number of young people be brainwash online by extremist group we have an excellent programme call education can not wait which in provide million in first emergency response grant cover not just the educational need but the psychosocial need of those affect by conflict and trauma call the shadow minister we know that education can make real difference to girl life chance which be why the last conservative government commit to ensure that every girl have access to quality education however we will now be spend less on development so can the minister give clarity on the commitment that the government be make to support woman and girl over the next few year which programme will be keep and which will be cut and how much will be invest in those programme the foreign commonwealth and development office humanitarian framework set out our long term approach through three policy priority provide humanitarian assistance for those in great need protect people at risk in conflict and crisis and prevent and anticipate future shock and building resilience when it come to build resilience the people most at risk be often woman and young girl who fail to have access to education the index of educational attainment will be the basis on which many of these decision be make consular assistance statutory right whether his department plan to introduce statutory right to consular assistance what discussion he have have with cabinet colleague on introduce statutory right to consular assistance we be committed to strengthen support for british national abroad include introduce right to consular assistance in case of human right violation the department be consider package of measure which we will announce in due course alongside

family be leave without information not know what have happen to they high profile case at the moment include those of alaa abd el fattah in egypt and of jagtar singh johal in india none of these people have an automatic right to support as be the case with other country such as the united states so can the minister give we more detail about exactly what the consular assistance will be and whether it will be automatic for everyone the safety and security of british national overseas be top priority for the government this be complex area of policy the hon lady have describe the wide range of different consular case that the foreign office respond to from kidnap case to more routine case as set out to the foreign affairs committee give the complexity of these issue we will come back to parliament in due course with option for consultation remind the government that their manifesto promise legal right to consular assistance in case of human right violation the government have

jimmy lai be still be hold ryan cornelius have be hold illegally for year which the un have criticise as human right violation for age we do not send anybody to see he surely now we must act and call out these regime the first place to start be by give those people the absolute right to consular assistance thank the right hon gentleman for his question and his commitment to these issue be it only so that pass right in this place would secure the release of the people whose case have be raise in every case that have be mention by the right hon gentleman and by the hon member for edinburgh west christine jardine the people concern do receive consular assistance have meet the family of ryan cornelius and alaa abd el fattah they both remain very much in our mind it be important that we get the right correct these be complex case and we be bind not just by what we decide in parliament but by the relevant convention and diplomatic norm we will take action to try to preserve the safety of british national overseas but it be right that we take our time to ensure that we get it correct it be at time of crisis that british national abroad need consular service the most share many of my constituent concern about the violence in india pakistan and kashmir include those of year old boy who contact yesterday about his aunt and uncle who be strand in pakistan as be one of my lovely

friend will have see report that america intend to raise the case of jimmy lai during its recent talk with china in geneva what step can the government take to capitalise on america renew interest in his case so that we can secure his freedom we continue to call on the hong kong authority to end their politically motivate prosecution and release jimmy lai immediately as my hon friend would expect will not comment overmuch on the action of other state but will say that the prime minister have raise this matter directly with the relevant authority as have the foreign secretary the chancellor and many other ukraine diplomacy what diplomatic step his department be take to support ukraine last week travel with european partner to lviv at the invitation of ukraine foreign minister and yesterday host for the first time in london foreign ministers from the group of key european ally to discuss our joint effort to strengthen european security and secure just and last peace in ukraine last weekend the prime minister say that the uk would do all that it could to support ukraine if that be the case why do the government continue to prevaricate over seize billion of pound in frozen asset hold in uk bank which could be use to build ukraine defence the long we delay the more likely it be that those fund will become wrap up in other negotiation and we will lose the chance altogether be grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the issue but it be not an issue on which the government should act unilaterally it be multilateral issue on which we should act with our partner and our european partner recognise that some partner in europe be hugely expose the good way in which to move forward be to pool those asset and discussion on that be ongoing the yale university humanitarian research lab be do incredible work in track the ukraine child who have be steal by russia but then become victim of the cut be make by the department of government efficiency follow international outrage its work be preserve and give reprieve for six week period that end on may can my right hon friend reassure the house that the datum collect by the university have be secure and transfer to europol or that its funding be secure for the long term thank my hon friend for continually raise this matter we be an active member of the international coalition for the return of ukrainian children and we fund the bring kids back ua and save ukraine campaign we have raise this issue internationally and be proud to have work on it with mrs zelensky will write to the hon lady as soon as can to update she on the funding the sustainable success of ukraine and its self defence hinge very much on the appetite of the president of the united states of america what step be the foreign secretary his ministers and his official take to ensure that the president remain committed to defend the territorial integrity of not just his own nation but all nation and will the foreign secretary ensure that the white house understand that allow an aggressor to prosper in this case will encourage other aggressor to invade their neighbour in the future be grateful for the experience and the strength with which the right hon gentleman have speak he will have note that the prime minister be in kyiv recently with president zelensky and other european partner and that they engage with president trump there we welcome the desire to secure an endure peace but it seem to that engage in those talk will require ceasefire it be putin who be prevaricate it be putin who be obfuscate and we must call that out with our long experience of scrutinise that particular individual we all hope the moot peace talk between russia and ukraine on end russia illegal invasion take place as quickly as possible to stop the killing and save life accountability be important so will the foreign secretary outline his position on russian war crime and on how justice can be do be very pleased to be with other european foreign ministers in lviv to support the special tribunal and be crystal clear that those who have prosecute this war must attest and be accountable for their action call the liberal democrat spokesperson ukrainians continue bravely to resist russia war machine yet president trump continue to indulge in the fantasy that putin be serious about peace the uk need to maintain clear leadership in the face of trump unreliability in the foreign secretary response to in march he say that the uk want to pursue the seizure of frozen russian asset but that belgium and germany be blocker listen carefully to the answer he give to my hon friend the member for horsham john milne and he speak about multilateralism what conversation on this issue have he have with his counterpart in belgium and germany since march and when will the point come when the uk show leadership call time and lead from the front by seize russian asset have have detailed talk with my belgian counterpart not just at foreign minister level but technical talk that have involve our official know that the hon gentleman understand multilateralism he will recognise that the new german government have only be in power for matter of day be able to discuss this issue yesterday with my german counterpart but with all grace be allow he to spend some time get into the detail of the issue marine biological diversity agreement what progress he have make on ratify the agreement under the united nations convention on the law of the sea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of area beyond national jurisdiction as the foreign secretary say in his kew lecture we be completely committed to ratify the marine biological diversity of area beyond national jurisdiction agreement primary legislation be require to give effect to our obligation under the agreement and legislation to implement the agreement will be introduce as soon as the legislative timetable allow the uk have lead world class conservation effort and this government have rightly commit to the landmark high seas treaty but we must act now as without ratification the uk risk lose its place in shape this vital treaty implementation and future direction can the minister confirm when legislation to ratify the agreement will be introduce or provide clear timetable if we want to stay at the table we must claim our seat my hon friend be quite right to push the government on this issue and the fcdo will redouble our effort in this place to make sure that we do the necessary work to conclude the legal process call the shadow minister the uk be world leader in protect marine environment particularly around the british overseas territories but tragically that reputation will be trash when labour surrender to mauritius one of the most important marine protect area around the british indian ocean territory while mauritian fishery ministers have be pledge to issue fishing and trawl licence for those water labour ministers have give no assurance about future protection and have just make vague comment on work with mauritius on new mpa can the minister state if the propose treaty will have any guarantee protection in place will she confirm what be say in legal letter to british chagossians that their right of return be not guarantee surely that would be total betrayal thank the shadow minister for his question follow the trip that he and do together when we be both on the foreign affairs committee be sure he be aware that the marine protect area will continue and that the environment have be at the heart of the negotiation indeed he must remember that because when he be the chair of the chagos islands all party parliamentary group he begin the debate with the mauritians so be sure he be in very good position to ask any further question that he may like to ask of the mauritians official development assistance budget which development programme he plan to maintain funding for after the plan reduction of the official development assistance budget in this government be resolutely commit to development but we recognise that we must do it differently we will ensure that the aid budget deliver value for money and have impact globally support and grow economy will be at the heart of how we spend oda go forward and further decision on the oda budget include specific programme be subject to the spending review and resource allocation process these severely constrain budget call for thinking smarter not simply small so what work be the government do with the world bank and other international institution to make sure that uk development spend be fully leveraged so that every penny be as effective as possible the right hon member raise very important point and we of course continue to engage closely with our partner at the world bank and other multilateral development institution multilateral co operation allow global scale of investment and delivery that outstrip what country can achieve alone we be also look at other way include through the important work of british international investment and other body so we be go to look across the board and multilaterally to increase our impact the international development gender equality act say the government must have due regard to spend aid in way that contribute to gender equality follow on from the early question will the minister confirm that support woman and girl be ministerial priority and that we will continue fund vital programme that support woman and girl in many area it certainly be and woman and girl will remain at the heart of our programming can assure my hon friend that equality impact assessment be an essential part of how we make decision on oda allocation indeed minister chapman will be appear before the international development committee later today and think she will be set out our approach to the equality impact assessment and other process will the minister ensure that britain properly replenish gavi the vaccine alliance brilliant programme that have benefit so much from british leadership as well as taxpayer money when make his decision on how big that replenishment should be will he remember that the polling show that of our constituent think this be brilliant use of taxpayer money and that we should support it the right hon gentleman and have engage on these issue for long time and he know that recognise the importance of gavi work and that of other body such as the global fund we be proud to have support gavi to vaccinate over billion child save million life and generate billion in economic benefit we be consider our next investment as part of the spending review process and we look forward to the june event the reduction to will require painful decision but there be innovative financing mechanism on which britain could lead for example increase special drawing right use the exchange equalisation account guarantee and debt relief can the minister commit to work with the treasury to look at all these non oda instrument in which britain could show leadership and fund our development programme absolutely can make that commitment will not go into any individual item on my hon friend list of suggestion but as say in an early answer we be look at all measure by which we can support development and economic growth globally work with multilateral partner victory in europe day what step his department have take to commemorate victory in europe day be honour to attend the ve day military procession reception and service of remembrance alongside the prime minister and his majesty the king last week the event be fitting tribute to the hundred of thousand of man and woman who make the ultimate sacrifice during the second world war victory in europe celebration in suffolk coastal last week be poignant reminder of the need to continue to press for peace today both in ukraine and in secure an end to the war in palestine do the foreign secretary agree with that the lesson of world war two must not be forget as innocent civilian continue to face violence and warfare here in europe and in the middle east be grateful to my hon friend it be important to put on the record that the commonwealth play tremendous part in the second world war our european partner play an important part and europe benefit greatly from the sacrifice make to fight fascism wherever we see tyranny we must continue to stand up for the right of innocent people and be proud to spend the next day in lviv stand with those who be fight today the centenary of the second world war be way into the future but will the foreign secretary ensure that the uk do not repeat the mistake of the past when we be rather late come to the party with the international commemoration of the centenary of the great war will he say when we will engage with international partner to start prepare for the centenary of the second world war and will his department the cabinet office or the department for culture media and sport take the lead the right hon member ask an important question enter my year in parliament be not sure that will still be in

house that we recognise former civil servant but before we proceed to the next business would like to pay tribute to sir roy stone who die yesterday it feel far too soon give that he only retire from his role as principal private secretary to the government chief whip in role he hold for more than year serve chief whips and in turn this office with great distinction work in no before he join the whips office roy serve every prime minister from margaret thatcher to boris johnson he be virtually invisible outside this place but those who be involve in this tricky business of keep the parliamentary machinery run smoothly all know he well roy be despite the sometimes fearsome reputation of the whips office kind and generous man loyal to his principle as well as to his political master he be highly respected and hold in great affection by those in the civil service and with whom he work closely there be many member and staff in all part of both houses who work with he and benefit from his advice and guidance know that they will be deeply sadden by this news as we know the usual channel be not something we ever discuss that just show the great man we be talk about be sure the whole house will wish to join in send our condolence to roy family his wife dawn daughter hannah and son elliott on point of order mr speaker it be by convention unusual for the government chief whip to address the house it be also by convention forbid to refer by name to those who hold the office of principal private secretary to the government chief whip it be measure of sir roy service that today we lie those convention aside sir roy be the literal embodiment of the usual channel for more than two decade ensure each day that while the government get their business the opposition be able to scrutinise their work as look back on what be on occasion tumultuous time in this place sir roy be with skill and integrity the constant that hold thing together trust be place in he and his wise counsel be seek over many year send my deep condolence on behalf of the government to his family friend and the many staff who work with he such be sir roy stone diligence and long service that one could be forgive for think that work be his main concern but know from speak to he that his main priority be always his family of whom he be tremendously proud they should be equally proud of he my thought be with they at this difficult time call the shadow leader of the house far to that point of order mr speaker you have say much that be true and good and it be hard to improve on what you say as well as the chief whip but may add few word roy stone go into the civil service at the age of and serve his entire life there and in this house twelve chief whips across extraordinary moment be the beneficiary of his sage counsel and advice think the house will be aware that there be several occasion on which be able to benefit from his advice in somewhat tumultuous time have offend various senior politician do not always get meeting with the chief whip with coffee as hon member know that be the key test but sir roy and his team be the model of professional expertise diligence discretion care and candid advice throughout the fact that he have be take from we so quickly so prematurely and so early into his long deserve retirement be be sure source of the utmost sadness for every member of this house be sure that speak for all member of his majesty opposition we will remember he with great fondness for very long time call the liberal democrat spokesperson far to that point of order mr speaker have to admit to shed tear last night when hear the news of sir roy pass within nine month of join the house in become the chief whip of small group of and he treat and my party with the utmost respect he be the first person to refer to as my family have not pick up that term which show the respect he have for the house mps and the party they represent value his counsel we sometimes take the daily business for grant but it be testament to the work of the usual channel and the government whips office that we end up with the business and debate we have in this place my right hon friend the member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael be sit with when sir roy leave his role and the house in we take he for dinner at the liberal club will just say that the club standard of service be exactly what my right hon friend and expect they to be will say no more on that sir roy be the epitome of the good of the civil service we have good conversation but it be fair to say that no confidence be betray be very sadden to hear of his loss my thought and my party thought be with his family far to that point of order mr speaker in his role in the usual channel sir roy stone have unique influence in this place as we have hear work for decade for the government chief whip and the leader of the opposition provide advice to both and protect the confidence of both but answer honestly to each those in the usual channel hold the only role in government that mean work for both the government and the opposition roy manage the whips offices for both the british public see adversarial politic and party in this chamber but for decade roy and his team organise and co ordinate legislation debate recess statement and urgent question and manage the relationship between the party woe betide any chief whip who try to change roy recess schedule which be almost always in tandem with the kent school holiday break every political science course in the country should have dedicate module on the usual channel and sir roy stone roy dominance of this behind the scene role make he one of the most impactful and consequential civil servant of his time despite be fair to all side he be political to his core not least during the hung parliament and brexit during that time he be passionate about and focus on support the government to deliver on the referendum and be increasingly frustrated with we politician and in particular for fail to deliver meaningful vote roy love his central role in this place and have the respect if not always the agreement of everyone politician and civil servant alike despite all the stress and strain in that most demanding period of parliamentary history which be when work with he what shine out be the love for and commitment to his family his brother who be ill with cancer during the brexit year and his wife dawn and child hannah and elliott in particular there be pride in elliott commitment to the raf in which he be cadet and of which he be now full time member patriot at work patriot at home rest in peace sir roy stone far to that point of order mr speaker roy be political to his core he love this place more than anyone could possibly imagine he regularly get quite frustrated with government and prime ministers will always remember arrive at the office on my first day as chief whip and see his look of frustration and irritation which say who on earth have they send now he never be in the whips office remember roy sit down and explain that he work for of the time and for the opposition the other want he to shift the dial little more in my favour but he be never go to do that ask he rather naively what should read and whether it be worth pick up erskine may he look at and say chief only strange people and clerk read erskine may yet there be not page in erskine may that he do not know roy start as an apprentice in the ministry of defence work his way through to no downing street and get briefing ready for prime ministers and then go into the whips office all that equip he to understand raw politic as anyone who have be chief whip will know it be deputy not chief whips who whip their party chief whips have to manage the prime minister and the cabinet they be there to save the government from do incredibly stupid thing to themselves every single day or that be the case in my day have feeling that might not have change that much would sometimes come into the office and roy eye would roll he have hear the news about the late decision emanating from no yet he would always sit down talk through the problem and give solution potential way out of the awful mess that you find yourself in particularly recall the day after the general election for those who be not here it have not go quite as well as we have hop arrive at the beautiful chief whips office in downing street and roy who be as good with his anglo saxon word as any man will not say the word he use but it rhyme with well you cluck screw that one up do you what be you go to do at the time the prime minister be in shock and not really do an awful lot and it fall to the whips office to work out how we take thing forward sit down with roy to work thing out be essential to our put together deal with the democratic unionist party deal that make sure that the right hon member for islington north jeremy corbyn do not have the opportunity to form government in or since roy live and breathe politic but also care about nothing more than his family would hear he talk with such pride about his daughter at university and about his son whom he take to countless event relate to swimming and then to the raf altogether roy be good friend just few week ago be sit down with he have cup of coffee and talk about his family we talk about the difficult time but also the amazing time he will be so miss far to that point of order mr speaker want to pass on the sincere condolence of the scottish national party to the family and friend of roy stone and really hope that they take comfort from today proceeding we speak of roy in such term not just because we respect he but because we like he he be likeable guy who be great company and such fun to be with will never forget the kindness that roy show as new member of this house and as recently instal chief whip who do not have clue about house business or procedure he patiently run through how the house work get lesson from roy stone on parliamentary procedure be something that will never forget be represent group of five and roy have time for we all the snp finally get access to the usual channel when we become the third party in the house and be able to observe how effectively he do his work will never be in government unlike other who be pay tribute today but see how seamlessly roy be able to serve government of different hue and how the ship of state sail on under his stewardship and command roy be the absolute epitome of public service and commitment to this house which he love and we will all miss he dearly far to that point of order mr speaker thank you for allow this quite exceptional but fitting tribute which be sure will give some comfort to sir roy wife dawn and his child hannah and elliott it be my privilege to work with sir roy during the first three and half year of the coalition government coalition government have never be do in this country in modern peacetime the coalition require service to not one party but two in government and for sir roy it be time of change and challenge but they be all challenge that he take impeccably in his stride there be many anecdote that could tell you mr speaker but unfortunately too many of those who be involve be still alive and there be limit to how far one can push parliamentary privilege the genius of sir roy stone be that he never betray any personal political view that be how he be able to serve government of all stripe the dignity of parliament and of the business of government really matter to he there be only one occasion when see sir roy mask slip it be the early day of the coalition government the liberal democrat whips office be in the business of babysitting and on this occasion it involve an actual baby it be not the normal babysitting that the whips office be call on to do inevitably as happen with baby there be need for nappy to be change take the baby think it be jenny willott son toby into my office and have lay he on the sofa and be change his nappy when sir roy stone appear in the doorway one glimpse at his face tell that this scene realise his bad fear about have liberal democrats in government sir roy care about both government and parliament and be able to serve both require very distinctive and particular talent it be privilege to work with he and to have the benefit of those talent for those who mourn he especially his family the recognition of those talent should be an endure comfort far to that point of order mr speaker first know sir roy stone when become leader of my group after the general election he do in fact pass view on the chief whips of the time but think they be probably well keep to myself for now because some of they be in the chamber he be immensely supportive and as the leader of very small group learn so much from he it be the first time that the group have have meeting with the chief whip speak on behalf of small party and sir roy respect for parliament and for the presence of small party in it be evident he feel that we have role to play and he enable we to play that role very effectively my last memory of sir roy be from just after he leave member of staff fflur elin could play the harp sir roy find that out and nothing would do but for fflur to bring in say harp to play for he it have be an honour to know he and people recollection of he today tell that he have immense influence on all of we here far to that point of order mr speaker on behalf of the democratic unionist party want to convey to the family of sir roy stone our deep condolence at this time of tragedy and grief to serve under number of prime ministers and chief whips be no easy task but he be always fair and impartial he contribute loyally and with great wisdom would not like to say anything against any of the chief whips in my party but have probably challenge they all and to be perfectly honest probably still do sir roy advice be much seek after and liberally give he set standard for other to follow and to admire from distance it be always good to cite the bible at these time he have run the race he have fight the good fight and there be many crown lay up for he in heaven thank you sir roy and god bless all the family at this time these really have be fitting tribute to sir roy stone he will always be in our thought and memory because of what he do for this house know that the clerks feel the same way mansion house accord urgent question to ask the chancellor of the exchequer if she will make statement on the mansion house accord mr speaker would like to associate myself with your tribute and those of other member to sir roy stone who be true public servant and servant of this house pension matter they underpin not just the retirement that we all look forward to but the investment on which our future prosperity depend this morning workplace pension scheme provider between they manage about of active saver define contribution pension sign the mansion house accord the accord be propose and develop by the industry specifically by the lord mayor the pensions and lifetime savings association and the association of british insurers and build on the work of the former chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt who be in his place signatory to the accord have pledge to invest of their main default fund in private asset by these be productive asset that boost the economy such as infrastructure at least will be for uk asset this investment could support well outcome for saver and deliver growth finance to britain world lead science and technology business it could also support clean energy development across the country deliver great energy security and job the shift towards great investment in private asset be journey that the sector be already on because everyone recognise that uk define contribution scheme stand out relative to their international peer for how little they invest in those area this be right for saver because it be in their interest for pension fund to hold diverse range of asset and it be in britain interest this government want to see high investment level in the uk we can not continue with the low business investment in the as we manage under the previous administration supply of capital be part of that and today agreement be expect to release billion of additional investment into the uk economy by but so be the supply of project to invest in the pipeline our job as government be to support the depth and visibility of that pipeline and that be why we be get this country build once again the accord be an industry lead agreement nevertheless hugely welcome it the pension industry decision to invest in more productive asset from grow company to infrastructure will support well outcome for saver and fast growth for britain in the come week the government will publish the conclusion of the pension investment review to support the move to big and well pension scheme we will implement the review reform and other to improve return for saver in the forthcoming pension scheme bill which look forward to present to the house may start by associate myself with the very fine tribute make to sir roy stone my condolence go to his family no response from the chancellor we see but thank the minister for his statement the retirement income of million of uk saver rely on the careful management of pension fund those pension provider have fiduciary duty to act in the good financial interest of their member we on the conservative benches support effort to ensure pension fund be invest in asset that can both increase uk productivity and growth and deliver strong stable return for investor and saver indeed that be the purpose of the first mansion house compact which be broker by the last conservative government as we well know labour ministers have habit of think they know well what to do with other people money but it should ultimately be the responsibility of the provider which have be entrust by saver with their money to make investment decision report that the government intend to take new power to mandate pension fund to allocate minimum amount to specific class of asset should be matter of great concern to this house can the minister confirm whether the government intend to take such legislative power in the pension bill later this year if he can not rule out make such move can he explain what it would mean for the exist fiduciary duty set out in legislation major player in the industry include scottish widows have reportedly refuse to take part in the late iteration of the mansion house compact can the hon gentleman explain to the house why that be what discussion he and other ministers have have with scottish widow and other that have choose not to take part and what concern they have raise let be clear we on the conservative benches want pension industry that be invest in grow uk business infrastructure housing and all those element that drive healthy economy but it also have to be for the benefit of saver of course the risk in this case would be bear entirely by private sector worker while public sector worker would be protect finally we be clear that pension saving should never be there to dig chancellor out of the economic hole that she have make will directly address two question and then come to the overall tone of the shadow chancellor remark there have be debate across this house and in the wide industry about mandation include on uk equity it have be lead by conservative peer in the house of lords baroness altmann have call for exactly that and by some member in this house include the right hon member for salisbury john glen on the conservative benches what we be set out voluntary agreement lead by the industry on the industry consensus behind the accord of the define contribution industry by active saver have sign up this morning and all provider include those that do not sign up today be commit to the idea of more investment in private asset more generally the shadow chancellor tone be disappointing the truth be that he be lonely figure there be wide consensus about the direction of travel to invest more in private asset as canadian and australian pension fund do and today accord be industry lead it set benchmark agree by the industry and in fact many industry player want to go far there should be cross party consensus at the event this morning the chancellor spell out that this work build on the work of her predecessor in support the mansion house compact the shadow chancellor will remember that compact because it be sign under conservative government when he be the work and pensions secretary he be in the press release champion it he be right then and he be let himself down now have some news response to the accord have just come in from guy opperman hon member will remember he because he be the conservative former member for hexham and the only pensions minister in the last government to last more than five minute he be in post for five year what do he say about this morning accord he say that it be good thing and should be be not wrong call the chair of the select committee draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as trustee of the parliamentary contributory pension fund the point about fiduciary duty have be make give that fund manager will need time to pool together fund that reflect the government wish and the voluntary accord when do the minister expect it to kick in at that point might he consider mandation the decision by the industry reflect the question that the chair of the select committee raise about pace of change be that the target for asset allocation be for call the liberal democrat spokesperson liberal democrats cautiously welcome the response from the minister clearly ensure that people have good return on their investment be essential but we welcome this step change where we be look at investment within the united kingdom within the appropriate parameter would the minister unpick for we what core lesson he have learn from australia and canada which have already embark on this path also it have long be long term investment opportunity for many in the pension industry to invest in rental opportunity how can we drive the opportunity in the social rent sector through the accord finally the minister rightly talk about pipeline of opportunity our fear be that these might only be large opportunity such as the redevelopment of an airport when many of our community be worry by the collapse of our town centre there could be bucket of opportunity highlight there which could be drive by appropriate investment through source like this it be characteristically bold of the liberal democrats to cautiously welcome these measure however the hon member be right to raise the question of australia and canada we look across at place with similar pension scheme to those in the uk and the level of private asset allocation in those scheme be far high than we see here in the uk so he be absolutely right on that front on the two specific point the hon member raise agree on investment in the social rent sector many of our pension fund be already do that and know that other major one will be make announcement in that area in the month ahead he also raise the breadth of investment opportunity he be absolutely right that there be large national level project but there be also many more local project where those be finance by the private sector pension scheme may want to look at they as well will the minister spell out how this deal provide real change for constituent across the country and what it mean for infrastructure project especially housing my hon friend be absolutely right there be no way that britain can return to growth unless it start invest in its future again rather than live in its past which be if we be honest what we have be do in recent year this be part of much wide story hope that there be cross party consensus there be certainly consensus across the pension industry and among most economist who look at the uk economy that we need to move to high investment level the finance for that be one thing some come from abroad and some come in domestically but it also need to come from our pension scheme obviously it be for the public sector to play its part but we should be careful in distinguish this the government be do our bit on public investment level with billion extra of public investment compare with the plan inherit from the conservative government that be do lot of the work to move we to the high investment equilibrium but there be lot of project and in the end most investment happen in the private sector that be where welcome the progress make by the pension industry today thank the minister for build on the work of the mansion house reform that introduce two year ago westminster work well when government do not automatically tear up the work of their predecessor who know with this constructive attitude we may see some tax cut in the autumn budget do the minister agree that there be circularity in the argument that the reason pension fund do not invest in the uk be because return be low here in australia and america the stock market can depend on more than of pension fund asset invest domestically to create big return compare with just in the uk do he agree that if we be really to make these reform fly we will need to involve the define benefit scheme as well as the define contribution scheme that be more like it that be what we want to hear from the conservatives the right hon gentleman rightly say that progress be make under the previous administration have make that clear and the chancellor make that very clear this morning as say have discuss with many lead member of the pension industry the fact that we be explicitly build on the progress that the right hon gentleman make rather than throw any baby out with the bathwater even after they have have their nappy change by the previous lib dem chief whip the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael very grateful to the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt for the tone of his question he be also right to highlight the lack of uk bias in some of our pension scheme we see that right across asset class and it be not in the interest of the country in the long term as he know the focus today be on private asset but we do need to think more broadly what be we all after we be after well function capital market both public and private and these reform will make big difference in that regard be not say that there be not more to be do be sure that there be and that he will continue to play an active part in those debate the science innovation and technology committee inquiry into the innovation and growth of the region have repeatedly hear evidence that the lack of access to investment particularly outside london and the south east be barrier to scale up our fantastic science and tech start up so welcome the commitment to put more of our pension and saving into the productive economy and be rather surprised by the response of the shadow chancellor will the minister say little more about how these commitment will support growth through innovation my hon friend be absolutely right she have long talk about both the issue that she raise the regional balance of investment and the ability of grow firm to get hold of growth finance the latter be long stand problem in the uk economy and today accord will help to address it although we talk about private asset and investment help with infrastructure it be also about provide growth capital to wide range of firm obviously the onus be on we and private asset manager to provide way for pension fund to direct capital those be often small ticket item and pension fund will need they to be aggregate up to high level that be exactly the work of the british business bank which know she have engage with through the select committee on both point she be right undoubtedly the city of london be not in the good possible place when it come to where it be invest and the amount invest in uk equity when be minister we have the hill review the kent review the austin review and the capital market review everything be do to seek to open up the city to more initial public offering and more momentum this systemic undervaluing of uk equity and therefore the lack of investment in they need to be set alongside the fact that billion of pound of taxpayer money be use to enrich the size of pension scheme through tax relief urge the minister to continue engage with the city welcome the voluntary commitment give but we must come to the point where the risk aversion of db scheme be call out consider the amount of taxpayer money that be effectively go into they will the minister continue to look carefully at the option available give that the previous government seek and his government will no doubt continue to seek to meet they wherever possible always enjoy discuss these thing with the right hon member as we have do over recent month he offer recognition of the challenge face the country and in focus on what we can do to start change thing he take much well position than that adopt by his front benchers recognise the right hon member point about risk aversion there be need for more innovation in our pension landscape more generally that be one of the area in which be glad to see progress take slightly more positive view than he do on the consensus that thing need to change we be see that in the pension industry more generally partly in relation to invest in wide range of asset as well as in embrace the agenda that we be set out for small number of big pension fund that be able to take different kind of risk the right hon member ask specifically about public equity my view be that the accord from the industry today will support that by fund pipeline of company that can grow to the level at which they can list publicly also private asset will include private share include the alternative investment market and other think the picture be slightly more positive than the one he paint but be not hide from the wide question he raise about capital market the uk government the chancellor and my colleague the city minister be focus on that he will have hear their word on isa reform and the rest of it look forward to further conversation on that how will my hon friend bring together uk pension scheme and local and regional government in order to invest in local infrastructure project give that european and global pension scheme invest when uk pension scheme too often do not my hon friend ask great and important question we will have more to say on this in the month ahead as we come forward with the final report of the pension investment review and the pension scheme bill some local government pension scheme have track record of invest locally but we need to see that at scale and we need to see it crowd in private investment include perhaps from private pension fund that be exactly what our package of reform combine with the industry work with the accord today will help we to deliver he be absolutely right to push we on that as be sure he will continue to do in the month ahead give his record in previous role we want high investment level not just in some part but in all part of the country over the past year the dow jones have grow by the german dax by and the nikkei by while the ftse have grow by it be against that backdrop that there be concern about investment in the united kingdom as other member have say give the fiduciary duty on asset manager would they not be invest in the uk anyway if they think that they be go to get the good return for their policyholder if they be not already do so what have change to ensure that that fiduciary duty be uphold as asset manager be coerce by the chancellor to invest in market that they would not otherwise have invest in clearly the hon member have not even read the accord it talk about private asset interruption no the accord be about private asset while he mention public asset he also adopt the very market fundamentalist view that there be no role for government at all which be odd give what hear he talk about in the chamber day in day out lastly he also adopt extreme pessimism about the future of the country be much more positive about britain than he be that be not surprising because his job be to pull it apart in its first six month the national wealth fund base in leeds have fuel almost job and unlock billion of private investment can the minister confirm that this deal will equal more investment in british business my hon friend be powerful advocate for leeds and for britain every single week in this chamber and everything she say be completely right the job of the national wealth fund and the british business bank be to work with our nation and region to ensure that project can be de risk and support and that wide range of private investor can come in behind that and make sure change actually happen so that this become country that invest in its future once again at time when we have be commemorate significant anniversary of ve day do the minister share my concern that certain large pension firm be refuse to invest in profitable defence industry on spurious ethical ground be that something that his pension investment review might care to investigate hear the point the right hon gentleman raise and we have have those debate in this chamber in recent month the uk government be do what they need to do to invest in our security and defence and to support our defence industry more generally we have make it very clear that private investment in those sector be the right thing to do for our national security and our national economic growth so far today there have be call for mandation and call to oppose any mandation there be choice available within pension fund for saver the vast majority of fund think it be within the national employment savings trust for example invest in the broad default and do invest in the like of defence company warmly welcome the statement one of the most woeful thing about our national story have be the lack of investment in infrastructure but that story be not just about gdp and productivity at national level it be also about place in peterborough the lack of investment over the last decade have be woeful know that the public sector can not do it all itself while put on record my thank to the department for transport for this week announce business case approval and funding for our station regeneration project can the minister explain how this policy will help investment in place like mine do it truly meet the definition of far and fast be sure that ministers in the department for transport will have hear my hon friend word and that his butter up will have the desire effect over the year to come he be right to highlight the synergy between public and private investment we need to see high level of public investment which be why this government be put in place billion over these five year that be be do because it will deliver real tangible progress that people can see in their street why do people think britain go backward over the last year there be lot of reason but high up the list be visible pothole on every single road in britain we be turn that around as we speak that wide investment also give confidence to the private sector and we see that across the piece wherever we be deliver regeneration project with public sector investment support they it crowd in private investment in exactly the way my hon friend set out before be elect to this place be trustee of one of the large public pension fund and lot of the correspondence receive be from retired social worker who be quite grumpy about their fund be invest in extractive industry company list in london we know that more young people will opt in to invest if they be comfortable with what their pension fund be invest in what more can the government do to engage with the industry but also with young saver to ensure there be pension option that reflect their investment preference the hon lady be right to say that we see high engagement level among young people today in invest more broadly whenever go into school sixth form surprising volume of the question be not unfortunately for on what the government be do and how we will bring inequality down and get growth up but be instead how do we make lot of money quite quickly we should support that level of engagement and active investment on the hon lady specific point scheme be require to set out their policy and approach and many pension scheme provide member with option for how they wish their fund to be invest nothing that have be set out today on the accord get in the way of those approach that be already in place warmly welcome the mansion house accord and the minister statement during the last parliament have the pleasure of take part in cross party visit with the then hon member for hexham to see solar farm that be fund by pension investment it be wonderful scheme close to the and my constituency could the minister say little more about how this announcement will support much broad investment in the green transition both in the south of england and across the country have benefit from conversation with my hon friend about this topic give his previous experience he be completely right to set out that one of the large reason although not the only one why we need to move to be high investment country be that our energy infrastructure have to be upgrade and fast if we be go to give this country the energy security it need he mention solar this government sign off in matter of day and week string of solar farm that need to be invest in and that have be sit on ministers desk for year after year more broadly when the leader of the opposition stand up and say we do want to see this progress on net zero what she be really do be put up sign across britain say close for business some define benefit scheme have trillion worth of asset the trouble be that the regulatory environment be skew toward buy an insurance policy at the end of that journey in order to change the way in which trustee and fund manager invest the minister have to change the end state what discussion have he have with the pensions regulator and the association of british insurers about change that particular game we have discuss some of these issue in the past and look forward to the conversation that be sure we will have in future not least around the pension scheme bill it be true that for many in the industry buy out of their define benefit scheme be the end point they be look to reach and the number that can reach that point have rise significantly in the recent past as more scheme have move into surplus our job be to provide range of option for those db scheme we have discuss the superfund regime that we will bring forward regulation on through the pension scheme bill we have also talk in the last few month about the role of surplus release which can benefit both employer who want to make investment but also scheme member the hon gentleman be right to highlight that there be range of option available to scheme and they can take the one that be in the good interest of their member the mansion house accord be clearly welcome step in align the uk pool of domestic pension capital with long term growth great economic sovereignty and financial security in retirement for this to succeed we need great clarity in who be step up so can the minister update the house on what discussion he be have with the industry about how firm intend to report progress under the accord in clear and transparent way my hon friend be completely right but would use slightly more optimistic tone it be now the settle consensus of the entire define contribution industry that this be the direction we need to move in almost every single scheme be move to think about how they will invest in wide range of private asset many of they be look to go far than the benchmark set out in the accord today they want to do that because it be in their saver interest it diversify their asset and over the long term lead to high return on average the exact amount of those return will obviously depend but study show that it range from to high return it be absolutely in saver interest and think there be broad consensus about do that my hon friend be also right to say that we need to make sure that change happen we will come forward in the pension scheme bill with more detail about how these development will be monitor to make sure that change be deliver because in the end what the british people want to see be less talk about this and more actual investment pension fund be by definition long term capital and be therefore particularly well suited to be invest in long term infrastructure british pension fund invest in british infrastructure should be welcome by we all but would caution against any specific mandating within sector which fear may lead to low performance the thing about private market be that they have almost no transparency in term of valuation and liquidity urge the government to encourage the pension fund voluntarily to be more open about how they value these private investment to ensure great confidence thank the hon member for what think be his support for the accord indicate assent he be nod so will take that as support he will worry that he sound dangerously like liberal democrat when he sit on the fence as much as he just do at least the shadow chancellor have the gut to say he oppose it because he think that that be simple politic to get he through the day be glad to see that the hon member have not learn enough and hope he enjoy the fence sit while it last the hon member be right to say that scheme will want to be transparent about their asset allocation partly so that saver can see what be go on but also to refer back to the question from my hon friend the member for buckingham and bletchley callum anderson so that the country as whole can see that progress be be make it be disappointing but unsurprising response from the conservative front bench and similarly from the snp to talk our country down congratulate those in the city on this announcement which will mean new funding for company across the uk drive growth will the minister set out what this mean for constituent such as mine in central ayrshire and across scotland that be characteristically punchy and accurate contribution by my hon friend and that be the difference between this government and some of the opposition party we want to see britain succeed we be invest in britain success and in the long run it will be high investment high growth and high wage that will turn round the long year of stagnation the daily mail have say in its coverage of the accord today that industry leader have warn that the government must deliver pipeline of investment opportunity to meet the new target what faith can saver have that this government can deliver on that give that they tout gb energy as fantastic investment vehicle when in fact it be damp squib saver can have lot of confidence because the pipeline be already be deliver solar farm approve onshore wind happen after be ban for year under the conservatives the national grid actually be build out for once home be build right across this country and be oppose by conservative mp right across this country the pipeline be happen because this country be build once again welcome the agreement that have be reach today do the minister agree that the pension fund be able to make those ambitious commitment only because of the improved investment environment that this labour government be nurture through economic stability economic stability that be vital to protect work people include those in paisley and renfrewshire south exactly that be what be go on speak to pension fund every week who say they be look to increase their allocation of uk asset because political stability have be deliver because liz truss have be exit from this building speak to australian and canadian pension fund as well who be say that they want to open an office in the uk because political and economic stability have arrive increase investment in the united kingdom be always welcome will the minister confirm that this government will never interfere in the fiduciary duty of pension trustee to get the good return for their member the job of pension trustee be absolutely to deliver for their saver and the accord today be deliver exactly that make sure that we have diversity of asset allocation in our pension scheme so the answer to the hon member question be yes the shadow chancellor speak about public sector worker benefit from this kind of investment before come to the house be the chair of the cornwall local government pension scheme which very successfully invest in local and social impact investment in local renewable and local affordable housing will the minister ensure that more of that happen in the future thank my hon friend for her question we should focus on the accord today but the lgps be very important part of our pension landscape there be billion worth of asset under management rise to trillion worth over the next two decade it be right that we build on the lgps track record of local investment to make sure that we get the absolute good value for that investment both for taxpayer in local area and for local community that be exactly what our reform will do we will be come forward with the final detail in the pension investment review final report in the come week to make sure that we have big professional well govern and locally invest pension pool thank the minister for his positive answer to the question that have be pose from all part of the chamber today while it be encouraging to see workplace pension provider invest in private asset it be disappointing that scottish widows for example be refuse to sign up what far can be do to ensure that investment will be focus not simply on london firm as other have refer to but throughout the united kingdom include the tremendous potential in northern ireland some of the industry by active saver number have sign up to the accord today and the small number of large provider who have not sign up be supportive of the move towards great private investment there be very broad consensus across the industry that this be the right way to go unrelated to that but much more importantly the hon gentleman be absolutely right that we need to see that investment right across the country include in northern ireland and in his own constituency welcome the accord and the minister word people in dartford be await further news of funding package for the low thames crossing which the government consent recently and be incredibly welcome to resident there do the minister agree that this be just the sort of shovel ready infrastructure project which pension fund could invest in both for the benefit of their saver and to drive economic growth for constituent include my resident my hon friend be absolutely right the low thames crossing have be consent and it be another example of this government get on with get the country build again and when we come to the spending if be in the conservative party would not be talk about the low thames crossing really would not be the regime for plan that the conservatives put in place mean that hundred of million of pound have be take to build precisely diddly squat this government have give consent and we will be set out in the come month the provision for that scheme to go ahead congratulate my hon friend and treasury colleague on help to deliver such an important agreement the accord will unlock up to billion of additional capital it be huge vote of confidence in the government demand side reform agenda to get britain building and in our economic strategy provide stability what step will the government take to help make sure that investment be ramp up as quickly as possible and to ensure that regulator help encourage investment of pension fund directly in real economic asset for instance by look at change to the match adjustment thank my hon friend for his comment it be nice to hear the positivity come from he and other member in this house who believe that britain can do well than the last absolutely terrible year the investment we will be make deliver on the supply of capital with the like of the reform today while allow building for housing transport project and the rest be exactly what will make the difference in the long term innovation be one of britain great strength with fast grow firm drive over trillion into the uk economy and support million job however many of those firm many of which be base in my constituency still face stubborn barrier to scale up particularly around access long term finance how will the mansion house accord help channel great investment from pension fund into those scale up to help they grow innovation be one of the way in which we drive high productivity which be the only lasting way alongside high level of investment that we will see high wage for all of our constituent which be what everyone on both side of this house want my hon friend be absolutely right to say that there be long last barrier to scale up for our innovative company right across sector that point be raise early by the chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for hackney south and shoreditch dame meg hillier specifically we need our pension fund to invest in wide range of private asset and that will include through venture capital which be how we make sure that we provide that growth financing that we all need to see that be for the private sector to do as have be mention but it be our job to support that and that be what the british business bank draw on some of the work put in place by the previous government but now be scale up be seek to do point of order pm on point of order madam deputy speaker on march the foreign secretary say in relation to the conflict in gaza there be atrocity on both report march vol on march write to the attorney general ask how and when his majesty government arrive at that determination far ask the attorney general about the legal

that the matter be not down to the chair he will appreciate that mr speaker respect timely response to correspondence and request for answer to question from back benchers there be no doubt that not only have the hon member put his point on the record but those on the treasury front bench will relay that swiftly to the appropriate department slip road safety east ilsley and beedon motion for leave to bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to provide for review of the safety of the slip road at east ilsley and beedon and to require the publication

difference for our community question put and agree to order that mr lee dillon olly glover and olivia bailey present the bill olivia bailey accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday june and to be print bill opposition day allotted day uk eu summit inform the house that mr speaker have select amendment in the name of the prime minister beg to move that this house recognise that the conservative party stand by the result of the referendum to leave the european union eu call on the government to stand by that decision at the summit with the eu on may to put the national interest first and not to row back on brexit for example by re introduce free movement through eu youth mobility scheme accept compulsory asylum transfer create dynamic alignment between the uk and the eu by submit the uk to further oversight from the european court of justice or by join the eu carbon tax scheme which will lead to high energy bill further call on the government to stand by the will of the british people by ensure that no new money be pay to the eu that there be no reduction in uk fishing right that nato remain the foundation of european security and that the uk can continue to undertake strategic and defence agreement with non eu partner and also call on the government to put the negotiate outcome to vote in the house of commons it give enormous pleasure to open this debate on one of the subject that have be central to this house since be first elect in it be debate that be necessary this week because we know that next week the eu and this government be go to meet in london to discuss the next step in our arrangement before that agreement be reach it be important that this house receive some clarity on what this government be fight for what they stand for and what their red line be because even at this late stage this house be unaware of the government intention do not know whether you remember madam deputy speaker but there be very good tv programme in the call quantum leap in it an american scientist dr samuel member beckett stand correct and apologise to the house dr beckett step into the quantum leap accelerator and vanish and awake to find himself in strange new form that be not his own every time the prime minister speak think which body have he leapt into now be it the prime minister who spend his early life chastise all immigration law on the ground that it be racist or the prime minister who have new find love of strict immigration rule be it the prime minister who promise to protect winter fuel payment or the one who immediately cast they away be it the prime minister who promise to protect farmer but immediately do the opposite the prime minister who say he know what woman be but then change his mind or the prime minister who say he would not put taxis on work people but then promptly do the prime minister do not know what he stand for or which way he look and that be very difficult thing in negotiation our position be simple there can be no go back the conservative party fight long and hard to take control of our law our border and our money and with those power we succeed in secure new trade deal and the fast vaccine roll out in europe the naysayer gloomster and dismal voice on the opposition benches say that it would come to nothing but in uk look forward to correct the hon member for cheltenham max wilkinson who chunter from sedentary position will the hon member give way no in uk international trade stand at just over trillion year but by it stand at trillion year all in spite of brexit our concern be that this government have prove themselves to be really terrible negotiator we have previously hear the administration talk about the need for ruthless pragmatism one can only wonder whether that be the same ruthless pragmatism that give we the chagos deal when be history teacher we use to say that the bad deal in history be the one that the lenape people of north east america do with the dutch settler as the house will recall they give away manhattan island for guilde and handful of bead but at least they get guilde and handful of bead they do not spend billion of their own money on give away their territory as this government have wonder whether it be the same ruthless pragmatism that immediately give out billion in above inflation pay rise to the unionised sector in return for nothing at all no agreement on productivity or reform be it the same ruthless pragmatism that give we the collapse of the million astrazeneca deal the botched steel mess that we all have to return during recess for or the miss opportunity of the us tariff arrangement the other day our concern of course be that this will happen again wish could say that be enjoy the hon gentleman speech but that would be stretch it bit too far do not know why he be present all these faux disagreement do he not appreciate that the government be as hard brexiteers as he be how much damage do this brexit have to do before both party decide that it be far too much and start to look at it seriously always have respect and time for the hon gentleman wisdom but feel must correct he the government be not hard brexiteers they be just brexiteers today tomorrow who know what we know be that they be against leave the eu and then they change their mind those people who change their mind on such fundamental issue may well change they back they may well turn on sixpence and do it again the fact of the matter be that the government have enter these negotiation with no clear objective and with red line so thin and wash out that they can be quickly discard however today be an opportunity for the labour party to come clean about what it want and what it be do because labour members will have to vote on our motion which set out our red line those red line be very clear and precise and in keep with the will of the british people the hon member talk about the official opposition motion be precise but that be factually incorrect in that the motion conflate freedom of movement with youth mobility if youth mobility be good enough for australia canada and uruguay it do not run against the red line regard freedom of movement do the hon member not understand that it be freedom of movement for young people be it not what we be ask for today be for the labour party to set out what its clear position be in moment will explain why that be very important the fact be that up until this point we have see chaos in these negotiation that will be easy for the labour party to understand because on february we hear the home secretary rule out youth mobility deal the government be not go to do it and be not look into it at the beginning of march though the postmaster general suggest in westminster hall debate that he be open to such deal but then on april the postmaster general rule it out again interruption mean the paymaster general would the right hon member for torfaen nick thomas symonds like to be postmaster general okay paymaster general it be he rule it out on april but then at the beginning of may he once again rule it in this do not end with the youth mobility scheme on january labour ministers rule out join the pan euro mediterranean area three day later the chancellor say that the government be look at it and then on february the government rule it out again the government do not know what they be do they do not know what they want to achieve have no objective and have very blur red line there be an emerge sense that this will be good deal good deal for the eu in which the balance of benefit will run against the uk despite the fact that the government do not wish to give run commentary they be content to give running commentary to the press it seem that the eu demand be be meet in this negotiation but because the uk have no demand its demand can not be meet the hon gentleman have refer to quantum leap the point about sam beckett be that he keep leap back into the past because he could not cope with the future that do seem rather apposite hope the hon gentleman agree with many labour members that one of the important thing about next monday be that we will be able to move forward on the security and defence partnership give the threat pose by president putin can the hon gentleman put aside his blindness to the benefit to this country of co operate with europe and at least agree that that partnership would be good thing to secure be glad to be the one to break it to the hon lady that we already co operate with europe on defence and have do so for very long time she will know that the cornerstone of our defence be and always have be since the second world war nato now be an apt moment to remember that because today be the anniversary of the first speech that sir winston churchill make as prime minister give from that dispatch box or rather from the dispatch box that be there before the chamber be bomb it be his blood toil tear and sweat speech it be obviously incredibly important that we co operate with our european partner on defence but that be why we do we spend of gdp on defence and the opposition would like to spend and more largely to help defend europe and we know of no reason because the government have not give one why nato be insufficient for that task british firm be call for co operation with our european ally so that there be investment in increase defence spending across europe include in my constituency what would the shadow minister say to they the government be call for security deal do he not agree that we need one with the eu would say that if the term of the deal be that the uk must pay to have access to that fund we must ask very serious question of our european ally about why we should have to contribute when we be already committed to their security if the government choose to go down that route it be for the government to explain why that should be the case the truth be that nato must continue to be the cornerstone of our defence but over the weekend there be report in the sunday times that the eu might be insert into our chain of command which would be very significant change absolute nonsense from sedentary position the paymaster general say that that be absolute nonsense be pleased to hear it but the right hon gentleman have not yet have an opportunity to tell the house that it be clear that someone in the government or within the eu be brief journalist over the weekend that this might be true interruption think the right hon gentleman need to take responsibility for his special adviser if there be to be defence pact it be for the government to explain why it would make we safe one thing puzzle slightly about the position take by the government which be bit like that on the chagos island we already own they but we enter negotiation to give they away and rent they back in this instance europe threaten we that we can not talk about other matter until we sign up to this defence deal but we already have defence deal and we already co operate we have build weapon with france sweden and various other country rather than what they would lose what be it that we gain my right hon friend have great deal of experience of these matter and he have make series of very important point but it be for the government to explain why this would be in the interest of the uk the summit be take place next week and so far the government have not do so give that the last government reduce our army to size not see since the napoleonic era we should take no lecture on defence from opposition members the people who will benefit from this be the defence contractor in my constituency who have be struggle to sell their component to the eu since brexit and have have to cancel contract which have be affect job all over the west midland when first arrive in the house the leader of the hon gentleman party be advocate leave nato and give up trident so will take no lecture from those on his side of the house my party be commit to defence spending and think that those defence contractor in his constituency would very much like to see conservative government spend some of that money in his patch would my hon friend care to disabuse labour members who seem to be under the impression that whatever amount we put in somehow our defence contractor in the uk will get more out of the fund than we be contribute the history of defence procurement in europe be that france and germany invariably make sure that they get more out of it than they put in and we be always the loser do not think we will suddenly become winner when we be not member of the eu my hon friend experience in these matter speak volume the truth be that we must be absolutely certain that this will not be just another scheme for funnel money into french defence company while keep it away from defence company in other jurisdiction do my hon friend share my hope that in next week negotiation the government will make it abundantly clear to our european partner that for decade this country contribution to our collective defence have be well above the level that our economy our population or our size would dictate and that europe have benefit from that while be in no way recommend trumpian approach to these matter it be nevertheless important for the government to make clear to our interlocutor the scale of our contribution to collective defence fully agree with my hon friend the fact be that the uk have make disproportionate but necessary contribution to european defence for many decade think that we be right to do so and would support our do so into the future but it be only right for our friend to recognise that contribution and to treat we not as an external power come to parlay but rather as close and long term friend whose loyalty have already be prove many time over it would also be good today to have clarification from the government of their position on eu lawmaking be lucky enough to have call with my friend sir william cash this morning it be an unusually brief call last only minute laughter sir bill put it very clearly to he say that in any new arrangement with the eu it be important for we to see no eu lawmaking no jurisdiction for the european court of justice and no attempt to reapply the principle of eu law in our court because one principle of our departure from the eu be that we would take back control of our money our border and our law the hon member be right to say that there must be no further surrender to eu law but in the same vein be there not need to recover the territorial integrity of the united kingdom represent part of the united kingdom where in area of law it be not this house but foreign parliament that make the law should the starting point of reset not be recover the integrity of this parliament in the territory of this united kingdom the hon gentleman have make very good point it be one that he have make often in the house and look forward to his make it to the minister in few moment time on the subject of fish we be clear about the fact that there should be no multi year deal because that would reduce the uk leverage in future negotiation with the eu we should have nautical mile of exclusive access that be what our fisherman want and it be what the conservative party support there should also be fair distribution of quota scheme and no trade barrier during dispute my right hon friend the member for louth and horncastle victoria atkins the shadow secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs have make the position very clear this be an opportunity to defend the uk fisherman and to build on the deal that we have previously from the brexit negotiation we should not be give up the freedom of our fisherman it be important to remember the history here there be no common fishery policy until the prospect of britain join the common market arise and then those country create one simply so that they could rip we off ai that the truth here be an opportunity for the government to give guarantee and security to our fisherman the hon member be talk about fishing right under his government the uk catch suddenly drop by will he now apologise for the damage that he and his party do to the uk fishing industry we be the party that take fisherman out of the common fishery policy which be something that fishing community want we very much hope that this government will not concede the right that be hard win in those negotiation wonder whether the shadow minister have quantum leapt into body in which brexit have be huge success could he say either way if the hon gentleman have hear my opening remark he would have hear that in the volume of uk trade be just over trillion by despite brexit that have go up to trillion sometimes the people who be on the other side of the argument many of whom have understandable concern we be make big constitutional change that have not be make in over year seem trap in the past like dr samuel beckett and unable to realise that there have be significant improvement in the uk trading position because of the freedom that we acquire and because of the trade deal that the previous government bring in if the hon gentleman wish to change his altered reality there will be an audience for it in this house on the emission trading scheme we know that carbon price be high in the eu than they be in the uk there be great concern among certain industry that if as have be trail in the press the government be plan to sign we up to the eu emission trading system there will be heavy price to pay particularly in the ceramics industry two week ago we see ceramics factory in stoke on trent close cite high energy price under this labour government sadly high energy price be result of the policy of the hon gentleman government who have four industrial strategy all of which promise significant help for the ceramics sector and it never materialise one of the big problem for the ceramics sector be ensure that the european union food contact regulation which it have to comply with to sell its ware match the british system if he be in power today what would he do to ensure that our trading arrangement allow for free trade of the good that my city make and sell into europe well it will be irrelevant if all the business shut down because of high energy price the hon gentleman can talk about the previous administration but it be his party that promise to cut energy bill by instead they continue to go up and the market expectation be that energy price will continue to rise under this government that would be very bad for ceramic factory such as the one in his constituency there be range of other thing that we could go into if there be go to be negotiation with the eu there be plenty of thing that might be raise but we do not know whether the government have raise they they include the arrangement with france on illegal migration mutual recognition of food standard conformity certification touring musician rule of origin and so on the point be that the government have not tell we whether they want these thing whether they be pursue they and whether it be negotiate they on our behalf we on this side of the house be clear follow the referendum this country turn page and it be very important that the labour party do not turn it back the fact be that we be on the brink of witness yet another disastrous labour deal we know that when labour negotiate britain lose to leave the house in no doubt if and when my party be back in power we will reverse any handover of power any imposition of eu law any new right for the ecj and any new budgetary commitment it be my party that take the country out of the eu and it be my party that will keep it out commend this motion to the house beg to move an amendment to leave out from house to end and insert note the overwhelming mandate on which the government be elect which include reset the united kingdom relationship with the european union to deepen tie with its european friend neighbour and ally welcome the government commitment only to agree deal that be in the uk national interest and be in line with the manifesto on which the government be elect support the government commitment to agree new and ambitious security agreement between the uk and the eu to help tackle common threat whilst note that nato be the cornerstone of the uk defence recognise the government ambition to negotiate sanitary and phytosanitary and veterinary agreement to address the cost of food and to tackle range of other issue to reduce barrier to trade and far support improvement to the uk eu relationship that be aim at make the uk safe more secure and more prosperous in line with the prime minister plan for change first of all should say what pleasure it always be to debate with the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart who be across the dispatch box from discussion with the eu be ongoing and be sure that member from across the house will understand that can not this afternoon pre empt what will be unveil at next week summit we will not provide running commentary on negotiation nor would this house expect we to however after the summit have conclude we will take the early possible opportunity to update parliament on what have be deliver and on the impact that any measure will have will focus my remark on how this government be improve the life of work people and make the people of the uk safe more secure and more prosperous and be grateful to the opposition for give we the opportunity to talk about that we have hear from the opposition today and from the leader of the opposition in recent day that the only thing that have be surrender be the credibility of the conservative party as party of opposition let alone party of government the only quantum leap make be by the conservative party which have go from government to irrelevance start so well do it the leader of the opposition be turn over new leaf and take responsibility for her mistake she say of the previous government we be make announcement without proper plan we announce that we would leave the european union before we have plan for growth outside the eu however with negotiation ongoing today the conservatives be rehash the argument of the past there be no analysis of where the united kingdom interest lie in the the conservatives simply do not believe in britain ability to win perhaps that be no surprise give the year of failure that they deliver for our country this government be elect in july on mandate to deliver change for work people and we be deliver on the promise of our manifesto if the hon member for brentwood and ongar do not know about the objective of the negotiation suggest that he read the manifesto manifesto that deliver labour members of parliament as the public overwhelmingly reject the conservative party may point out that the conservative motion say that the conservatives stand by the result of the referendum but the labour amendment do not say the same of the labour party be the right hon gentleman say that one term mandate in one election trump referendum result or do he respect the referendum result of absolutely respect the referendum result if the hon gentleman bother to read our manifesto he would discover that there be red line we will not go back to the single market the custom union or freedom of movement let say to the conservative party that deliver on our manifesto promise will unlock huge benefit for the united kingdom reduce barrier to trade and accelerate economic growth in an uncertain world it will keep we safe more secure and more prosperous that be what this government be work towards the minister have refer to the labour manifesto several time in few minute do it say anything at all about accept dynamic alignment or become rule taker yes or no the objective of negotiate sanitary and phytosanitary veterinary agreement so that agricultural product food and drink can be trade more cheaply between the uk and the eu be in the labour manifesto and we have mandate for that the government will put more money in the pocket of work people and create great long term stability and security for the british people apparently the opposition be against that and so hear be reform to be fair the hon member for clacton nigel farage say that he think the current deal with the eu can be improve but he have never tell we exactly how and we wait to find out since last july this government have be get on with the job of reset our relationship with the european union in number of important area right now the young people of this country be confine to this island and can not live work or move freely across the continent there be discussion about youth mobility scheme will the minister commit himself to secure mobility scheme for the young people of this country would not describe the hon gentleman as be confine to any island have already speak about smart control youth mobility scheme the previous government agree number of they this government be exercise diplomacy in our national interest we need only take one look at the trade deal that we have sign with the united states hon member india in the last fortnight to see that we be deliver for the british people conservative front benchers shout from sedentaryposition about the us deal but they can tell that to the worker at jaguar land rover whose job have be save by the deal can tell the hon member for perth and kinross shire pete wishart that be in scotland yesterday to talk to the scotch whisky association about the enormous benefit for scotland of the india deal he should welcome that deal not criticise the government britain be back on the world stage no thank to the carping from the opposition will the minister give way on the point about carp from the opposition will the minister mention that he be in scotland yesterday which be wonderful as scottish mp be in scotland every week and quite often meet people from distillery who have recently say that they be suffer because of the family farm tax that the government have bring in their farmer be downsize and not invest which be reduce their supply of grain be the minister and the government proud of that legacy and that contribution to the scotch whisky association be very proud of the extra billion that we have put into the national health service apparently the ludicrous position of the opposition be that they be in favour of the investment but they will not tell we exactly how they would raise the money put it to the opposition be there any country they actually want british business to trade with in government the conservatives promise trade deal with india by diwali to be fair they do not say which diwali but they deliver absolutely nothing for the british people we secure an india trade deal and they complain about it we secure an economic deal with the united states long promise by the last government but never deliver and they do not like that like to be constructive so can make suggestion to the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith maybe he should change his title to shadow secretary of state for no business and no trade because when it come to the trade deal that we have negotiate that be the opposition position he have run business unlike you be self employ actually would be careful about make remark without know the fact while the opposition continue to turn inward on themselves this government will focus on delivery our priority be translate that strengthen relationship with the european union into long term uk eu strategic partnership that improve the life of work people and put more money in their pocket the minister will have hear what the shadow minister say about the conservatives pride in brexit it seem to that they be proud of the terrible brexit deal that they deliver and completely unable to bring forward any constructive idea they have manage to set out five red line but do the minister agree that the opposition have nothing to be proud of when it come to the botched brexit deal that they bring forward nothing to be proud of in make britons poorer and nothing to be proud of in make trade hard will he share with we some of the framework that he will be discuss conservative member sit there defend the status quo but if they bother to speak to any business trade internationally they would know that the status quo be not work for britain the minister have speak about uk deal with india and the united states and next tuesday there will be uk deal or reset with the european union where be northern ireland place in that when the hon and learn member for north antrim jim allister and have ask where the benefit be for northern ireland from the uk india and uk us trade deal we have have no answer from the government have visit belfast as minister more than once and have listen very carefully to business in northern ireland about their priority northern ireland have dual market access and be absolutely supportive of northern ireland take the great possible economic advantage of that on the windsor framework and the check at the border on the irish sea if we be able to secure sanitary and phytosanitary deal that will obviously reduce the necessity for check at that border which hope the hon gentleman would be able to support on safety the trade and co operation agreement agree by the conservatives leave gap in our ability to tackle crime and criminality and stop opportunity to work with european country on close the loophole allow illegal migration we have to improve on that on security which be raise by the hon member for brentwood and ongar we be respond to once in generation moment for the collective security of our continent through an ambitious uk eu security and defence relationship in the shadow of the anniversary of ve day which give we all powerful historical reminder in our constituency up and down the country secure our collective future be paramount remind the house that nato be the creation of that great post war labour government of clement attlee and ernest bevin it have be the bedrock of our security over three quarter of century after the treaty be sign and that will not change in fact new defence and security pact strengthen european security and strengthen nato and to suggest otherwise be irresponsible the united kingdom be rapidly increase defence spending and it be play leadership role on ukraine the only person who would benefit from talk of division across europe be vladimir putin on growth the government central mission be to slash red tape at the border make it easy for uk business to trade with the eu and to cut cost for business and consumer be so pleased that the minister be try to negotiate new sps deal and work to remove the red tape would he agree with that business in my constituency such as tri wall in monmouthshire be absolutely desperate to remove that red tape so they can increase export again as they do before the botched brexit deal my hon friend be absolutely right and business up and down the country will benefit from reduction in trade barrier the minister be make good case would he agree with that close uk eu defence tie do not diminish our role in nato but complement it especially at time when transatlantic security simply can not be take for grant would he also agree that secure access to programme such as the security action for europe fund would be win for british manufacturer and for our strategic capability the hon lady be absolutely right that that be in the uk interest and this would be the bad possible moment to start fragment defence across europe let just say that on the three pillar of this negotiation safety security and growth this government will deliver for our country future reduce the cost of live and create job the opposition motion be stick in the past everybody else have move on and frankly it be time for they to move on too the minister raise the important issue of the cost of living give the dire economic impact of brexit include food inflation be eight time high than it would otherwise have be and the cost of leave the european union amount to million an hour in accord to datum from the office for national statistics do he agree with that it make total economic sense for the uk and the people in it to use next week summit to start discussion with the eu on what the process of rejoin might be and the timing for report may vol correction we respect the result of the referendum what the hon lady be say on the cost of food be precisely what an sps agreement on agricultural product food and drink would seek to deal with would hope to see her party support that the conservative now seem to be the defender of the current status quo if they bother to speak to trader these day they would know that that status quo be not work in the interest of uk business big or small one member say that the exist trade deal be not very good one that be actually the hon member for clacton it be not often that agree with he but there we be as result of the previous government failure company have be endure significant delay at our border and have to fill out hundred of piece of paper just to be able to import or export to our near neighbour be very grateful to the minister for give way he be make an excellent speech like be sure he be concerned about small business that could particularly benefit from an agrifood deal would he like to say little bit more about the benefit for our small business my hon friend be absolutely right there will be particular benefit to small and medium sized business which simply have not have the capacity to deal with the additional red tape we have see in recent year rise rise rise will give way once more to the right hon member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes be immensely grateful to the right hon gentleman for give way the last time we exchange comment in the chamber think they be about asquith but can not match that today the right hon gentleman be make some sensible point about trust trader and ease barrier at the border but he will know when he speak of safety and security that our key security relationship be the five eyes relationship with america canada australia and new zealand of course we co operate with europe but any change to our relationship around security with europe would endanger the security of this country if we compromise that core relationship in particular give that those euro enthusiast on the continent have always want pan european army and pan european security policy will he talk bit about defence and defence procurement first of all there be absolutely no compromise on the core principle of our defence which we have have since nato be found in far from any weakening we be produce the opposite this would be the bad possible moment to fragment european defence that be not what this government be do dismiss any suggestion of european army in the way that think the right hon gentleman mean it this be crucial moment for our continent it be about leadership and peace on our continent and strengthen and complement nato absolutely not weaken it in any sense hope he will take that reassurance have to go back to the point about business because business themselves be speak out business such as marks and spencer have be up front about how real the challenge be its head of food say recently paperwork take hour to complete and demand detail as niche as the latin name for the chicken use in our chicken tikka masala it be not just all supermarket have say the same as recently report in the financial times just yesterday be in edinburgh hear from business about the difficulty they face difficulty that we could resolve with some ruthless pragmatism and well deal will the minister give way be go to make some progress meanwhile few week ago more than energy company and organisation highlight the need for close energy co operation with the eu to drive down cost and drive up investment all those be voice that conservative party of the past might have listen to but not it seem this lot on the opposition front bench there be an opportunity in front of we that the opposition do not even want to try to understand it will make difference to grow our economy boost our living standard and eradicate the barrier that limit trade with our single big trading partner today the consequence of the conservatives position today be that they be defend status quo that be fail business and fail work people their view let we be clear about this be that the trade barrier hold business back should stay in place that impact on the cost of live and on the number of job do the minister agree that at the heart of this debate be that this government be take proactive engagement with our near and large trading and security partner which be quantum leap from the fail position of sneer resentment from the conservative party my hon friend be absolutely right the situation now be quantum leap of improvement after what we see from the conservative government will the sps and energy deal that the minister have in mind be on the basis of mutual recognition of standard or do he envisage the united kingdom accept eu standard now be dynamically align and place ourselves under the jurisdiction of the european court just to be clear whether on energy an sps agreement or employment right this government be interested in race to the top not race to the bottom interruption opposition member feign interest in the detail of the deal next monday the leader of the opposition do not even want to look at it before she go out at the weekend and make her mind up about it that be not the behaviour of serious opposition party let alone party of government but that be where the conservatives be now very happy to carp on about what they be against not care about reduce bill not care about people pay check not care about people job and forever try not to spell out an alternative they have not listen and they certainly have not learn rise on the issue of learn and listening give way to the right hon member just want to check on something we can debate whether trade deal can be improve be sure that all trade deal can be improve whether it be the american one or what be an extensive one with europe and probably the great one negotiate in the past but one area as the government go back into this discussion need to be very clear be look at paper produce by the centre for european reform which make one point very clear as the government go into the negotiation it state labour red line do not extend to rule out dynamic alignment or role for the ecj in dispute settlement be that correct be that the position of the present labour government have to say have be for some year in this house with the right hon gentleman that never think would find he quote the centre for european reform in parliamentary debate but clearly someone on the opposition benches be move on even if those on the opposition front bench be not drive by our ruthlessly pragmatic approach next monday uk eu summit will be the first annual summit between the uk and the eu it will be day of delivery we be deliver on our manifesto not return to the custom union single market or freedom of movement or revisit the argument of rise on the subject of revisit the argument of give way to the hon member can understand why the right hon member do not want to answer the two question from the opposition on dynamic alignment but surely give third opportunity he will commit the government not to have dynamic alignment in any way so that we can benefit from trade deal around the world great brexit benefit in the past few week we have absolutely be benefit from trade deal around the world nothing we be do with the european union be stop that if the hon gentleman want evidence of that he can see the uk india trade deal that this government agree in recent week or look at the deal with the united states that we agree in recent week nothing we be do with the european union cut across that our position have be that we will not choose between our ally the uk national interest lie in no there be nothing dynamic about the conservative party the uk national interest lie in deepen our trade relationship with all our partner will the minister give way have give way number of time now trade security defence and other area of our relationship should never be treat as zero sum game it be possible to deliver on all front and that be exactly what this government be do look forward to turn the page next week as we forge new strategic partnership with our european friend and make brexit work in the interest of the british people we be step up and meet the moment make people safe and more secure deliver growth and deliver in our national interest that be what this government will do call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank those on the conservative front bench for bring this motion which reveal if nothing else the sorry state of their party not vision for britain future but stubborn fixation on fail past the tories botch brexit deal have leave we not flourish but flounder not prosperous but poorer their dreadful brexit deal have be utterly ruinous for our economy while they cling to their brexit dogma british business farmer and fisher in every corner of our country face the harsh reality of their record of incompetence britain deserve more than hollow promise and endless excuse britain deserve well the conservatives motion today be checklist of their own failure what be once pro business party that support open market and free trade now cower behind trade barrier there be only one liberal party speak up for british business in this house and that be the liberal democrats business that be promise bonfire of regulation be now bury in paperwork the tories do not deliver the streamlined trade they promise instead they create bureaucratic nightmare be grateful to my hon friend for give the opportunity to speak on behalf of one of my constituent who start business import organic produce from the eu but have to pay to re certify the organic produce in the uk at their own cost that be kill their business be this the type of red tape introduce by brexit that the government should remove absolutely my hon friend point speak to the nature of the deal that be agree when we leave the european union far from create the streamlined trade the conservatives promise and instead of boost growth they have strangle it our farmer be promise golden opportunity but have end up poorer and weigh down by yet more tory brexit bureaucracy the previous conservative government undermine farmer and our rural economy with botched trade deal with australia and new zealand indeed the former secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs slam it by say the uk give away far too much for far too report november vol do my hon friend agree that this government should not allow our farmer to be throw under the bus again my hon friend be strong advocate for farmer in her constituency and across the country and absolutely agree with she our fishing community have suffer similarly hear from local fisher in newhaven in my constituency who fear their livelihood be close to collapse elsewhere we have the example of offshore shellfish in brixham represent by my hon friend the member for south devon caroline voaden where vet be now need to sign separate document by hand for every shipment of mussel if the deadline be miss at calais the entire catch go to waste that be not take back control it be lose the plot the tories have thoroughly botch our relationship with europe but labour overcautious approach risk cement this failure we acknowledge the government recognition that this brexit deal be not work but their approach fall long way short where britain need bold leadership they offer nothing more than reluctant half measure where we need decisive action they offer excuse and red line the hon gentleman raise an interesting point about shellfish the environmental and hygiene standard we apply to our shellfish remain exactly the same the day we leave the eu as when we be in the eu it be the eu that supply all that bureaucracy and requirement for wet stamp under world trade organisation rule if territory have equivalent standard it be oblige to allow good to enter its jurisdiction unchecked why do the eu breach this international law so wantonly and why have the government become supplicant to the eu try to gain its favour to remove these illegal barrier think the hon gentleman would acknowledge that the regulation he reference be not the only barrier to export in this country mention calais the port of dover currently see massive delay in get any good through the port because of the additional bureaucracy and security that be necessary as result of brexit newhaven port in my constituency which know very well in fact humbly suggest that know it well than other hon member have have to spend million of pound simply put in place more barrier in order to move good through the port and that be what be slow thing down the hon gentleman make fair point about equivalence but at the end of the day it be not the only output of brexit that be harm our industry with its half measure labour seem so afraid of its reform shape shadow that it have rule out bold measure to set free british business and stimulate growth britain can not afford such timidity our business can not afford it and our young people who face future with few opportunity than their parent absolutely can not afford it assume the hon gentleman be not advocate return to the common fishery policy which with its ludicrous quota and equivalence be bad for fish which be discard live and bad for fisherman who be limit by quota it be disaster that have detrimental effect on the fishing industry across this country surely he do not want return to that absolutely not the common fishery policy do lot of damage to british fishing as the common agricultural policy do to farming on that point it be possibly worth note that the hon member for clacton nigel farage attend only one of european parliament fisheries committee meeting that he could have attend thereby never speak up for british interest and that be potentially why the common fishery policy be not to our benefit thank my hon friend for that point what we have advocate for on all these area be new relationship with europe which would involve new discussion around fishing unlike the conservatives who apparently can not cope with the idea that we can actually move forward in the world and have different arrangement we acknowledge that we do not have to go back to what we have before the liberal democrats have clear four step road map to rebuild our european relationship first we must have fundamental reset rebuild trust trash by year of conservative recklessness absolutely acknowledge the positive work ministers have do in that regard secondly we must rejoin crucial european agency that directly benefit british people such as the european union aviation safety agency and horizon europe which back in the conservatives agree to pay more than billion year to rejoin due to the enormous harm that leave that programme have do to our critical research and innovation sector to recognise the necessity of such programme only to demand in the motion that the government rule out pay for access to other scheme that could benefit the uk be the very height of hypocrisy thirdly we must negotiate practical arrangement to slash red tape culminate in uk eu custom union by that would give british business the oxygen they so desperately need finally as trust rebuild we must pursue single market membership unlock maximum prosperity for business and maximum opportunity for future generation welcome the hon gentleman comment about the common fishery policy will he join we on the conservative benches and go one far by urge the government not to give up any of the sovereign fishing right that the uk currently benefit from by give away fishing to france for other see to be benefit from wide deal can he be strong and urge the government on fishing like those on these benches can be strong promise the house that will never join those benches can rule that out definitively what we should not be do as the right wing press have slightly hysterically speculate be trade away fishing right for defence deal for instance that be something that liberal democrats have be very clear about and that we continue to be clear about the hon member make an excellent case to his credit he set out four clear point which be more than the government or the main opposition party have do member across this house have previously say that democracy fail to be democracy if people do not have the ability to change their mind do he rule out ever rejoin the eu it be impossible to rule out anything in the future if the hon member have ask year ago whether it be possible that we would ever leave the eu would have say that it be extremely unlikely who know what will happen in the future we may have government of different complexion one day who choose to take those step but right now that be clearly not something that we be talk about the eu must show flexibility too britain be no ordinary third country we be major economy and an indispensable partner on defence security and trade the eu must make space for bespoke pragmatic arrangement alongside that the government must immediately introduce youth mobility scheme our young people deserve the same european opportunity that previous generation enjoy include many on these benches the tories obstinately refuse this common sense approach and labour have so far flip flop on the issue we have exist scheme with australia japan new zealand and canada but not with our near neighbour our young people do not deserve this short sightedness they deserve access to opportunity across europe as global threat multiply putin brutality in ukraine and trump economic recklessness britain security demand strong european partnership our comprehensive uk eu defence pact be not just desirable but essential for our national security we be no long part of europol mean that we have lose access to crucial intelligence sharing and vital database that help track criminal and terrorist across border that be not take back control that be make british people feel less safe and less secure to those who claim that uk eu defence co operation pact would somehow weaken nato let we be clear it would do the exact opposite great mobility for personnel across europe strengthen nato ability to deploy force particularly in the east access to eu procurement mechanism allow we to purchase more equipment more efficiently and boost british defence firm strong co operation on european defence not only bolster the alliance but improve our share operational effectiveness the conservatives be undermine british security and scaremongere by suggest otherwise with trump in the white house the world have be plunge into trade war britain export to the eu reach billion last year which be of everything that we sell to the world imagine how much high that would be and how much more money the british people would have in their pocket have the conservatives disastrous deal not shrunk our economy by in my constituency of bicester and woodstock many worker at the cowley mini plant tell that they be worried about the future of the plant and one of the principal reason be that the conservatives botch brexit deal have introduce so much red tape that the just in time delivery of component part across the european network that bmw operate be threaten the plant do my hon friend agree that that be just one example of how the brexit deal damage our economy rather than support our core industry thank my hon friend for his intervention and for stick up for his local business as he always do absolutely the effect on supply chain in particular have not always be obvious but it have be detrimental to many particularly large complicated business will the hon member give way not at the moment no by contrast the much vaunted trade deal sign with india last week be worth just fraction of our former deal with the european union it be around time small than the economic boost that we gain simply by align with the eu on good and service on that point will the hon gentleman give way of course the whole house will have note that the hon member clearly fail to rule out second referendum because he do not much like the result of the first one may ask he this directly like the government as be obvious from their evasion this afternoon be the liberal democrats prepare to accept process of dynamic alignment whereby we effectively become passive rule taker from the european union yes or no the right hon member make two point first he mention second referendum find this fascinating contention election happen every four year at the last election we return labour government this argument that the result of that referendum in must be hold in perpetuity no matter what the british people think of it suggest to that everybody should join the labour party because now we will have labour government in perpetuity too perhaps conservative members might want to give some consideration to that secondly the right hon member use the term rule taker find that fascinating too it be quite noticeable that in the negotiation on brexit conservative members become enthral by the philosophy of cakeism to the extent that it become their mantra that we could have our cake and eat it and that apparently modern trade deal do not require any give and take the recent india trade deal which have be so trumpet by labour members and which of course be start by conservative members do involve the uk have to take some thing as well that be what trade deal look like and it certainly look like that when we be talk with the large trading bloc on the planet the key question that the right hon member should be ask be what benefit would it bring to british people that ultimately be the job of any government and any politician what will benefit we yes be pleased that the right hon member agree with himself by contrast my hon friend the member for honiton and sidmouth richard foord tell of an engineering firm in his constituency that due to the mountain of brexit red tape now find it far easy to trade with south korea than with europe this be not just damaging but frankly absurd the one thing that the government will not do that be guarantee to deliver growth be negotiate bespoke customs union with the eu yet they be hike national insurance for business stifle investment and refuse to support the most vulnerable in our society by not scrap the two child benefit cap or safeguard personal independence payment rise rise will if may make little progress because be conscious of the amount of time that be take up only custom union can give business the long term certainty they need which will help to shield british job from the loom threat of trump trade war will take an intervention from the hon gentleman first and then from my hon friend the hon gentleman tell we that he have constituent who find it easy to trade with south korea than with the eu what do that tell we about the eu be that not one reason why people vote to leave it be because of its excessive bureaucracy and its protectionism why be it easy to trade with south korea than with the eu if it be not for eu bureaucracy just to be clear be talk about one of the constituent of my hon friend the member for honiton and sidmouth but on the hon member point the reason be the trade barrier put up by the conservative party as part of the brexit deal it be as simple as that it be protectionist party put up trade barrier and it continue to advocate for it on the issue of red tape epsom and ewell constituent be face preventable delay on essential medication for condition such as diabete adhd and mental ill health do my hon friend agree that now be simply not the time to play politic and that we must urgently seek comprehensive mutual recognition agreement with the european medicines agency to cut the red tape that be so detrimental to the health of all of our constituent that be really important point we have see shortage of key medication my hon friend mention adhd medication which have detrimental impact on the life of child and parent like insulin and other the liberal democrats understand that britain belong at europe heart not on its periphery isolated and diminish we recognise that rebuild these tie require patience and skilled diplomacy but unlike the tories we will not bury our head in the sand unlike labour we will not settle for tepid tinker as such we will abstain on the government amendment we believe in britain potential and in britain future we believe that our future be bright strong and more prosperous when we work closely with europe today the conservatives motion offer no solution only distraction from their disastrous record britain deserve leader who will properly rebuild relationship deliver genuine prosperity and restore our standing in the world this be the vision that the liberal democrats offer not tory and reform fantasy and not labour fence sitting we believe in practical solution clear direction and an unwavering commitment to britain good interest let we be honest many on the labour benches agree with what be say they know that this fence sitting will not cut it but they be not allow to say so fear not we will say so the conservatives have nothing to say on europe labour have tie itself up in red line the public know that our country future be european for business and job for our nation security and our child future it be time to put the division of the past behind we and act in the national interest we will vote against this nonsensical motion and we stand ready to work constructively with the government to build close more pragmatic relationship with our european friend and neighbour many people may still be find thing little bit gloomy and challenging as result of the mess leave by the previous government as be after month of be member of parliament but today be incredibly heartened it be probably the happy day have spend in the house yet because we have real opportunity to be hopeful and positive about the future of this country the ideology and chaos that have cause so much damage with the conservative government run frit from the reform party have now give way to party that be pragmatic and have prove itself to be competent would love at this stage to congratulate the government on their tremendous securing of trade deal with india and the usa be look forward to the hat trick where we secure trade deal with the european union that be even big and well than either of those two and all in the british interest what be absolutely clear to everybody know this in the labour party and it run through everything the prime minister have say be that this country have to get growth over the last year service have be decimate every time the new government open cupboard we find it bare we have to rebuild our public service and the swift way to get growth in the economy be by have good trade deal with the european union nothing will guarantee swifter growth for the economy what be the hon member analysis of why growth projection have be halve since labour come in find it very hard to take anything that the conservatives say with any degree of seriousness what be their explanation for why after year public service be on their knee and we have see collapse in the economy we even hear conservative front bencher the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart say that there have be growth since leave the european union despite the conservatives admit that it be disaster nothing will deliver the growth that this country need fast than sign good deal with the european union slash red tape and reduce regulation with the big market on our doorstep open up market kick start growth boost export and investment and reduce price at home this prize would be welcome by anyone who be not crazy ideologue we on the government side be not crazy ideologue or prisoner of our past or of television programme from the past the action that the conservatives take while in government have damage the british people business across the country and in chelsea and fulham want we to get good deal from the european union people in my constituency do not want we to rejoin the eu and be not talk about rejoin they would like we still to be in it and they think it have do they damage the importer of wine in my constituency who have to pay for every consignment he now bring in would like we still to be in the eu and to not have to face that but they do not want we to spend the next five year renegotiate the deal my hon friend be make an excellent speech constituent and small and medium sized business be cry out for this labour government to come forward and renegotiate good trade deal so that business can thrive do he agree that this government be take the right pragmatic approach in want to deliver growth for our country be most grateful to my hon friend for stress that point she be absolutely right we have government who have replace chaos and ideology with cool headed pragmatic determination we have trade deal with india and with the us and we be go to get good trade deal with the european union that be why it be day for rejoice not for doom and gloom and people rehash the past not single one of the conservatives except the hon member for brentwood and ongar on the front bench who accept that despite brexit the economy grow little bit sarcasm oh do realise sarcasm be allow as be say be very pleased as many be with the government for be cool headed and have common sense approach we be go to reset our relationship with the european union and put britain first put britain first have to also mean put our young people first so be excite by the opportunity for young people in my constituency and every constituency to take advantage of time limit control visa base youth experience scheme which we already have with dozen country the hon gentleman will know that thousand of young people perhaps not in chelsea but in most of the country be neet mean they be not in education employment or training and that number be grow why should those young people who be desperately seek access to education or job have to compete with large number of people from abroad be that what the people in chelsea and fulham really want for the people who live in the rest of britain can tell the right hon gentleman what people in chelsea and fulham really want they do not want prime minister like the last but one bugger business prime minister who say that we would level up to help people across the country but then do nothing about it what they want be prime minister who will invest in increase skill and apprenticeship right across the country as ours say yesterday that he will that be what we need and that be what we be get now on that point because rhetoric be important do the hon member agree with lord dubs who say that what the prime minister say yesterday be outrageous or do he agree with the alternative für deutschland leader who agree with the prime minister have to say when you ask about lord dubs order the hon member say you but do not ask the question apology madam deputy speaker the hon member touch soft spot when he mention lord dubs who be great friend and doughty campaigner in my constituency lord dubs will have his view but be talk about the prime minister set out an absolute commitment to increase the skill of young people right across the country and that be in no way undermine by the prospect of control visa base youth experience scheme in such unstable time it be right that we should seek close relationship with the european union that will strengthen defence and security alongside our commitment to nato be hopeful that the government will pull off an agreement that as hon friend of mine have say already will bring new job in the defence industry of this country we be face the stark most serious defence challenge that we have face for decade and we have to meet it together with the european union have speak to many ambassador here know that they welcome britain play its full role in defend our share continent that be what we be do as government that be why it be so disappointing with all the prospect and excitement ahead of we to hear the conservatives and reform still put ideology first ahead of growth and security they be fail to say what they would do instead and just want to continue with the status quo the hon member for lewes james maccleary talk about the chaos that be bring to kent where truck back up for mile near dover because the infrastructure for custom check be never ready and fresh produce rot in the queue that be under the conservative government they jeopardise car manufacturing in birmingham and the west midland which be region that rely on just in time eu supply chain it be hit with rule of origin check rise cost and delay part thank to the conservatives they sell out cornwall poor community by move out of european structural fund that have million in they replace they with share prosperity fund worth far less that be the conservative government fail brexit they weaken port talbot and the south wales steel industry make export hard and reduce competitiveness in what be already challenge global market they undermine scottish farmer and distiller by erect barrier to their large export market this be all part of the record that the conservatives be delighted to defend would not be delighted to defend such record but they be so much so that they have bring forward this ridiculous motion today be delighted by the amendment that the government have table the contrast between our pragmatic cool head approach and these ideologue could not be starker it be refreshing the hon member have criticise the opposition for the motion but to give they their due at least they have turn up they deliver brexit but none of its architect who would usually be sit on the benches behind have show up do that not show the contempt in which those member hold we and voter as well agree with the hon member if the reform party entire shtick for get elect be be anti eu and think that it can defend the interest of the british people well by continue the chaotic unfavourable system we have with that be its entire reason for existence it be not okay for one of its member of parliament to ask couple of question and skedaddle as for the hon member for clacton and for florida do not know what he be do today but he ought to be here we should be cheer it be refreshing so let we be little more optimistic as we look to next week and not say we always go to be out diddle by french and germans that counsel of despair be pathetic we be perfectly capable of negotiate trade deal as we have show with deal with the us and india to get the good for the british people and that be what we will do with the european union that be what the people of this country vote for at the last election an end to fail ideology and the start of applied cool headed determined common sense as result at the end of the meeting next week and in future year the british people will benefit we should all be delighted about that be delighted to follow the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman and his flowery optimism for the future of this country with it somehow be terribly good thing that we be realign ourselves with the european union without actually rejoin it it make wonder about all the debate have attend over year in the house about our relationship with what use to be call the common market then the european communities and now the european union this debate have ring of familiarity about it because there be two side in the house that tend to completely misunderstand each other only think that conservative members now understand the truth because that come out in the referendum the referendum demonstrate that the house of commons be completely out of alignment with the population on the question of our membership of the european union the whole brexit story be about battle within the house as to whether the pro eu majority would assert itself and somehow negate the referendum or whether the referendum would be respect that be why my right hon friend the leader of the opposition and her shadow cabinet colleague be right to put at the front of the motion the importance of honour the referendum result the fact be that referendum result represent superior mandate to single term of election for an elected government because that referendum take place on single issue do not think anyone would pretend that the european union be the main issue at the last general election so anyone in the government or indeed in the liberal democrats try to use the general election result as mandate to circumvent the result of the referendum be play dangerous political game of course that argument be use in reverse on those of we who have have concern about europe for year as we be tell exactly to my hon friend point that referendum be superior to continuous election we make decision after the last referendum that be generational move we have hardly have generation in the few year since the referendum agree with my right hon friend the important point be that we do not have write constitution but we do have in our mind hierarchy of legitimacy on which in the end the democratic credibility of the house depend the fact be referendum represent superior mandate on single issue and with great struggle the pro eu majority eventually align itself with the decision that the british people have take on our membership of the european union since we be stray into political idea and philosophy be not the point that the democratic legitimacy we enjoy in this place be on the basis of popular consent and there be no more direct expression of popular consent than referendum which be why its result have to be honour agree with my right hon friend and that be why it be an extremely ominous portent that the minister at the dispatch box refuse to answer he on the question of whether there would be alignment or subjection to the european court of justice if the referendum be about one thing it be about take back control of our law in fact many of we in the leave campaign at the time argue that the british people do understand sovereignty they certainly do by the end of the referendum and get into permanent alignment of regulation or subject the meaning of law apply in the united kingdom to the scrutiny and jurisdiction of the european court of justice be give back control it be dangerous thing for government elect on the principle of honour the referendum result and one who be now play dog whistle politic with immigration to be backslide in secret with sleight of hand into allow jurisdiction of the european court of justice and permanent alignment back into our law while pretend that be not happen that be exactly what the minister do at the dispatch box rise will give way to my right hon friend but have another point that wish to make my hon friend will well remember that during the referendum booklet be circulate to every household in the united kingdom which famously say this be your decision the government will implement what you decide the people decide to leave and some in this place spend three year try to frustrate their decision in that context be he concerned that today the minister blatantly refuse three time to answer straight question about whether the government would concede dynamic alignment at the summit be that not the sort of duplicitous behaviour that make the public so angry in the first place agree but there be another dangerous game be play by another political party the liberal democrats my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois press the hon member for lewes james maccleary who want to rejoin the european union on whether there would be another referendum and he do not say that there would be that we would have referendum to leave the european union but not require new referendum to rejoin it would be incendiary politic for this country why have people become disillusioned with their politician it be because politician seem to agree to one proposition and then do something completely different from what be vote for hope we can all agree on one proposition that there could be no possibility of proposal to rejoin the european union or to accept dynamic alignment or the jurisdiction of the european court of justice except over its current limited area which will eventually expire without further referendum that be serious matter the hon member talk about people lose their trust in politic do he agree that the promise of million week to go to the nhs which be broadcast on the side of big red bus during the referendum might have somewhat reduce trust in his party be happy to point out that after the referendum and since we leave the european union we be spend way more than million week more on the nhs than we be and our contribution to the european union have fall dramatically in fact much fast than be expect under the withdrawal agreement so the benefit that be on the side of the bus have turn out to be correct although believe it be statistical sleight of hand to use that particular number disown it at the time but have no doubt that if we be to get draw back into the european union we will have to start raid the nhs to make payment to the european union again do not think that be what the british people vote for that bring back to this great defence fund which think will be borrow will we have to borrow some of that fund as well no it be go to be borrow through some european central bank mechanism will it instead be tax in any case it be all government borrowing so will we add to government borrowing by participate in the borrowing or funding of that fund or would it not be well if we just remain aloof from it to concentrate on spend money on our own defence that be the point that have already be make the money that we have commit to defence over the year in the period since the second world war and indeed since the end of the cold war be far great than that of the vast majority of eu country we also mandate our nuclear deterrent to the protection of the whole of europe we play our part in the defence of europe as for the idea that we can deploy troop more quickly through free movement of people what planet be the liberal democrats on it be utterly ludicrous come back to the point about the defence fund there have be such fund in europe before but can assure members that the game that every country play be the one where what they put in they get out the french be past master at that they will participate in multilateral programme but if they do not get the lion share they pull out they pull out of the eurofighter programme when that be mean to be part of their deal because they be not get enough work out of it therefore the idea that it be freebie for british defence company to participate in the fund and get extra money into the british defence industry will simply not happen in any case this fund be not about create warfighting capability this year or next year which be what we need it be about the very long term big programme that the defence industry want that will not rescue we from america absence from nato if that be to occur for more than few month or few year under donald trump let we also remember that donald trump will not be there forever he have more month to go let we not do more damage to nato by make it look to the other side of the atlantic that we will take care of our own defence in europe from now on that be very dangerous remember madeleine albright democrat secretary of state rail against what be then call the european security and defence policy she warn that it represent the three ds the duplication of nato asset which be wasteful and unnecessary the discrimination against non eu member of nato such as norway turkey canada and the united states and the decoupling of american and european defence policy be that what we want be that what this house want be that what the labour party want no the labour party say that nato be the cornerstone of our defence and rightly so but what signal be it send to president trump will my hon friend give way ask that he wait just minute what signal be it send to donald trump by suggest that we will have an eu defence policy that exclude the united states it be exactly the wrong signal for this moment be pleased that my hon friend raise that point which want to elaborate far the real point be that vance the vice president come over to munich and rip hole through the europeans include ourselves for not have spend enough although we be one of the top spender since then the americans have go on and on about that but each time we get the sense that they be keener to decouple do what we be about to do not give strength to the argument that we do not need they any long and therefore they need to look somewhere else that be the danger because nato be not just about defence of the west it be about make sure that the us never go into isolationism again yes that promise of create an eu defence capability have be on the table since the st malo declaration of in the aftermath of the maastricht treaty that first introduce the word defence into the eu that be when france and the united kingdom under labour government declare that the eu would have autonomous military capability with separable but not separate military force from nato we still have the absurdity in which the armed force of the eu country be allocate to nato task but at the same time be ready for eu task there have to be complicated de confliction arrangement to try to ensure that an eu defence mission do not conflict with nato defence mission we finish up with something call the berlin plus arrangement which turkey have never accept because it be not member of the eu but be member of nato there have always be an impasse between nato and the eu on those two question and it be all completely unnecessary because nato have military headquarters it have political committee and it be an international organisation indeed it be the most successful military alliance in the world why be the eu try to duplicate it just for itself the eu be more interested in statecraft and state building than defend our own continent the anger with which ursula von der leyen and friedrich merz have attack trump reflect latent anti americanism that have always be there and which we could do without at this moment my hon friend make profound argument he highlight the eu which see itself as supranational body and nato which by nature be anything but that in that it be confederation of sovereign nation that tension lie at the heart of the eu ill conceal and now evident disdain for nato do not know whether the government be careless or unknowing of that they be either complicit or ignorant wonder which one my hon friend think it be sadly european union defence have always promise far more than it deliver it be mean to galvanise all the european state into spend more money it fail and just do not do that when any serious military operation be require it be nato to the eu credit some eu military operation be take place but they be on very limited scale the british and the americans need to reinforce the balkans now because the europeans be not commit enough on their own and be incapable of do so even if this time there be rapid growth in eu military capability to address the crisis that we face it would take decade to replicate what the americans currently provide such as tactical nuclear weapon and air cover why do the eu need to have its own air defence policy when that be exactly what nato do it do european air defence we need to bolster nato it be encourage that force plan for possible peacekeeping force in ukraine be all be do at nato and not in the eu crisis management centre or at eu military headquarters only nato have the capability to plan large scale military activity indicate dissent the hon gentleman shake his head what do he know about it would be interested in he challenge do the hon gentleman not see the fragility of european defence that be dependent on key item of american hardware which he correctly identify that we do not have and which it will take decade for we to replicate operate integrate with our system and train people on do he not see the fragility of our defence if president trump or another incoming us leader say actually you on your own we do care about the defence of ukraine order while be in the chair intervention will be short than that be glad that the hon gentleman have make that point but the good thing for all european nation be not to try to build our own eu defence capability but to strengthen nato there be an argument that we be somehow do this through the eu so that it can strengthen nato but do not think that be really the ambition of the bureaucrat in brussels they have flag and parliament and they want an army euro army that be what people periodically talk about particularly the germans and the french they want euro army but that would send the wrong signal to president trump yes we need to develop those capability but let we develop they through nato be not the hon member point put beyond all doubt by the wording of article of the treaty of the eu which expressly say that the purpose of co operation be to arrive at common defence be it not therefore perfectly clear that the eu be set itself up to have its own sovereign defence capability yes and when we look at the european defence agency and all the mechanism that have be create we can see that the european defence agency be an embryo european ministry of defence that be what be intend let we just suppose that in the ideal world that labour and the liberal democrats live in this defence capability come about the fundamental problem be that the european union be never originally conceive as defence and foreign policy organisation there be many country in it with very no it be functionalism that drive the foundation of the european communities it be about trade and create single market defence be never in the mind of the early founder of the european union and it be very ill suit to the task of get defence capability because the institution be not design for that purpose it be not in the culture of those institution to rely on they for our defence and security be extremely unwise on the other hand nato be already very well suit to the task and do not need to be duplicate to put it mildly give the political disunity in the european union particularly towards trump okay that afflict nato as well this be not an instant solution to the political problem in nato if those be what the european union be seek to resolve we should dispense with the idea that make defence pact with the european union be somehow the great panacea for all the problem we face on our continent because of president putin on the contrary think it be likely to make thing bad more complicated and more bureaucratic and it would probably make our defence industry less competitive because they would be cocoon inside this fund instead of compete on the on the global stage with the americans incidentally our defence procurement co operation with the americans remain essential they have the lion share of the technology they be way ahead of the european union when it come to technology so why be the government do this think they have always be religiously commit to the idea of eu defence they introduce it in the first place in the st malo declaration but why be they so devoted to do this now of course it be what the european union really want we be the supplicant in these negotiation we be ask the eu for concession and the one thing that would really make it feel good be draw the united kingdom into the defence arena of the european union meanwhile what concession be we get from the eu do not see any it will be interesting to find out it will not instantly reduce all trade barrier because we be not in the single market and will not be in the single market it will still apply all the check include the antiquated wet stamp that be apply to form certify the fitness of shellfish wet stamp be so last century but the eu be still use they on custom form that be how backward it be there be electronic frontier between african country where there be no barrier incidentally that be the answer to the northern ireland problem fully support the opposition proposal which be to question everything that the eu will demand of we and which the government might pursue and to reserve our ability to tear up those agreement if they be not in the national interest the government do not have monopoly on the national interest national interest be subjective term the national interest might be different in the mind of one person and in the mind of another as far as be concern we leave the european union in the national interest because we want to remain sovereign democracy in charge of our own law and to be like most other country that be not in the european union they get on fine as my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart point out the economy be still grow or be grow until the government hit it with their budget we have every opportunity at our foot one of the reason we leave the european union sorry to relitigate all these argument and leave that slow growth high unemployment high regulation high tax trade bloc be so that we could make deal with the high growth low regulation high employment part of the world which in the end will provide we with far more business than we get from the eu actually the vast majority of our trade particularly our service trade be outside the eu people forget that by be obsess with trade with the eu we drive our economy into straitjacket we be well out of that the government should take away from this debate warning they know that they be be attack by reform those voter would probably never vote conservative or be less likely to vote conservative than labour but they be go to reform because they can sense the backsliding go on in this government if there be ever to be another referendum would hazard guess that the vote would be against rejoin the european union so there can be no rejoin by stealth which seem to be the government policy we will stand by the british people and will dishonour any agreement that the government make with the european union that be not in our interest indeed there be part of the withdrawal agreement that we may need to revisit for example in the northern ireland protocol the technology have move on and we can move to an electronic frontier across the north south border without the need for check on trade between northern ireland and the rest of the united kingdom one of the found principle of the act of union be that there should be frontier free trade within the united kingdom as whole if the continue development of the northern ireland protocol continue to impose those check those check be not in the national interest and we should reserve the right to jettison the protocol and replace it with something well thank you madam deputy speaker for the opportunity to speak and commend the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin on stay on his foot for nearly half an hour quite an impressive feat it be an honour to follow he he be elect year ago when be nine imagine that he have see lot of history over the past year and over the past nearly year since the referendum if we think about the main feature of that history it be indisputable that we live in new world we have the illegal invasion of ukraine taiwan be act as test point nato and the un be at risk and there be rise authoritarian populism which risk democratic backsliding be that through the undermining of institution power be concentrate in the executive the dismissal of check and balance grow electoral interference or big tech captain involve themselves in democratic politic like never before we see economic inequality on an unprecedented scale that create risk of democratic instability here and around the world there be also the risk of wealth concentration unaddresse tax haven network rise social inequality and people feel leave out issue of development aid and debt relief be go from our political discussion the rise of technology risk create democratic threat artificial intelligence and social medium create the potential for deepfake automate disinformation cyber attack and the development of lethal system with no human oversight there be health challenge such as the global pandemic that we have be through climate change continue unabated and remain unaddresse at the scale need create the possibility of resource conflict climate refugee flow and stress on nature and wildlife if that have not convince the house that be fun time down the pub do not know what will say all that because those be the major threat that have emerge in the past year and that be not an exhaustive list if carry on members would want to sit down fast we have to face reality all of we in this place be elect to behave like grown up to face the fact debate on the basis of reality and come up with common sense solution give that we face those threat have not even mention the lion share of threat in the uk which would say we inherit from the previous government it be no wonder that people outside the wall of westminster feel that we go too slow and do not focus on the thing that they care about it be no wonder that people be succumb to hopelessness and feel that politics be not meet their need question be ask early about what be on the ballot paper accept that the european union be not on the ballot paper as an existential question however what be on the ballot paper be quality of life in our country the state of our economy and the possibility that generation will be lock out of the democratic agreement and social contract on fair chance at life we labour members be say that trade be solution to some of those challenge as be say people outside the wall of this palace feel frustrated by the slowness of our debate rise will come to you shortly we must recognise the importance of urgency that be why be genuinely extremely pleased that we have government who have move forward in recent day and week with two significant trade deal the first with india be achieve in month after the conservatives have spend eight year say that they would get deal we roll up our sleeve and get deal that will put more money into people pocket create job here and benefit our economy the trade deal with the united states be not what we would have get have kamala harris be elect president it be the deal we could get with donald trump as president and think that it show realistic common sense negotiation will the hon gentleman give way on that point will come to you that deal will put money in people pocket grow our economy and create job now we have the prospect of third trade deal with the european union on the horizon it would be really important deal that be crucial because if we do not foster the condition for trade in world of global insecurity we will create further problem in our democracy and around the world rise think sir john want to intervene order the hon member have say you twice and now say sir john it be very long establish convention that member do not refer to right hon and hon colleague by name be extremely grateful to my namesake for give way he be make an interesting speech he be right that global power and its growth be make people feel that they can not affect decision making that be profound point but we need to root power close to people not detach it from they as happen when power be give over to foreign potentate whether in the eu or any other part of the world agree with the right hon member with the uk sovereign independent trading nation we in this place be able to shape the debate and condition of trade we have the prospect of an eu trade deal before we and we must grasp it if we do not we will see our country fall far behind there be area of possibility for that trade deal for example there be need for the transfer and exchange of clean energy between the uk and france and the european union on large scale have the privilege of visit gosport recently to see interconnexion france angleterre where the subsea interconnector be exchange clean energy between the uk and france ensure that we can keep the light on not only here but in france and across the european union surely energy security be an important feature of our democracy in an age where we be threaten by putin and other dictator the hon member talk about we be sovereign nation and be able to choose our trade deal assume we will get vote in this place on the shape of future trade deal with the united states so that we be able to examine it vote and exercise our parliamentary sovereignty thank the hon member for listen to some of what say say that we in this place have the right to speak in debate such as this to shape the condition of trade clearly with the minister on the front bench listen acutely to everything that member be say that message be be carry into government the minister be nod profusely in which case we will have that democratic accountability turn to the other area of potential eu uk relationship improvement defence be obviously core part of that nato be the cornerstone of our collective security but strong uk must sit alongside strong european country the uk be raise its defence spending to an unprecedented level and make effort to grow our defence industrial base we need to do that not only for our own security and the security of democracy but to set an example to european country about raise their own defence spending while work with they to grow our collaboration on the question of trade all of we in this house whichever party we represent will have have small business come to our surgery and tell we about the red tape they encounter as result of the brexit deal if they vote for brexit they do not vote for that brexit deal they vote for something very different think we can all recognise that and if we do not we be not listen to our constituent when they come to our surgery and tell we their truth very clearly by reduce red tape we can help to grow the number of job in our economy open up our border to more trade and smooth our export which be critical if we be go to achieve the government no goal of grow our economy without growth in our economy we will not raise living standard we will not be country at ease with itself we will not again be confident on the world stage and we will not be lead democratic voice in world of strengthen democracy do the hon member agree that rejoin custom union would achieve all those aim of reduce red tape do not agree be talk about very different proposal that be meet the need of our constituent in the interest of allow more member to speak in the debate will take no more intervention will the hon gentleman give way after minute of speak the hon member have probably say everything he need to say and if he do not we have serious problem in this house on the question of expand opportunity in the uk eu relationship be particularly strike by the need for capped control balanced youth mobility scheme around our country include in my constituency of bournemouth east young people be suffer generational challenge that their predecessor do not face be it their inability to buy home at an affordable price find secure work or get the education they want or the fact that they have go through cost of live crisis and pandemic surely we owe it to our young generation to provide they with some of the condition that will allow for well life capped balanced control youth mobility scheme be key to that such scheme will not just be beneficial for the youth of the uk have in my constituency significant number of english language school have the privilege of visit beet language centre in my constituency last friday for roundtable that it host and we be join by other important language school they talk to about the difficult financial circumstance they be all in and the difficulty of keep the door open because of the damaging brexit deal that be negotiate with youth mobility scheme we can put money back into our english language sector which be critical we be live in an insecure world britain soft power be critical to ensure that we be respect around the world by bring people to the uk and particularly to sunny bournemouth for one to two week or four to six week they get sense of how wonderful open and accept we be as country they can then take that back to their family and their home country and they can grow an affection for this country come back repeatedly spend money here and grow our tourism sector bournemouth christchurch and poole have the high concentration of english language school of any borough or local authority in the uk they contribute million to the bcp economy indeed english language school contribute billion nationally imagine how much well we could be if we have youth mobility scheme and support for our english language school will soon conclude my speech so more member can speak but before sit down want to talk about not just the importance of the uk eu reset as way of deliver trade in its own right between the uk and the eu but the benefit of trade in an increasingly protectionist world we need to be talk up the benefit of trade trade bring people into close and more harmonious and profitable relation with one another it bring down the wall and the barrier between nation it make war less likely because it bind people in peace it do not just put money into people pocket or create job in our community it grow our economy fast and it raise living standard we know that trade have its challenge but do well trade deal can help to make sure our country prosper at its heart the eu uk reset should be about trade our economy and our business it should not be question of identity culture war and scaremongere it should be about grow up gathering in this chamber and talk about what be important to our constituent on the basis of the fact rather than rehash old tired debate and scaremongere we need to face the future and be pleased that finally we have government who be do so it be good to follow the hon member for bournemouth east tom hayes and to be remind of how old he be when first come here hope he stay here as long as well or maybe do not hope for that as it might mean we conservative members will be on the opposition benches forever today debate be on an important topic and there have be some very good contribution already but want to get to the bottom of what the government really want out of this negotiation because they have be little bit tepid in come forward on the key issue welcome the government negotiation in india finish off trade arrangement deal or whatever it be with the indian government welcome too that they have be able to begin to negotiate with the united states although they have not secure full trade deal by the way they would not have get trade deal if the democrats have get back into office because they reject it for four year in fact president biden say that there would be no trade deal with the uk let we not just observe that because the democrats be not trump somehow they be go to give we trade deal have my problem with the current president but president biden absolutely do not want trade with we it be as simple as that that be mistake on his part he have real opportunity because the trade deal be pretty much all do and then it be bin there be also the question of the reason we be able to do these trade deal with the rest of the world to which we export more than the european union we should do more of those trade deal the conservative government do after brexit although some of they be mop up the one that we have before stand ready to congratulate the labour government if they use the freedom brexit give they to get more trade arrangement because that be what we be here for might want to press they far and say they could get lot more out of the us but that be another debate all together do not disagree with the idea that the deal we do with the european union be capable of be improve of course it be because the eu put up many barrier in the course of that negotiation it weaponise northern ireland distinctly and that be grave error on its part it risk some of the process of peace in northern ireland by make it critical negotiating tool that could be use as leverage later in the rest of the negotiation and as result we have be leave with problem in northern ireland encourage the government to have very good look at that do not vote for the windsor agreement because think it do not solve the problem by long chalk and it have leave northern ireland in the same position as before with couple of small modification this debate be really about get into the issue say to the minister that the european union do not play straight about phytosanitary from day one in the negotiation and it still do not play straight the fact be that our standard in animal welfare and product health be and always have be above those of the european union the european union know that the reality be that somehow it decide that there have to be all these phytosanitary check and change and it be desperately keen to get dynamic alignment now because that mean that there will be rule base order come from the eu that be what it have always want to do the truth be that the european union do not have that arrangement with other country around the world for example it be quite happy to have new zealand vet check their product before departure those product go in through rotterdam without any check other than check that they come from the area specify the eu know which vet it authorise so it do that it could have do that here in the uk sit down with monsieur barnier and group of people to have long discussion when the negotiation break down as result of what be go on here in parliament and very much remember that we talk about trust each other regulation and work with that trust to get an arrangement that make it as easy as possible to get good across the border he accept that then say that provide we could trust each other veterinary authority we would not need to have the phytosanitary rule as propose at the moment it be only later when my party in government come back and do terrible shimmy with he that he think he have it all so he take it the reality be that the eu know all along from the word go that it be easy to put in place these arrangement than it make out have always find the phytosanitary objection peculiar because it could be sort out very quickly our standard be high than the eu and our vet be quite capable of check different producer to see whether they fit european standard that be all it be be they up to european standard and be european standard up to ours when the eu export to we it be very simple that can be do in every trade deal and the eu already do it with other country that be not and have never be part of that union there be an idea that to get this issue sort we would have to go into dynamic alignment and accept the eu rule over our product but it would make it more difficult to make future trade arrangement if we be rule taker from the european union and could not negotiate these area ourselves that bring back to my previous point before return to that issue want to raise another point the trouble be that the argument hear make that phytosanitary agreement involve dynamic alignment would address the price of food be patently absurd if sps check concern the price of food we could unilaterally relax they they do not have to be where they be that be our decision to take it would not change or lower the price of food if anything it would be more likely to block we from do number of thing such as gene edit in food and work that we want to do that the european union do not want to do all these thing put at risk where we may be in future trade arrangement and the direction in which we may want to develop farming here will the right hon gentleman give way want to make couple of point on this issue before give way we know and everybody else around the world outside the eu know that the eu put up very hidden tariff barrier america be right about that it complain that europe find all sort of little regulation and problem so that it can not break in with its product and good that have happen for long time and it have happen with we we know that it be even happen when we be in the eu we be by nature free trading country and there be no way on earth that we think the eu as construct be as free trading in that sense it want to protect its market more than anything else rather than open up to the rest of the world welsh food and drink export have fall by since do that not evidence the damage that have be do to wales by these deal if damage have be do to export to the european union as say early that be about the attitude of the european union to protectionism in the eu its trade with we have not fall away on that basis because we do not set up those barrier in the first place so my argument to the hon gentleman be very simple the european union want it all that be the reality of what we be deal with it want it all and it negotiate in bad faith from the word go we have an agreement which be pretty good agreement as trade agreement go it be one of the large trade agreement that we have it can always be improve do not disagree with that but the reality be that we need to deal with an organisation that be as relaxed about be fair to we as we be about be fair to it that have be our big problem from the word go return to phytosanitary issue have have debate and discussion with the minister the hon member for cardiff south and penarth stephen doughty in the past and we have agree with each other many time laud he for his stance on russia and everything else there be no question about that but want to quote from little document that come across from the centre for european reform by the way it be very complimentary to say that read thing that do not agree with tend to do that quite lot strangely it be bad habit of mine know that document be very close to how the european union head of department all think and it say labour red line do not extend to rule out dynamic alignment or role for the ecj in dispute settlement as such ask the minister this simple question be the centre for european reform correct do the government red line rule out dynamic alignment or do they not will give way to the minister right now because be generous like that and he probably want to answer that question tempt he to come to the dispatch box and say whether the government red line rule out dynamic alignment could they and will they agree to dynamic alignment and ecj rule will give way to he now because see that he be begin to move indicate dissent he be not what pity will the right hon gentleman give way with respect to the hon gentleman he have little while to go before he stand at the dispatch box be after the minister not he but we will get to that in due course the reality be that the government could agree to dynamic alignment there be no denial of that essentially the government be go into this negotiation know full well that they be so desperate on phytosanitary matter that they will give way on dynamic alignment that be exactly what the eu want my real worry in all of this however be that we know what be go on will just move on to another topic and then will sit down and give other member chance to speak most of all be worried about bad faith when we talk about improvement which to be fair to the government they do with the european union what do france do almost immediately the prime minister be show some leadership over ukraine try to galvanise the other nation which be his role his role be to haul america and keep it with we and he have be do that do not have any criticism of that but when the prime minister get involve say that europe should form coalition of the willing and that he want to drive that far forward and get some kind of agreement on it what do france immediately say not before you give we access to fishing that be it in no world do fishing have anything to do with defence yet france weaponise fishing to block off the uk which have take the think generous position of say that it want to galvanise europe to do more the problem here be that if we take out the country that join since the ukraine war europe across the board spend half of what the united states do on defence in dollar term we have more people and more industry in europe yet we spend half of what america do on weaponry and defence that be shocking position for member of nato to be in we have not stand up we have do well still not good enough but what the rest of europe have do have be shocking by the way the country that just tell we that we will not get any discussion unless fishing be on the agenda have be one of the bad spender on defence in the european union let alone in global term less than we way less than we and less than most of the other it be at the bottom of the scale simply say to the government that the prime minister be right to press on defence to get the european nation to step up but as my hon friend the member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart say early we have mechanism for that the prime minister be right to do it through nato and we must not allow europe to slide away from nato as its mean of defence watch as do many of its leader when vice president vance lecture the european union in munich what he say shock the european leader as it be mean to he lay into europe quite vindictively but fair enough however where we be now head towards somehow encourage those country peculiarly to form some kind of european union defence organisation be exactly what will give the american administration permission to say well you can do this yourself we be already halfway there by the way because we be form coalition of the willing but america be not willing and we be at odd with it over its relationship with ukraine we agree about the ceasefire but america have now change its position and will now be hold negotiation before ceasefire think that that be wrong by the way although be personally big supporter of america think it be mistaken on that particular point and the government be right my point be that we be put the whole of nato at risk for phytosanitary and fishing deal in what world do anyone do that what be we do it for the answer it seem to be that we be too desperate to curry favour with an organisation that when push come to shove and when it come to defence need we more than we need it it need the uk to be lock into this because we be the key to so much of what it need to do with defence say to the government you have much strong tool in your hand than you may think we have key persuasive power on defence and we should not sell they on the basis that they should become european and we should destroy nato or damage nato simply because we want to make some kind of adjustment or improvement which include dynamic alignment and the loss of the possibility of future trade negotiation unlike many opposition members my constituent have little appetite for relitigation of the brexit debate of back at the time of referendum of they vote to leave the european union there be scant desire for we to rejoin and even less desire for return to embrace freedom of movement will always put my constituent first and these be red line that understand honour and respect however my constituent also see the change world around we and recognise that the world have be transform immeasurably since the term on which we leave the european union do not match the global moment that we face today president trump tariff have rock the international economic order war have break out in europe and there be need for dramatically increase defence spending and new method of work with international colleague new wave of mass migration from the middle east and africa and the small boat crisis in our channel can only be properly handle through further co operation with our international partner basically my constituent be patriotic they want their country to be resilient to new threat and prosperous in chaotic world while any future with the european union must respect critical red line on control border and protect ultimate sovereignty in westminster there be now scope for new thread new relationship to embolden our security and economic interest in volatile world this new approach can should and will believe overcome the increasingly desperate archaic old fashioned attack from some opposition members about the so call brexit betrayal and the british public know that polling by the good growth foundation show that of the public support significant co operation with the eu on trade and the economy defence and security more than twice as many adult say that the eu be the uk most trustworthy ally rather than the united states under its current president and about of the public say that it be imperative for we to have close relationship with the european union in the future new well deal with the european union be popular because few think that the current relationship be work many while support the principle of brexit and have vote in favour of it in feel that its execution during the chaotic conservative premiership have be disastrous the public desire for change be reality that the conservative party can not seem to wake up to although fundamentally disagree with its principle it have be great party at their good the conservatives have be successful in modernise the country in line with global trend they bring we into europe and play pivotal role in build the single market that so many europeans enjoy today give their track record it be sad to see that they seem to oppose the notion of negotiate new and well relationship with europe the party of churchill and thatcher who once lead on the world stage be now leave to carp from the sideline like talk radio commentator from bygone era the leader of the opposition be busy denounce every post brexit deal that this labour government sign as inadequate or betrayal include those that she fail to get over the line when she be trade secretary on this issue as with so many of the conservatives current fixation the public have simply leave they behind the conservatives be fight yesterday battle although the theme that win such support in the referendum can not be ignore change be require any entanglement of political structure and any notion of increase immigration or lack of control will rightly be meet with outrage by those who support brexit but the benefit of close deal be now clear be grateful to the hon gentleman for his tribute to the conservative party it have indeed be great party and remain so on entanglement he make valid point about co operation and collaboration but that have always be the case of course we must work with other country but the core issue here be authority entanglement mean grant authority to power outside this country surely this movement of young people which be dress up form of free movement be just that reject the right hon gentleman characterisation of the policy will come on to that specific policy in moment but his characterisation be unfair be not in the habit of give advice to the conservatives but my understanding be that at the last general election the party finish fifth among voter under the age of look in the mirror and think about how they have end up in that position might be worthwhile way to spend some time the benefit of close deal be now clear unified carbon and electricity market could raise billion of pound in revenue for the treasury and more collaboration on defence would ease pressure enhance capability and support joint procurement and in key area there be also scope this go to the right hon gentleman point for capped uk eu youth mobility scheme to be part of the deal but it have to be negotiate and the devil will be in the detail there should be tight limit on the number access to service and duration of stay and it should be part of an agreement whereby the eu help the uk with many of the challenge that we face with immigration this be part of relationship that do not stop at one moment or at one deal it be an ongoing relationship this government be open negotiate listen and get the good deal for britain and it be one that support as so often be the case the political class be lag behind public opinion and fight the last battle the brexit paradigm that certainly define british politic between and be history and the government be right to look to the future and pursue well and deep relationship with our european partner in order to improve living standard offer economic protection and ensure our country security be pleased that this government appear willing to seize the moment and look forward to support their effort in that endeavour in the come week rise order do not intend to introduce time limit but member will be aware that there be in the region of people wish to speak they might like to consider how long they will spend on their foot so that as many colleague as possible can get in last week this house recognise the anniversary of the ally victory in europe so find it somewhat strange that today the party of churchill be call for debate that seek to drive wedge between we and our friend and ally on the continent speak on behalf of the young people farmer fisherman and small business owner of my member fishermen yes plural they be hard work people who have feel the consequence of our severance from europe the bungling of farming and fishery policy since brexit have lead to supply chain disruption reduce access to export market and financial uncertainty for our producer our farmer once able to trade freely with europe now find themselves bogge down in paperwork lose out to competitor who enjoy smoother trade arrangement despite the turbulence of brexit the european union remain our large trading partner to undermine this reality seem to my mind to be curious act of economic self harm grand promise of scale back brussels bureaucracy be make but precisely the opposite have occur with more red tape delay and headache for our business and trader as be put to the lib dem spokesperson the hon member for lewes james maccleary at the start of the debate the red tape be come from the eu not we why be the ire of the lib dems never direct at the people responsible for introduce the trade barrier simply do not accept what the hon member say big corporation may be able to adapt shift do be quiet for minute big corporation may be able to adapt shift operation and sidestep the chaos but for our small business the backbone of our economy this be not merely an inconvenience but catastrophe ask my constituent becca james of williton what she have make of the brexit fallout have run superb au pair agency that fold as an mp represent many sme in my constituency of tiverton and minehead minehead be on the sea hence the fisherman hear daily about their struggle to keep trading and to navigate new regulation conservative government have hang they out to dry leave they to fend for themselves in post brexit economic landscape riddle with uncertainty talk about cut off your nose to spite your face we must swerve the temptation of dogma and pursue policy that benefit our economy our people and our future we must come to term with the fact that form new custom arrangement would offset much of this harsh impact and would be sign of more grow up politic and my party be look forward eagerly to the government big reset in the week to come without comprehensive trading arrangement with the eu it will be clear that reset just mean rebrand fishery have not fare any well grandstand notion of reclaim british water turn out to be hollow as coastal community have see dwindle profit complicated licensing and deal that have leave they materially worse off than before if only the hon member for clacton nigel farage have attend more than one of the meeting of the eu parliament committee on fisheries which he be pay to attend our fisherman might be on more even keel we must embrace the eu youth mobility scheme the west somerset area of my constituency sit at out of on the social mobility index and while there be no overnight panacea to this believe that those from disadvantaged background have access to opportunity on the continent can only be good thing the youth mobility scheme would democratise travel and work abroad by remove the financial barrier that typically make it an option only for the privileged it would empower talented young people who may have the skill but lack the financial mean to access the same opportunity as their more affluent peer why should they be reserve for few it be my firm belief that travel and broaden one experience can be one of the good form of education why would we deny our young people that golden ticket to live work study and build lifelong friendship in europe this be not entirely an argument about economic for what monetary value can be place on broaden the horizon of our young people wherever those opportunity may lie it be peculiar irony that young people from nation on the other side of the world the like of our australian and kiwi friend be part of this scheme while the uk across that small body of water know as the channel or la manche remain on the outside look in will end with the word of the european union preamble nous somme uni dans notre diversité notre histoire commune nos valeur et notre avenir partagés will give hon member translation if they need one as this be debate in the name of his majesty opposition it be only right that share some personal reflection on the record of the conservative party when it be in government be feel generous madam deputy speaker be sure the house will be pleased to know that this will be brief speech but be also feel generous because want to begin with three simple and constructive suggestion for the conservative party on its future approach to the european union first good place to start would be by accept that the brexit deal sign in have do substantial damage to our economy fundamentally it be deal that put up barrier to trade as the office for budget responsibility conclude the uk economy will be small than previously expect that mean the country be on course to be billion poor than it otherwise would have be it be not the first time that the figure have be reference be the hon gentleman aware that it be base on the assumption that uk eu trade would fall and there would therefore be hit to our productivity in fact eu uk trade have rise since brexit so the whole basis of that assumption be wrong will he please acknowledge that it be curious be it not have see conservative front benchers talk up the obr when it be convenient but in this case when they do not agree with it they decry it and say we must not listen to it step one it be time to accept that it be deal that make the country poorer and it must be look at again my second tip would be to apologise to the business community he be no long member of this house so perhaps it be time to fully disown the former member for uxbridge and south ruislip as well as say sorry for his language towards the business community it might be time to say sorry to the of company that tell the british chamber of commerce that it have become hard for they to trade as direct consequence of the deal that be sign the highlight of the shadow minister speech be his reference to quantum leap he talk fondly of it but think it be time to jump back into the present my third piece of advice be therefore that the conservative party should listen to more podcast know for fact that the shadow chancellor the right hon member for central devon sir mel stride and the former chancellor the right hon member for godalming and ash sir jeremy hunt listen to certain weekly political podcast feature former chancellor george osborne know they listen to it because have hear the voice note they submit as question in recent week and month it be an excellent podcast but fear that while conservative mp be tune in they be not really listen george osborne could not be more clear the european union be our single big trading partner and if we be serious about grow the economy it be time for new and more ambitious deal on this he and his co host ed balls be united and they be absolutely right be pro european and an internationalist in my short time in this place have already have the opportunity to speak at great length in other debate on why now be the time for substantial reset in the relationship with our large trading partner today will not revisit those argument at length but we be less than week away from the uk eu summit and be very hopeful that we will see comprehensive deal that make progress on security trade and visa base youth mobility scheme this be not or while the conservative party in parliament may want to replay the old debate public opinion in the country have move on in an uncertain and volatile world there be no more important relationship for the uk than the one with our close neighbour and big trading partner people want to see progress they want to see deal that make material difference to their life be confident that be exactly what this labour government will deliver start with the summit next week it be wonderful to hear from the acclaimed globalist from both the liberal democrat benches and the labour benches who can not wait to bring we back into the eu for the record be oppose to do so not only because the british people vote the opposite way and we should honour the referendum but because as labour members seem to have forget we actually negotiate trade deal with europe what be interested in be the evasive nature of what the minister say from the dispatch box which commit we to nothing other than reset our relationship with the eu would like reassurance on what that mean what strategic partnership with the eu be he refer to what concession be he plan on make will some kind of new eu treaty renegotiation come out of this what kind of active or passive role be the uk planning on take at this summit none of that have be make clear will the hon lady give way in moment want to make some progress while none of that have be make clear we have hear from quite lot of back bench labour mps that we will have wonderful new trade deal and great new visa system for young people which give pause either we be not be tell fully what be go to happen at this summit or there be such anticipation for back door eu realignment that the labour party can not contain itself and its member can not help but tell we what they be plan on do my big concern in all this forgive for want reassurance from the dispatch box be that the outcome of the summit might involve concession of jurisdiction to the european court of justice or the application of any of the principle of supremacy of eu law would like guarantee from the minister on the floor of the house that that will not be the case there can be no question of the european court of justice be bring back via the back door through dynamic realignment with eu law want to hear reassurance from the minister that nothing will be discuss or renegotiate at this summit that would tear apart all the work we do through the withdrawal agreement and the retained eu law revocation and reform act to ensure that our law have supremacy over eu law that be the point many of we vote for brexit because we want to see our sovereignty and our border restore we want to see our law bring back under our sovereignty we want to ensure that we honour the commitment that we make with both the retained eu law act and the withdrawal agreement to move forward with the eu welcome trade deal all over the world want we to be as successful as we can be praise where praise be due if the labour party have achieve trade deal fine be happy to acknowledge that and to say well do we should be try to get trade deal with any country that we can the reason be ask for assurance from the dispatch box be that have see the labour party change its view on so many thing on brexit on trump on scrap winter fuel payment on energy bill on national insurance and on national insurance forgive for need reassurance from the dispatch box that the minister will not come back with some sort of doublespeak and expect we to enjoy that my hon friend scepticism be well found because many on the government benches do not say all could barely sustain the result of the referendum and regard it with outrage the people have speak and contradict the long stand prejudice of the liberal bourgeoisie that be why they try to block brexit indeed the prime minister try to block it time my hon friend be right therefore to be sceptical about labour my right hon friend make an excellent point we need to protect our brexit freedom and make sure that we hold the labour party to account we hear lot from the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman about all the wonderful thing he have plan for our free trade deal however be concerned that we be go to rewrite history that we be go to ignore the british people again and allow for dynamic back door realignment with the eu without give parliament or the british people say will the hon lady give way the hon gentleman have long time to speak but will give way once thank the hon lady for give way take third of the time that her colleague the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin take for his speech be she genuinely suggest that we should tell this house right now what we will be negotiate in brussels next week that we should give away the full detail of our strategy perhaps that be the attitude that the conservative government take when they be negotiate the trade deal with australia the conservative former secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs say that it be poor deal that let our farmer down give her approach no wonder that happen the hon gentleman should allow we to fulfil the deal to which we be committed we have put in place trade deal and the retained eu law revocation and reform act unless there be new negotiation to be have what exactly be the purpose of the summit be go to end my speech but the hon gentleman have inspire to continue the government amendment relate to nato but nato have nothing to do with the eu it be completely separate entity talk of dynamic realignment on defence come about after we leave the eu ensure an ever close union through military policing and social policy have always be part of the plan of the european union that be welcome to internationalist liberal democrats and labour members be sure that they would all love to have another way of bind we to the eu nato be separate it have one document that have be agree in the post war period will the hon member give way no will not nato give we an alignment on military matter that need to be protect and foster liberal democrat member mention our technical and military capability that be not the issue the issue be who bear the cost of our military capacity which we deploy in defence of europe and the free world nato be create post war during the cold war when we need that strategic protection in europe that still hold true why would we disrupt that and muddy the water with this motion which bring in nato which be separate from the eu why would we talk about something relate to the military in debate on eu jurisdiction rise will finish and allow other to speak want to hear from colleague from across the house because this be very interesting debate thank you madam deputy speaker for your time will really enjoy hear from the minister when they return from the summit on what exactly they have in mind for we and the eu be delighted to contribute to the debate be really pleased to hear the minister say from the dispatch box that at the eu summit we will focus on safety security and growth and boy do we need growth after year of chaos and disaster from the conservative party since leave the eu in business in monmouthshire and across the uk have face the many barrier that result from the tories botch brexit deal must declare an interest be big fan of the eu no that do not mean that want to rejoin the eu contrary to what the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey say we need well trading deal for our farmer and for business in monmouthshire be lucky enough when be at middlesex polytechnic many year ago to take part in the erasmus scheme go to europe for two year study in france learn french and do my final in french that cultural exchange that ability to go to another country be so important for our future and for our young people that be even before meet my catalan husband so now have lot of family in barcelona it be so important to have close tie with the european union as member of the uk eu parliamentary partnership assembly be delighted that we be receive with open arm in brussels early this year our trading relation with our near and large partner be too important to be take over by playground politic from the conservative party be so pleased that the new labour government be seek more co operative and mature relationship with the eu as one mep say thank goodness the grown up be back in charge wales have unique relationship with the eu especially regard our world famous delicious and well taste welsh lamb farmer and national farmers union cymru have tell that we need new sps deal in alone wales export million of food and drink to the eu and large proportion of that be red meat but uk export to the eu overall be down in on the subject of lamb will my hon friend reflect on the fact ask this of the hon member for beaconsfield joy morrissey that the previous government negotiate trade deal with australia that former conservative environment secretary describe as disaster for our farmer not least those farming lamb absolutely remember that well the reduction in export be mainly due to the increase in paperwork form filling and check and barrier to trade some company have simply give up because they have have such difficult time deal with the red tape company have also have to put up price which have impact consumer for farmer business and consumer we need strong beneficial sps agreement be so pleased that the minister be work hard on this our government no priority be economic growth and that would be support by grow co operation with the eu recently meet people from business in my constituency that export to the eu for proper discussion about what brexit have mean for they sadly be unsurprise by what they have to say have already mention the increase in admin which have hit their productivity they be do more work for less reward requirement for product information and documentation be create time consume and costly burden once the paperwork be all do there be another set of challenge one person meet say that delay at calais be borderline unmanageable that be especially impact the small and medium sized enterprise of monmouthshire one person speak to at the roundtable say the big issue currently be that inspection at calais for our product be very slow and at the same time we be restrict in term of time spend at the port due to dangerous good that be include in the load this be balance that be barely manageable for we person from another company say what disaster brexit be for the import export business for my company although through the agreement we be now back to zero tariff the net result be simply huge increase in admin and transport cost for which ultimately the consumer pay finally person say exhibit in the eu be much more complex and require great admin they give this example if business take as much as screwdriver to an exhibition in the eu it must fill in form for that screwdriver even though it be to be use only to put up an exhibition stand they say that every single piece of equipment must be count in and count out three overall strand emerge from my roundtable we must remove trade barrier we must have dynamic alignment of standard and business in my constituency would like return to some kind of youth exchange scheme like the one benefit from trade be one of the most pressing issue at hand as we seek to rebuild our relationship at the summit next week remove barrier to export will be essential for farmer business and consumer in monmouthshire as the government pursue their vital mission of economic growth will start with few word about the context of the debate clearly the accusation as though it be negative be that the campaign for brexit have sort of nostalgic backward look spirit and that those of we who support it do so in that spirit there be something in that because we be talk about restore british sovereignty there be sense that something good have be lose and need to be bring back all good revolution be in sense backward look the bad revolution be the progressive one while good revolution restore what be lose that be what brexit be about nevertheless despite that point which do concede fundamentally the case for brexit be forward look it be about put this country in the good possible position to meet the challenge of the century this century demand agility and the independence that sovereignty can allow obviously there must be co operation and close work in partnership britain have always be an outward look country but nimbleness and agility will be need in the highly contested new world that we be in that be what brexit be about and on number of hugely significant occasion since brexit we have already see why our independence be so necessary we see it in our covid response and in the context of ukraine and our defence policy and we see it now in our trade indeed we have do since brexit we have see it in the uk negotiation with the us which we can compare with those undertake by the eu in recent month on trade as say in an intervention the challenge be often make that brexit have harm our gdp because it bring about loss in productivity the reverse be true trade with the eu have grow since brexit and it be not the case that we have suffer detriment because of that trade be grow between the uk and the whole world include the eu but it be grow more with non eu country which make the point about why it be so necessary to reclaim sovereignty over our trade policy echo the concern raise by conservative colleague about what be be plan for next week in term of dynamic alignment on trade and call on the minister to rule out back door alignment arrangement with the eu we have see worry hint of that look forward to his response the case for brexit be not primarily about trade of course that be very important matter but let we acknowledge as think we all do that really people be vote to take back control of our border and our law those two vital issue remain contested because this government never believe in brexit and do not understand the call of the people for independence and sovereignty in those two key respect on border and immigration recognise the case for youth mobility scheme in principle the abstract case for reciprocal arrangement in which young people can spend few month or year work in another country be good thing the hon member for monmouthshire catherine fookes say that it be nice thing to do nevertheless we see the value of such scheme only when there be reciprocal arrangement and comparable number be come and go the same argument apply to the indian trade deal and its reciprocal arrangement on national insurance the fact be many more people will take advantage of the so call reciprocal arrangement by come to the uk than will go either to india or to the eu so we would not have level playing field as with free movement this youth scheme would be another way for many more people to come to this country undercut british worker and continue the stagnation of wage that we have suffer from for so many decade on law and take back control be concern about the threat of european court of justice oversight of the trade arrangement and potentially of the new veterinary agreement and deal on meat and dairy very much hope that the minister will definitively rule out any extension of ecj oversight the fact be we see this in the government rather mealy mouthed amendment to the motion that labour do not believe in brexit really honour the green party for its amendment because in that we hear the true voice of the pro european movement it be almost parody it suggest that free movement and rejoin the eu be what the country need and would be in the national interest indeed it suggest that it would be way to counter the hard right have green members see what be go on in europe the extension of the principle of ever close union deep alignment and concentration of power at the european level be stoke the far right across europe the fundamental reason why the conservative party have always be so successful historically be that we have speak for those people who otherwise would be outraged reform have be do well by the way do not associate reform with the far right because it speak for those outraged member of the public many of whom use to vote for we and for the labour party who feel that their parliament have let they down and politic have leave they behind that have happen across europe in much more dangerous way so if we be serious about counter the danger of the right we should be absolutely clear about there be no suggestion of any return to the eu let finish on reform its member be not here any more but there we go they have rather amusing amendment to the motion which simply replace the word conservative party with the word reform they be piggyback somewhat on our good work in desperate search to be relevant and to catch up with the conservative party which be lead the way on this agenda it be bit of problem and two thing occur to first that they can not even write an amendment of their own and they have to rely on we order the hon member might reflect on the fact that the amendment to which he refer be not even select so he should not even be speak to it will therefore end just by say that the amendment table by reform which appreciate be not select demonstrate that we be on the same page and deeply regret their opposition to what we be try to do reform member be not here so will answer that point they be not on the same page as we because their amendment which be not proper one do not fit on the same page of the order paper order the right hon gentleman be very experienced parliamentarian and know that he should be address the chair not face the back of the chamber apology madam deputy speaker that be lapse on my part all sort of thing go wrong when we mention reform so we have good leave that topic pay tribute to the conservative front bench members who have put forward an important and principled statement of the declaration that our party will stand for we support the decision of the british people to leave the european union repeat in multiple general election it be great shame that we can not hear the labour party make the same pledge be try to understand if at some point we will hear anything from the conservative party about what its member think could be improve in the brexit agreement that have be so bad for their party we be talk about get well brexit agreement than the one they negotiate be they say that what they do be perfect or can it be improve on if it can how everything else the hon gentleman have say have be negative there be two thing first we could do well on northern ireland but let we leave that whole topic for another day secondly the brexit agreement that we negotiate be absolutely right but the problem be the eu and the fact that it be protectionist bloc we decide to leave because we believe in sovereignty and leave decline quarter of the world economy the problem be the trade barrier that the eu erect unnecessarily and which be harmful to both party will leave it there may start with warning to my colleague elect in many of we who be here between and have be deeply trigger by this debate which have rerun and rehash the debate of old we have the scar on all our back warn hon member do not go down that rabbit hole no good can come of it interruption wager that the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois be laugh because he know how much will the hon lady give way well of course have to give way to my constituency neighbour be grateful to my neighbour for give way if she want to deliberately not go down that rabbit hole she should be talk to the government front benchers and lo bugs bunny do appear we have also hear from the man start argue with year ago as young campaigner about the merit or otherwise of work with europe it appear that the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin be on the other bus in the debate about brexit that be exactly it our constituent who might listen to this would be horrify to see we go backwards again act as if the last year have not happen and there be no evidence about what brexit mean will the hon lady give way do not want to try your patience madam deputy speaker you have have to sit through many lengthy speech rise oh go on will give way the hon gentleman be like this when be too who be it that be try to take we back to the past it be the government brexit be give this country its new future and the government be try to turn the clock back that be what be wrong hate to warn the hon gentleman but have horrible feeling that if he be to compare the speech he make today with many of those he make between and he might find that he would lose just minute on the ground of repetition that be go backwards this country deserve well let start with clear statement of intent brexit have happen we have leave be not here to prosecute the argument to rejoin we do not have time for that what we need be salvage operation because of the damage that have be do especially in world with so much uncertainty where tariff be now part and parcel of the everyday conversation and the damage that be be do to our constituent we can fight many thing in life but geography really be not one of they however hard some member on the conservative benches try we hear from the hon member for east wiltshire danny kruger the continue myth that somehow the isolation to our status that brexit have bring would bring we strength the last year indeed the last six month have show how clearly that be not the case in fact we be uniquely isolate and at risk as nation that be why what this government be do be absolutely right they be get on with sign trade deal try to sort out the damage that have be do and indeed look for that hat trick have to say to conservative members that there be no conspiracy here those of we who be here in remember exactly the detail of that deal and the fact that five year review process be write into it what we be go to see next monday be not some secret negotiation it be part of the trade and co operation hear conservative members chuntering hang on can see their tin foil hat beg they to look at the detail of the agreement which say clearly that there would be renegotiation point where we would review whether or not it be work be sorry that the shadow minister be not in his place he try to claim affinity with sam beckett but frankly suspect he be go to be more like jim trott from the vicar of dibley he will say no no no no no no no and then have to say yes the summit be not the end it be the start of the process of review the trade and co operation agreement and look at what be in the good interest of this country let be clear be absolutely committed to the idea that there should be parliamentary scrutiny my colleague on the front bench will know that have be concern that the european scrutiny committee be delete because think we should be able to discuss these matter however think there probably ought to be summit first in order for we to have something to discuss hope that will account for put in an advert for the backbench business debate that the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice and be go to have after the summit on may so that we parliamentarian may properly examine what come out of it sadly he be not in his place which be shame because know how strongly he feel about these thing and be sure he would want to talk about the benefit of brexit and other mythical creature the summit be the starting gun it be not the final deal and it be really important to look at it in that way this be the test for the motion today be the opposition really tell we that the trade and co operation agreement be perfection be there absolutely nothing in that agreement that they would not wish to amend revise or refine be there absolutely nothing in what it have deliver in the last five year that they be trouble by for example there be million few job in our economy because of the tory hard brexit and the academic who have study this recognise that that figure will rise to million by trade be down with the european union bloc that we do five time more trade with than we do with america over business have give up trading with europe all together because the truth about brexit be that it be just paperwork ream and ream of it and small business in this country have sadly have to up stick declare an interest as the chair of the labour movement for europe be not stand here argue to rejoin but be red against red tape and what see be the amount of be love the fact that conservative members be chuntere from sedentary position as if this be some sort of revelation perhaps they can borrow some tin foil from their fellow member and talk about conspiracy they would do well to reflect on the impact of the border trading operating model an entirely self inflict wound by the previous government on british farmer and british food supply chain that push up inflation because charge for pallet of food come into the country create more and more paperwork unless conservative member be genuinely tell we that they think chef kiss for the trade and co operation agreement it be right for we to look at whether there be thing we can do to deal with the problem it have create for our constituent include the billion of additional cost to household and to account for some of the myth that have be create again the hon member for east wiltshire he will accuse of be obsess but let we look at what he talk about say that somehow be out of the european union make our response to covid well well he might want to talk to the uk covid inquiry which find that it be the reverse it find that our failure to prepare be increase by the fact that we be deal with no deal brexit it harm our covid response he might even want to reflect on the word of the uk medicine regulator which say we could have use the emergency process to bring forward our own vaccine be sure that be what he be talk about the hon member also talk about ukraine he might want to reflect as he think about the summit on monday on how hard it be for we to make the case about the importance of stand with ukraine from outside of the room and that those who be less convinced who be part of the european union would have hear our message more clearly if we be inside the room particularly when it come to gas import we champion ukraine but we have to shout from outside rather than be part of the conversation from the start this summit need strong agenda and that be exactly what this government be talk about it be an agenda focus on fix the problem that this trade and co operation agreement have create that be what the public want they agree with we they do not want we to spend five to year on treaty renegotiation and the possibility of rejoin they want we to salvage this country from the damage that brexit have do two third of the country say that brexit be bad for the cost of living and say that it have have negative impact on the economy opposition members might want to reflect on the fact that that be nearly twice the number of people who think that immigration be bad for our economy the british public be not daft they be wise about what need to happen next they understand the value of defence deal they understand that in world with putin at our doorstep with the challenge we face and the uncertainty in other part of the world it be absolutely right and proper and will complement nato to work more closely with our european counterpart to increase investment in the uk defence industry and to collaborate on crime those of we who use to have constituent whose need be serve by the eu arrest warrant know the damage that the previous government deal have do those of we who want to see we step up the way we collaborate on international aid know that we need to get round the table with our european counterpart the good way to tackle those who might be stick on boat flee persecution be to try to stop the conflict at the source that be what collaborate on international aid with europe could offer the public understand the value of an sps deal which my hon friend the member for monmouthshire catherine fookes mention and the value of the pan euro mediterranean convention which deal with the paperwork about rule of origin thank to the tory hard brexit those rule mean that every time tomato be bring into this country to make pizza in the wirral extra paperwork come with it the public would want we to look at the vat rule because small business be now struggle with different vat regime they would also want we to sort out the carbon border adjustment mechanism that be how we save british steel which will be affect if there be divergence we need to look at how the emission trading scheme can be link and we can save british business million in charge the public want we to look at mutual conformity assessment to try to reduce duplication they want common sense on regulation the previous government try to bring in separate regulatory regime and understandably british business say that be twice the cost british business want to be able to sell to their neighbour they do not want extra piece of paperwork the previous government try to make we have separate regulation on airline safety as if an aeroplane take off in london would need to follow different set of regime if it land in berlin that be bonker understandably we walk back from it and we should not go back to those kind of argument just because those on the conservative benches have blindness when it come to europe this government have get their head on they be look at what they can do to help the chemical industry and supply chain and of course it be look at what deal on youth mobility might look like this be summit it be about have the conversation look at the detail and look at how we can support apprenticeship through youth mobility clearly youth mobility be not freedom of movement otherwise would have hear complaint from opposition members about the fact that we have freedom of movement deal with canada australia new zealand and can see conservative member say yes indeed presume they be go to call for the abolition of freedom of movement from canada then that would be consistency we could also do more to help our creative service and financial service and yes to resolve some of the tension in northern ireland many of we feel deeply that the people of northern ireland have suffer the most as result of the tory hard brexit yes we could do deal on fishing we could acknowledge the fact that our fishery industry feel sell out by the previous government by support they to be sustainable all those be issue that we can return to in that back bench debate but we can not do that if we do not have the summit we can not walk into the summit say no no no we need to walk in say what give what be the opportunity here how can we solve some of these challenge many many year ago one of my next door constituency neighbour be winston churchill we on the labour benches have become the defender of his vision of end conflict in europe conservative members spend all their time fight with each other and fight ghost we need to talk about the future we need to get away from the fantasy that somehow brexit will deliver and start get back to the cost of live crisis in our community and how we can help people rise be go to sit down promise but can not resist give way the hon lady mention churchill so can not let she sit down yet she talk about conflict within the conservative party winston churchill have few battle in his own party as she might recall he be not averse to that sometimes one have to stand up for what be right which be what conservative brexiteers do do she really think that winston churchill would have support the eu in its current form do she really think that he would have support what the echr have become how can she possibly claim winston churchill for the politic that she stand for go on think winston churchill would turn in his grave if he see what the conservative party and its libertarian wing have become and how the proud defence of our ability to participate in international organisation and to speak up for freedom for share interest and for the national interest have be diminish as result of the previous government approach to brexit as well as that of conservative members today will draw my remark to close the world be change we be live in world in which trade security co operation and climate issue move at pace many of we could not have predict remember it have be only day since president trump be elect what would happen next never more have we need good relationship with our neighbour monday be about be good neighbour the world might be change but we have the same old conservative party on the same page as reform that be all they seem to care about we care about the british interest look forward to hear what come out of the summit and look forward to the back bench debate to discuss it that really be take back control it be good to contribute to the debate on the matter of churchill be of course one of his successor in dundee where he be defeat by the only prohibitionist ever elect it be after his defeat that he go on to make his speech about europe after he have join the conservative party suspect that will in moment slip into the same level of exasperation express by the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy hope that she do not mind my saying that we agree on so much but before do let thank the conservative party for bring this motion have to say salute their how should one put it courage in secure the debate nobody be say that the conservatives brexit have be success in that context feel that they be lead with their chin today nobody be argue that it be something that have go well nobody be argue that it have become triumph rather we be debate and discuss today how to tackle problem that have be well set out by the government be sorry to say that brexit continue to cast spell over the political class at westminster we have hear rerun of some of the argument and some of the falsehood about the european union but let we talk about the evidence will be brief as it have be well cover there be the drop in gdp that the treasury have outline and the drop in trade that be part of the budget document the uk have now lose more than it ever contribute financially with absolutely nothing in return there be the loss of job the loss of regional structural fund that be never replace despite the promise the loss of opportunity for sme and critically the loss of opportunity for our young people can remember when the brexiteers tell we that lot of country would follow the uk out the door nobody have follow the uk and wonder why it lean into the sense of british exceptionalism that we hear time and again the uk have be leave impoverished as direct consequence of those argument have hear the warm word from labour members about want to be close to europe but they be fundamentally grab hold of hard tory brexit fail to see why labour government do not stand up for europe more rather than try to imitate fail conservative policy and fail reform policy let we not forget that reform have track record and it be not good one labour should take they on on that track record will the hon gentleman give way before move on to the treasury and some of the right hon gentleman point will give way to he the hon gentleman be point to an empty bench when he talk about reform by the way because its member have not turn up on the structural fund know the hon gentleman would not want in any way to say something misleading after brexit my constituency attract government funding of something like million or million for road new leisure centre and the regeneration of our town centre in the last year we be in the eu do he know that it cost we billion to be member what sort of price be that seventeen billion be less than half the amount lose from the public finance those be not my figure but the labour mayor of london figure that be money lose without get anything back in return and the scottish government have lose million in money that have not come from regional structural fund let turn to devolution and sovereignty the eu be union fit for the century the uk be barely union fit for the century because it have not be modernise since we have brexit deal that rip up the devolution settlement which scottish labour and other speak out against but which have now be impose on the devolved administration in way that the eu could never do to its member state remind member that not one of the independent sovereign member state of the eu consider themselves any less independent or sovereign for be member of the european union not one of they just one do and it be this british nationalist exceptionalism that be so utterly damaging to everybody in the uk the most sovereign country in the world be north korea because we give up tiny bit of sovereignty with deal all these other state that see themselves as the hon member for spelthorne lincoln jopp talk of ukraine ukraine want to join the eu he talk of democracy the democrat in georgia and moldova drape themselves in european flag because they see that as the future of the rule of law democracy and great wealth for their country every country that have join the eu get well off the one country that leave get bad off and its citizen have few right we all have to recognise that the eu be security actor and majority of european state now see the eu and nato as the twin pillar of security those sovereign state see that while welcome the uk government steadfast support for ukraine both the current and previous administrations we be not realistic about the challenge we face putin russia fear the eu that be why we see the initial war in ukraine in because of the eu accession agreement we know that and everyone else get it except those in the united kingdom the eu provide food security and energy security for its member and sit outside leave we more isolated and less secure why be the uk so exceptional what make the uk so special how be it that everybody else have get it wrong but the uk have somehow get it right it be piece of nonsense that be damage we all turn to young people be get tired of hear labour talk about youth mobility scheme would like the minister to tell whether youth mobility scheme will be put in place and then say how it will compare with the free movement we all enjoy when we be in the eu we be leave young generation with few right and opportunity than we ourselves enjoy and that be failure of our political generation an abject failure be sorry to say that the prime minister rhetoric yesterday feed into that that he be call out by lord dubs labour member of the house of lords and yet praise by the leader of alternative for germany should surely give labour member some cause for reflection some cause to reflect on how other be see they right now would expect such rhetoric from reform and other but do not expect it from the labour party and say to labour members sorry oppose you sometimes and you stand against but do not expect that from the labour party the bad part of this be that we be get it from labour government who do not really believe in what they be do know that from work with they over the year they do not believe in the damage this be do what be damage we in politic right now be that people be stand up for thing they do not really believe in they do not say what they believe in they might say believe in leave the european the right hon member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois talk about parliament just hear that in parliament where we do not have an idea of british sovereignty the definition of scottish sovereignty would encourage he to read maccormick lord advocate be different from the idea of english sovereignty because the supremacy of parliament do not exist think it be fair to say that in the year have be here generally most people have know what believe in but be the reason the hon gentleman be so incredibly angry this afternoon because from his point of view he lose not only one referendum but two on scottish independence and then on the european union will concede the point know what the right hon gentleman believe in be not surprised that he want to take on not on the substance of what say but rather on some of the semantic because as the secretary of state for scotland say democracy cease to be democracy when it cease to have the ability to change its mind my appeal would be this yes believe in independence believe that the european union provide model that the uk union do not that be something believe in and some member disagree with and respect they for that and know that scottish labour members disagree with on that and respect they for that as well what struggle with be that we know this be bad deal with europe we know that stay outside the custom union and the single market be make we poorer every day would encourage member to stand up and put the case of what they believe in because that be the way to return respect back into politic not repeat what have be say in the past but truly look to the future will keep my remark fairly brief and we have be treat to lot of good well inform speech on respect and speak up for what we believe in it be important to remember the poison that be bring into the body politic before enter this place on the local election night be particularly concerned in my constituency about the return of reform councillor whose facebook page have be describe by hope not hate as slew of anti muslim content that really worry it worry lot of my constituent and it worry lot of people across the country be very disappointed with reform and question some of its vetting process to return to the matter in hand meet every week with business in my constituency with farmer small business business that export and those that want to export but do not feel they have the facility or support in place to do so there be failure in the brexit deal and know that there be many sober and mature member on the other side of the house who recognise those shortcoming and this summit be an opportunity to recognise that we live in world that be change every single day where the demand of yesterday be not the same as the demand of tomorrow we have government who be look to the mature reasonable and responsible thing to do which be to improve the day to day life of our constituent which be what we be send here to do speak to farmer who suffer from be catch up in red tape when try to export or small business who do not have access to the rolls royce access programme that large business do to go abroad and that be one of the major failing of the previous government trade policy hope that in wind up the minister will address how we can get small business export across the world as part of the slew of trade deal that we have just sign it be really important that we do not go into conspiracy theory bait on backslide on the eu and what that mean do not particularly care about chase view from account amplify by elon musk care about get good result job and outcome for my constituent for far too long my constituency be deny voice because it be safe conservative seat it be seat where member would go up every six week and not really engage with the solid issue we have school in my constituency that be build eight and half year ago that be already structurally unsound that be pretty damn failure of the conservatives we need to ensure that the system we have inherit work properly urge the minister and the government to get to the negotiating table work through the kink in the deal work out what be go wrong and hold business back and approach the issue with mature honest and genuine discussion on how we can improve thing as it say on my party membership card we achieve more by our common endeavour ultimately we need that approach we need an internationalist approach root in pragmatism that do not fall victim to some of the appalling cynicism and rather brutal mischaracterisation that we often see from opposition members thank you madam deputy speaker for call to contribute to this important debate on the forthcoming uk eu summit next monday as someone who have hope the house will concede follow these matter reasonably closely for number of year will focus on three broad area will say something about the summit itself make some point about the very worrying suggestion that we be about to waive large part of our fishing right and raise my concern and those of many other about the potential for so call dynamic alignment by which the united kingdom effectively would become passive rule taker despite vote peacefully and democratically to leave the european union in the first place before do that pay personal tribute to sir roy stone who have tragically pass away he be constituent of mine and live just few minute away from once inadvertently canvass he some year ago during the local election as highly professional public servant he be completely inscrutable about his voting intention subsequently work with he closely for two year in the coalition whips office between and he be always very patient especially with when be the vice chamberlain of the household he always give well inform and canny advice he believe passionately in the institution of parliament and the principle of representative democracy which he serve so well our thought and prayer be with his widow dawn and her family may he rest in peace and always be warmly remember crucial summit will take place between the leader of the uk and the eu in london next month recall be tell repeatedly during the referendum campaign that if we leave the eu we would be isolate and friendless all the meeting that have take place in london recently include one with virtually every eu leader at lancaster house regard the so call coalition of the willing show how absolutely ludicrous that assertion be however accord to multiple medium report it seem as if this summit could involve some kind of defence pact between ourselves in the uk and the european union as have front bench responsibility for defence shall not dwell at length on those matter but hopefully we will have lot more to say on they next week once the detail of any such agreement have be make public and crucially we have have an opportunity to read the small print nevertheless be sure that the government tactic will be to try to talk almost exclusively about defence as form of camouflage to mask likely concession both on our fishing right and potentially relate to our food when the british people vote democratically to leave the european union some nine year ago they do so in order to decide their destiny for themselves it would be completely against the spirit of the referendum under the guise of some kind of reset with the eu to surrender that principle next week moreover after the absolute chaos of the labour government propose chagos deal the spanish foreign minister assert only yesterday that the uk should make concession over the sovereignty of gibraltar as part of our reset at the summit this be despite the fact that the gibraltarians themselves vote by majority of to maintain the current position in their own referendum on the subject margin so emphatic that even the snp would have to accept it on fishing in early during boris johnson premiership the united kingdom agree what be know as the trade and co operation agreement between the uk and the eu while there have be much recent talk of trade deal include with india and now the us the tca be in effect major comprehensive trade deal with the eu negotiate in the context of have leave the european union for the benefit of the hon member for bournemouth east tom hayes who be no long in his place that agreement be page long know because read it in essence the tca guarantee virtually tariff free trade between the uk and the eu moreover the fact that we have leave the eu include the custom union mean that we be able to negotiate unilateral trade deal of our own around the world will the right hon member give way in moment while we be in the custom union it be possible to negotiate those agreement only collectively via the auspex of the eu that be fundamental difference it be important to note that by use this critical brexit freedom we have be able to negotiate almost independent trade deal with nation around the world since we leave the eu include important commonwealth partner such as australia new zealand and now india we have also join the trans pacific partnership which materially improve our access to asian market worth trillion of dollar moreover will the right hon member give way if the hon lady will let finish this point promise will do so but want to enjoy this bit we now have the delightful visage of our ambassador to the united states one lord mandelson have to acknowledge through metaphorically grit tooth that we have be able to negotiate trade deal with the united states albeit one that be limit in scope only because we leave his beloved european union think our peter be struggle with that will give way to the hon lady who have be patient if those trade deal be such sunlit upland and such wonderful deal can the right hon member explain to why our seafood export to the eu plummet by since the brexit deal why do that happen on his watch if that deal be so good the hon lady pre empt if she will give moment will get to fish very shortly the tca part head contain transition arrangement relate to fishing in essence the tca allow for period of over five year during which there would be temporary arrangement on access to uk water by eu fishing fleet after that under international maritime arrangement the united kingdom would become solely responsible for its own territorial water out to nautical mile in some place as this transition period be now approach its expiration in the eu be push very hard to maintain its access to our fishing water and it would seem even to expand its access in certain case be we naive enough to give in it would be complete betrayal of our fisherman if the united kingdom labour government be now to grant major concession to the eu in what will become indisputably our own sovereign water once again come will the right hon gentleman give way in second the bourgeoisie will have to wait while our sovereign right be enshrine in both the tca itself and wide maritime law we have yet to see the final detail of whatever faustian pact the government have agree with the eu on fishing however our fisherman and those of we on the opposition benches although not reform members who be not here will be watch the government very closely and will be highly alert to the prospect of sell out on fish we then come to veterinary matter and sps and ultimately therefore food which would involve the united kingdom in process know as dynamic alignment in essence this mean that if the eu be in any way to change or modify its rule in those area we would in turn be compel to follow the eu regardless of the wish of our own parliament in other word we would become rule taker in those area even though we have leave the european union moreover it seem that these arrangement would apply throughout the united kingdom and in the event of dispute that would be arbitrate by the european court of justice rather than the uk supreme court or even an international tribunal will the right hon gentleman give way in moment to have leave the eu but submit to become passive rule taker would be entirely contrary to the spirit of the referendum that be why time and again today no minister will admit that the government be go to do it next week will the right hon gentleman give way no when labour talk about reset in its general election manifesto there be absolutely no reference to rule take as part of any such accommodation labour would therefore be give away our right entirely without the consent of the british people that must be fiercely resist and if necessary overturn moreover there be the prospect of additional concession over everything from so call youth mobility scheme euphemism for return to freedom of movement in another guise to capitulation over net zero mechanism and specifically the eu carbon border adjustment mechanism or cbam which would make our remain industry even more internationally uncompetitive than the right hon member for doncaster north ed miliband have achieve to date as someone who sit here during the last parliament as the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy kindly mention and witness night after night and week after week the then labour shadow secretary of state for exit the european union now the prime minister pull every procedural trick from the depth of erskine may in order to try to keep the united kingdom in the european union at almost any price and despite the referendum be in no way surprise that his government be now attempt this act of capitulation our prime minister have always be passionate europhile in short he remain remainer in his heart of heart and he always will what the labour government be up to and say again that they will try to use defence pact in order to hide it be begin process of gradually take we back towards and even back into the european union if they think they can get away with it they will never risk another referendum because in almost up to the last minute the poll be show that remain might win but when it come to it the british people have the temerity to vote to govern themselves despite the good effort of the british establishment and project fear what they will do be try to take we back in very gradually via process of grandmother footstep or to make another analogy try to boil frog slowly if they get away with submission next week despite their manifesto commitment they will eventually try to take we back into the single market although no doubt under some other name and if they can get away with that they will suggest that we might as well rejoin the custom union they will put the argument to the british people that we be so far back into the bloom thing that we might as well go the whole hog and rejoin it entirely all without vote or the consent of the people of the united kingdom at any stage whatsoever just want to draw something out dynamic alignment be not small thing it be huge because it be rule take can my right hon friend imagine our engage in any other trade arrangement with the united states or australia for instance or the trans pacific partnership and be in position where we have to say we will accept your rule and your adjudication it would be far well to do this via process of mutual enforcement of which my right hon friend have always be staunch advocate when the minister sum up the debate we will ask he if he will rule out very clearly any prospect of dynamic alignment at the summit next week will the hon gentleman give way in moment this be yes or no question perhaps the minister at that time because he would not answer my right hon friend question yesterday will give we an honest answer to an honest question in fact if he want to do it now will give way to he stunning silence well as he have not the gut to get up will give way to his back bencher thank the right hon gentleman for his nomenclature and be most grateful to my jacobin friend for take my intervention do not want he to finish without have the opportunity to answer the question that my hon friend the member for monmouthshire catherine fookes put to he export of uk seafood to the european union have fall by since brexit and there have be lot of new check and there be lot of new paperwork and bureaucracy what do he put that down to export of seafood have collapse do he put that down to brexit or to something else people have make market choice but under the common fishery policy we have the absurdity of so call discard our fisherman have to throw fish many of which be already dead back into the sea in order to comply with the absurdity of the cfp hopefully we will never return to that this be something that have look at quite closely the reason for the collapse be that the united kingdom be not in the internal market so we do not give direct applicability and direct effect to eu sps law the eu procedure be to check every consignment of shellfish come into the eu to see if it comply with eu standard even though the provision in eu law on clean river clean beach and clean water all exist in the united kingdom and our provision be probably of superior standard to those that apply in much of the eu defer to my hon friend who be clearly subject matter expert will conclude because other want chance to speak the labour government will go for dynamic alignment they will sign we up as passive rule taker at the behest of the eu despite the british people vote in to take back control of their law have absolutely no doubt that if the labour government get away with this surrender summit early next week that be precisely what they will do it be therefore very important that we alert the british people and the medium that serve they to exactly what labour be up to in an attempt to expose the situation and prevent it get any bad in summary we will not allow our obsessively europhile prime minister in this context our white flag man to surrender our right to govern ourselves this surrender to the eu have absolutely no democratic mandate and we will oppose it tooth and nail if necessary we will eventually overturn it remember what the booklet in the referendum say this be your decision the government will implement what you decide the british people decide to take back control of their own law it be not for labour to give they away this have be an interesting debate but to reflect on the unhappy nostalgia of my hon friend the member for walthamstow ms creasy it be quite clear that some people be have trouble move on as we need to the summit be happen because of the process agree by the conservative party when it be in government this be not surrender summit it be summit for success for business and business people and we can only achieve that if we move on in this debate at one point think bill cash be go to stand up and contribute we be not move forward as parliament and think about the real priority of the british people and our future relationship with europe but other people be prepared to move on and want to do so today be pleased to have the chance to meet representative of the scottish advisory forum on europe know as safe at an event that have the pleasure of co host with the hon member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins it be an excellent event that reflect all their great work in collaborate with their colleague and counterpart in europe they have be collaborate not just with government but with civil society academia and whole range of organisation because that be in their interest this be about grow the scottish economy and further the interest of the scottish people pay tribute to my good friend dr irene oldfather who as chair of safe have do so much to promote ongoing collaboration with colleague in europe she be happy constituent of my hon friend the member for central ayrshire alan gemmell and be do vital work we should go into these negotiation in spirit of collaboration seek mutual benefit in order to build well relationship between the uk and our european union colleague put on record my thank to irene oldfather on very hard issue and we have see today that it be very difficult she be do something extraordinarily constructive and think we can all learn from her work could not agree more on the issue of learn it be so important good and welcome to hear that ahead of this vital summit the minister for the constitution and european union relation my right hon friend the member for torfaen nick thomas symonds attend meeting with safe in edinburgh yesterday understand that it be hold at the scotch whisky association so hope he enjoy an excellent afternoon this be good point at which to mention that our trade deal with india be secure billion for the scottish whisky industry over the next five year and extra job this fantastic deal be in no way frustrate by our pursue well deal with the european union at that event yesterday the minister meet young people who look to our future in europe rather than seek to debate the battle of the past they ask the minister to find way to ensure that they have the opportunity to work and study in europe hope he can think inventively about how that can be achieve within the policy framework that the government have set out because the previous scheme be important not only for the young people who participate but for scotland economy it be worth million annually deliver in value for every invest economic growth be rightly the priority for this government if they change course in these negotiation in the way propose by the opposition that would not be put the national interest first the minister and his colleague should proceed with the vital work that they have take forward with their european counterpart ahead of the summit that be the right thing to do for economic growth and in our national interest the government approach which be absolutely essential recognise the eu status as our big trading partner it account for of our export and of our import be encourage to hear from the minister that issue that be vital to growth in my constituency of glenrothes and mid fife include close co operation on energy policy which hope may include increase co operation with the north seas energy co operation be the issue on the agenda next week hope that there will be measure that benefit small business in my constituency particularly in the creative sector rightly at the election our party commit to make it easy for musician to tour in europe that be vital for the future of our brilliant creative sector in scotland and in the uk and hope that we can make progress in this area of course we have to respect the decision of the brexit referendum however while we should not simply repeat the debate on brexit in this house as we seem to neither should we repeat the mistake of the previous government who fail to ensure that our new relationship with the european union create the right environment for trade and co operation in key area of policy this government have already make significant progress on reset the uk relationship with the european union in our national interest and particularly in line with this government policy on economic growth my hon friend have cover range of group he mention farmer business young people and the creative sector but be it not the truth that all these group be simply look for practical measure that the government can take to improve their lot and to improve our relationship with europe that could involve cut red tape unlock energy and deepen security co operation without be to the detriment of the previous agreement could not agree more this will absolutely be in line with previous agreement in our new relationship with europe we be do far well than the previous government who agree very poor deal which result in economic decline we could have achieve more with different approach urge my right hon friend the minister to go far fast on this policy area and government priority urge he not to be deflect by opposition members who wish to fight the battle of the past the government be right to seek well relationship with europe and to be ready for the opportunity and indeed the test that lie ahead for our continent in human affair there be persistent fascination with novelty it be curious that people clamour for what be different for the other whatever that other might look like it be this fascination that lead to the similar interest in indeed preoccupation with internationalism even to the point where that mean give up power to someone beyond these shore it be damaging preoccupation at its most curious it lead to the peculiarity of be sorry the hon member for arbroath and broughty ferry stephen gethins be not here because he make remarkably articulate speech as tell he afterwards representative of nationalist party make the case against nationalism and member who believe in sovereignty make the argument that sovereignty do not really matter although he do qualify that by say that sovereignty in scotland mean something different he and will no doubt have an opportunity to debate that at some length in future that fascination fuel the sentiment that after the referendum pervade the labour benches and the liberals it be matter of record that do not have liberal bone in my body of any kind whether socially culturally politically or economically and shall make the case against free trade in few moment as result of that fascination the cadre of people who populate good deal of the establishment the hon member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman will know this because lot of the establishment live in his constituency it be not surprising that they pick one of their own really could not bear to come to term with the result of the referendum for the people have speak and of course the people will directly contradict the assumption the presumption of that establishment which they have foist on the people for donkey year do not say by the way that all the guilt lie on the other side of the chamber this begin with harold macmillan and then be carry on by ted heath who sell out our fisherman it go on and on the gallery of villain be almost endless one think of roy jenkins there be noble exception include labour peter shore and tony benn who make the case for national self government in what my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith tell be one of the good speech he have hear in this chamber in his year here on our side there be noble exception too enoch powell stand proud among those but there be many other interruption there be michael foot of course on the other side will not go into the whole list madam deputy speaker just in case you think be go to be think of our lamented friend sir bill cash who give such great service he be see as bit of an outsider for the great bulk of his career and then in the last part of it be prove right my goodness what be well than that in politic they say all political career end in failure but bill cash do his political career end in success it have not end yet sir bill be sprightly and he have be texte some of we throughout the debate do my right hon friend agree with that sir bill great success be the sovereignty clause which finally say after year of campaigning that this parliament be sovereign that be on the statute book because of bill my right hon friend be absolutely right sir bill political career have not end his parliamentary one have can like my right hon friend acknowledge that sir bill have texte this afternoon along with no doubt many my right hon friend the member for chingford and woodford green just gather this tension between the will of the people as express in the referendum and the prevail assumption of what describe early as the liberal establishment underpin this debate in the spirit of generosity which tend to employ there be exception by the way member can intervene on if they like note that there be those on the government benches such as the hon member for walthamstow ms creasy who acknowledge albeit grudgingly that the referendum result can not be reverse and that we can not go back into the eu that be not what those people say immediately after the referendum of course they fight hard for age to try to frustrate the outcome they use every parliamentary technique they could conjure as well as extra parliamentary technique include well fund legal case to try to derail brexit the scepticism personify by my hon friend the member for beaconsfield joy morrissey who say she be doubtful about the government intent be well found know that the minister will want to reassure we when he rise at the end of the debate that that scepticism in his case at least will not prove to be prediction of what might happen next scepticism be well found though because of the history it be labour politician who say you do need crystal ball when you ve get the record bevan of course we have the record book when it come to labour and worse still when it come to the liberal democrats hope the minister will be crystal clear as he have be invite to be throughout the debate on dynamic alignment or as think it would be well describe dynamic realignment realign our relationship with the eu such alignment would bring we close not to our friend and neighbour in europe of course co operation and collaboration be natural part of mature policy but to the eu in term of governance regulation law interference in our affair and crucially jurisdiction it be the exercise of authority that we be really debate here not the ability or indeed the willingness to share but the danger of succumb to power that take authority far and far from the british people the hon member for bournemouth east tom hayes talk about some of the challenge the world face and the answer to those global challenge he be right to do so by the way think the first half of his speech be very good although it get bad as it go on the answer to those challenge be not to become more globalist or to give in to the force he describe that exert power in an unaccountable way but to bring power back to the people when those of we who advocate brexit speak of take back control we do so partly because we want power to be vest in this parliament which be accountable to the people whom that power affect you madam deputy speaker be almost model for this and other would do well to follow your model we be answerable to and know by our constituent they understand that we make decision on their behalf new members of the house will be come to term with what that mean and its relentlessness do not mind it myself but can see how it could wear down soul less forceful and robust than it be that constant interaction with our constituent that be the lifeblood of democracy whoever know who their member of the european parliament be could not remember who the tories be let alone the member from the other party people certainly do not enjoy that kind of intimate relationship and sense of mutual ownership when we be member of the eu we feel as though we own our constituency and they feel as though they own we and quite right too interruption be be chide madam deputy speaker first hear of my hon friend the member for bridgwater sir ashley fox when he arrive here never know who he be before then say that without disrespect my right hon friend be correct while be in the european parliament opinion poll research be conduct into whether people could name their member of the european parliament and only of british people could name any member of the european parliament regrettably it be not it be typical of my hon friend humility and good humour that he should acknowledge that in the chamber in such an open and frank way and pay tribute to he for it the scepticism that have describe and try to articulate take the form of real doubt about what realignment will really mean let just deal with three or four specific speak early in an intervention about security and defence of course it be right that we have continue relationship with our neighbour in those term we do work with the agency across europe but the critical security relationship we enjoy be with the five eyes country by the way we also enjoy relation with many other country in the world outside the five eyes and europe and it be vital that we reinforce that relationship that of course overlaps with our commitment to nato and defence there may be some virtue in information sharing indeed there certainly be virtue in various kind of co operation but anything that undermine the sovereignty of that security and defence alliance seem to be highly questionable and also risky which be bad let turn now to free movement although the referendum be not all about immigration immigration be perhaps the most pressing and salient matter during those time people resent and resist free movement and they want to bring it to an end for many the term take back control epitomise the need to control our border to decide who come here and who do not although it may be understandable that people want to wax lyrical about young people be able to travel across the continent what they say less enthusiastically or do not say at all be that young people from the entire continent will want to travel here until we know the term of that that could easily mean those people compete with britons for scarce job we have large number of young people not in education employment or training no government have deal with that satisfactorily start speak about this more than year ago previous labour governments and indeed conservative governments do not really grasp that nettle as firmly as they should have do disturbingly the trend be upwards and so do not want people in my country to have to compete for education and training place and for other opportunity with possibly ten of thousand of people who have enter the country by those mean there will be suspicion that it be the beginning of return to free movement what do mass immigration do the prime minister be right about this yesterday he be very late convert but the bible say that we must welcome all convert with enthusiasm what mass immigration do be to displace investment in recruitment training and retention of worker and in automation and improve workplace make we ever more dependent on low skilled labour it have the effect of stultify the economy any suggestion that we may return to that will inhibit perhaps ruin the government intention of improve productivity if we really want to deal with productivity we have to create high tech high skilled economy be fearful that that broad consideration will not necessarily hold sway when we get into negotiation with the eu on this issue of some relaxation of the bar on free movement which be bring by the referendum mindful that there be enthusiastic insightful and bright colleague on all side of the house but mainly on the conservative side who want to contribute to the debate will draw my remark to close can hear colleague say no go on but be go to resist those overture and finish with this thought lewis say we be what we think we be think we be proud independent nation that have make disproportionate contribution as part of western civilisation to world history think that our past be noble and should give we sense of achievement and pride do not buy the self loathing that seem to have take hold with too much of the very establishment that deride early will the right hon member give way will happily give way let we see whether the hon member be self loathe individual trust that be not hope that the right hon gentleman appreciate when say early how excited be for the prospect ahead of we want to thank he for identify couple of time and associate with my constituent which be certainly proud of also thank the right hon gentleman and number of his colleague for make feel like have be in this place not for month but for year and for give the privilege of see the brexit debate live writ large again it be rare opportunity that do not know would get as member of this house and be most grateful invite the hon gentleman to look at it through this prism for all intent and purpose be brexit stand for brexit be patriot proud of my working class origin be determined to do my good for my constituent and my country and be drive by combination of the national interest and the common good that be the spirit that inspire brexit it inspire those of we who campaign for it and those who vote for it which of my constituent in south holland and the deepings do be bit resentful that boston and skegness next door have an even high percentage but it be only by as say lewis say that we be what we think we be think that we be proud country who can stand in the world in collaboration with other nation of course but free and sovereign labour can not have it both way it can not say that we have do great deal with india because we do not have to kowtow to the eu and that we have do great deal with the us because we escape the clutch of the eu while at the same time say that we want to creep back in and for they to have more say in any future deal we might do let end with the word of one of my political hero joseph chamberlain who understand that to protect our economy we need to protect the job industry and enterprise that be part of it and not to give in to the free trade liberal he say democratic government rest on the confidence and support of the whole nation and not on the favour of any limited class would be very strong it would know how to make itself respect and how to maintain the obligation and the honour of the country no member of this house should do less than that rise order be now instate an immediate three minute time limit call luke charters next monday be really important day as the uk rebuild our relationship with europe this be big issue for my constituent because they be fail for far too long let be clear can not believe that the conservatives think that they have the credibility to run an opposition day debate on this topic the absolute cheek of they be off the scale they come in here to talk down the merit of the youth mobility scheme an arrangement that we already have with many non eu country what they be really do be demonstrate yet again prehistoric approach to young people across this country it be no wonder that support for they among that age group be virtually extinct they want to deny reset that will benefit our national security food security and economic security with our big and most proximate trading bloc my hon friend be make an excellent powerful speech do he agree that the summit be not about give away power but about work with our european neighbour in our mutual interest of which there be many my hon friend be spot on that be why the conservative party be completely irresponsible conservative members be so out of step with reality that may as well be ask they to take advice from the stone age they say that they want to take back control once upon time but the reality be that over the last eight year they completely lose control of our economy of our border and of our future they do not want the pragmatic sensible summit next week that will be focus on the future not the past far cry from the chaos and conservative circus they preside over let move on to something we should all be welcome youth mobility scheme it be important that we strike the right balance with that just like we have with other country we already share deal with but unlike conservative members who focus on themselves rather than the public let we talk about how such scheme would matter to ordinary people nobody would want an year old at the start of their adult life eager to explore the world to be limit to just day in europe it be natural for young people to swap bishopthorpe in my constituency for barcelona for year or so or copmanthorpe for copenhagen as parent in york would love for my child to have the privilege to enjoy an experience like the youth mobility scheme an opportunity that can open mind and broaden horizon research from the university of oxford have show that mobility scheme lead to returnee who launch their own enterprise start social venture reform hospital practice and launch tech start up that sound good to really important topic that we must address in the forthcoming summit be defence before we leave young people opposition members have say that we be not do enough for our young people and that scheme would cause problem do my hon friend welcome the fact that yesterday the prime minister say that we must put british young people at the front of the queue for skill and training the government have already commit million for train up young engineer chippie and brickie order thank my hon friend for that intervention youth mobility scheme could be sensible and pragmatic and lead to opportunity across the continent let briefly touch on defence last week hold westminster hall debate about the benefit of multilateral defence bank be pleased to have with the founder of the defence security and resilience bank rob murray who be an inspirational ex army officer really believe that the uk could anchor multilateral defence bank at the heart of any future defence pact with europe that be the single most transformative lever that the government could pull to fortify our collective security act as an industrial deterrent to russia would welcome my hon friend the minister think about that run into next week finally will touch on holiday over the next few month hard work family across the country will travel to airport up and down the uk to go away for some hard earn summer sun since leave the eu many of we have land at foreign airport to see huge queue and wait with envy as other pass straight through would really welcome it if as small gesture to give back to the grafter of this country we could look at new arrangement with the eu to ease airport congestion will the hon member give way will not because we be on three minute limit for speech perhaps the hon member do not want to give back to the grafter of this country but think we should be help hard work brits get through to the gate and straight to their sunbed could we have some co operation with the eu on airport congestion there be lot that could talk about but will leave it there this be about move on pragmatically and secure our future just as we have recently with india and the us next week the eu and the uk will meet in london for much vaunted reset of our post brexit relationship if that deliver real benefit for our country that be great let we hear they but forgive because be doubter have learn two lesson from my miserable direct experience of how labour operate first do not trust the prime minister between and and other watch he as the shadow brexit secretary twist every parliamentary rule to block what the british people vote for that be not principle opposition it be sabotage in so do he connive to empower brussels in way that directly and actively undermine our national negotiating position he be not alone in that endeavour but it be spectacle that disgrace this house order may respectfully suggest to the hon lady that she need to be very careful in the language that she choose to use about the prime minister be deliberately careful to adhere to the rule of the house madam deputy speaker but hope my intent be clear let be clear do not think that the prime minister be straight dealer he say what suit he pose as man of decency and hope order suggest the hon lady withdraw her comment in which she have accuse the prime minister of not be straight if that be outside the boundary of what be acceptable will withdraw the comment my second lesson be that when labour negotiate britain lose we have already see it in this parliament from the chagos island to the backroom deal with the union it be ideological naivety dress up as serious and sober diplomacy labour think that sign deal be the same as secure good one it be not and all that will become clear let we remind ourselves that brexit be never rejection of europe and its people it be demand for democratic control over our law our border our trade and our future the hon lady be great fan of honesty in this chamber so be sure that she will give an honest answer one way of understanding brexit be that it replace circular flow of people with one way flow of people do she think that brexit increase or decrease migration into this country brexit allow we to introduce point base system and that be what we do will accept that mistake be make in the introduction of that point base system but the key be that we can tweak and tune that to accommodate the need of our economy and those of the people we represent the british people could feel the world change around they and they know instinctively that the uk need to be nimbler fast and more accountable in respond to those current be they the movement of people or the regulation of business we will not let it be say that there have be no brexit benefit because that be simply not true for start we no long hand between billion and billion year net to brussels we have secure trade deal include from the fast grow comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership nation whatever we think about last week us uk tariff deal we be not pay the same prohibitive trade taxis as the eu we be set our own course in area such as ai financial service and agritech those be not abstract win or nostalgic impulse they be real opportunity for modern outward face britain if next week summit can ease practical friction that be all well and good want what work for british people however be worried that labour do not know what it want only that it want deal be worried it do not grasp what the eu will demand in return and be worried that labour think slick comms matter more than real outcome for the british people today we lie down clear marker on immigration there should be no youth mobility scheme it might sound harmless but let we not be naive and have partial free movement by stealth on defence and regulation we want no dynamic alignment and be fascinate by the minister refusal to say anything far on that matter if labour really think it have great deal there be simple thing it could do which be to bring that deal back to this house for vote we be here to look forward to the uk eu summit next week and not to relive the past although listen to today debate feel like have go back about year as we look forward it be important that we all in this place do what we can to make the life of people across the uk well that be our job even though the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin who be no long in his place would probably not agree time change as do opinion we know that many people even some of those who might have vote for it now realise that brexit have damage our economy and our country we only need to compare the result of the election in with the result last year for the conservative party to see that opinion can change quite drastically look forward to the summit next week would like to focus on reality not rhetoric the former prime minister boris johnson say in may we think that leave the single market would weaken our economy and hurt job trade and investment that be exactly what we have see an act of economic self harm that no other country be dream of research by aston university have show that export to the eu have fall by since brexit and the office for budget responsibility have project long term reduction in gdp of relative to remain in the eu in contrast the great brexit benefit of the australia trade deal negotiate by the conservatives be project to increase uk gdp by just and the government new india trade deal while welcome be estimate to add only to gdp neither of those trade deal even come close to touch the side of what we have lose through brexit which be why the liberal democrats be call on the government to approach next week summit with ambition and boldness and to agree road map and timeline for the creation of new bespoke uk eu custom union to free up the red tape that be strangle our business we have have lot of example could give the house many from my constituency but in the interest of time will move on also want to see we agree youth mobility scheme as part of next week summit it would be win win for young people and deliver boost for our economy yes we do want to see young people come over here no long want to see the pub in my constituency close two day week because they can not get the staff do not want to see cafés closing down because there be not enough young people to staff the hospitality business it be estimate that young people have leave the hospitality industry since brexit we need progress we need to improve the terrible deal that be do by the conservatives so hope the government will be bold forget this rhetoric and bluster and sign deal that we can all celebrate across this house be grateful to be able speak in this opposition day debate ahead of next week uk eu summit campaign for believe in and continue to believe in the promise of brexit at its core brexit be vote for the importance of national democracy vote for national sovereignty and vote against regionalisation and government by bureaucrat believe strongly in international co operation but do not believe in institutionalisation do not believe that decision making get well in aggregate my experience have teach that it only get bad it get more remote less well informed and riddle with compromise that barely satisfy anyone and please no one continue to believe that the uk its people and its government decide its own future not lock into continental bureaucracy provide the well possible future for we behind all the carefully choreographed language from ministers about reset there be one inescapable truth this labour government risk lay the groundwork and take the first step to betray the full promise of brexit that should not be any surprise give that they be lead by man who campaign for the leadership of the labour party on the basis of restore freedom of movement he support second referendum and he vote against brexit time we on this side of the house be not prepared to watch this slow train wreck in silence many issue have be raise by many member but want to raise just two that be of particular importance first on the youth mobility scheme the fundamental issue that make freedom of movement so unpopular would remain at the core of any youth mobility scheme the level of economic disparity across eu member state be fundamentally incompatible with the scheme become anything other than yet another route for mass low skilled migration at time when the government tell we they want to drive that down secondly there can be no dynamic eu rule taking or ecj oversight any agreement on food standard service or carbon trading must not come at the price of automatic alignment we do not leave the eu to find ourselves bind to it in everything but name we must demand mutual recognition and independent dispute resolution and that be the only thing we should accept that would reflect relationship of mutual respect these be not unreasonable demand they be the bare minimum that any sovereign state would expect when engage in talk with foreign bloc the united kingdom vote to leave the eu whether the prime minister and his ministers like it or not be it any wonder that they be look for answer internationally when we look at their domestic picture they be restrict winter fuel payment inflation be still bite we business confidence be shake work family be be hammer with job destroy taxis and growth be stall we must not allow this to serve as diplomatic distraction from their domestic failure we will not allow labour to turn reset into roll back and any future conservative government will not be bind by any agreement that breach these clear red line we will not allow brussels to disguise control as co operation and we will not let the democratic choice of the british people be erode by stealth brexit be not pause it be pivot it be huge opportunity for our country and believe that the benefit will accrue for decade to come the government might be able to hide their true intention this week but they will not be able to hide they forever and we will be here to make sure that the british people know what they really believe in it be not the freedom and sovereignty of brexit with regret it may not be possible for all member to speak in the debate even with this time limit no one represent northern ireland wish more than do for proper reset of the relationship with europe to be proper reset however it must acknowledge and respect the fundamental concept of international agreement that the agree party respect the territorial integrity of each other that be the fundamental flaw and fail of the present arrangement there be not and there be not under the last government requirement for the territorial integrity of the united kingdom to be respect that be how and why it come to be that in my part of the united kingdom in area of law we be subject not to the law of this house but to those of foreign parliament the eu insist and alas the british government accept that northern ireland should be under its custom code which treat gb as foreign country and northern ireland as eu territory and that we should be in its single market and subject to all its law in that we have the most dramatic refusal and repudiation of that fundamental concept of mutual acknowledgment of territorial integrity unless and until that be address in reset we will never have fair deal with europe and that be what would dearly like to see when hear talk about dynamic alignment it be not academic for we experience it every day of the week we experience the indignity of be subject to law that we do not make and can not change we be subject to the indignity of the other part of this united kingdom be describe as foreign country whose good must be check come through an international eu custom border if the government be go to do an sps deal with europe it inevitably fall as it have in northern ireland that we submit to the yoke of dynamic alignment with eu rule that be the price that the eu extract for northern ireland it be the price it will extract for an sps deal with great britain therefore that be not the way forward the way forward be to retrieve sovereignty over all of this country and to retrieve respect for territorial integrity in mid march in my role as vice chair of the eu uk parliamentary partnership assembly form part of the delegation that head out to brussels for the assembly meeting ahead of the may summit meeting while it be convivial affair come away with great concern about the tone of the conversation and contribution make by labour members while the prime minister be on the record as say as part of his red line that there would be no return to freedom of movement and no rejoining of the custom union or the single market the assembly would not allow to include such statement in the committee recommendation that be publish if as be say it be implicit surely it be not controversial to include it as statement of fact the tone of the conversation and debate indicate different direction the red line seem to be draw in disappear ink it very much feel that the leadership and the members be sing from different hymn sheet or perhaps the members belie the government true intention if that be the case the government should be much clear with the british public and those in this house about what they be try to achieve go into the summit the conspiracy of silence can not continue brexit at its heart be about restore power to britain allow we sovereignty despite the result of the referendum the goal of labour members seem to be to get ever close to the eu again talk of youth opportunity seem innocuous but labour members must explain their term and be realistic about what that would mean for open up free movement of people between the european union and the uk via the back door we must also be alert to the trade off in this debate fear that to secure veterinary agreement we will concede on dynamic alignment the minister have another opportunity to intervene should he so wish silence once again also fear that our fishery which be not mention once in the labour manifesto may be the next sacrificial lamb the ppa recommendation which the conservatives dissent to on the whole state that the assembly would provide signal at or before the summit that fair deal on fishery will be reach build on current arrangement but what do fair deal mean to this government if as condition for get an sps agreement the french insist on multi year agreement that naturally shift the favour far towards their industry and our government agree they will have harm another community first they attack our farmer now they attack our fisherman at the ppa meeting member say that everyone should be clear that this labour government be clear in their ambition to reset the relationship with the eu but offer word of warning we must not betray our fisherman and risk our food security in do so could speak about so many aspect of the brexit renegotiation that the government be enter into conservative members in particular have speak lot about those issue but wish to focus on fishing and farming it be always worry when this government go into bat in negotiation because when labour negotiate britain invariably lose the current agreement with the eu on fishery should be baseline and preferably springboard so that if the government negotiate they improve on that deal that be always the intention what be negotiation if we go into it with mind to sell out and come away with bad deal that be what be on the mind of uk fishing community right now when my hon friend the member for chester south and eddisbury aphra brandreth ask the prime minister only last week to rule out give away sovereign british water to the eu he refuse to do so the minister may intervene on to give our fishing community the reassurance that the government will not sell out to the eu on our sovereign water we know what the french want to send their trawler close inshore to our fishing water in order to catch fish from uk water and take they back to the eu and sell they we be already in situation whereby dutch tonne vessel travel up and down the english channel trawl the bottom of the ocean they take huge bycatch of fish include bass right in front of small british vessel such as those fish out of the isle of wight where my constituency be that have set of rule restrict their bass catch they have to watch the dutch boat scrape those fish up by accident and take they home if the government enter negotiation the current arrangement for fisherman must be baseline they must improve on the deal and absolutely rule out any concession to the french and the eu on sovereignty over british territorial water welcome the government state aim of negotiate close trading relationship with the european union wish the minister well but give this government record of negotiate international agreement worry about what the prime minister will agree on our behalf we have see his weakness in the negotiation on the chagos island the government intend to give away the sovereignty of territory that we already own and then pay billion of pound to lease it back can assure the minister that when he come to negotiate the detail with the european commission he will find it great deal tough to deal with than the government of mauritius the government say that the agreement will improve growth in our economy and that be commendable but we on the conservative benches would take that assurance far more seriously if the government have not spend the last month make life more difficult for british business the employment rights bill will increase cost to business by billion year bear mostly by small and medium sized enterprise and the billion national insurance job tax will make it more expensive to employ people unless of course it be an indian business import worker from india because then it will benefit from the new trade deal negotiate by the secretary of state for business and trade close trading relationship with the eu would be very welcome trade friction could be diminish easily an agreement on sanitary and phytosanitary measure could be reach be the eu and the uk to recognise each other standard our standard be already the same as or high than the eu and the eu know this but the eu have no intention of do that it intend to wait until the uk have government who will agree to its rule agree to the dynamic alignment of those rule and then agree that the court of justice of the european union be the final arbiter of those rule it seem that the eu patience have be reward because when ask the minister early to clarify what approach he intend to take answer come there none it be clear that this government intend to sign we up to eu rule over which this house will have no say when those rule be change by the eu britain will simply have to follow agree with my right hon friend the member for rayleigh and wickford mr francois that this be the beginning of process to bring the united kingdom within the regulatory control of the eu and thereafter perhaps an attempt by the labour party to make we join the eu there have be an astonishing lack of transparency by the government ahead of the dud deal that they look set to agree next week and that be personify by the paymaster general who refuse to engage on any of the substantive issue briefing suggest that the government be prepare to sign deal that pull the uk back into the eu regulatory and political orbit anyone listen to the debate will have hear minister repeatedly refuse to deny that the government be prepare to make the uk rule taker once again one of the frustration when we be negotiate the trade and co operation agreement be that the eu refuse to back veterinary agreement base on regulatory equivalence give our record and our commitment to high sps standard that be clearly the common sense approach but the eu simply refuse to engage instead it have impose high cost and regulation which fall on business and consumer now extraordinarily it seem that this government be simply go to roll over and concede that the uk will have to follow eu rule over which it have no say and bring back ecj jurisdiction that be not necessary desirable or consistent with democratic vote to leave the eu and restore our sovereignty once again let we see whether the minister will rule it out when he speak have spend three year in the ministry of defence advise the then defence secretary be concern at the approach the government be look to take on defence and security nato be the cornerstone of our defence and the alliance should be our focus yet leak reveal that the deal will pull the uk into the eu common security and defence policy duplicate many of the function and institution of nato and for what the deal do not even guarantee british firm access to the rearmament fund instead that will be subject to future separate negotiation and the uk will have to pay how much and on what term be completely unclear it be very disappointing give the need to defend our continent that some in the eu want to link access to the defence programme to fishing right interruption france indeed once again the government have simply roll over know from my time in the cabinet office and no work on brexit issue that the eu be determined to be inflexible from the start michel barnier the negotiator embody that rigidness unlike the man from del monte he delight in say no improvement to the tca can be make the agreement provide for that precisely and deliberately in the review mechanism to get trade flow there be easement that the eu could easily agree to benefit business and consumer instead of pursue those from position of principle this government be negotiate backroom deal and look set to do so badly and undermine our national interest start by pay small tribute to the government because just last week they pass secondary legislation albeit make possible by the conservatives groundbreake genetic technology precision breeding act that will mean more resilient crop further food choice and enhance food security although it might pain some of they labour members have to admit they be make some use of the hard win brexit freedom secure by the conservatives why would we give they away the example have use might seem somewhat niche but this be exactly what modern industrial strategy focus on technology productivity and the future look like and in do this we have head start on the continent which be now fumble to produce regulation of its own in this area we should be go far still gene editing have the power to reduce the impact of animal disease and stop pandemic in their track researcher at imperial college london and the roslin institute edinburgh be now close to make breakthrough on bird flu resistant poultry use gene editing the government must introduce secondary legislation for farm animal as they have do for plant visit imperial silwood campus in my constituency the student there be do incredible thing when they make breakthrough our regulatory framework should allow we to nimbly make use of they but there be very real risk that with next week reset the government could kill the progress with the sanitary and phytosanitary agreement they be negotiate company at the forefront of the agricultural industry have raise concern about this reset and know that my colleague in particular my hon friend the member for mid norfolk george freeman and the environment food and rural affairs committee and the all party group on science and technology in agriculture have do the same this be rare and much need as those on the government benches hammer our farmer competitive unique selling point for british agriculture report suggest that this government will make concession on sps to give they more bartering power on other issue set precedent for the wide agricultural relationship with the eu bend over backwards for an establishment that the british people vote to reject we would also be sign up to rule we have no power to influence there be good reason to leave the eu and good reason to stay in the eu and reasonable people could and do disagree but there be no good reason to leave and opt into rule over which we have no say that be the bad of both world under switzerland agreement with the eu it must align with almost all the eu food safety demand and replicate any further regulatory change make in the future that agreement may well be in the good interest of the swiss but it would not work for britain every time we want to diverge in way that could benefit the british people we would have to supplicate to those in brussels once again carve out be possible but we all know what tend to happen when the prime minister negotiate when labour negotiate britain lose reset deal with deep sps agreement would be short sighted perhaps offer quick boost in the near term but take the wind from the sail of long term game change investment that be start to flow in we need to maintain competitive advantage to supercharge investment in area like the thames valley where we have world lead life science sector so warn the government not to chain britain to the economic anchor of the eu and the dead hand of its precautionary principle regulator especially when last week secondary legislation on precision breeding be such clear example of what regulatory autonomy for an innovative uk could do for we be grateful for the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to highlight the impact of the botched brexit deal on business in my constituency include pharmacy and the local hospitality industry stuart yalden the manage director of gw martin small and medium sized enterprise in engineering in my constituency have raise concern over the additional cost and regulatory requirement the business now face when trade with the eu in one recent case it export small volume of product to customer in france worth around but the combine cost of paperwork export licence and transport come to this be not sustainable way to trade to reassure my constituent hope that the minister will give this important matter some consideration and that he will raise these issue next week we can not ignore the opportunity that have be take away from young people for no good reason and with no benefit to anyone have listen to argument from conservative members but still can not understand why anyone would want to stop young people from experience all that the world have to offer hope the minister will agree with that give young people include those from disadvantaged background the opportunity and freedom to live study and work in europe with youth mobility scheme would be hugely beneficial to they and to the country we must also recognise the negative impact that brexit have have on our creative sector we need urgent action to renegotiate touring arrangement with the eu ensure that british artist can showcase their talent abroad without excessive red tape the liberal democrats have set out clear road map to reset uk eu relation we must start by restore trust rebuild co operation in key area such as research climate policy and security and remove the barrier that have be strangle our economy it be time to take meaningful step to repair our relationship with europe and restore the prosperity that our country so desperately need sincerely hope that the government will use the eu uk summit to turn page on the chaos of the last five year diolch dirprwy llefarydd the people of wales have be let down by those who promise that brexit would lead to bright future instead it have cause huge damage right across our community and economy the hard brexit pursue by the previous uk government have cost the welsh economy up to billion and reduce the value of welsh export by up to billion and post brexit trade deal such as those with new zealand and australia have be unfavourable for welsh agriculture and manufacturing since brexit wales have lose out on billion in european structural and rural development funding which could have be use to support our deprived community that be despite the promise make by the then conservative uk government in to at minimum match the size of former eu funding in wales and the other nation across the uk in my constituency the port of holyhead which be strategically vital port for uk eu trade have see dramatic fall in traffic since brexit note that follow the closure of the port after storm darragh in december last year the value of trade go through holyhead have drop by million at the time call for the government to establish hardship fund to support business impact by the closure of the port urge the government as part of their strategy towards the eu to make clear commitment to safeguard the port against future crisis give its strategic importance we need relationship with europe that work for wales and the opportunity to improve relation at the upcoming uk eu summit be welcome give that wales be more reliant on export to the eu than the rest of the uk it be crucial that we make trading between wales and europe easier have see the challenge that exporter in my constituency face with local business the lobster pot tell that it have struggle to export under the post brexit system veterinary agreement cover plant and animal health to cut red tape and cost for our export business will be vital the government should create youth mobility scheme and join the programme so that our young people can study and work abroad create new skill and opportunity for the next generation we also need to see co operation on the environment the art and defence hope that next week summit will be the start not the end of strengthen our tie with europe this government have say that their first mission be to grow the economy and can see no well opportunity to improve growth than by commit the uk and wales to the long term goal of join the single market and custom union wales have be make to suffer badly by those who champion the false promise of brexit this government must now take action to fix our damage relationship with europe to protect the welsh economy call the shadow minister we have have strong debate this afternoon with many contribution on both side thank so many of my hon and right hon friend include my hon friend the members for east wiltshire danny kruger and for beaconsfield joy morrissey my right hon friend the members for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith and for rayleigh and wickford mr francois who know great deal about this subject as well as my right hon friend the member for south holland and the deepings sir john hayes and my hon friend the members for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin for hornchurch and upminster julia lopez for bexhill and battle dr mullan for south northamptonshire sarah bool for isle of wight east joe robertson for bridgwater sir ashley fox and for windsor jack fantastic set of knowledgeable contribution and real concern about the impending eu surrender summit it be in the spirit of such rigorous debate that this house find its strength and purpose it have be less than year since the general election in that time this labour government have tank the economy crush british business see as we have learn few people in employment drive wealth creator overseas at the rate of one millionaire every minute and shatter any sign of economic growth be afraid to say that the next item on this bleak agenda of declinism be the betrayal of the million people who vote for this country to leave the european political union this should come as no surprise to anyone because those on the benches opposite and regret some of those on the benches to the left of vote against brexit on no few than different occasion if this debate be reminiscent of the past it be because that be precisely where some member wish to take we back to ever since they be seduce by jacques delors the euro socialist their heart have never be in the mission of take back control of our law next monday eu surrender summit formally mark the start of labour plan to dismantle the power of not just the government but this house and push we back into the european union as passive rule taker we conservatives ask to what end why be the government capitulate the very same hard fight brexit freedom that permit the signing of two trade agreement notwithstanding their limited scope in the past seven day have we follow the policy that labour be advocate in opposition this government would never have be able to reach an agreement with the usa or with india they would not even have be in the room they would have be one of member nation resort to ask beg ursula von der leyen to perhaps consider put british interest first we be right not to follow labour advice then and the government would be right to listen to our advice now yet it appear that they still have not learn as we hear from many speaker this afternoon the opportunity of the future will fall to those state that be agile opportunity in area such as artificial intelligence genomic space the creative industry financial and professional service and the life science this country already have good deal with the european union we have mutually advantageous zero tariff agreement that be value at billion in service and billion in good nothing be perfect and where there be sensible measure such as pursue opportunity for mutual recognition they should be explore for example one of the big friction our business face today be the denial of the use of gate which be impose by the european union out of spite there be no such small mindedness from we however the problem we face today be that the government have fail to come to this house and explain exactly or at all what the prime minister eu reset will look like we have see nothing on the government negotiate objective their red line or the suppose benefit and we have not see an impact assessment or even an interim update of course understand there will be fine negotiating detail that the government will not want to share but that be very different from share absolutely nothing that be disrespectful of parliament and force this house to rely on leak and read between the line of downing street press handout if those leak be to be believe we know that labour be plan on sign up the british armed force to an eu army bind our strategic military decision make power to bureaucrat in brussels interruption the minister be very welcome to rule these thing out perhaps he will be more forthcoming than the paymaster general be early when it come to security there be no big challenge than our border think even the prime minister recognise that on monday but the uk request for share access to joint illegal migrant database have already be reject by the european union so much for co operation on security defence procurement must never be pay to play have no idea why the european union member nation would cut themselves off from the uk excellent defence prime unless this be once again protectionist industrial policy cloak and what twisted deal make trade fishing right for the french for work more closely together as we have so many time on europe defence we warn that labour would betray our fisherman and it have sadly prove we right by put fishing right back on the negotiating table my hon friend have refer to the betrayal of our fisherman wonder whether the minister will take the opportunity to deny media speculation that the government be about to consent to multi year agreement the fisherman want single year agreement which be the international norm can the minister rule that out today be afraid the minister be as talkative as haddock when it come to clarify his objective but perhaps he will confound our expectation when he sum up the debate just as the prime minister pretend to talk tough on immigration by the same token he plan to open our border to an eu youth mobility scheme perhaps the minister will deny that but it could mean million from boulogne to bucharest limited volume scheme with comparable economy whereby the uk be able to decide who come here be fine in principle we have such scheme with australia but australia be mile away and its economy be very different from those that we be discuss the wrong type of youth mobility scheme would disadvantage young british worker who thank to this government be already struggle to get foot on the ladder whether for job unemployment be up again today or to secure roof over their head in britain housing market what part of the government objective involve make thing hard for our young people what we do see be the government proceed at breakneck pace with the product regulation and metrology bill beware of bills with boring name madam deputy speaker this be trojan horse blank cheque bill give ministers the power to roll back brexit sign we up to eu rule and abandon imperial measurement for good all at the stroke of pen it provide unchecked ministerial power to make we passive rule taker of brussels diktat let be clear the conservatives be certainly not oppose to co operation with europe as one among other market that much should be obvious from the hard fight trade agreement that we obtain under the last government but we must not in any circumstance surrender our brexit freedom so that the prime minister can reassure his next law school reunion that he have undermine our sovereignty after the early equivocation from the paymaster general let give the minister they have be chuntere all afternoon final chance to answer these question once and for all can he reassure the million of people who vote to leave the eu that his surrender summit will not betray their wish will he confirm that there will be no backsliding on free movement or compulsory asylum transfer can he reassure taxpayer or those who have lose their winter fuel allowance or whose benefit be set to be cut that the uk will not be agree to any new payment to the eu be he able to confirm for the benefit of our coastal community that there will be no concession on fishing right can he assure the house that there will be no rule take dynamic alignment or extension of european court jurisdiction will he pledge in deed as well as word that there will be no compromise on the primacy of nato as the successful cornerstone of european security if the minister be not able to provide those assurance this government be betray brexit all of the evidence that we have see today suggest that they be limber up for surrender summit to damage britain interest they be determined to deal away our hard fought freedom and we will lose control of our border our law our fish and our armed force urge the minister to come clean and to have the honesty to explain to this house and this country why labour be prepare to surrender the right of the british people to choose their own destiny we know that when labour negotiate britain lose be grateful to have the chance to respond to this afternoon debate do not know that the house have so many fan of quantum leap favourite show of mine when be young of course fan of the show will know that sam beckett be advise by hologram call al us admiral who would come in and give good advice on how to get through challenge instead we have have the spectre of sir bill cash come in via text to conservative members who would have think it this debate have be journey back to the past on this side of the house we have government who want to take this country forward not back that be stark contrast with those on the other side who seem stuck in the last decade we will not be rejoin the eu the single market or the custom union or return to freedom of movement but we look forward to welcome president von der leyen and costa to london next week for the first ever uk eu summit the first annual summit to take place between the uk and the eu the leader of the opposition recently say we announce that we would leave the european union before we have plan for growth outside the eu these mistake be make because we tell people what they want to hear first and then try to work it out later of course the lesson that we have learn and to which the conservative party might want to pay careful attention be that fail to plan be inevitably plan to fail this government will not take the same reckless chaotic and dogmatic approach when it come to the british people and our national interest that be why under the leadership of our prime minister this government be elect on mandate for change which be what we be deliver we have be reset our relationship with our eu partner and our wide european partner and we be use those strengthen relationship to deliver growth prosperity safety and security the paymaster general the prime minister the foreign secretary and other have be work to do that just this week we host the foreign ministers meeting on ukraine and we have have high level engagement with many european leader we have be travel around the continent drive forward growth drive forward action on illegal immigration and drive forward relationship for our security and our defence we be also set up structure to ensure that our european partnership deliver in the long term include treaty or leader level summit with some of our close partner such as france germany poland and ireland not to mention the exciting and successful state visit by his majesty the king to italy last month be delighted that buckingham palace have today announce that president macron accompany by mrs macron have accept an invitation from his majesty to pay state visit to the uk and the prime minister and president will hold their next summit during that visit increase engagement have already deliver result for the uk on growth we have have million of czech investment in rolls royce small modular reactor and million investment by the polish logistic company inpost and iberdrola be double its investment through scottishpower over the next four year on security we have new defence agreement with germany and romania and new negotiation on defence agreement with poland and norway on migration we have joint action plan with germany and new migration deal with serbia kosovo slovenia and slovakia and we have also agree new measure to tackle people smuggle gang with france on energy and climate we have new civil nuclear co operation between the uk and finland and other european country be respond positively to that crucially on security and defence rise rise rise they want answer to the question they have ask be go to give they some answer and then will happily take intervention on foreign security and defence policy let be absolutely clear nato be and remain the bedrock of our security and our transatlantic alliance but there be many strand to muscle whether it be the joint expeditionary force our bilateral security and defence partnership or our work through other pan european body through the european political community in the western balkans through the quint or indeed through new uk eu security and defence partnership muscle get strong when its multiple strand be flex those thing do not contradict each other they be strengthen this country and our place in the world and deliver on defence on technology on job on industry and on security be grateful to the hon gentleman and as have say we have work together in the past quite lot will just ask very simple question the government have constantly say they will not breach their red line they have apparently say that publicly in europe and they have say it here my simple question be be dynamic alignment one of the red line will come on to that in moment but we be absolutely clear have be clear and so have the paymaster general will come on to answer that question specifically in moment talk down britain role in nato at time of war in europe when we be show such leadership be quite frankly irresponsible will not take lesson on nato european defence and security or the defence and security of this country from party that shrink the british army to the small size since the napoleonic era when we have make the tough choice of investing in defence let be absolutely clear there be no suggestion that the uk would ever join european army and no formal proposal for that have ever be put forward indeed on gibraltar answer question on this early we absolutely take stand on the sovereignty of gibraltar give the importance of our military base there speak to the chief minister early about that and the wild speculation that be be put about be hugely unhelpful on fishery we should be clear that there be of course brexit deal negotiate by the last government and we be look for an overall arrangement that be beneficial for our fishery and our coastal community but be not go to get into run commentary on sps and indeed on the question the right hon member for chingford and woodford green sir iain duncan smith ask let we be clear since the uk agrifood trade with the eu have fall by for export and for import after adjust for trade inflation so it be in the interest of both side to seek an sps agreement that remove those barrier to trade we be not interested in divergence for the sake of divergence or in race to the bottom on standard we will not get into running commentary on this but we have be absolutely clear of course there need to be appropriate dispute resolution mechanism rise conservative ministers ask question but they may not want to hear the answer interruption order we be absolutely clear we be take serious action to reduce net migration but we support control scheme that create opportunity for young people to experience different culture travel and work important question be ask about issue such as the pan euro mediterranean convention it be of course right and responsible that we look at it ensure that any final decision be make in the national interest however want to address very fundamental point which be this absolutely absurd and nonsensical suggestion of surrender what an absolute disgrace to be talk britain down talk britain down in fact what we see be strength we see strength from this prime minister and strength from this government in world of turmoil rise no in world of turmoil and uncertainty be there red line on dynamic alignment yes or no have answer that question already interruption order the minister will be hear thank you madam deputy speaker have be absolutely clear surrender what nonsense instead we see strength in stand up for our steel and our car manufacturer deliver trade deal with the us and india invest in green energy lead europe with our key ally in the defence of ukraine tackle illegal migration and serious and organised crime and boost funding and support for our national defence after shameful disinvestment by the previous government that be talk down britain we be stand up for britain question put
