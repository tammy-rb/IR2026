commend our own domestic broadcaster include the much malign bbc for keep we inform on what be go on there be grateful to my hon friend for bring this matter to the house attention strongly condemn all violence direct against journalist and call on the israeli authority to make every effort to ensure that medium worker across the region can conduct their work freely and safely deliberate target of journalist be entirely unacceptable international humanitarian law offer protection to civilian journalist during any armed conflict and those law should be abide by call for all attack to be

article of the geneva convention state that journalist be civilian during war and article of the rome statute make it clear that attack civilian in hospital be war crime agree with the guardian editorial yesterday when it state that israel want to stop the world from see what it do do the foreign secretary agree that the nasser hospital bombing be war crime and what action will he be take against israel on august the uk join media freedom coalition statement call on and urge israel to allow immediate independent foreign medium access and afford protection to journalist operate in gaza there must now be full independent investigation into what happen at the nasser hospital and my hon friend be right to call to mind the importance of abide by international humanitarian law the world have watch in horror as humanitarian aid have be block from reach gaza lead to famine that be claim the life of those who survive the bomb meanwhile in the west bank the israeli government turn blind eye to rampant settler violence and openly approve new settlement that could end the very possibility of two state solution can the foreign secretary assure the house that he be do everything he can not only to end the mass killing but to secure last peace between two equal state in israel and palestine be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue the confirmation of famine be utterly horrifying be appal by the shocking level of settler violence and have be clear that israel must clamp down on that violence the government have introduce three round of sanction relate to settler violence include the july sanction on ben gvir and smotrich for the incitement of violence against palestinian community the only way to deliver long term peace and security for palestinians and israelis alike be through viable two state solution the remain hostage in gaza those who be still alive be be starve persecute and prevent from get any form of medical aid when the foreign secretary visit the region will he force the international red cross to seek the hostage and ensure that they be give the medical attention they need the hon gentleman have always bring the issue of hostage to mind in this house and applaud he for that work meet with hostage family just before the summer recess and will again in the come week the recent photo show hostage malnourish and starve be obscene and will do all can to ensure that they get the aid and support that they need underground in those tunnel it be clear that the state war goal of many element of the israeli government be not ceasefire and last peace between two community live side by side in peace but ethnically cleanse gaza and prevent viable state in the west bank will the secretary of state therefore commit to sanction the head of the israeli government benjamin netanyahu the hon gentleman should look closely at the three package of sanction that we have have since come to office he will see that there be no other country in the world with the range of sanction against those who incite in particular settler violence and expansion israel have breach two ceasefire to date its bombing its killing and now its starvation have continue for month it be not just the hostage who be not get food it be also baby child woman and man the impunity that israel have to continue to perpetrate war crime after war crime atrocity after atrocity when will the uk and the international community say enough be enough and take real action to put an end to the killing and to help the hostage be free it be not enough to assert it or say it that be why we restore funding to the united nations relief and works agency that be why we have have three package of sanction that be why yesterday announce an extra million of aid that be why have speak to my israeli counterpart nearly every week certainly every month that have be in office it be why we have corral the international community with the statement we have make it be not about word it be about action to bring this to an end the secretary of state be very clear yesterday that if we want peace we must ensure that the hostage be release if we want peace we must ensure that hamas be oust from gaza if that happen we will have peace that will last know that he be committed to that for he say so yesterday but will he reiterate that for the chamber and those who be here the hon gentleman know lot about stand up to terrorist hamas be proscribe organisation there can be no role for hamas we need the total demilitarisation of gaza those leader who be there must leave and exit the country so that the palestinian people can be free from the plight of what hamas be rain down on they recognition of palestinian state what discussion he have have with his international counterpart on the recognition of palestinian state we have be clear that we will recognise palestinian state by the united nations general assembly in september to protect the viability of the two state solution unless the israeli government take substantive step to end the appalling situation in gaza and commit to long term sustainable peace the united kingdom government should never have place condition on the recognition of the state of palestine there be no place for it in international law however give that it be clear that israel have fail to comply with these condition can the secretary of state confirm that the uk will unconditionally and immediately recognise the state of palestine at the un general assembly next week high level week be not actually next week it be in three week time may say to the hon gentleman that it be most bizarre to say to responsible government that they should not attempt to change the situation on the ground to encourage israel to commit to ceasefire and to process of course we should use all diplomatic effort to do that notwithstanding what we say about the assessment we will make on recognition at the appropriate time we all want to see an end to the suffering and progress towards two state solution but what assurance can the foreign secretary provide that in the recognition of palestine there can be no role for hamas in the governance of palestinian state be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue let be crystal clear hamas must never be reward and we will not reward it by the uk recognition of palestine if we reach that point our demand of hamas be absolute and unchanged it must immediately release all the hostage who be cruelly take on october and hold in the most atrocious condition which we have already discuss in the chamber this morning russia economic sanctions what step his department be take to increase economic sanction on russia until putin stop his barbaric assault we will keep tighten the screw on his war machine with even more sanction since come to office we have sanction more than individual entity and ship more than double the number of designation make in vladimir putin be in

recently give birth be happy to meet she to discuss these issue in great detail speciality steel uk insolvency would like to make statement regard the insolvency of speciality steel uk ltd which be part of the liberty steel group hon member will have see that the high court grant compulsory winding up order against liberty speciality steels on august and the company have now enter liquidation first and foremost let say this the government stand with the affected steelworker in rotherham in sheffield and in wednesbury we stand with their family and the community who will undoubtedly be worry at this difficult time would like to reassure they and all those employ by liberty speciality steels that we be stand by with our rapid response team to give immediate support on the ground if require that we be work with the trade union and the south yorkshire mayor and that we be work with the council and hon member from affected constituency to offer all the help we can also want to stress that there will be no immediate change to the current operation of the business include to employee job follow the appointment of special manager the company site have be secure and employee payroll process within hour other liberty steel company outside speciality steel such as liberty dalzell and liberty hartlepool be not affect by this action follow the company liquidation the official receiver have be appoint as liquidator by the court hon member will know that the official receiver operate independently of government with statutory duty to act in the good interest of creditor yesterday lay departmental minute notify the house of the contingent liability associate with this intervention regret that due to the liquidation take place during recess we have not be able to follow the usual notice period of parliamentary sitting day however copy of the departmental minute will be place in the libraries of both houses in addition the government have agree to fund for the official receiver who will now stabilise operation the official receiver will gather company information and report to we on the likely next step include option for the company business and site the total cost will depend on market condition and the strategy adopt by the official receiver however that will be subject to close scrutiny by my department and the insolvency service as the house will be aware the company have face severe financial and operational difficulty since liberty speciality steels have fail to file account for over six year failure that have lead to separate prosecution by companies house of its parent company be sure that the official receiver will want to gain well understanding of the company business and the conduct of its director lead up to the liquidation also inform the house that the director of the company be currently under investigation by the serious fraud office for suspect fraud fraudulent trading and money laundering give that be sure hon member will agree that it would have be wholly inappropriate for the government to enter into commercial arrangement with the company this government will always take difficult decision when they be in the national interest that be why in april we act to prevent the pre emptive closure of the blast furnace at british steel in scunthorpe in the case of liberty steel the lack of transparency the legal and financial risk and the complete absence of reliable corporate information mean we have no credible route to act before insolvency it be worth note that liberty speciality steels use electric arc furnace technology that can be power up or down as need although it should be note that those furnace have not be operate since july of last year that be the situation this government inherit the circumstance in scunthorpe be fundamentally different british steel operate the uk last remain blast furnace asset that once shut down can not simply be restart allow those blast furnace to be close pre emptively would have remove our ability to make strategic choice about the future of steelmaking in scunthorpe and that be not position this government be prepared to accept scunthorpe be therefore truly exceptional situation and that be why we take the unprecedented step of implement the steel industry special measures act to maintain the safe operation of the blast furnace the situation with liberty speciality steels be not comparable the company be issue with wind up order by the high court due to longstanding financial issue spend taxpayer money on company operate in such way would have expose taxpayer to hundred of million potentially billion of pound in hide cost with all that say very much believe that the steelmaking site in rotherham stocksbridge brinsworth and wednesbury have future be keen to see they return to production but that have to be achieve through private investment by an owner who can invest in the workforce and in the future of the business so that they put it on long term sustainable footing we know that the business environment have not be good enough for the uk steel industry which be why we have already make substantial change to secure strong future for it will say more about the step that we have take shortly in the case of liberty speciality steels it go without say that the company hardworke employee be key to turn the site around their skill and expertise will be essential in deliver that bright future however in its current state produce only minimal volume of steel and with many employee still on furlough we know that some tough choice lie ahead it be now for the official receiver to determine the next step in the insolvency process but let be clear this government will stand by this workforce and do all we can to support they through this period of uncertainty despite the challenge face the steel sector today after year of neglect under the previous government we believe that this industry will bounce back and grow strong tomorrow this government be do everything we can to make that happen we be press ahead with bold steel strategy for the uk set to be publish later this year that strategy will set out our vision for competitive decarbonised and resilient domestic steel industry our approach be clear we want the uk steel sector to thrive with strong private investment and commercially sustainable operation at its core under our new industrial strategy we have already announce some major policy change to increase the future viability of the steel industry we be reduce electricity cost for steel producer by increase network charge discount through the supercharger from to we be change government procurement rule via the publication of new steel public procurement notice to ensure that uk make steel be consider for all public project we be also strengthen current steel safeguard measure ensure that uk steel producer will not be undercut while still ensure that the uk have steady and reliable supply hon member will know that we have also secure much improve deal for the worker of port talbot something the opposition repeatedly say could never be achieve and we deliver it alongside million grant to support the transition to low carbon electric arc furnace production be proud to attend the groundbreaking event for this in july with the chair of tata group we will continue to work hand in hand with this vital british industry to ensure its long term success let there be no doubt that for liberty speciality steels we will pursue every option to keep steelmaking in rotherham sheffield south yorkshire and the west midland we will offer all possible support to the independent official receiver on the all important next phase and we will continue to work with hon member across the house to ensure that the uk remain proud steelmaking country now and for many year to come commend this statement to the house call the shadow minister be grateful to the minister for give advance sight of her statement today but here we be again another day another government takeover of key british manufacturing plant another people face an incredibly uncertain future and the prospect of significant job loss alongside the wide economic impact across supply chain and in aerospace defence and power generation that would result from the collapse of this specialist steelwork despite so many warm word about the steel industry despite so many labour promise to the people who have work their whole life in that industry and despite the impression of superiority while in opposition this labour government be fail british industry they be fail to provide certainty of policy and the economic growth that they say be their central mission and they be fail to get grip on the issue that affect thousand of work people life the minister say she want to provide certainty to the steel industry and the people who work in it she say that we can expect bold steel strategy for the uk but where be it the government be not new any more they have be in power for year now and there be still no clarity on this supposedly bold strategy the british steel industry face fierce dual set of pressure new us tariff and continue high energy cost we all know that the energy cost in this country be too high yet they have be drive only high by this government ideological obsession with prioritise decarbonisation over economic growth back in may liberty steel warn that it face significant challenge due to soar energy cost but instead of focus on tackle the underlie cause of expensive energy the energy secretary be back windmill while leave britain oil and gas industry in the doldrum he be leave our amazing british oil and gas our great energy source trap under the north sea this be economic illiteracy aim at satisfy their own green obsession from steel to chemical to car builder and maker across britain be pay the price of this government socialist green agenda and it be their worker and investor who will lose out on tariff despite the economic prosperity deal agree by the prime minister and president trump the agreement provision lower us tariff on uk produce steel and steel derivative product have still not come into effect the government have repeatedly avoid answer question in this house on when the agreement will come into effect we hear no mention whatsoever of it in the statement today or in the note yesterday so ask again when will the provision lower us tariff on uk steel come into effect of course even if those provision do eventually come to fruition steelworker should beware of this government who have overpromise and under deliver before with devastating impact for worker just look at jaguar land rover the prime minister look worker dead in the eye and promise that he would protect their industry and save their job he then use those worker as labour propaganda photo opportunity across television and the front page when the uk us deal be announce but little over two month later jaguar land rover announce it be cut job the very same worker who be promise everything by the prime minister be leave out in the cold by this labour government inability to secure well trading relationship with our close ally let we today try to get some clarity on what exactly this minister have do and will do for the british worker impact at liberty steel first she announce that the government have agree to fund the official receiver and that total no it no use nod at have not go over time it be the shadow minister himself be sure he be now come to conclusion be mr speaker although have lot of question will ask just two very quick one if that be okay you must ask they now otherwise be go to stop you will mr speaker what be the budget for the official receiver the minister have not lay out any cost she have say that it be relate to market condition but have not set out any estimate she know that the treasury will have approve estimate so please will she set those out the government have make the national wealth fund allocate billion to british steel can she assure we that they will follow the investment allocation that assure its operational independence order please it be not acceptable on either side of the house to take advantage of the back benchers who want to get in you have set amount of time if the minister can stick to it expect the shadow minister to do so if the minister go over time do then grant time the other way please do not do this again let we come to the chair of the select committee thank you very much mr speaker order the minister need to respond it be that long that have forget thank you mr speaker shall just explain to the shadow minister how the system work the government have not take over control that be not the process of the official receiver the official receiver be appoint follow court case which begin in it have be very long and arduous case the hon gentleman will hopefully understand that can not set out the cost of the official receiver at this point because the official receiver have only just begin his work it be very early day and we can not be specific we know the number will be in the million as oppose to anything more substantial because the company be not operate in and of itself what we be do be ensure that the salary be pay which hope the whole house would agree be the right thing to do company will be come forward and express an interest in buy part of the company and it will be for the official receiver to look at that and see what process we should go through but can not give the hon gentleman the actual number on that hope the whole house will understand why not on the shadow minister wide point if this government have not intervene thousand of people would have lose their livelihood in scunthorpe that be fact if this government have not intervene we would not have have well deal for the worker in port talbot we would not have be there support they in the transition and we would not be there support the building of the electric arc furnace which begin back in july the shadow minister ask what this government have already do we have already change the rule on procurement have work closely with colleague in the cabinet office on that to ensure that where government be spend money we be spend on british business where we can something his government fail to do on energy price we have commit to lower price through the reduction in cost that will come from the expansion of the super charger something his government fail to do we be work on bold strategy which we will publish this year that will build on that whether on trade protection on which we have already take measure our scrap policy job apprenticeship or skill we will have bold strategy because we believe in steel unlike the previous government who say that manufacturing be victorian pursuit well leave to the chinese we do not agree with that approach will try again call the chair of the select committee congratulate the minister on save britain real engineering from year of financial engineering which be not in the good interest of this country and be more in the interest of the self enrichment of the people behind it the question for we today though be what step the government will now take to ensure and safeguard grow thrive industry will the minister reassure the house that she will use we on the committee to oversee the liability that the department have take on crucially will she set out when she expect those low energy cost to kick in when she expect the tariff barrier in the united states to come down and when she will tie together the steel strategy which hope she will publish as soon as possible for the house to debate thank my right hon friend for those helpful question he remind that the shadow minister have ask about the us of course we be in position where the world have tariff of on steel and aluminium we have we be work with our us counterpart to reach conclusion to those negotiation my right hon friend will know that the president be due to come to the uk and of course we will be do all we can to get that negotiation conclude at pace my right hon friend ask about energy cost we be seek to ensure that there be viable steel industry into the future and that those company currently talk to the official receiver about want to take over and invest in liberty can do so in way that will make they money on the charge we be reduce the to super charger extension for network charge relief to give an example it will mean about to relief per tonne of steel produce we know that liberty be not produce what it can at the moment but two or three year ago it would have be produce about tonne of steel per year so it would have save up to million on its energy cost that be substantial reduction and something that be sure he will welcome on the liability of course we want to be as honest open and transparent with the house as we possibly can lot of the liability be with the creditor at the moment we want to come to the house as soon as we can to ensure that we be set out the cost that we incur my right hon friend be right that the steel strategy this year need to be bold and we will of course look to the work that his committee have do to help we in that call the liberal democrat spokesperson may start by associate the liberal democrats with the minister remark in support of the employee family and community who be affect by this late development we welcome the minister come to the house today to provide some clarity steel be sector of huge strategic importance for our country it provide vital material for our national infrastructure from defence to renewable energy and it create thousand of job across the uk the neglect of the steel industry in recent year be just another part of the previous government disastrous legacy with putin barbaric war in europe and donald trump damage tariff cause economic turmoil secure the future of steel production in this country be more important than ever that be why the liberal democrats firmly believe that nothing should be off the table in support this critical sector for too long our steel industry have be neglect the conservative government oversee string of near collapse and last minute deal they scrap the industrial strategy which be so vital to our manufacturer and put in place new trade barrier which constrain our exporter in the light of this late insolvency will the minister set out what action the government be take to set our steel industry on truly sustainable footing what reassurance can the government provide that job loss can be avoid in the future what progress have be make in bring down industrial electricity price through the measure announce in the industrial strategy what be the government do to press president trump to finally drop his damaging tariff on our steel export finally what step be the government take to treat steel as the nationally strategic asset that it be ensure that more british make steel be use to power our national infrastructure and other major project here in the uk thank the hon lady for her remark she be right to ask about how we ensure that this nationally strategic asset be protect and we be do that have just set out the reduction in energy price that the steel industry as whole will benefit from extend the super charger from to to give network charge relief which will bring significantly low cost for energy price for our steel industry we be prioritise the procurement of british steel where the government be spend money because we believe that that be the right thing to do we have already introduce protection for steel trading and we be ensure that we do everything we can talk to our us counterpart all the time about reach conclusion on the negotiation on the steel tariff be optimistic about those conversation of course speak to official and other ministers and to the steel industry about these issue all the time we be lucky to have the steel council that we put together trade union industry and other who be help we to develop what we think will be an ambitious steel strategy that will ensure that the steel industry will not decline the strategy will ensure that we will not be in the position we be currently in where only of the steel we use in this country be make in this country and that we will be in position where we can protect those good experienced job and those good people who we want to support and make sure the industry grow you will be aware mr speaker that as long as have be an mp have be come to this chamber argue for support for speciality steel in my constituency politely say to the shadow minister that the difference in response from this government be night and day from what have under the conservatives personally thank the minister and the secretary of state for have such an open door policy to and my hon friend the member for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball know the minister be do everything she can to save this speciality business one of the first action of the official receiver be to release approximately apprentice who be due to start their training in the next few week can the minister reassure the house that the government will not only commit to the business but acknowledge that it can survive only with its highly skilled committed professional staff and that she be as commit to they as she be to the business thank my hon friend for those remark they be gratefully receive and we will continue to do all we can to support the steel industry she be absolutely right that number of apprentice be due to start this week but the official receiver take the decision that give that the month continuation of the apprenticeship could not be guarantee it be right to try to find they other placement be take close personal interest in what happen to those people know the local authority and the department for education be try to ensure that we can find other place for they want to make sure that we can do so because one of the thing this government be passionate about be ensure that our young people have the apprenticeship to give they support for the job that we know we need into the future the minister be obviously incredibly committed to the steel industry as we all be but manufacturing will continue to struggle in this country when it pay energy price that be so much high than competitor in germany and france can the minister assure the house that in year time follow the government strategy manufacturer whether ceramic or steel will be pay the same amount for their industrial energy price as their german and french competitor the right hon gentleman make good point of course our energy price be too high and it be difficult for company to compete we be take action to address that in the first instance by expand the super charger which will make significant difference to industry that use significant amount of energy we will also introduce an electricity scheme in it be complex process and will take time to bring in mean that around company across the country will also have significant reduction in their energy cost we be take what we believe to be the right measure in our industrial strategy through those two intervention to ensure that our energy cost come down and that we can be competitive among our european counterpart liberty speciality steels uk have fail its highly skilled worker this ongoing situation have be deeply concern so be delighted that the minister have offer her solidarity and the government support for the incredible workforce at the site in south yorkshire it be hugely positive and great contrast with the year of conservative government that this government have step in and appoint an official receiver to protect the plus job at the two site include stocksbridge speciality steels in my constituency the secretary of state have acknowledge in this chamber the strategic significance of those site to national security and we must ensure that those business be support in fulfil their capability and have as the minister have recognise strong future will she take adequate time to find responsible buyer with the right deal and during that time will worker be keep in employment with salary continue to be pay while effort be make by she and the official receiver to resolve the outstanding pension issue my hon friend and have speak many time about this she be such champion for the industry as be many colleague she be right to point to the importance to the country of the work at stocksbridge of course we will do what we need to do through the process of the official receiver to ensure that people get the salary that they need for the past couple of year so many of those people have be on furlough we want to turn that around we believe that this viable industry be languish unnecessarily the government will provide the right support through intervention such as our energy reduction measure and work with the official receiver can tell she that multiple company be interested and come forward and we need to establish how viable those offer be and what the good situation be of course the official receiver must think of the good outcome for the creditor but we take close interest in that my hon friend be right to point out the pension issue know that there be uncertainty the official receiver and teneo be consider these issue now to see exactly what have and have not be pay so that we can unpick the pension issue this be the second crisis in the steel industry in the past year it impact other commercially operate industry that be critical to our national security in lancashire the failure to place an order for typhoon jet be risk thousand of job in the critical defence industry of bae systems there be also lack of join up between departments which do not realise that the whole life cycle of nuclear fuel manufacturing be equally critical for our national infrastructure and impact on hundred of highly skilled job in lancashire at the westinghouse springfields site will the minister update on her work with the ministry of defence to ensure that commercially operate industry that be critical to our national defence capability and security be strategically support to be sustainable in the future the hon gentleman be right to point out the importance of our defence industry and the need for we to support it of course the industrial strategy outline eight growth drive sector that we believe can be turbocharge with government support defence be one of they we have publish those sector plan apart from the defence one which will come shortly he should look out for it we have significantly increase funding for defence which will lead to thousand of job across the uk will work closely with my colleague in defence particularly the minister for defence procurement and industry to ensure that we procure uk job where we can and support our industry to grow first thank the minister for her action after year of inaction by the conservative party it be welcome change sheffield be synonymous with steel particularly special steel after harry brearley invent stainless steel in the city over year ago the minister mention public procurement and consideration be give think those be the word she use to the purchase of british steel may ask she to be clear about what consideration mean hope that it mean look not simply at the narrow issue of cost for product but at the wide benefit of purchase uk steel benefit to the steel and engineering sector as well as to the broad economy will she assure we that when public procurement take place those wide consideration will come into effect yes within the parameter of what we can do legally in term of subsidy we be ensure and the cabinet office be keen to ensure that when we spend public money we buy british the value of that and of british job around the country be recognise in the contract that we pursue my hon friend talk about the importance of steel in his area have talk with colleague about develop steel corridor which think be important we be pursue that through the steel strategy the minister be right to come here today to make statement on such an important part of the national infrastructure it be just shame that no minister have ever make statement in this house on grangemouth we have now learn that the chancellor meet ineos chair jim ratcliffe just three week ago just three week before petroineos grangemouth close but she do not do so much as raise the refinery with he in her statement the minister say the government stand with the affected steelworker in rotherham in sheffield and in wednesbury we stand with their family that be quite right so do we in the snp but why have this labour government never stand with the worker of grangemouth it be up to the minister to answer that question if she want to but the statement be about steel rather than petroleum thank you mr speaker will just say that we have very much stand with the worker of grangemouth we be invest through the national wealth fund million to support that development have have multiple conversation and the hon gentleman and have speak multiple time in this place about how we will support industry in grangemouth to transition and grow and provide significant support to worker where they lose job fundamentally disagree with the picture that he paint thank the minister for her action steel remain key part of the south yorkshire industrial and economic strategy can she reassure the house that worker wage and livelihood will continue to be prioritise throughout the whole process and will she join in thank our hon friend the members for penistone and stocksbridge dr tidball and for rotherham sarah champion for their work to champion not just the site in stocksbridge and rotherham but the south yorkshire steel corridor of course share that gratitude for those amazing colleague who stand up for what they know to be right and sensible we be protect not something that be not worth protect but something that have vibrant and viable future that be what we be work towards we be work closely with the south yorkshire mayoral combine authority and the mayor in broad advanced manufacturing in the region include the innovation district and research centre there be huge wealth of expertise and talent that we can build on be grateful to the minister for the frankness of her statement she say that the director of the company be under investigation for suspect fraud fraudulent trading and money laundering can she reassure the house that that will not in any way hold up the government in take any remedial step that they need to take in support of the industry and its workforce for background knowledge will she tell the house precisely what sort of specialism this plant offer give that it name itself speciality steel enterprise the right hon gentleman should perhaps go for tour and see what the speciality be but it be defence aerospace and industrial engineering on the stocksbridge site the rotherham site have two electric arc furnace which feed the stocksbridge site and there be huge expertise there there be number of other site that feed various sector such as the automotive industry hydraulic and whole range of other there be range of specialism on the investigation the official receiver will look at what be true and what be not because there have not be any account publish for many year they will establish what have happen the secretary of state have write to the insolvency service today to ask it to take special account of the serious fraud office investigation and to pass over any information it uncover to the serious fraud office so that it can do its work congratulate the minister on the decision she have make in the last few week we in sheffield be very proud of our steel industry and we want to resurrect it we want people to be proud of the city and to get into the same work that their grandparent do many year ago constituent who have be in contact with on the issue will be very relieved follow the reassurance that the minister have give but if she could clarify the pension issue that would offer even more reassurance be so proud to hear our minister speak about steel and be quite disgusted at the way the shadow minister the hon member for grantham and bourne gareth davies and other conservative members have try to pretend that they do not run down the steel industry they never even have steel strategy in all their year in office they really ought to apologise for the absolute rubbish they be talk thank my hon friend for point out the failing of the opposition which we all understand very well on the pension issue recognise the concern that people will have we have to let the official receiver get under the hood and work out what have be pay and what have not because that be not clear once we know we will look into that and do what need to be do but do not want to say something on the subject until we know the reality congratulate the minister and the government on do the right thing in support our steel industry have be express concern about liberty steel since this be critical moment and it will be interesting to see whether private sector investment can be attract into electric arc furnace with electricity price where they be think there be well solution which have speak about outside this house merge speciality steel with british steel to create cohesive excellent strong champion of our steel industry that we all support into the future and invest in that be the way to ensure economic growth in this country the official receiver be independent of course we be very interested in this and be keep in close touch with the receiver on what come out of this the hon member idea be not necessarily foolish on this occasion this be legal process and the official receiver legally have to think of the creditor who have suffer throughout we have to think of they as well and make sure we do the right thing but we will continue to do everything we can to make sure that there be viable future whatever form that take like other very much appreciate the support be give today and the wide work be do on energy price procurement and more by complete contrast the conservative party have no steel strategy as my hon friend the member for sheffield brightside and hillsborough gill furniss say and have woeful record on steel over year however market condition be particularly tough point make to strongly by trade union representative at llanwern steelwork over the summer so will the minister ensure that we support the steel industry as whole include llanwern and that wales get its share of the green steel fund we talk before parliament return about how we can support llanwern and the work do there my hon friend be right that this be difficult time for the steel industry there be headwind that we need to address we need to conclude the negotiation with our us counterpart and bring in energy price reduction which will make big difference and we need the steel strategy we be put all these thing in place we believe that there be great future for steel in south wales and we will continue to support it british warship be make with mixture of uk and non uk steel what impact will this announcement have on that mix particularly for the type frigate programme about which we have some good news early this week navantia which be build three ship have recently enter into contract to use liberty steel that relate to the dalzell plant in scotland so it be unaffected by the announcement we have make today of course work very closely with my colleague in the ministry of defence to ensure that we use british steel where we can and that we have the right infrastructure across the country produce the right type of steel we produce some type of steel for defence and not other and some type of steel for shipping and not other we need to do everything we can to protect british job and produce what we can here in the uk it would have enhance the shadow minister response if he have at least acknowledge that this government be literally pick up the piece after the chaotic dismemberment of the steel industry on the conservative party watch have work at stocksbridge and rotherham and pay tribute to the workforce there but also to the dedicated steel team in the department who know will have be work long hour in support the minister on this the government now own control or fund three of the uk six steel company while full merger of british steel and speciality steel be one option at the very least review of all the asset under the government purview would be good idea to see whether we can create more sustainable investable business and reintegrate some of the internal supply chain would the minister consider that thank my hon friend for his word and particularly his thank to official in the department who be brilliant work with they very closely and they have not have many weekend throughout the whole steel process undertake by this government his expertise be very much welcome we will continue to speak about this as we do yesterday and to use his expertise of course we need to look at the whole situation he be right that the government be now involve in number of steel company although we do not have ownership of any of they and it be different kind of involvement in different part of the country we be review all that and we want to see what the good mix be we will continue to take his advice on that the government have make direct intervention for steel job in scunthorpe and now in rotherham that be no comfort for steelworker in wales no similar measure be take to protect their job can the minister explain why her government will save job in yorkshire and lincolnshire but will only help worker in port talbot to write cv and search for new job as the hon lady will know one of the blast furnace have already close by the time we come into government we have long conversation with tata about different model that we have hop it would pursue we be unsuccessful with that we have now improve the outcome and the support for that workforce and be very pleased to be at the first stage of the build of the electric arc furnace at port talbot in july which will secure many thousand of job there we will continue to support port talbot with the million that we be invest thank the minister for her statement and for the decisive action this government have take to safeguard steel job across the country liberty pipes be deliver an important contract for the government landmark carbon capture usage and storage project in our region can the minister provide assurance not only that those job in our region be unaffected but that this project continue at pace liberty pipes be separate and be not part of this situation at all of course there will be concern in the wide group about the impact understand that but at the moment there be no crossover liberty pipes will continue to do what it be do and be sure will continue to support the ccus industry which be great news for the worker there and great news for we it be good news that liberty steel dalzell in scotland be not involve in this immediate crisis but it be not shroud wave to suggest that the difficulty in the wide industry may mean that one day it will become involved when the overdue steel strategy arrive will it be look at steel production as whole in every corner of this country will the minister help scottish colleague get to the bottom of the scottish government murky deal with this company which mean that they be on the hook for potentially as much as million quite incredible sum which be deeply troubling the scottish government be use the devolution settlement to hide behind what be go on there will she shine torch of truth on that aspect of the steel industry as the hon gentleman know dalzell be separate legal entity so it be not affect but he be right to worry about the overall situation and its possible impact on the company will look into the point he raise about the scottish government and liberty we be look at what the steel industry should look like across the whole of the uk the devolve government be involve in the steel strategy as well as the union the industry and other so we be take holistic view of the whole uk to see what we can do with steel the minister be right to state that the business environment have not be good for the uk steel industry the main cause for that adverse environment of course have be high energy price twice as high as those of european competitor and three time high than those of us competitor give that the energy sector remind we daily that the secretary of state for energy security and net zero intend to continue his manic obsession with net zero which have cause the high energy price and this environment how do the minister hope to attract the private investment that she say be necessary to make the industry bounce back strong and to grow tomorrow industrial energy price double under the previous government the right hon gentleman know that the impact of the ukraine war on our energy price highlight how we be reliant on the global oil and gas market that be why we be push for clean energy by to take we away from that reliance and to stop such crisis happen again should point out that the crisis at liberty be nothing to do with energy price it operate electric arc furnace so it be not anything do with carbon pricing or anything else the right hon gentleman might be refer to he be right that energy price be too high which be why we be intervene we will see significant reduction in electricity cost when we extend the industry super charger from to as outlined early in scenario where speciality steel be produce what it be produce couple of year ago that will give it upwards of million off its energy cost that be lot more than the previous government ever do uk manufacturing have be undervalue for far too long one of the good way to support industry be to ensure that its cost base be as low as possible will the minister commit to the house that in month time uk manufacturer will face low energy cost than today will she also rule out further national insurance increase uk manufacturing suffer under the previous government who have no strategy do not really believe in it and allow thousand of job to be lose across range of different industry this government be take fundamentally different approach we have an industrial strategy under which we intervene directly to grow the industry of the future include foundational industry such as steel which be so important to we for many different reason we be also introduce energy price reduction that for company such as liberty that use high level of energy will mean significant reduction in their cost by next year we be introduce an additional energy reduction for wide group of up to company which by will also receive significant reduction again that be something that the previous government never do thank the minister for her statement and for her commitment on anything that have ever have to speak to the hon lady about she have always be willing to try to achieve something to give security for job and thank she for that personally the fact that some job be on the line be devastating not only for all the family concern but for the subsidiary supply company and those that rely on high quality steel for their manufacturing in northern ireland for example that include harland wolff aerospace and the construction sector for the future of steel the sector must continue to win future contract for our industry how can she provide certainty in these uncertain day thank the hon gentleman for his kind word he be right to point to the supply chain and the need for we to support not just the key industry but the whole network of small and medium sized company across the whole uk not just in northern ireland be in belfast couple of week ago and be delighted to see at harland wolff the building under way of the three ship that be part of the mod contract with navantia be also pleased to go to spirit give our good conversation with boeing about the future of that site and what it could look like also meet lot of other part of the industry advanced manufacturing in northern ireland be show the way in lot of new technology that we need to support will continue to support they group base child sexual exploitation and abuse

so much well that be why on june the home secretary make it abundantly clear that this government will accept all of baroness casey recommendation include the establishment of new statutory national inquiry into group base child sexual exploitation and new national policing operation to get more perpetrator behind bar since then we have make significant stride in lay the foundation for robust survivor centre national inquiry and in establish national policing operation while continue to drive forward the major workstream that be already well under way to tackle those abhorrent crime will first update the house on the progress make to establish new national policing operation to get perpetrator who exploit abuse and harm child behind bar where they belong today can announce that

tackle organise exploitation programme for the very first time this new national policing operation bring together all the relevant police partner under one operation to ensure swift and specialist law enforcement response to groom gang offending this collaborative approach ensure that long term investigative capability be build across police and that good practice be standard end an unacceptable postcode lottery for victim and survivor the new national operation will eliminate inconsistency on how case be handle across force and will ensure that there be no hiding place for perpetrator victim and survivor be central to the operation and trauma inform practice will be at its core over the summer have be meet survivor and their support organisation on the issue this work be already well under way in january the home secretary ask police force to identify case involve grooming and child sexual exploitation that have be close with no further action to pursue new line of inquiry and to reopen investigation where appropriate as result of that commission case have now be identify for formal review and the new national operation have identify high priority case those

who should be behind bar that include the ongoing investigation relate to south yorkshire police handling of report into child sexual abuse and exploitation in rotherham follow discussion between the independent office for police conduct south yorkshire police and the national crime agency can confirm that it have be formally agree that the investigation will now be carry out by the nca under the

be expect in the come week set out the full scope of the operation and the support available to those affect we will never shy away from the fact in these case follow baroness casey audit and her conclusion on the disproportionate role of pakistani heritage gang and build on the work that the home secretary have already commission to improve ethnicity datum in relation to those crime we have also commit to make it requirement to collect ethnicity and nationality datum of suspect who commit child sexual exploitation and abuse offence the home secretary have write to chief constable to signal that the current data collection across ethnicity and nationality be unacceptable and that this datum must be improve as matter of urgency work be now under way look to amend the annual data requirement to support this process and we be look at legislative option to drive forward these improvement finally baroness casey recommend the establishment of new statutory national inquiry that could compel target investigation in local area to get truth and justice for victim and survivor and to drive meaningful change in local system and structure that have fail so many people in the past can confirm that the national inquiry into group base child sexual exploitation and abuse will place victim and survivor firmly at its heart crucially it will ensure trauma inform accessible engagement for victim and survivor that reflect diverse live experience and minimise the risk of re traumatisation the inquiry will examine how effectively local and national safeguarding system protect child from group base sexual exploitation and abuse and hold institution accountable for past failure as the home secretary say in june its purpose must be to challenge what baroness casey audit describe as continue denial resistance and legal wrangling among local agency the inquiry will consider intersection with ethnicity race and culture and assess the safeguarding duty of public service identify both failure and example of good practice know that everyone in the house and beyond want to see the inquiry begin its work at the early opportunity colleague will know that that require the appointment of chair and the agreement of term of reference follow recruitment process over the summer home office official the home secretary and have meet with prospective candidate for the chair of the inquiry and we be now in the final stage of the appointment process most importantly the chair must have the credibility and experience to command the confidence of victim and survivor as well as the wide public meaningful engagement with victim and survivor be paramount to support that dedicated panel of victim and survivor have be establish to contribute to the chair selection process this be critical milestone and once an appointment be confirm the house will be update at the early opportunity member from across the house will understand that this process must be do properly and thoroughly we must avoid repeat of what happen with the effort to appoint chair of the original independent inquiry into child sexual abuse when three chair be appoint and subsequently withdraw from july onwards prior to the eventual appointment of professor alexis jay in full two year after the original chair be name we be determined to ensure that that do not happen again in line with the inquiries act the appoint chair will play central role in shape the commission term of reference these will be publish and subject to consultation with stakeholder include victim and survivor the inquiry be expect to run for two to three year enable it to examine broad range of issue while honour baroness casey recommendation that it must be time limit to deliver answer swiftly key request not just from victim and survivor but from member from across this house the inquiry will begin by identify priority area for review conduct target local investigation and report finding at both local and national level these review will be tailor to the specific context of each area and may involve wide range of organisation include child and family service police the crown prosecution service health and education provider youth service third sector organisation and central government departments whose action and decision have affect what have happen at local level where appropriate the inquiry will issue recommendation at both local and national level we will continue to keep member of the house the victim and the public inform of all appointment and the term of reference the government remain unwavering in their commitment to ensure that this inquiry be robust transparent and capable of deliver truth accountability and meaningful change as we have say from the outset we be determined to ensure that every survivor of groom gang get the support and justice they deserve that every perpetrator be put behind bar that every case historic or current have be properly investigate and that every person or institution who look the other way be hold accountable as that be stain on our society that should be finally remove for good commend this statement to the house order give that the minister have just take minute will be extend the time allowance to the shadow home secretary to six minute and to the spokesperson for the liberal democrats to three minute call the shadow home secretary thank the minister for advance sight of her statement let we remember that victim be at the heart of this young girl some only year old be groom and gang rap by man of predominantly pakistani origin they be girl like jane who be just year old when she be rap by an illegal immigrant but when she be find by police instead of arrest the rapist the police arrest jane or like anna only year old who repeatedly tell social worker that she have be gang rap but instead of help she they allow she to marry her main abuser in an islamic ceremony and the social worker even attend the ceremony the ring leader of the rochdale rape gang shabir ahmed be actually employ as welfare right officer by oldham council in another case man try to rescue his young daughter from be rap but instead of protect she the police arrest her dad speak to mother whose daughter be rap by taxi driver of pakistani origin when she complain to social service they say that if she dare to raise the matter again she would lose her daughter speak to retired police officer who be tell by senior officer at the time to stop investigate abuse by pakistani origin taxi driver in bradford because the police locally do not want to offend bradford muslim community former labour mp simon danczuk be even tell by senior labour party figure to stop ask question in his constituency to avoid antagonise the muslim community these crime be deliberately cover up by people in authority because so call community relation be see as more important than protect young girl that be disgrace the minister claim in her statement moment ago that nothing have be do about this issue previously do not want to dwell on this but gently remind she that it be the last government who set up the original rotherham inquiry in and set up the long run independent inquiry into child sexual abuse which be much broad but do touch on this issue we start to collect datum on the ethnicity of suspect and set up operation soteria to combat sex crime attend many meeting on that we set up the grooming gang taskforce which lead to arrest in its first year and be glad that that be continue we introduce legislation to require mandatory reporting and be again glad that the government be continue that work it be clear that much more be need however this government have have to be drag kick and scream every step of the way when the government rejection of oldham call for national inquiry become public on january the prime minister disgracefully smear as far right those support call for that proper inquiry that kind of language be how these crime get cover up in the first place some day later the government partially turn and announce local inquiry on june face with parliamentary vote two day later the government finally announce statutory national inquiry not because they choose to or want to but because they be force to what the prime minister claim be far right bandwagon in january have become government policy by june here we be three month later and almost no progress have be make my office have be in contact with survivor in oldham today and they have hear nothing we now discover that no chair have be appoint and there be no term of reference there be no news on town such as oldham or bradford and nothing of substance at all that be just not good enough will the minister tell the house precise date when chair will be appoint and when we will have term of reference will this inquiry have full statutory power under the act will she confirm that all town affect will be cover will the minister confirm that no police force or council will be able to investigate themselves perhaps most importantly will she confirm that this inquiry will look at those in authority the police the cps and local council who deliberately cover this up those people be more interested in appease certain minority community than in protect young girl finally do she agree that those individual responsible for deliberately cover up this issue should be prosecute for misconduct in public office and if they be convict send to jail partially thank the shadow home secretary for his tone but will correct the record do not say that he have do nothing say that baroness casey say that there have be decade of inaction on these appalling crime by previous government that be exactly what say answer in my statement many of the question that the right hon gentleman ask his office may have speak to some of the oldham victim today speak to some of they personally last night so keep in touch with lot of victim what will not do what will never do be make it so that they be not involved it take time to ensure that this process be completely victim centre frankly be sure that be what he and other member on the opposition benches who have write to with that request want to see and that be the process we be undertake in answer to the right hon gentleman question no local authority area can turn the inquiry down the home secretary and have say number of time that it be full powerful statutory inquiry have see some scaremongere and victim have write to to say this will not cover government official or people who cover thing up that be absolute nonsense let be very clear and let it be take away by everybody who be sure have the good interest of victim at heart that it will cover what it need to cover to uncover the truth and no stone will be leave unturned that will make for difficult conversation for people if people be find by our court system to have undermine and disgrace public office they should of course be send to prison however that have never happen to date in these case very much hope that we uncover the kind of social worker that the right hon gentleman refer to and hope that they face the full force of everything that they deserve to face but there be absolutely nothing that say that anybody can avoid this inquiry it will be up to the inquiry which be independent and statutory to look at and work with area about where this will be thank my hon friend for her statement no one doubt she and her team absolute commitment to address the root cause of the abuse and exploitation that so many woman and some boy have experience in my contact with woman this morning speak on their behalf hear that they be absolutely committed and understand and reflect the commitment of my hon friend but they be keen to know bit more detail about when the chair can be appoint and about the relationship that the national inquiry will have with the local inquiry my hon friend quite rightly say that victim and survivor should be engage and involve in the appointment of the chair and that be so important will she say more about how we will ensure that there be locality specific representation as well there be slight difference accord to locality there absolutely be my hon friend be exactly right that there be difference so it will be for the chair panel and commission to do that work in locality and ensure that victim engagement be really location specific with regard to the specific issue in oldham we have be engage very closely with oldham for some time include with victim and survivor as say speak to some of they last night about want they to be part of the term of reference for the national inquiry our offer for full and local independent inquiry in oldham remain in place and we be in discussion with they about how they want to proceed in the context of the national inquiry we do not want to have victim have to do repetitive exercise but assure my hon friend that we be speak to official in oldham very regularly call the liberal democrat spokesperson be grateful as always to the minister for advance sight of her statement in every single conversation about this issue in this house our first thought must always be with the victim and the survivor no child should ever suffer the devastating trauma of sexual exploitation or abuse these crime be abhorrent and an assault on the very value of our society we carry responsibility to act to secure justice for victim to ensure that offender answer for their crime and to build future in which such suffering be not repeat in professor alexis jay publish her independent inquiry into child sexual abuse in june baroness casey release her report on group base exploitation be really grateful to the minister for her update on the progress be make but when do she expect to have implement the crucial recommendation from both report baroness casey be clear about one of her key recommendation the government must end the practice of out of area taxi by introduce strong national standard for taxi licensing and driver regulation across greater manchester we know that problem all too well for year driver have exploit the fragmented system by secure the easy licence to obtain from council in one area and then operate elsewhere as result many taxi work in greater manchester be license mile away in wolverhampton what work be the minister do to address that specific issue it feel like there be an opportunity to do so this afternoon through the english devolution and community empowerment bill but that opportunity have not yet be take if an amendment to the bill be the way to achieve that aim will the minister work with colleague across the house to ensure that this important recommendation from baroness casey can be deliver finally turn to an issue that and other have raise repeatedly and on which some progress be hint at in recent press report could the minister confirm when parliament will see legislation for hillsborough law as promise many time by the government to guarantee that public official and authority co operate fully with duty of candour in case such as this one include in the upcoming national inquiry meet the department for transport on the issue of taxi licensing last week this be about look for legislative vehicle the government have say that we will undo some of the harm cause by the deregulation legislation of the past include the danger that have come about related to safeguarding and taxi licensing the hon lady invite member to work across the house in every interaction there have be many that have have with victim of this crime since the last time or the home secretary stand at the dispatch box make statement they have ask if we could just work together and stop throw mud at each other will happily work with anyone on this issue we be currently look for legislative vehicle but we do seek to legislate we expect the hillsborough law shortly be sorry that that be not very prescriptive answer but that law be very much expect the last government fail to implement single recommendation from the iicsa report and professor alexis jay herself speak of the huge anger and disappointment at their response baroness casey work rightly focus on the future and be grateful for today statement but can the minister please reassure that the extraordinary work of professor jay and all the brave victim and survivor who contribute to her inquiry will not be forget and that the government will implement the iicsa recommendation in full include its recommendation on the criminal injury compensation scheme currently that scheme exclude far too many victim of group base child sexual exploitation and leave they without adequate support to rebuild their life praise my hon friend for her long term commitment in this space the government have give number of update on iicsa expect to come back to this house soon one way or another with further update on progress in that area much of the progress we be seek to make be through bills that be currently pass through parliament and be over in the other place but my hon friend make the very important point that we must not undermine the two year piece of work that have already be do by professor jay we will make sure that all those finding and recommendation which casey include as well and any intelligence that be send to we feed into the new national independent inquiry over the summer lord cryer say that there be deliberate attempt to silence his mother ann cryer when she first bravely raise the issue of groom gang in keighley more than year ago ann cryer be of course one of my predecessor as member of parliament for keighley lord cryer say that he be absolutely certain there have be cover up on local level and that bradford need to be examine as part of the inquiry unfortunately bradford council and other in this house be still say that they will only support focus on bradford if that be deem necessary by the inquiry chair that be not the same thing as say that they will actively lobby for that outcome so do the minister share my concern that bradford council reluctance for an inquiry to take place in our area have not change despite the voice of so many victim and other demand one pay tribute to ann cryer woman be incredibly fond of personally as well as professionally for her immense bravery have no doubt that none of we would be sit in the chamber today talk about any of this have it not be for she she deserve absolute credit do not recognise the characterisation that the hon gentleman have give have not have any particular pushback or hear anywhere suggest that the inquiry should not be look into certain area or give any sense that they will resist it but would say to all local area resistance be futile welcome today update on the national inquiry into groom gang particularly the way in which the minister have make sure that victim and survivor be definitely go to be at the heart of whatever happen during the trial of seven member of rochdale groom gang early this year it emerge in court that the social worker involve have refer to one of the victim who be at the time as prostitute other victim who be at the time be also call prostitute know the minister will agree that the criminalisation of young girl as prostitute cause they far trauma later in life these girl be victim and the state should recognise they as such so what step will the minister take to ensure that such conviction for prostitution be disregard as swiftly as possible often in this debate we discuss how people feel nervous or anxious about ethnicity when what be also evident in every single case regardless of the ethnicity of the perpetrator be the ability of agency to look at woman and think of they as something else and to treat young girl poorly that be exactly what my hon friend be talk about the crime and policing bill which be go through parliament be go to disregard any child prostitution conviction we be work with the ministry of justice to find the wide cohort of victim and with body in the criminal justice system to identify and review case and to support victim it will not always have be prostitution charge have meet many victim who have be criminalise for variety of thing that they probably should not have be that will be much more complicated process but it be one that we have set in train be glad that the minister want to put victim and survivor first and hope the whole house will join she in that it be absolutely right that we all do so she will be aware of the tom crowther inquiry which highlight victim over year in telford and in some part of my constituency early the minister say to the house that we do not want victim to have to undergo repetitive exercise understand why she say that but would she support the national inquiry go back to telford to ensure that thing that should have be do but that still have not be do will be do will she also ensure that the labour council forgive in telford and wrekin will not stand in the way of that progress on the contrary very few people have write to more throughout this process than the leader of telford council who have talk about how they want to continue to make progress be very familiar with what happen in telford quite lot of the evidence show that people in telford be groom where live in birmingham yet the telford inquiry while brilliant do not lead to any change in neighbouring area that be exactly what we hope the national inquiry will do so although can not direct where it must go absolutely want it to look at prior work that have be do and some of the gap that have be identify exactly as the right hon gentleman say welcome my hon friend statement this be yet another example of the state turn its back on working class people in this case young girl also welcome the fact that cold case be go to be investigate and that those case will be reopen if there be any evidence of criminal activity but in the past when an inquiry have be announce we have see police suspend until the outcome of that inquiry investigation that they have be undertake can the minister assure we that that will not happen in this case yes my hon friend make an important point that we have to make sure that the inquiry be not use for further state inactivity there have be case where that have happen before as we be undertake new national policing operation in operation beaconport at the same time as the national inquiry give he my absolute assurance that will ensure that the two work closely together so that such situation can not happen unless it would cause such judicial issue that it would have to happen truly thank the minister for put vulnerable girl first and central in her statement as we all know victim of sexual abuse be too often disbelieve by the authority whatever the circumstance speak out take immense courage and people pay an immense cost only too often welcome her announcement regard the national inquiry but can she assure that the government delay violence against woman and girl strategy will clarify how victim will be support to rebuild their life and can she please say when it will be publish there have be some reporting that the violence against woman and girl strategy will not include child abuse victim and groom gang victim can stand here and say that be utter rubbish it absolutely will and it will be publish very shortly any delay be only out of my own perfectionism think that be what will call it this be year strategy that will last until at least the next parliament and it have to be right huge part of it will absolutely be about support for victim thank my hon friend not only for her statement but for the care and determination she have bring to this role to centre the discussion and action around victim and young girl and to work in collaboration with other not just in this house but those who be directly affect may just add to the point that the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart raise about loophole in taxi licensing one of the big issue that come up in my constituency both from taxi user and woman group as well as from the vast majority of decent hard work taxi driver be that these loophole and ineffective and outdated taxi licensing give bad name to the system as whole urge the minister to work with her colleague and to ensure that as we proceed with the national inquiry we also proceed with the updating of legislation to give protection to all absolutely long before baroness casey be point out the safeguarding issue be be lobby by decent hard work people about the failure of the taxi licensing system as it stand we will consider all option as have say we have commit to legislate specifically on this point but we be also look at include out of area work as well as national standard and enforcement and at consult on make local transport authority responsible for licensing what disappointment come to the house today to listen to the minister statement in the hope that we would get some detailed information about the government statutory inquiry what have we have today long statement and little information in fact would go so far as to say that what this government be do with the rape gang inquiry be masterclass in procrastination what do we hear from the prime minister that it be right wing bandwagon what do we hear from senior ministers that it be dog whistle issue we want to know what the term of reference be and when they will be put on the government website so that we can all inspect they when will this conclude or do the minister hope that it will go on and on past the next general election be not sure the right hon lady want to hear my hope about the next general election as say early the victim of this crime have sit in front of with tear in their eye and say that they hate it when we shout at each other about these thing and that they wish we would work together just to tell she the detail again outline that case have now be identify by the new policing investigation which be recommendation of baroness casey of those we be expedite case the term of reference will be publish and consult on and would very much welcome the right hon lady opinion she have never ask for meeting with and would love to have one if she would like to be involve in how we build those term of reference up please get in touch with my office have to say however that hers be not the voice be most concerned about hear those people be speak to one of the most shocking indictment in baroness casey evidence to the home affairs committee be the long list of inquiry and speech and the shocking lack of action that have follow so welcome the announcement that the minister have make about action to tackle these issue can she update we on the establishment of the child protection agency how it will be set up as this inquiry go on and how it will adjust and evolve as learning from the inquiry come out my hon friend be absolutely right because baroness casey point out how many of her recommendation hinge on there be good child protection authority and that work be be do by department for education colleague have be involve along with alexis jay and have ensure that she have be in meeting with they the authority will evolve because what we do not want to do contrary to the view of some in the house be to wait forever to set it up or to try to get it exactly right first time when it be complicated thing it will evolve along the way but all those involve in the inquiry across both local and national body will have the opportunity to feed in their view about what it need to look like be wholly supportive of this government commission report into group base child sexual exploitation but the government must not be distract from the place where child sexual abuse occur most frequently the national society for the prevention of cruelty to child report that of young people who have be sexually abuse say that the perpetrator be someone they know around third of child sexual abuse be perpetrate by young people under the age of and the nspcc say that in relation to sible sexual abuse the number of child affect by this hide harm be far great than be acknowledge by policymaker be the minister certain that the government will not be distract from abuse within school and within family praise the hon gentleman for say that because familial abuse and child exploitation not by group but by family or peer group be be afraid to say not uncommon know that from my year of experience those victim feel as if their voice be be marginalise this piece of work that we have announce today be part of much broad child abuse body that sit within the home office and work on all those thing the recommendation of the independent inquiry into child sexual abuse keep we on that track but we must not lose sight of all the abuse especially that happen among young people against other young people and online thank the minister for her statement today and for the recognition that process that be support by those people who should be at the heart of it be always difficult we must take time to ensure that any inquiry have the faith of the people at the centre of it because it will never be possible to do that again as they have be fail too often we have discuss before how child abuse and exploitation do not stop at gretna will the minister outline what engagement there have be with the devolved administration on how we can make this truly national inquiry my hon friend be right as say early there be likely to be border crossing between birmingham and telford which be mention in the early inquiry we continue to discuss this with the devolved administration the scottish government can set up specific national inquiry under the inquiries act as we have but any cross border finding will of course be share action will be seek and potentially recommendation will be make at the start of the summer there be some horrendous report about rape and assault commit by south yorkshire police welcome the decision to involve the national crime agency and strip responsibility for those investigation from the force but can the minister confirm that the national inquiry will examine the role of the police not only in cover up but in the crime themselves south yorkshire police should never have be leave to investigate themselves in this matter and move those investigation to the nca be absolutely the right thing to do would be lie if say that over the year have not meet girl who talk to about how police be part of not just the cover up but the perpetration we must ensure that victim can come and give that testimony it be hard to give than other testimony because it bring fear and lack of trust but if that be where the inquiry take we because that be what victim say that be what will happen the crime of group base child sexual exploitation be probably the most heinous imaginable it be so brave of victim to speak out seek justice and drive change so that other young life be protect from such crime can the minister tell we more about how the national inquiry will engage with victim and survivor and ensure that their voice and the voice of those who previously bravely contribute to investigation and inquiry be central to the recommendation unlike the criminal law the criminal injury compensation scheme do not recognise that child can not legally consent and exclude those who have be deem to consent from compensation will the minister work with the victims minister the under secretary of state for justice my hon friend the member for pontypridd alex davies jones to right that injustice absolutely commit myself to work with the victims minister the issue of consent and the age of consent be huge part of baroness casey review and number of member have mention make this victim centre process these be word that we say but it be much hard in reality we be talk about people who have be very badly wrong and whose level of trust have be badly affect this be not something that happen easily it be not process in which every one of the victim will get on with the other we will ensure that in both the national police inquiry and the national statutory inquiry there be system to enable as many voice as possible to be hear as comfortably as possible but do not think we should lie to the public about how easy those procedure be speak as someone who have work in this field for very long time we be talk about very traumatised and distressed young people and this will take considerably more effort and patience than think they have be show in the past groom gang be entirely abhorrent as be all form of groom lead to sexual exploitation this summer meet torbay resident whose year old adopt son have be groom online and then prostitute online can the minister please tell we how she intend to tackle all form of groom that lead to sexual exploitation my hon friend the member for oldham east and saddleworth debbie abrahams mention the importance of draw attention to the fact that especially in the context of the online crime of sexploitation boy be at great risk that be the only area of exploitation in which most of the victim be teenage boy and it be new and grow phenomenon say to the hon gentleman that in both the national inquiry and operation beaconport the home secretary and have be push at every stage for recognition of the fact that this process can not just rake over historic coal it must be ground in recognition of the way in which abuse be happen now and improve police force response to it and undoubtedly it be now happen online the most frightening statistic that keep awake at night be that last year of child sexual abuse be perpetrate by child age between and pay tribute to my hon friend for what have be lifetime of work protect woman and girl welcome what she have say about update the ethnicity datum which will enable the public debate to take place on the basis of datum and fact rather than the prejudice and scaremongering of which she have speak but do she think it might also help to engender trust in the debate if she be to take this opportunity to acknowledge that there be completely unacceptable woke reluctance to offend certain community and that this culture of deference where it persist must be stamp out thank my hon friend for his kind word and will certainly take that opportunity because have see this with my own eye in case in which have be involve people have say oh it might cause trouble that be not stop they do it but they would not have even mention it to in other circumstance what we have to do and what we all owe to the victim of these crime be to call it what it be but also not to use our own political agenda in relation to their very delicate and harm life whatever form that take we do not want backlash cause the police to go on thinking oh gosh this be go to open can of worm we must all act responsibly in respect of these issue however have definitely see this and it should never have be allow to happen recently meet dr joanna kerr an extremely brave survivor of child sexual exploitation and abuse in scotland as it stand the national inquiry will not cover scotland and the scottish national party government will not launch their own ask the minister again will she commit herself to extend the national inquiry to cover all part of the united kingdom include scotland or do victim like joanna not deserve justice it be not that victim like joanna do not deserve justice they absolutely do deserve justice do not know about joanna case but should be more than happy to meet she and talk to she about it the body that must hold national inquiry into event in scotland be body in the devolved government because both policing and child protection be devolve issue however as say to one of my hon friend early be more than happy to look into this people who be scottish or who live in scotland now and have be abuse in an area cover by the inquiry will absolutely be able to take part one of the question that haunt baroness casey audit be why why be this type of offending allow to grow seemingly unchecked for so long will the minister whom it be good to see in her place give an assurance that serious and credible research on all the factor that drive and enable the horrendous crime of gang base child sexual exploitation will be commission and will operate without fear or favour absolutely one of baroness casey recommendation be for piece of research on exactly that the why about thing that be cover up and the why about community but also institution the home office be currently work with various academic to commission such research and it be fundamental while huge amount of discussion and as have say agree with it have concern the why issue on ethnicity with the nervousness the wokeness or whatever we want to call it another why be about class and the way in which the system treat these young woman when they come forward and indeed the way in which they treat plenty of other woman when they come forward in relation to any of these issue it be pity that the government have have to be drag scream into grant this inquiry into pakistani rape and groom gang but the inquiry be welcome however give the fact that nobody have be appoint yet the term of reference have not be determine and we do not even know how long the inquiry be go to take be sure the minister will understand why victim will be look for what can be do immediately to address their concern for those case where police officer social worker and council official have be identify as cover up can we be assure that their case will be deal with ahead of any inquiry for those who have be put in jail can we ensure that they serve out their sentence unlike the oxford six who be release early despite the recommendation do actually say in my statement that as outline in baroness casey review the inquiry should take around two to three year and be time sensitive all can say to the right hon gentleman be that in order to make sure that we be do this right we will shortly be provide an update on the chair of the inquiry gently remind he of the two year it take to find chair for the child sex abuse inquiry two year and three fail attempt do not want to do that to people this time so that be why we be take the time we all want to see an end to groom gang and justice for victim and survivor because exploit the most vulnerable be about as despicable and heinous as it get we all know that perpetrator come from different background and community but certain politically motivated individual be try to blame particular community which be why they try to gloss over that fact in their effort to sow division and discord we certainly can not be politically correct about this either because no one regardless of race or religion be above the law we can not allow such an important issue to be treat like sectarian political football by those who seek to sow division can my hon friend the minister outline what the government will do to root out this evil with this second national inquiry how will it remain focused on victim and survivor and how will she ensure that this debate be conduct in sensible sensitive manner stand here as vessel of the victim who have speak to they have not necessarily use the word sectarian but they hate this issue be use as political football baroness casey in the medium that she do post release her report say the same she feel that politic be not meet the moment in some of the response we have get to do well and the very first thing that would say be that welcome the involvement and look forward to the engagement on the term of reference which will be publish for consultation with every single member of this house regardless of what they might have say before or whether we might have fall out on other occasion welcome the inquiry and want to make sure that we show the very good of this place because that be the least that victim deserve the minister will be well aware that many of the victim of this disgraceful despicable type of activity be originally take from broken home and put into the care of local authority and then groom ruthlessly social worker turn blind eye manager tell social worker to turn blind eye the police in many way be complicit one of the problem be that the whistleblower who come forward to tell the story be all sack what action will the minister take to ensure not only that the victim be protect but that the whistleblower who come forward and tell the truth of what be go on be similarly protect as part of this inquiry absolutely agree with the hon gentleman he be not man have fall out with before hear from some whistleblower this week that some of their testimony be not publish by iicsa when deal with the term of reference we have to ensure that there be robust safeguard for whistleblower have work with one of the whistleblower sara rowbotham who lose her job in rochdale have meet she and her member of parliament to talk about exactly some of that and how we need to get this right not just in the inquiry or in operation beacon port but in the future on august the minister describe certain council that do not believe that they have problem with grooming gang as idiot can she explain if that also apply to the government give the enormous pressure it take for they to implement this inquiry and the disparage comment previously make by the prime minister it would be play very long game to say that have be take kick or scream into this issue sarah rowbotham be one of the whistleblower and write book about she and this particular issue about nine year ago have also set up many many support service for victim of these crime will always do what think be good in these case and take the advice of baroness casey try to see bad faith or to score political point be not what we should do pay tribute to the minister for her work and thank she for her statement this crime be absolutely abhorrent every single victim and survivor of this crime must get justice no matter the perpetrator pakistani indian english or anyone so can we please dial down the politicisation and the inflammatory rhetoric in this place and show total compassion and empathy when we work together to tackle this scourge in our country for every single victim may ask the minister for meeting with and my colleague so that we can learn how we can support the work of the government in this space of course will meet the hon gentleman and like say any colleague who wish to take part in this work as somebody who represent large and diverse community have to say that the pakistani part of my community have be most fervent in want the truth to come out because harm have be do to they by the alleged wokeness that have be talk about as finish my statement let take this opportunity to say that we have to make sure that we have the fact and do not feel squeamish about the perpetrator at am on monday morning meet victim of this crime who be black white and asian we must not silence those victim by only ever talk about one type of victim the victimhood in group base abuse be not just one type apart from one thing they be all girl bill present sentencing

bring in bill standing order no beg to move that leave be give to bring in bill to make provision for review of allergy guidance relate to the feeding and weaning of baby and infant and for connected purpose have child be tell be one of the most amazing and fulfilling time of new parent life hope to be able to report back to the house on the validity of that claim later in the year hon member hear hear however it can also be period of huge anxiety parent be reliant on our brilliant nhs through pregnancy and those important first few month of child life they will be inundate with information via medical professional peer support group or the internet and will of course make the good decision they can base on the information they have this matter be personal to as long time allergy sufferer expect my first child have be actively seek out information on how can well militate against my child grow up with some of the food allergy that have and be not alone rate of allergic disease such as asthma hay fever and food allergy have be increase the uk have some of the high rate of allergic condition in the world affect more than one quarter of the population allergic condition be one of the most common chronic disease in childhood around of all visit to the gp be due to allergy and medicine to treat allergic disease account for of the total gp prescribing budget the direct cost to the nhs of manage allergic disease be more than billion per annum but the cost in reality be likely to be much high the cost to individual allergy sufferer and their family be great still with huge impact on their life as many of we know all too well increase anxiety social isolation and limited opportunity for travel and other experience because the health risk be far too high and allergy awareness be far too low on average two child in every classroom be affect by food allergy and food allergy double in the uk between and the scale of the problem be huge with allergy impact every classroom and every gp surgery in the uk have speak to some of the most noted allergy specialist in the country ahead of today it be clear to that the current food allergy guidance for the feeding and weaning of baby and infant should be review with particular focus on child who be show early sign of allergic disease well address allergy at primary care level be relatively simple but hugely effective way of move the allergy conversation towards prevention the government new year plan for the nhs rightly demand that focus on prevention prevention in allergy be about recognise the key principle that prevent severe condition from develop rather than purely focus on the treatment of those severe condition be well for both patient and the financial sustainability of our nhs rather than long wait to see allergy specialist and the hope of medical trial once child have already develop an allergy which have huge waiting list and be sadly not effective for everyone improve our approach to allergy in our public health advice and primary care can be the key to prevent child from develop allergy in the first place the guidance should be review for number of reason to improve the clarity and consistency of message to increase awareness to help to empower healthcare professional and to ensure that ethnic minority be not be put at disadvantage however before go into detail as to why the evidence suggest we need this review want to be clear about what this bill be not current nhs guidance recommend exclusive breastfeed for about the first six month of the baby life and that continue breastfeed into the baby second year or beyond alongside other food be good for their development the bill do not contradict that advice it be not about change the advice give to the majority of parent it be only for child who be begin to show sign of allergy development such as those with severe eczema and those already show sign of food allergy additionally any suggestion of early weaning for this cohort of child be to be do alongside breastfeed there be no suggestion in the study that cite to support the bill that breastfeed rate be impact by alter public health advice to well prevent allergy nhs guidance on introduce food that could trigger allergy show that delay the introduction of peanut and egg beyond six to month may increase the risk of develop an allergy to these food the report that this advice be base on be almost year old other country around the world have take more aggressive approach to allergy prevention over the past decade and we in the uk need to learn and adapt base on the outcome of those different approach the medical guidance and evidence from other part of the world include the us and some area of europe actually go far and encourage the early introduction of those allergen which be particularly the case for child who display allergy early on the learning early about peanut allergy study or leap look at the introduction of peanut into the diet of infant age between four and month who be at high risk of peanut allergy with high risk infant define as those with the presence of significant eczema pre exist egg allergy publish year ago now the study demonstrate that the consumption of snack contain peanut by infant who be at high risk of develop peanut allergy prevent the subsequent development of the allergy of the child who avoid peanut have develop peanut allergy by the age of five while only of the child who be randomise to eat the peanut snack have develop the allergy by the age of five in the us the guidance recommend that parent of child who be believe to be most likely to develop peanut allergy infant with severe eczema an egg allergy or both introduce these child to peanut contain food at four to six month or get referral to an allergist who will give the child skin prick test or blood test to check if the child be allergic to peanut european guideline make similar recommendation on the early introduction of peanut and egg between four and six month while nhs guidance suggest that delay the introduction of peanut and egg may increase the risk of develop the allergy believe that more information should be give to parent when their child be show early sign of allergy the feedback have have from speak to young parent and parent to be be too often that the information for these child be too difficult to find or that the medical professional the parent be engage with be more likely to take safety first approach and not encourage the early introduction of allergen believe that review of the guidance will help to empower our nhs to give the good most medically appropriate information to parent at time when they can be at their most anxious it must be support by education and awareness campaign together with training for the different healthcare professional who support these new parent so that the advice they give be consistent and reflect good practice finally as touch on at the start have concern that the current lack of guidance be most likely to impact young child from ethnic minority family the evidence suggest that these child be both more likely to develop an allergy and more predisposed to have multiple allergy as result they be more likely to be disadvantage without clear unambiguous guidance on how their parent can navigate those first few month ask hon member across the house for their support with the bill so that we can get parent the good allergy advice for their child and so that we can mitigate the effect of and in many case ultimately prevent allergic disease question put and agree to order that becky gittins jim shannon chris bloore alex mcintyre sarah coombes kirith entwistle jodie gosling maya ellis pam cox claire hughes satvir kaur and catherine fookes present the bill becky gittins accordingly present the bill bill read the first time to be read second time on friday september and to be print bill english devolution and community empowerment bill second reading relevant document oral evidence take before the housing communities and local government committee on january and february on english devolution hc the reason amendment in the name of the official opposition have be select beg to move that the bill be now read second time this government be elect on manifesto to deliver change real change for work people change that people can see and feel around they that mean more money in their pocket decent job new home good transport link thrive high street and opportunity for young people but after year of tory government unwilling to take the tough choice to make life well for work people it be no wonder that people have lose hope that real change be possible and we have plan to change that plan to give people with skin in the game real control over their life and the power to have real stake in their place and share in our country success our landmark english devolution and community empowerment bill will deliver this and more it will help we to build modern state base on fair strong partnership between government and local people with the aim of renew people faith that the state can work for they that faith have be sorely test in recent year after more than decade of broken promise from those on the conservative benches people associate whitehall with failure and decline the community that once build britain have see good job disappear secure home crumble and once strong community divide thing that our parent and grandparent once rely on that rely on as young mum have fall by the wayside it be my mission to rebuild those foundation of good life for all community in all part of our country work on the frontline of local government and see how it change people life know that will not achieve our goal unless we fundamentally change the way that our country be run that mean hand power back to where it belong to local people with skin in the game so that they can make decision on what really matter to their community this bill will drive the big transfer of power in generation out of whitehall to our region and community and end the begging bowl micro manage culture it will make devolution the default set by give mayor new power over planning housing and regeneration to get britain build as part of our plan for change rebuild local government so that it can once again deliver good local service that people can rely on and empower local community to have big say in shape their local area in the right hon lady attempt to drive forward this carthorse of devolution will she tell we where the accountability and scrutiny will come from and where the voice of local people will really be hear be really disappointed because think that the previous government be the one to turbocharge devolution and we be move on that agenda we actually do believe that devolution be good thing and that these measure will enable mayor and local area to be empower more to drive that growth that we desperately need in all part of the country this bill be long overdue england be one of the most centralised develop country in the world too often the system work against rather than with local people too many decision affect too many be make by too few that combine with short term stick plaster politic have leave the country in doom loop of worsen regional divide madam deputy speaker you many wonder why scot would make an intervention at this point in the debate may advise the right hon lady to look north to scotland to see how this should not be do the scottish government have centralise power take they right away from community such as mine that be how we should not do it this be cautionary tale thank the hon member for his guidance always look north contrary to what other people believe be very proud of the north gently say to he that the challenge at the moment lie with the government of scotland hopefully we can reverse thing and have government who truly believe in put the power in local people hand we only have to look at the difference be make by our mayor to see that there be well way from build ten of thousand of new social home with mayor rotheram in liverpool to fight child poverty with mayor mcguinness in the north east to make people commute quick and cheap with mayor burnham in my own greater manchester and to create london summer of al fresco dining and world lead culture with mayor khan will my right hon friend give way on that point will happily give way we be very proud of the work of our greater manchester mayor andy burnham on the issue of drive change would like to raise point about driver half of private hire taxi in greater manchester be license outside the area that undermine local enforcement and accountability as well as local driver who do the right thing do my right hon friend agree that the bill be chance to fix that protect passenger raise and maintain standard and back the good in trade as another greater manchester mp my hon friend will know that mayor burnham have be try to address taxi licensing for some year think madam deputy speaker you be here for the previous statement which listen to intently in which the minister make it clear that there be commitment to introduce that legislation as quickly as possible we need to make sure that that vehicle be there and sit next to be the leader of the house whose job it be to make sure that happen we have also increase opportunity and give young people voice in decision in the east midland with mayor ward we be drive forward new mass transit network for west yorkshire with mayor brabin support woman and girl into activity and sport with mayor skaith in north yorkshire and not to forget work to secure the future of doncaster sheffield airport with mayor coppard in south yorkshire we be also secure the extension of the birmingham tramline with mayor parker for many year under the tories the west midland be at the bottom of the league table for regional transport investment but mayor richard parker have secure billion of investment to extend the metro will my right hon friend confirm that the power in the bill will make it easy for combined authority to deliver these kind of project in the future include hope further extension of the metro to south birmingham thank my hon friend for his intervention and again give full credit to mayor richard parker who have be work tirelessly with the labour government to invest in the future of birmingham also thank my hon friend for his campaigning press the case that his constituent be well off for such an investment which will bring new job and well transport link this bill be just the start of that on job in sadiq khan first two term as london mayor he have see the creation of more than job by the greater london authority these be high quality well pay job that bring huge opportunity to londoners from all walk of life do the secretary of state agree that this be the testament to growth that devolution can deliver which will be far boost by this bill absolutely agree with my hon friend this be about unlock growth in all part of the country hope that most hon member can see that people with skin in the game be work across the board to make sure that that potential be reach be talk not just about london although london be incredibly important to that but about all region across our country first thank mayor tracy brabin for her investment in mass transit across west yorkshire include new bus station in my town of dewsbury be grateful for those investment but how will this bill stop council from make the decision to distribute funding unequally across its borough how would it stop council from for instance make decision to shut down sport centre that be use by people of all age on the pretence of there be reinforce autoclave aerate concrete and then not take step to investigate or have plan to reopen welcome the hon member comment on the mass transit network for west yorkshire which be sure will bring add benefit to his constituent to his other point obviously elect official in local council make decision and would gently say to he that council have face significant pressure since the austerity measure of which be sure he be aware of be in local government at the time and remember be union rep and see the devastation we be try to restore and empower local government instead of this situation where they have to make incredibly difficult decision that be harmful to their constituent it be about be able to grow our economy and have big slice of the cake we be already invest more into local government so that we can deliver the service that people want within this bill be the community asset element which may be able to help community in relation to high street and to sport facility which can be utilise as an asset that they value in their local area we be also improve local transport for people in the west of england with mayor godwin our brilliant ambitious mayor be make difference every day for their region work with they we have already achieve so much after just year in office we be on track to achieve devolution across almost of the country cover million people we have create integrate funding settlement for greater manchester and the west midland give their mayor the tool and freedom to make decision to get growth go with liverpool city region london the north east south yorkshire and west yorkshire set to benefit from the same freedom next year we be in london the great city in the world some would say anyway and we have all just come back from holiday have we not our mayor sadiq khan have ambitious plan for an overnight accommodation levy that would put we on par with paris and new york and would harness our growth those fund could help regenerate the tourism sector and improve the visitor experience wonder whether the secretary of state would be open to use this devolution bill to give mayor everywhere the power to make decision about those kind of thing can hear much provocation from the conservative benches but any new tax be of course matter for the chancellor at the budget and it must balance the potential revenue and benefit against the impact on taxpayer and the economy really welcome the bill effort to strengthen community and local democracy however be worried that not enough be be do to protect private renter in lambeth nearly third of resident be renter rent be rise fast than wage and the average renter be pay more than the national average which be leave many family struggle and in poverty the renters rights bill be definitely step in the right direction but it fall short on rent hike do my right hon friend agree that this bill be an opportunity to give metro mayor the power to bring in rent control and protect renter in their city the renters rights bill do contain measure that mean that renter can challenge unfair rent hike the previous government say many time that they would do something about section no fault eviction but they do not our renters rights bill will ensure that we end those eviction which be cause so much harm to my hon friend constituent and many around the country our devolution revolution be well under way with other queue up to join it this what we commit to in our manifesto and we be deliver it through this bill crucially the bill will make devolution the default for how the government do business with new strategic authority have power to pilot and request new function and government have duty to respond to certain request it will mean that we can deliver devolution far and fast on devolve the ability to run pilot and follow up on the point make by the hon member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy bristol city council include labour councillor vote cross party to have the power to pilot rent control recent figure show that typical private renter in my constituency spend of their income on rent that be not sustainable this bill could offer the opportunity for that pilot order intervention have become far too long there be many member in the chamber who wish to contribute which the secretary of state might think about before she take more intervention will pay attention to that madam deputy speaker the hon lady be right that there be challenge in housing at the moment which be also contribute to the rental situation for people that be why we have big ambition to build more house the bill give we more power for strategic planning so that we can get on with build the home that people need the renters rights bill do start to make progress toward make housing fairer for renter something that the previous government promise but fail to deliver will now make progress madam deputy speaker before the secretary of state make progress will she give way laughter the strategic authority will be create as new category of authority in law they will make it easy for local leader to work together over large area to drive through big pro growth project such as integrated transport network and housing these will operate at three level foundation mayoral and establish mayoral and the particular power and responsibility that each of they will have be to be define by the bill work alongside parliamentarian and local councillor mayor drive forward the delivery of people priority drive growth unlock infrastructure and power national renewal from the ground up that be why the bill will give mayor wide range new power in area such as transport planning and economic development will the secretary of state give way will make progress we will create new planning power to raise the mayoral community infrastructure levy which have generate over billion since in london and alongside investment and leadership from mayor khan have help to fund the elizabeth line with the expansion of their remit the bill will allow mayor who choose to raise precept to spend it on the full range of function ensure that local taxis be spend on local priority be sure that the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly will welcome this change give that it be the conservatives who first introduce the mayoral precept nearly decade ago and that mayor boris johnson use business rate supplement to help pay for crossrail hope the shadow secretary of state will wholeheartedly support the new power in the bill which will mean that mayor can intervene in major strategic planning application to unlock housing as long as that housing be nowhere near his constituency of course we will also introduce power to license share cycle scheme so that they work for everyone and so that bike be not lie across pavement the bill will see more mayor take on police and crime commissioner function and become responsible for fire and rescue function allow they to take join up approach to improve public safety will the secretary of state give way one more time and briefly in southend east and rochford we be proud coastal community but we have be leave behind when it come to connectivity educational outcome and investment in skill do the secretary of state agree that through this bill we have chance to deliver the long term meaningful change that my constituent deserve absolutely agree with my hon friend this be about all area be able to join up and create inclusive growth for their area and that be broad than at local authority level by combine those effort we can unlock the potential and his constituent will feel the benefit of that as we take this forward the new power also mean new duty include to produce local growth plan demonstrate how mayor plan to unlock growth through planning and house building there will also be duty to co operate with local government pension scheme manager so that mayor can attract investment into their local area unlock job and opportunity mayor across the country will also be able to appoint commissioner to support they as their responsibility grow just like in london the bill also strengthen the ability of mayor to work with the public sector convene local partner so that they can lead with helicopter view of public service across their region we be back the ambition and untapped potential of local area with more ambitious role for the mayor represent they that must be underpin by election that command public confidence because of change make by the last government mayor can be elect on just fraction of the vote despite serve million of people and manage multimillion pound budget we can do well than that the bill will therefore revert to supplementary vote system for elect mayor and police and crime commissioner after the may election to provide great accountability and strong personal mandate for mayor in addition the bill will bar mayor from also sit as mps ensure that local place benefit fully from have dedicated local champion if the deputy prime minister feel that election for mayoral authority should have supplementary vote as that give they sufficient authority why do she not feel the same for member of this house million of people be represent by mayor who have huge power over big region we want mayor to have strong personal mandate for the community they serve rather than be elect on fraction of the vote it be right that first past the post remain in place for general election to maintain the constituency link will the right hon lady give way will give way to the right hon gentleman who have be very patient be truly grateful this be hope non party political point the white paper in advance of the bill mention rightly that there have be consultation on strengthen the standard and conduct framework for local authority which relate to campaign many of we have be involve in to try to protect local council clerk against bullying we be pleased to be call into that consultation there be however nothing about that in the bill do the right hon lady plan to bring it forward in separate legislation thank the right hon gentleman for raise that important issue we intend to bring forward legislation our response to the local government standard consultation set out our plan for whole system reform include empower local authority to suspend councillor who be guilty of serious misconduct for up to six month with the option to withhold allowance and institute premise and facility ban we be committed to ensure that misconduct be deal with swiftly and fairly across the country at local and regional mayoral level we do want to take action on the issue let be clear that strong mayor and strategic authority will not replace council nor the crucial work of the house mp on both side of the house will continue to be vocal champion for their area and we expect mayor to engage in regular and constructive dialogue with mps work together in the good interest of their constituent alongside the freedom for mayor to focus on local priority my department be continue to explore local public accounts committee style model to improve the system of accountability and scrutiny of local spending the government expect mayor to use their new power to deliver real change not retain the status quo this be not about grandstand or make political point it be about use the lever of growth to unlock infrastructure and drive investment the role of local authority in deliver vital local service and improve local neighbourhood be essential and it will continue we also expect to see strategic authority work hand in glove with their constituent council to deliver for their resident the bill will help rebuild local government for the community who depend on it day in day out as fit legal and decent foundation of devolution the bill will establish the local audit office to help fix the break fragmented local audit system we will also reform local authority governance require council with committee system to move to leader and cabinet model and put stop to new local authority mayor role be create that change will streamline decision making across all council and make it easy for people to understand how their council be run it will also give the government the tool to deliver local government reorganisation result in well outcome for resident and significant saving that can be reinveste in public service and improve accountability at all level we be back local people to drive growth and great opportunity for all because from top to bottom the good decision for community be make by those who know their area well that be why the bill will also give local community across the country much need new power like big say in shape their place through effective neighbourhood governance with council require to make sure that this be happen as well as the tool to transform their high street and neighbourhood through new community right to buy to save much love community asset like pub and shop from be lose and to protect sport ground which be at the heart of so many community and source of great local pride the bill will also support our high street by ban the unfair practice of upwards only rent review prevent the blight of vacant shop front because it be only when every community succeed that our country succeed the bill and our reform herald new era for britain new way of govern that put politic back in the service of work people where previous government promise and fail the british people this government be keep faith note the conservatives reason amendment must say that after they leave the country with the bad housing crisis in generation be dismayed that they would oppose bill that will unlock housing and planning on vast scale this bill will empower local community to take back control of their high street by end the tory policy of upward only rent review and it will end the begging bowl culture of the last government while the tories make empty promise to level up the country this labour government be get on with the job within day of take office secretaries of state be pass down newly win power for the sake of our town city and village with the prime minister lead the way it have not always be easy but real change take hard work we be rewire britain and with it growth and opportunity this be how the british people will take back control and how we will unite our country in time when we have never need it more commend the bill to the house call the shadow secretary of state beg to move an amendment to leave out from that to the end of the question and add this house decline to give second reading to the english devolution and community empowerment bill because the bill do nothing to empower local community but instead contain measure reduce the democratically elect representation of community and enable the government to impose local government restructuring on community irrespective of local opinion disregard local geography and identity because bureaucratic restructuring of local government will cost money and reduce focus on housing delivery with no evidence that it will deliver well service because the bill will lead to great cost for resident by create new mayoral precept increase borrowing power and raise parking charge on motorist and add more local bureaucrat as mayoral appoint commissioner and because the bill will result in high council tax bill for hardworke family at time when local government be face increase cost pressure due to unfunded rise in employer national insurance contribution the english devolution and community empowerment bill it be title straight out of the ministry of truth the bill be not about devolution it be clearly blatant power grab by the deputy prime minister right hon lady for whom have huge amount of respect and her department it be not about community empowerment at all it be about strip power from local authority and concentrate it in whitehall and the hand of the people in whitehall big brother would be proud centralisation be devolution whitehall diktat be community empowerment the fact that the bill do the opposite of what it claim be as we set out in our reason amendment why we can not give it free pass this bill sideline community this bill force restructure without consent this bill waste money while family be face high bill because of labour mismanagement this bill disrupt and distract council from build the home that local people need those be our objection that be what we have set out in our reason amendment if the government want to win the confidence of this house rather than just shoehorn their back benchers through the division lobby they need to justify the demand embed in the bill during the debate and when sum up sincerely hope that they answer our question why centralise control why raise taxis why deny resident their voice those be the question that those on the treasury bench need to answer before this bill can make credible progress through the house the case have be set out but before member on the labour benches get too excited let put to bed few spectre that have be raise the conservative party believe in devolution not just in theory but in practice we create many of the exist mayoral role we create police and crime commissioner we empower parish council and neighbourhood planning and we give family the power to block excessive council tax rise we devolve by consent by agreement with local leader and not by whitehall diktat the simple truth of the matter be that labour do not and have never believe in devolution and it do not deliver meaningful devolution it be centralise party and it centralise this government be abolish council without consent and force they to sign up to their model of restructuring they force the postponement of election in nine county council that be unprecedented election be the foundation of democracy and deny they undermine public trust and confidence in truth deny resident their democratic voice be do for very specific reason it be do because labour fear what people would say to it at the ballot box the right hon gentleman have just list load of thing that the tories do with devolution he can not deny that the reason we need devolution and local government reorganisation be because his government significantly underfunde local government which be now on its knee we therefore have to take action to get local government back in good place and devolution and local government reform be one of those action think the hon member say the quiet bit out loud this be about put up taxis on local people that be what this legislation be fundamentally about we know that to be true promise the house that do not tee up that intervention it be the next bit in my speech labour by impose this restructuring from the centre be leave local people without voice this legislation be about create what this government want which be cohort of subservient labour mayor let we look at what labour mayor actually deliver as say this speech be write before the previous intervention labour mayor put up taxis labour mayor increase the tax burden on local people the liverpool city region up by greater manchester up by west yorkshire up by and london since sadiq khan take office in up by over labour member be quiet now be they the truth hurt can the right hon gentleman tell then why labour keep get re elect to mayoralty will mention paul bristow later in my speech the difference be that under conservative mayor we keep cost down ben houchen for example be deliver zero precept if more place get mayor under this labour proposal how much more will local people pay will ministers whether that be the secretary of state or whoever respond to the debate guarantee that cost will not go up under this model and that council tax will not rise under this model or be this another set of taxis on hard work family by stealth the truth be that the record of labour mayor be that they increase taxis by well above the rate of inflation also will the pressure on parish council precept also hit hard work local people in the pocket the conservatives be in no doubt that once again it will be hard work family and local people who will pay the price for labour ineptitude it be not only family that will be hit this bill force council to merge and prudent council those that have be careful with their money will be force to inherit the debt of other how on earth be penalise good financial management at local government level fair what protection will be in place to protect people from high bill look through the bill there be none that can see how do my right hon friend think my constituent on the isle of wight feel about be fuse under combine mayoral authority with hampshire without have single say my hon friend point go to the heart of these proposal for all labour warm word about community engagement community voice and community actually have say that be classic example have visit the isle of wight not only in personal capacity but as guest of my hon friend so know full well that even though the county of hampshire have many many excellent thing the people of the isle of wight want to maintain their autonomy and they should have the right to do so if that be what they want it be not just that local council will lose control of their finance they will also lose control of their power which be be strip from they in this bill mayor be gain sweeping planning and transport power without council consent or representation let give an example what if community oppose punitive anti driver proposal from mayor in their local neighbourhood how can they make their voice hear who will win will it be the mayor who have be impose upon they or will it be the local community what will the accountability model be for those mayor we can see nothing in the bill about people hold their mayor accountable there be no provision for meaningful scrutiny during the tenure of the mayoralty the secretary of state make reference to the upwards only rent review completely get that that be superficially attractive set of proposal but what assessment have be make of the effective valuation of commercial property include property that be own by the local authority themselves if she be confident that this be such good idea why be there no scrutiny why be there no consultation on these proposal do ministers really think that that be good practice when it come to create stable investment environment and confidence for people spend money in the high street commercial property that keep our community alive the silence on those question about the bill be frankly deafen because the government have no answer this bill be not about empower local community and it be definitely not about empower local council it be about create cohort of puppet mayor control by the right hon lady department respect she enormously but her ability to strip power not just from local council but from the prime minister be something well worth watch think we should at least be impress by that put this to labour member if this be about community empowerment why do it reduce local representation if it be about fiscal responsibility why will it burden ratepayer council tax payer with debt that their local authority do not create if it be about more home why do it hamper and suffocate council with increase bureaucracy devolution can work and indeed do work when it be do properly we know that it work because conservative mayor have deliver ben houchen save teesside airport deliver the uk large freeport with quality job and secure treasury north in darlington with high skilled role all with zero mayoral precept paul bristow in cambridgeshire and peterborough be end labour ideological attack on driver boris johnson while mayor of london deliver the game and secure crossrail in the west midland andy street be genuine champion for his region and household name who have he be replace by person who be not even household name in his own household that say it all we conservative deliver we deliver devolved government that deliver infrastructure job and economic growth what have labour deliver high cost and broken more tax less delivery that be the labour way thank the right hon gentleman for give way sorry for treading on his punchline be very pleased to hear his new find enthusiasm for teesside that be something we all share but it seem to stand at odd with the comment he make to my predecessor about the town of stockton do he stand by those terrible comment that he make or would he like to take this opportunity to apologise to my constituent the hon gentleman really do need to keep up address those comment at the time have be to stockton have campaign with my good friend and colleague the conservative mayor of the town have knock on door in stockton and have huge amount of respect for the town the point be make be about the then labour representative who be not terribly impressed with and the hon gentleman know that that be the case we be always deeply sceptical about whether the content of the bill would match its aspirational title so we set five test frame in the form of five simple question first be this genuine choice for council secondly do all the affected tier agree with the change thirdly be there genuine public support for the change fourthly will the change keep bill down fifthly will the change protect social care have look through the bill it be clear that the answer to every single one of those question be no five question five failure as have say conservative be in favour of devolution when do properly but only if that devolution be meaningful and only if local community and their immediate representative have the power to deliver we be its champion because we deliver it we have prove that it work but it must be by consent it can not be by compulsion it should be by partnership not imposition and by empower council and councillor not by erase they this bill be not devolution it be central control this bill be high taxis and weak local democracy this bill be power grab by the secretary of state it fail to deliver on its promise and that be why the house must decline to give it second reading and demand that the government rethink these proposal rise with the exception of the liberal democrat spokesperson there will be an immediate five minute time limit rise to support the second reading of the english devolution and community empowerment bill which be vital step towards modernise local government and deliver fair investment and great accountability across england do so with year experience as local councillor for five of which be leader of south ribble borough council in lancashire which form part of my constituency although the scope of the bill cover many distinct subject matter intend to focus my brief comment listen to what you say madam deputy speaker on part chapter on local government reorganisation let we be clear lancashire be now an outlier while of england population live under unitary authority deliver all local service through single accountable body lancashire remain part of the shrink operate under two tier system frankly no one would design the two tier system today it be inefficient confusing and expensive resident do not understand why one council be responsible for pothole and road and another for pavement and park why education sit at county level while planning sit with district or why one council collect their waste and another dispose of it they do not understand why they be pay for two different set of local councillor for the same geographical area and for chief executive and senior management team when they only actually require three or four or why our neighbour in greater manchester and the liverpool city region be all unitarie but lancashire be leave with two tier of bureaucracy the result duplicate service inefficient staffing and confused accountability we know that change work in south ribble through share service with our district council neighbour chorley we have save over million for local taxpayer real money back into local budget imagine what could be achieve with fully unitary structure across lancashire in my time as leader of south ribble borough council freeze council tax for three consecutive year while still deliver effective and efficient frontline service yet our resident council tax bill keep rise as lancashire county council increase their taxis annually due to its inefficiency my community be confuse by these council tax bill not understand that the local district council only account for around of their overall bill and in fact that they be pay more to the police and crime commissioner than to their district council beyond efficiency this be about fully unlock devolution lancashire have be leave behind we will end up be one of the large county in the north of england without metro mayor we have miss out already on hundred of million of pound of investment see in greater manchester the west midland west yorkshire and the liverpool city region that be why welcome the power in the bill that allow the secretary of state to mandate reorganisation where appropriate from two tier system to unitary model it be necessary tool to drive reform and commend the secretary of state and the local government minister for their bold vision call the liberal democrat spokesperson may start by welcome the shadow secretary of state the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly to his place on the front bench refer the house to my entry in the register of members financial interests as be councillor at bournemouth christchurch and poole council and vice president of the local government association transfer power close to community through devolution be critical to get service delivery right and develop trust the public consistently say that they have more faith in local government than in national government and the bill be mean to deliver on that promise as the secretary of state note the prime minister say in his first week in office that he want to give power to those with skin in the game and pledge to help citizen to take back control the liberal democrats absolutely agree with that desire however what we see here be bill that centralise decision making limit community influence and because it leave area unsure of their future risk deepen inequality between region the white paper promise mayor for all region and community lead reorganisation but the bill provide power to merge council from westminster and fail to strengthen the council close to people our town and parish it even allow council that have directly reject combined authority to be force into one with their neighbour do my hon friend agree that the conservatives have some nerve talk about top down reorganisation when against people wish as express in poll they impose an unwanted and unpopular unitary council on the whole of somerset do she also agree that the bill should introduce fair vote in this place and in council across the country to restore faith in democracy and politic similar thing happen in dorset in fact the hon member for christchurch sir christopher chope vote against merger in our area but fail even under his own government will come to the issue of proportional representation strategic mayor have the potential to be our regional champion the liberal democrats recognise the benefit that they have bring to many city include london and manchester however the bill fail to standardise their role or to put all region on an equal footing some area have be select for early adoption and funding while other kent medway and my own area of wessex be leave behind with no timeline or support it be unclear for some area include shropshire where they will end up be make to form combine authority shropshire share border with wales and cheshire which be in different region so there be no clear partner for it be concerned that shropshire will end up be force into combine authority with an area that do not look like shropshire or give any benefit to its resident do my hon friend agree that this need to be well think through share my hon friend concern that some area risk be leave behind by this muddle approach ask the secretary of state for assurance on how she will ensure that such area do not fall far behind neighbour that be far along in the programme we liberal democrats be pleased that the government be reverse the conservatives disastrous decision to use first past the post for mayoral and police commissioner election it be ridiculous that one of the mayor elect this may win on just of the vote but the government must go far in make vote fair we believe that the government should bring in the alternative vote system so that voter voice be properly hear we maintain that if the government believe in majority support for elect official they should extend that mandate to mps and councillor too the sussex mayoral election that be due to take place in may next year will use the current first past the post system rather than the propose system that the government say they favour do my hon friend agree that it be totally unfair on sussex resident that everybody who be year behind in the programme will get to vote use well system will come to that later in my speech when will share the concern of electoral official about whether the legislation can deliver in time for any of the change schedule for next year although recognise that there be an anomaly for next year even electoral official be worried about the bill timeline and the ability to make any change for and for those who have already have election delay across the sector there be serious concern about the power of the commissioner that will be appoint by mayor people with significant influence but little scrutiny there be concern that they will hold more sway than elect leader of local authority but without any democratic accountability in the very centre the secretary of state will retain sweeping power to merge authority and extend function without parliamentary oversight or local consent be seek an explanation of how and when those power would be use so that we can assure our local leader that they will not be overridden there be widespread concern about the loss of highly skilled experienced councillor through the removal of district council note the secretary of state concern about put power into the hand of too few people how will she ensure that there be not democratic and skill deficit and that people be properly represent across these large region for the last decade the conservative government have cut funding to council but force they to do more their economic mismanagement and failure to fix social care have leave many council on the brink of collapse this bill be an opportunity for real local government reform but it be an opportunity miss particular concern of my constituent in tiverton and minehead where we have one local authority in devon and one in somerset be the real difficulty around special educational need and disability do my hon friend agree that the bill could create difficulty for local authority that be struggle to deliver good send education for so many of our child thank my hon friend for her intervention special educational need be huge passion of mine be sure member have hear talk about they many time and this issue will take so many council to very dark place trust that the minister hear that on regular basis and that we will see in the fair funding review something really serious about special educational need provision local authority have unique access to every household and business which give they huge opportunity to improve people health and wellbeing the bill require strategic authority to improve the health of their community but be concerned that it do not provide substantial funding to do that and without that funding can not see how it can be achieve while the bill make substantial improvement to the working of audit it miss the opportunity to shine light on all the place that taxpayer money be spend through the introduction of local public account committee be reassure to hear the secretary of state refer to that be in her thinking but roll they out alongside strategic authority would really aid transparency improve value for money and enable organisation to share resource for the good of the community urge the government to reflect on that as we go towards the report stage the bill also propose that strategic authority take on the function of police and crime commissioner and fire authority however because of the disparity in boundary there be real risk that community priority will not be maintain and the control of such thing by appoint rather than elect commissioner far reduce democratic accountability how will the government ensure fair funding and effective policing and fire service where strategic authority cover vastly different community council have express similar concern about mismatch between place within those authority for example the different need of urban and rural area or the inclusion of single authority among cluster of place with very different level of deprivation or demographic some community feel that where decision be make by simple majority vote their voice will not be hear weighted voting and the meaningful inclusion of town and parish council can ensure that local insight be retain particularly around issue such as planning and transport representation must not end there this bill be an opportunity to ensure that local service draw on and be inform by the full range of live experience in an area do my hon friend share my concern that the bill could make it more difficult for resident to access service because where authority that currently deliver service on county wide basis be split into multiple authority it will create border within county my hon friend make very good point there be the opportunity to use more effectively our town and parish council system to drive community empowerment instead the creation of neighbourhood committee feel like top down solution without statutory power or budget they risk become symbolic rather than effective while it be welcome that exist town and parish council can participate the bill do not provide framework for community want to establish new council or the funding to do so district council have long underpin the civic identity of town and drive the activity that reflect their origin with their loss in ancient town and city such as colchester and winchester and without the funding to support small community lead council there be real risk that our distinct history culture and civic pride in our community could be erode we can not allow that to happen the liberal democrats welcome the replacement of the community right to bid with right to buy with first refusal have see some fantastic example of the right to bid working such as the anchor inn in shapwick in my constituency but these success be few and far between community such as teddington in my constituency will very much welcome the new community right to buy at udney park play field have lie derelict for more than decade however although the bill make provision for what happen when there be disagreement over price it be silent on what happen when community bid be refuse by buyer even at market valuation do my hon friend agree that the government must look to go far on that point agree that there be opportunity to do much more as the bill move into committee community long struggle to save such asset be not because of lack of passion or volunteer but because the system feel stack against they the museum of broken dreams display on the parliamentary estate show some good example of where community group have lose out to commercial developer who have demolish building and walk away or where the group can not get support we be pleased to see sporting asset include in the right to buy and we welcome their indefinite inclusion on the register but we want environmental asset to be include as well so that we can protect our land for restoration and nature management we also want restoration of the funding for neighbourhood plan so that small authority which will now struggle to make such plan for their tiny community can do so without onerous cost to their resident to pick up on my hon friend point about environmental concern at the moment local authority have weak duty on biodiversity to consider from time to time what they might do to conserve or enhance biodiversity so do she agree that the bill offer real opportunity to strengthen such environmental protection to get this country back on track believe that the community right to buy have huge opportunity for council in committee hope that we will be able to improve and enhance the bill for everyone as former retail business owner welcome the removal of upward only rent review business should not be lock into rise cost when market condition shift this be long overdue reform that will help small business to adapt and survive the bill make interesting and welcome change on thing such as pension scheme and transport devolution but miss the opportunity to improve council standard and attendance and it fail to establish in statute the promise council of region and nation or the local authority leader council both of which would be important in give local government strong voice in whitehall in conclusion the liberal democrats support the principle of devolution we recognise the crisis in local government funding and we welcome the fair funding review promise later this autumn the bill however do not deliver the ambitious shift in power that our community need it risk disenfranchise place leave at the back of the queue with no funding or timeline to work toward we can not support bill that centralise control weaken local accountability and miss the chance truly to empower community as we lay out in our reason amendment we urge the government to think again and to revise and recommit to genuine devolution and community empowerment so that we can support the bill draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests which include the fact that remain fellow of the royal institution of chartered surveyors my contribution be to assist the secretary of state and the government in ensure that this important bill will truly deliver on my right hon friend ambition for transformative change in our community vision that we share other in the house will want to articulate the advantage of devolve power and increase strategic focus for the english region but have expertise in commercial lease so the house will forgive for focus on that one point the bill represent crucial step in the vital work of promote economic growth and opportunity for our community our constituent will all have witness at first hand how the previous government failure to promote growth and support economic activity have contribute to the decline in the wellbeing of our community have spend year in the commercial property industry and as result numerous organisation and business have contact directly about the proposal to ban upwards only rent review the royal institution of chartered surveyors be already work to make lease term include about rent review more transparent since the code for lease business premise england and wales edition which include advice on rent review have be in place for charter surveyor to adhere to when advise both landlord and tenant the proposal to implement by legislation universal ban on clause within commercial lease for the provision of upwards only rent review create uncertainty for the funding of property development my concern be that this legislation would apply to all commercial property not just high street retail or small business property as currently draft the government proposal would impact high street retail as well as all other commercial sector the ambition to protect high street retail and small business particularly in tough economic condition be certainly not to be underestimate and nor be it unwelcome there be surplus of vacant unsuitable poorly configure and energy hungry retail unit cry out for regeneration in most town across the united kingdom include in the town of paisley renfrew and erskine in my constituency but do not believe that it be just upwards only rent review that be prevent the regeneration of our town and city with my professional background can help to improve this technical aspect of the bill in order to prevent unintended consequence for the government growth agenda understand the desire to support small business on our high street and understand the pressure face by those business because of difficult trading condition property development can be the foundation stone of economic growth in our regional economy my experience be that new sustainable development in the right place can be transformative source of job and training in construction and source of employment and opportunity in operation new transformative sustainable development add vitality to an area act as spur to further development and wide investment know that all member will intuitively feel that upwards only rent review be unfair but that be simplistic view among the early pioneer of upwards only review be the church of england church commissioners who implement they to ensure certainty of income for the church and remain among the large landowner in the country my concern be that the well intend focus on the genuine problem of small business and the high street could have unintended consequence for the broad property development sector in closing encourage my right hon friend the secretary of state to consider an amendment to the clause to ensure that it be focus where it be need most without impact on all property sector stand ready to help with that endeavour this bill be suppose to be the government flagship piece of legislation to empower england city region and community but there be disappointingly little in it about strengthen accountability in exist devolved body especially the greater london authority it be right that power be return to city region and community but those who hold devolve power must also be hold accountable for their decision action and delivery nowhere in england enjoy more devolved power than london that be in part why it be the only area with directly elect assembly devote to scrutiny however as the mayor of london responsibility power and budget have grow the assembly have become weak and weak in comparison notable issue be the two third majority require to amend the mayor budget and strategy but that be impossible to achieve in the london assembly which be why no budget or strategy have be amend in year unlike other combined authority the assembly can not call in mayoral decision and london borough be exclude from decision making that mean the mayor do not have to seek consensus negotiate or even listen to oppose view in city the size of london it effectively alienate and disenfranchise million of people that political fracture be make clear when mayor khan impose the ultra low emission zone expansion on outer london despite overwhelming opposition there be glare democratic and accountability deficit in london which be why so many of my constituent and know the constituent of other member be now question the place of the london borough of bromley in the greater london authority they have never pay more to city hall yet people feel that they be ignore on every issue mayor khan have increase council tax by in nine year mean that londoners pay nearly year on average to fund his policy let we not forget the huge sum that londoner now pay city hall thank to his road charge in the first three month of this year motorist fork out nearly million thank to his ulez charge the blackwall tunnel toll and his hiked congestion charge what do they receive in return for all that money ulez camera too few police officer and green belt protection be rip up anyone who want to see devolution in london succeed must support measure to make the mayor of london more accountable first this bill introduce simple majority voting in combined authority as the default decision make process but it stop short of do that in the london assembly that be mistake it should abolish the two third majority requirement to amend budget and strategy allow simple majority of assembly member to force change that alone would transform london politic and force mayor to the table secondly this government should consult on new model to give the borough voice and vote in london so that bromley can no long be ignore finally this bill should give the london assembly the power to call in mayoral decision my constituent in bromley and biggin hill have have enough of be ignore by the mayor of london sadiq khan if the government want to maintain the support of londoners for devolution the london mayor must be make accountable devolution and local government reorganisation must not simply be stick plaster over the problem of today instead we must determine what we want the come decade to look like for our local community we must ensure that people in place such as ipswich and suffolk have the resource power and trust to determine our own future we can end the fragmentation of service and decision making that have at time hamper progress and instead usher in new era of energy ambition and delivery it have be really encouraging to see all suffolk district and borough council lead by different political party work collaboratively and with compromise to form forward face submission however there be stark and disappointing contrast with suffolk county council it have be really concern to see that more time be be spend on aim to discredit alternative idea and proposal rather than promote why the plan be right for our county tactic have at time be bizarre but there be serious point here resident be entitle to proper information not spin heavy pr campaign fully accept that turkey do not vote for christmas but expect local authority to hold themselves to high standard while run such misleading campaign betray lack of confidence in their own proposal it do they disservice and more crucially treat local resident with lack of respect and no little disdain resident will question why the conservatives at suffolk county council be spend so much money and resource on such an overwhelmingly negative campaign at time when our pothole go unfilled and our child with special educational need be so badly fail all the while raise council tax by its maximum level every single year suffolk county council look not like an authority that be ready to grasp the future but like one that look to keep power and status for itself alongside the investment in our community by my right hon friend the chancellor this bill and the wide effort of my right hon friend the deputy prime minister offer ipswich suffolk and east anglia once in generation chance to turbocharge investment growth and opportunity give we the chance to determine our own future while be supportive of the bill for the transformative effect it will have on our country on local level greater ipswich council could do far more than just regenerate our town and the surround area it could become nationally lead economic powerhouse and our friend and neighbour in east and west suffolk would also greatly benefit from be able to set the direction of their local community this be not just my personal view it be view share by every district and borough council in suffolk as well as by political party of all stripe across ipswich from my discussion with local resident include at my recent town hall event it seem to be the option that they favour too greater ipswich will renew our area economic foundation and deliver the infrastructure we need after year of neglect lowestoft and the energy coast will be able to power new job and investment for their area and bury st edmunds will be well able to align itself with the opportunity offer by the growth around cambridge and peterborough people want their council to deliver public service effectively responsibly and accessibly which be why believe our devolution settlement need to produce unitary authority of sufficient scale to achieve that however people rightly also want their councillor and council to be root in their local community so that they can listen understand and act in their good interest believe that three unitary authority in suffolk work alongside mayor for east anglia would achieve that balance this be not about loosen the fabric that hold our county together it be about strengthen it move to suffolk when be year old quarter of century ago it be my home and care deeply about what happen next for long time we have be ill serve as town and county by short termism and do nothing approach every day have enter this job have think about all the way in which we can leverage the change we need to set we on new path the bill we be debate today will be the drive force behind how we do that as my right hon friend the deputy prime minister have set out time and again the goal of devolution must not be to tinker around the edge of our current system stick with system that be not work for anyone instead we should look to the future and take this opportunity to transform local government our public service and our community for the well proudly support this bill and in do so will continue to work for an ambitious devolution settlement that meet the need of people in ipswich suffolk and east anglia draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests as someone who be still sit councillor in fact when come into this place sit on three different council so speak from good history of local council knowledge this bill focus on mayor yet we hear about put power in the hand of local people have mayor of greater manchester which have single identity be quite different from have mayor in devon which be vast area contain different sort of place let alone perhaps mayor of devon and cornwall that be not power in local hand and the idea that reorganise council will save money be fallacy we will see few senior executive go but the number of people on the bin do the work in the street that need to be do across devon will not be reduce reorganise council will not save money in fact it will cost huge amount of money which be not be fund the government have claim that the measure in this bill include merge council will save significant amount of money however the county councils network have reveal that reorganisation could make no saving and cost money do my hon friend agree that the measure in this bill be base on out of date report that risk far bankrupt local authority agree entirely with my hon friend however in my remain minute will focus on two or three other area that be not cover by my hon friend the member for mid dorset and north poole vikki slade in all the power and broad strategic aim of this bill the key role play by town and parish council be forget in fact the bill barely mention they it also omit the role play by our national park authority parish and town council be the first port of call for resident they be close to the ground and most responsive to the day to day need of their community these be the truly local hand as district council disappear their local asset of less significant value to the new unitary authority will likely suffer or be overlook or sell off without consider local input from the town or parish council despite any change to the community right to buy whose success as we have hear be few and far between this bill must contain statutory obligation to work with the most local and community root body which be our parish and town council duty to co operate must be put into the bill neighbourhood committee or area as vaguely set out as they be in the bill may play part in keep planning and other function local within the wide unitary geography but they must also consider and work with the town and parish council that they cover this must be statutory requirement the bill allow mayor to convene partner and request collaboration but those be discretionary power they may be use or they may be ignore there be no enforceable duty and no statutory requirement to co operate and that be profound weakness national park authority be mention not once in the bill yet they carry the legal responsibility for some of our most precious landscape national park authority such as dartmoor have majority of member from mix of local authority five in dartmoor case and minority of government appoint member without change if dartmoor end up completely within the boundary of new unitary it would effectively be manage as part of that unitary and lose its unique identity its planning authority will be overridden and its strategic vision may be subsume we must protect dartmoor and the other park for people to freely access and enjoy and not let greed rip thing apart for mere profit the bill must address how these authority will maintain independence and protect the identity of the area they serve another miss opportunity be the need to make the provision of public toilet statutory responsibility too often council in financial difficulty cut these vital facility and in devon we know that there will be no money leave over once the special educational need and disability overspend have be pay for by the carefully manage district and their reserve it will still be case of there be no money leave finally welcome the return of the alternative vote for mayor but urge the government to go far and introduce full proportional representation for all the new unitary council make every vote count congratulate the deputy prime minister on bring forward this bill which embed our ambition and champion the promise of devolution it will mark the big transfer of power from whitehall to our region in generation it mean that the protection of our public space will result in the improvement of our infrastructure and the strengthening of our local economy devolution should promote local accountability and bring decision maker close to the people who feel the impact and wholeheartedly welcome the part of the bill that will ensure that the creation of community right to buy offer more oversight on local policing and place duty on authority to improve health and reduce health inequality be also welcome step in the right direction the spirit of the bill be one we should all support bring clause to the government attention it effectively abolish the committee structure and introduce measure that will impact on sheffield one of council run under the committee governance system more than people in democratic referendum in sheffield vote decisively in favour of modern committee structure over the leader and cabinet model that clause impose through the referendum sheffield citizen choose collaboration through their committee instead of decision make power be concentrate in few hand six year on from that referendum the committee system work for sheffield it have deliver meaningful scrutiny where it be lack before and it have prove its worth in those moment where public trust have be under threat however we be not here to discuss the merit and disadvantage of these two model of local governance what matter be that resident have make democratic decision at local level and it be important for that mandate to be respect and uphold if the bill pass in its current form sheffield be one of several council that will be force to undo those year of democratic engagement have receive countless email from constituent and campaigner such as it our city who have stress just how important this democratic engagement have be for sheffield and they be right one size do not fit all and the lga echo that view the hon member be make an extremely informed and important point in her speech do she agree that for sheffield and her council the committee system have be well more inclusive and more democratic for her resident than the original cabinet system do she endorse the view that any council that want to go down committee route or any community that have already decide to do so should retain that right the point that be go to make be about exist committee structure retain their model rather than about new committee the local government association have also call for council to be able to retain their structure until local community choose otherwise and for my constituent similarly this be matter of principle until the people of sheffield choose another structure in another referendum as promise their decision should be allow to stand with the same flexibility that be be offer to those who choose to directly elect council mayor there be still time to reflect that flexibility in the bill so ask the deputy prime minister to meet my hon friend the member for sheffield hallam olivia blake and as well as our local council leader to discuss the impact that these proposal will have on our community and their trust in local governance and more importantly to ensure that devolution work for sheffield draw member attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests which state that be sit member of east cambridgeshire district council we can surely all agree that power should be devolve as close to community as possible because they know what be good for their area far well than anyone else strong and empower parish city and principal council that be accountable to resident help our democracy and make well decision for the community that they serve sadly the bill do not deliver that although the government intention of devolution by default be commendable the bill represent centralisation by choice instead of provide for genuine decentralisation of power to community it empower regional mayor at the expense of local council and the secretary of state local councillor have express concern include about the uncertainty that these proposal have cause at time when council be try to set their budget amid the wide crisis in local government funding and fear that big authority particularly in rural community will lead to weak connection with the area they serve the bill have cause considerable uncertainty locally because it come at time when integrate care board be be change which mean that relationship with key health partner be be doubly unsettled councillor in my constituency fear that because the bill have be draft hastily it will not fix some obvious anomaly in our exist boundary such as what some people have call the newmarket bite the town of newmarket be almost completely surround by my constituency many of my resident look to newmarket for some of their service and many in newmarket look to cambridgeshire for some of theirs newmarket and the surround village should have have the opportunity to choose between cambridgeshire base and suffolk base unitary be particularly concerned about the bill provision to enable mayor of strategic authority to appoint seven unelected commissioner to deliver specific area of policy we already have an establish system for that very purpose in most council we have an administration consist of elect councillor from which the leader of the council choose small group to form their cabinet in other council we have committee that be responsible for oversight of policy area like an early speaker be also worried about the government plan to impose leader and cabinet model on these authority east cambridgeshire district council have keep the committee system because that be what our resident tell we they want we can not have minister tell we that we can not run ourselves in the way our local community want appointing commissioner rid roughshod over the current system of democratically elect council by allow mayor to nominate unelected commissioner to lead on policy how can the public hold these commissioner to account if not at the ballot box who will scrutinise their judgment call how can we improve the transparency of their decision making at political level the bill be miss opportunity to meaningfully decentralise power to our community and make fundamental shift in where power lie in this country where the government be claim to make devolution the default they have introduce centralisation these proposal weaken exist system of accountability and even in part of the bill where progress be make such as on electoral reform it tinker at the edge we urgently need system where every vote count so we need proportional representation true devolution come as result of grassroots consultation root in community top down attempt at devolution such as this bill sadly end in be well wide of the mark people in my constituency do not want to be force into unitary authority that be on the one hand too big to understand local need and on the other hand too small to cover the area where they work spend leisure time and receive healthcare they do not want decision to be take by appoint commissioner rather than elect councillor they would value real devolution and proper say in the change they want urge the government to reconsider this bill so that it deliver the devolution in england that people want enormously welcome this bill it be thoroughly rare thing for government to seek to actively give up power but this government understand that we be go to deliver an economy that work for everyone with new way of govern that shift power away from westminster once and for all at its heart this bill be about put power back in the hand of community recognise that decision should be make by those who know their community well and who be fully accountable for the consequence of those decision for somewhere like lancashire this bill be great opportunity to address the fundamental issue that have hold we back for so long my hon friend the member for south ribble mr foster explain the dysfunctional nature of lancashire eloquently but will recap we have district council two unitarie county council and police and crime commissioner this confusing two tier structure hollow out by austerity with little accountability and remote fragmented decision making sit in stark contrast with the clarity of leadership and devolve resource of our neighbouring city region we have have to watch manchester liverpool and west yorkshire forge ahead while we have be stick in the slow lane this live reality be the status quo that the conservatives include the shadow secretary of state who be no long in his place have seek to defend and maintain but this bill give we chance to change all that it be chance to take back control and empower our community and chance to rebuild local government to make it more effective and to save money that can be reinveste in local service it be chance to bring in resource that can turbocharge growth and deliver on our potential urge lancashire leader to work together with sense of urgency in order to grasp this once in lifetime opportunity but there be an additional challenge even with clear determination from local leader it will be at least two year until lancashire have mayor and restructure combined authority it be likely to take much long before we have the sort of capacity and capability that be already in place in the like of liverpool and manchester in that time those city region will move far ahead the risk be that lancashire will fall far behind yet as the new lancashire growth plan show there be bright future for the county if we have the tool to create it the plan identify transformational project that will be game changer for we range from transport infrastructure to world class innovation zone overall the propose project pipeline have the potential to attract over billion of additional investment to our county but as thing stand these be just bold idea and possibility take they to the stage where they be fully work up investable proposal require the sort of capacity and capability that lancashire no long have that be in contrast with our neighbouring city region which have be able to use devolve resource to have full business case and shovel ready project ready and wait for the green light we can see the result with the vast majority of infrastructure pipeline project locate within strategic mayoral authority the stark contrast between the investment in established mayoral authority and in area like lancashire which be just start the devolution process risk embed inequality in our region place like lancashire can not wait until the devolved authority be in place to stop inequality take root we need support now to ensure that we can progress our transformational project and deliver on our growth potential the recent green book review rather fortunately recognise this issue and helpfully identify some way of address it include expand the treasury well business case programme progress the national wealth fund strategic partnership programme and crucially secondment from central government to the region that be exactly what we need in lancashire so that we can start to deliver on our growth plan with our project take their place in the infrastructure pipeline although strongly welcome the bill and call again on council to come together to seize the opportunity it offer ask the government to work with lancashire mps and local leader to ensure that lancashire receive the up front support we need to start to catch up with our neighbour and to play our full and rightful role in deliver growth and prosperity for all our community democracy matter accountability matter be afraid that this bill strip away both at the heart of this government attempt reform lie democratic deficit where planning committee lose their power councillor may scrutinise but can not decide and local council be diminish while in their place mayor be hand sweeping power over planning housing infrastructure and even development order this be not devolution downwards to community it be centralisation let we be absolutely clear in the west midland the labour mayor have show time and again that his focus be on birmingham not community such as mine in aldridge brownhills this bill will entrench that imbalance it give licence to concrete over the green belt and drive coach and horse through local democracy leave the elect member of parliament with no formal way of hold the mayor to account or even to question his decision the government say that this bill empower local community but they have cut the very funding that make neighbourhood planning possible the neighbourhood planning programme support by the national association of local councils help more than community to write neighbourhood plan yet minister have scrap it at time when they seek to railroad development across community the nalc be right that this move by the government weaken the very tier of democracy that should be strengthen it be not empowerment it be contradiction my constituent know exactly what that mean aldridge brownhills be all too often treat as the dumping ground for housing number decide elsewhere do my right hon friend agree that the government devolution proposal be an urban base model that can not be apply to rural area without fundamentally distort the character of that area my hon friend hit the nail on the head his community not dissimilar to mine be on the edge of large urban area the west midland birmingham and yet we be not deeply rural we be at real risk of be subsume into the suburb of walsall or birmingham with no say in the matter my constituent know what this all mean with community feel do to not work with we have see what happen when contradictory housing target be impose from above take the black country plan which be mean to be model of strategic planning but it collapse it fall apart because resident across the black country lose confidence and rightly so it be plain wrong the bill repeat the same mistake introduce power to push development through rid roughshod over local objection and concrete over our community green space look at the imbalance birmingham housing target be fall while walsall be rise by my constituency be tell to take the strain as our second city offload its number it be not devolution but displacement and it will only deepen distrust take stonnall road longwood road longwood lane and bosty lane the list of speculative planning application across my constituency go on and on and all this before the planning and infrastructure bill and even this piece of legislation have be enact if this government be serious about empowerment they would have put brownfield first duty into their reform but they choose not to the west midland have hundred of hectare of derelict land that could be bring back into use and there be fund for this already the brownfield housing fund the national competitive fund and the brownfield infrastructure and land fund however there be no requirement for the mayor to use those fund first before launch into our precious green belt and green wedge without statutory brownfield first duty we know that developer will always go for the easy option first take the birch lane proposal in aldridge hundred of home on green belt land now rebrande as grey belt it be precisely the kind of inappropriate development this bill will make it hard to resist with local consultee weaken and mayoral power strengthen this government be not build community they be divide they what about infrastructure my constituent be promise aldridge train station as many member know talk lot about that funding be secure and the business case make yet the labour mayor divert the money elsewhere if he can not deliver on those commitment why should this house be hand he more there be serious question to answer about what exactly be grey belt regulation suggest that it can be use to redefine green belt site with building on three side that should alarm all of we in this place we in aldridge brownhills be now at serious risk of be subsume within greater birmingham and greater walsall do not get wrong we do need house but let we give it some thought let we put they in the right place and let we not lose our identity or our community because of government diktat because that be exactly what it be this government be make complete mockery of what we call green belt and green wedge which be there to protect community from urban sprawl and all this at time when birmingham city council can not even empty its bin the mayor have wash his hand of it and the deputy prime minister do not seem interested this bill be not devolution or empowerment quite simply it be developer dream and neighbourhood nightmare and shall be vote against it tonight have serve as town councillor and deputy mayor before my election to this house have witness at first hand the critically overdue need for reform of our local and very local council system town parish and very local council have be plague by inefficiency and toothless standard for too long which be why particularly support the reform of our local audit system outline in the bill my experience and those regale to by other over the year have underscore the urgent need for an overhaul to ensure transparency efficiency and accountability within our local governance structure the government commitment to reform the local audit system be both timely and essential the bill prioritise the establishment of more coherent and reliable audit framework which will undoubtedly build trust within our community and foster more robust democratic process by address these systemic challenge we be send clear message that council must be accountable and that the integrity of their operation be paramount furthermore these reform represent significant step towards great devolution empower town and parish council such as those in north somerset to take decisive action tailor to the unique need of their local however we must go far it be crucial to introduce great accountability through compliance scoring system that clearly indicate to the public whether their elect representative be undertake good practice and demonstrate financial competence with their money internal audit parameter should be set nationally to ensure consistency and transparency and we should focus on establish effective minimum standard for councillor ensure that there be proper consequence when acceptable behaviour be breach that would not just improve outcome for local community but restore confidence in our local democracy it would also help to alleviate the ongoing issue with recruitment and retention of town and parish clerk nationally who be the impartial and objective legal adviser to the very local council and be task with ensure that those council operate lawfully be sure that many colleague will have be make aware of the totally unacceptable behaviour that some town and parish clerk be subject to which be enable by lack of effective recourse against the perpetrator the ongoing loss of highly train and experienced expert be great loss to the sector this recruitment crisis also hit the number willing to stand for very local council as potential councillor face the same unacceptable behaviour we need professional regulation for councillor as an important first step monitoring officer must be properly fund through professional regulation fee pay by council base on the number of councillor this would enable monitor officer to perform their vital oversight function effectively we can not continue the current slide towards empty council chamber across our town and village decline community involvement and in some area poor standard of behaviour and conduct the localism act that come into force during the coalition government dismantle essential structure of accountability by abolish the standards board for england since then power to suspend councillor who breach standard have be repeal leave council with no substantive recourse against poor conduct there be now no recourse against poor standard of behaviour this legislative deficiency have allow pocket of inadequate behaviour to persist unchallenged undermine the very essence of local government we must take this opportunity to effect new system and process and to foster new model of accountable politic at the local and very local level have see myself how unacceptable behaviour in local council can go entirely unchecked erode trust the bill represent chance to establish high standard and ensure that we have appropriate people serve our community cut out the rot in some of our council if town and parish council be to play large role in the devolution of local service which undoubtedly bring the benefit of great ownership and influence to local community it be essential that all council be effectively hold to the same high standard wish to point out that there be very many local council across the country that do fabulous job and there be some great one in my constituency they be govern extremely well and enrich their community but the minority of council risk tarnish the wide reputation of the sector and create disparity in community benefit this bill represent the foundation that we should build on to do well in order to establish proper standard at the local level of democracy and ensure that we have appropriate people serve our community as be sure all member in this place do support the principle of devolution and empowerment two of the word on the face of the bill but this bill be about centralisation and disempowerment for the isle of wight it be about fuse our island with hampshire under combine mayoral authority where of the population live in hampshire on the mainland and just live on the island there be no empowerment because island people will not have say this plan be last crystalise under the previous labour government who give islander say through local referendum islander vote no and the previous labour government respect that vote this government do not respect my constituent enough to ask they whether they be happy to be fuse with much much large county that sit across the water it be centralise because my local authority the isle of wight council will lose some of its power it will lose power over strategic planning so mayor who represent largely hampshire voter will be able to allocate more housing on the island and any mayor who be interested in get re elect will of course be responsive to the much large voter cohort in hampshire there be three particularly offensive thing about the bill that the government be impose on my constituent our police authority be call hampshire and isle of wight our health commission body be call hampshire and isle of wight our fire and rescue service be call hampshire and isle of wight the vast majority of organisation that operate across our two county be name after our two county hampshire and isle of wight this government be go to call our mayoral combine authority hampshire and solent potentially remove our name from all the organisation that the mayor will end up have power over from our police our fire and rescue service our health commission body and who know what in the future that will be do without anyone on the isle of wight have say the second offensive thing about this proposal for my constituency be the power that it give the mayor over local transport the authority will have solent in the title yet the mayor will get no contingent power over the big transport issue face my resident cross the solent on ferry solent be in the name of the combine authority but the mayor will get no power over ferry our ferry be the only unregulated entirely privatised foreign own debt laden key transport provider in the uk the government be prepared to nationalise railway extend the arm of government in bus and put more money into road but they be not prepared to do anything about my constituent be leave at the mercy of foreign own debt laden company will acknowledge that they have use some warm word and the minister have visit the island but this be the opportunity to deliver on those word and put power in the hand of the mayor to regulate cross solent transport to make really important point on ringfenced funding because the isle of wight will be fuse with hampshire the mayor will be able to spend money as they wish across homogeneous single zone there be no special provision in the bill to ensure there be ringfence funding for the isle of wight that can not be raid for hampshire the local integrate care board be already raid money from our hospice to spend on hampshire hospice in the mayoral deal we need power to stop that from happen finally in the consultation of my constituent on the key issue of transport the word ferry be not mention even once meur ras madam deputy speaker on march this year the prime minister stand at the dispatch box and say these word we do recognise cornish national minority status not just the proud language history and culture of cornwall but its bright future official report march vol since arrive in this place on the back of pledge to ensure cornwall be give the devolved power and funding that we have be crave for century and in line with our manifesto commitment to deliver on the great ever devolution power out of westminster today be significant milestone with the prime minister commitment to cornish national minority status clearly reaffirm support bill that deliver tangible devolution to cornwall however would like to explore clarification on the implication of the bill for the people of cornwall madam deputy speaker the land that you call cornwall we know as kernow term believe to have be in use for over year that mean people of the promontory however the english word cornwall have different meaning it mean peninsula of foreigner for century the english have recognise the people of the land at the end of the peninsula as different from they right up to modern time the uk government have continue to honour the distinct territorial integrity of cornwall treat we in unique and exceptional way our constitutional status be perhaps most clearly outline in newspaper article in by the house of lords researcher kevin cahill who state that the whole territorial interest and dominion of the crown in and over the entire county of cornwall be vest in the duke of cornwall so cornwall be separate kingdom he continue know the cornish have be shout about this for long time but they turn out to be right the creation of the duchy of cornwall in recognise the distinct history identity and territory of cornwall unique and exceptional constitutional settlement that we enjoy to the present day in recent time cornwall have be the first rural area outside scotland wales and northern ireland to gain devolution settlement over aspect of transport education and renewable energy more recently it have do so over adult education cornish distinctiveness and the cornish language indeed cornwall already enjoy some of the benefit offer by the bill for mayoral combine authority be often ask even by colleague in this place whether as cornishman consider myself english along with hundred of thousand of cornishmen and woman be often sadly mock for my reply let be absolutely clear today be cornish not english although freely admit that some of my very good friend be english to those at home particularly young people who have be equally ridicule say be loud and proud it be okay to consider yourself cornish and british let deal with the issue of identity versus status cornish national minority status and cornish identity be sometimes conflate but when discuss the former reference to identity can sometimes be consider belittle it be not about identity it be about legally bind national minority status our status formally agree by the council of europe year ago must be respect uphold and celebrate meur ra be grateful to the hon member for give way he will be aware that in previous parliaments lead campaign to secure the recognition of the cornish language and the cornish people do he agree that this be not an issue of isolationism it be not about cut ourselves off but about cut ourselves into the celebration of diversity and have the identity of place properly recognise and respect so that it can grow rather than be supresse surely devolution be about enable place rather than control they which be what fear this bill will do as result of our geographical location for century we have be safe harbour port in the storm for people from all over the world we be an inclusive society let get straight to the nub of the issue the council of europe framework convention for the protection of national minority make it very clear article say the party shall refrain from measure which alter the proportion of the population in area inhabit by person belong to national minority and be aim at restrict the right and freedom flow from the principle enshrine in the present framework convention in when pass comment on the then government plan for redrawe boundary the council of europe advisory committee on the framework convention highlight that article prohibit restrict the enjoyment of the right of the framework convention in connection with the redrawing of border in the bill as draft cornwall be prevent from access the high level of devolution because to do so would require we to compromise our national minority status during the passage of the bill will work with the government to ensure that the bill as pass respect cornish national minority status and deliver an historic devolution arrangement that fulfil our manifesto commitment provide for the economic development support that we need to unleash the cornish celtic tiger give we the funding and resource to deal with our crippling housing crisis and celebrate cornish national minority status this responsibility weigh not just on the mind for we this be not just about functional local government it go way deeply into our soul to century old desire for increase autonomy and self governance in our place on this multinational island urge ministers together let we grasp this once in generation opportunity when the government get something right it be important to acknowledge that the community right to buy provision in the bill represent the genuine empowerment that constituent need therefore acknowledge that in my constituency have village community that be desperate to buy the local pub an asset of community value that have be up for sale for some time they have raise the fund for the ask price and they have community support but the owner simply refuse to sell to they under the current system they have no right of purchase and no right of refusal and although they have raise the money more time to organise the complex legal and financial arrangement require for community ownership would have be appreciate the new community right to buy provision in the bill be therefore welcome just as the bill get community empowerment right in one policy area it miss the opportunity to do so in many other draw contrast with one in particular the skill architecture the bill create new skill responsibility for strategic authority without clarify how they will co ordinate with the national role of skills england another new body or the exist employer lead local skill improvement plan or lsip we have system in which skills england set national priority lsip identify local employer need and strategic authority deliver adult education funding but the bill have no clear mechanism for ensure that those layer align or avoid costly duplication this fragmentation be compound by the separation of adult skill from the broad skill and education ecosystem the bill devolve responsibility for adult education to strategic authority but leave education with central government and provide no clear role at all for university in local economic development this be despite the education secretary herself call for university to make strong contribution to economic growth through close alignment to skill need and economic growth plan how can we develop coherent local skill strategy when we artificially separate the pipeline that feed skilled employment the funding arrangement be also concern strategic authority will hold the adult skill budget but have only joint ownership of the lsips that should guide their spending priority it be difficult to see how democratically accountable body can be responsible for outcome when they lack control over the full planning process furthermore current lsip boundary do not align with the propose strategic authority boundary and the government solution appear to be to hope that it all work out in the end the bill provide no mechanism for resolve conflict and no timeline for achieve the geographical coherence that effective planning require possibly most troubling be the absence of any performance framework link those different institutional layer strategic authority must produce local growth plan but there be no requirement for they to align with lsips or with skills england workforce forecasting we risk have three different body in each area produce conflicting skill priority with no clear co ordination mechanism that be recipe for confusion waste and ultimately failure to address the skill shortage that our economy desperately need to resolve want to draw contrast so here it be on community asset the bill trust local people and provide clear enforceable right however on skill one of the most critical challenge face our economy it create institutional complexity and lack accountability and clear line of responsibility hope the government will go away and think again and come back with more coherent approach that actually deliver the local responsiveness on skill that community and our economy so desperately need the uk be one of the most centrally run country in the world for decade whitehall have make every major decision on growth and investment while the community impact be too often an afterthought this have leave community poorer and trap play game that they can never win for region such as mine physically the furth away in england it have mean that we have feel remove from decision and decision making this bill be chance to change that failure in the north east during her first year our mayor kim mcguinness have launch important local project include tackle child poverty and bring bus back into public control but she be unable to tackle some of the big economic challenge that we face because she do not have the power to change they this bill make it easy for the mayor to decide how local money be spend by put the pen in local hand so that our own priority come first rather than an agree list make year ago with whitehall this will allow the mayor to create growth plan show where investment be need most so that westminster can follow that lead the north east growth plan set our priority so that we can then work with this government to deliver the project identify by create these local growth plan the government can see the share priority in area such as advanced manufacturing clean energy and digital innovation region be able to create list of project ready for investment we know where the blockage be in our area because we live with they every single day of course one such priority that politician business and community have identify for our region be the case of moor farm roundabout in my constituency something have speak about many time in this place it have already be identify as priority because upgrade it would not only address the misery that it cause for local people every day but unlock investment in manufacturing clean energy and housing and support business growth alongside change in the green book to local place base business case we can ensure that we approach these priority with cross departmental mission lead approach for too long departmental silos have prevent cross government approach but now we can ensure that the like of the ministry of housing communities and local government the department for transport the department for business and trade and the treasury work together with regional leader to deliver local priority it be not just new mayoral power that we benefit from be absolutely thrilled to see in the bill step to protect community and community sport for the future the bill take heavily from one that introduce in may create change to safeguard sporting asset of community value it would automatically protect football club leisure centre and other sport facility by give local community the first chance to buy they if they go up for sale just briefly as my hon friend explain about the sporting economic and social interest do she believe that environmental interest should also be take into account that would allow community to claim other different type of fund and also to protect the environment my hon friend make an interesting point we should look at what community prioritise and make consideration as to what they value go back to sporting asset in particular there be over sport ground in england alone protect they under the current system be complex bury in red tape and make far too difficult it have mean that few than sport facility be protect community asset across the country mean that almost of sport facility across the country can not be preserve if developer try to buy up land we want to give people the authority to make decision about their own area this summer be absolutely delighted to visit so many facility in my constituency cramlington rockets burradon juniors and backworth hall cricket club as well as work with the like of hazlerigg victory wideopen football club and many more these club and facility be at the heart of our community provide not just sport but community activity run holiday club and be welcoming community space they be the lifeblood of many of the village and town across the cramlington and killingworth constituency be delighted that this government be protect these vital pillar in the community that be so important to local people for too long whitehall have leave community and region like mine trap and poor because decision be not take with they in mind this government be change that with the big shift of power out of westminster to the north east and my community it will boost growth raise living standard and deliver service for local people it be about give power to those who know our community well be delighted that this labour government be put our region our community and our neighbourhood first rise to make the case for kernow or cornwall and its unique status in this united kingdom my constituent have be crystal clear with cornwall must never be forcibly join with devon or merge into any wide regional authority but that be not to say that cornwall want to go it alone it be not about separatism at all this be about respect our distinct status and history cornwall have proudly partner with other uk region for decade it have proud and unique language culture history and crucially national minority status which be grant over decade ago we be afford the same status as our celtic brother and sister in scotland ireland and wales and so the people of cornwall deserve devolution deal that recognise that this status be not just symbolic it create duty on public authority to promote equality for the cornish people to support our culture language and identity and specifically to avoid any assimilationist policy under the uk equality act and the public sector equality duty ministers and local authority alike must consider the impact of their decision include in this bill on the cornish people if they fail to do so their action can be challenge in the court use an array of legal claim include judicial review an equality act claim and human rights act article differential treatment claim therefore these right carry real legal and political weight to disregard or dilute cornwall status in this bill would be insulting unlawful and dangerous be alarmed that the bill would grant the secretary of state power to force combined authority without local people consent devolution in essence should give power to the community region and county that it aim to empower not to mayor secretary of state or an unelected commissioner at prime minister question last october the prime minister tell that he believe that those with skin in the game know what be good for their community official report october vol the secretary of state have repeat that today agree with they both decision should be make for cornwall and in cornwall by fully elect cornish assembly and not in plymouth bristol or westminster they should be make by those from within the duchy who understand our unique way of life and our unique economic and social challenge the immense challenge of fund rural transport the unfair and unequal investment in our school over decade the plight of our farmer and fisher who seem to be leave out in the cold by government after government and the enormous proliferation of second home and holiday let which lock local people out of our housing market generation after generation in my office proudly display famous painting of the cornish rebellion of it illustrate the cornish spirit of fairness justice and persistence of proud cornish man and woman who have taxis impose upon they by the government in london that spirit live on give cornwall history and that strength of feeling if the secretary of state impose mayor of devon and cornwall completely disregard cornwall national minority status as well as legal battle she might have full uprising on her hand the bill would likely limit cornwall to foundation strategic authority with limited power funding and control that be why we be fight for bespoke devolution deal the bill should have mechanism in place to allow such bespoke deal to take place cornwall mp look forward to work together for the good of cornwall onen hag oll one and all to make that happen call on the government to fully respect cornwall national minority status to create minister for cornwall who could sit in the wales office to consider the feasibility of an elect cornish assembly instead of mayor and to commit to devolution deal that respect cornwall historic identity by exclude it from combined strategic authority with other region kernow bys vyken few matter have occupy as much of my first year in this house as the question of cornish devolution for decade if not century the people of cornwall have speak of their desire to have great say in the decision that shape their life that desire be found in our distinct need and our more than year old national identity that be why the arrival of the english devolution and community empowerment bill have be watch in cornwall with keen anticipation and in some quarter with understandable apprehension have pore over the text of the legislation my conclusion be this far from be the bulldozer that many fear the bill leave cornwall position intact it formalise our single foundation status and once and for all hope single geography crucially it do not strip away the strategic power that cornwall already exercise recognition of our national minority status be now firmly acknowledge in this place and as one of the large unitary authority in england by geographic footprint we retain the ability to deliver many of the function that be only just be hand to combined or mayoral body elsewhere do my hon friend agree that the historic cornish constitutional status must be consider as part of the devolution discussion absolutely agree with my hon friend on top of the many example he have give of cornwall constitutional status and aside from our devolution arrangement with westminster the leader of cornwall council be in give permission to attend ministerial meeting of the british irish council much like the other celtic nation and the channel islands in the same year cornwall council and the welsh government sign historic collaboration agreement reflect the share culture of these two celtic nation perhaps more weightily in this place the crowther and kilbrandon report of the royal commission on the constitution in acknowledge that the creation of the duchy of cornwall in establish special and endure relationship between cornwall and the crown use of the designation on all appropriate occasion would serve to recognise both this special relationship and the territorial integrity of cornwall it go on to say that what the cornish want be recognition of the fact that cornwall have separate identity and that its traditional boundary shall be respect let be clear while the letter of the bill do not necessarily offer the content of devolution that so many in cornwall have long call for have no doubt that it will be very welcome in city and other region across england but cornwall be different remote coastal community an exist administrative unit functional economic geography and very good brand if nothing else as many member will know from their summer holiday above all cornwall be proud part of the united kingdom with distinct national identity resurgent language and desire to be hear after century of dismissal with the right power we stand ready to not only shape our own future but help lead the way in united kingdom that value local voice and unlock prosperity across all nation and region greatly welcome the inclusion of new power such as the community right to buy that be exactly the sort of measure that can put power back into local hand give people in my constituency the chance to ensure that public asset like the dolphin inn in grampound or the site of the former general wolfe in st austell and the fowey community hospital remain in public hand and continue to serve local need the hon member make very strong case for cornwall he should urge his colleague in government to welcome amendment to the bill that strengthen cornwall ability to achieve its unique and very special status which we believe need to be enshrine in this legislation as well as the historic record agree with the hon gentleman that it be incredibly important that cornwall national minority status be respect by the bill and that the power and investment require to meet cornwall distinctive need if not enshrine in the text be consider as part of the devolution process in the month ahead finally we should acknowledge that while the bill streamline england devolution architecture the mayoral model will not suit every part of our country cornwall have show for over year as unitary authority that there be other effective way to deliver devolved function what we need now be plan for cornwall one that equip we with the power we require over housing transport skill and industrial growth to meet the challenge we face the truth be that the statutory framework set out in the bill be not the central issue at stake what really matter be that we secure settlement for cornwall that recognise our unique circumstance protect our ability to make strategic decision for ourselves and give our community the tool to thrive draw the house attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests want to raise few issue all of which know be very much on my constituent mind first want to emphasise the importance of ensure that borough such as reigate and banstead which have be manage well and be not load with debt be not leave foot the bill for the failure of other council that have be less prudent with their finance reigate and banstead borough council have commendably strong record of financial prudence so please will the secretary of state reassure my constituent that protection will be put in place to safeguard our community asset such as the harlequin theatre and our community and leisure centre on the harlequin theatre specifically emphasise how important the asset be to the people of redhill and beyond it have now be close for more than two year follow the discovery of raac and resident and community group notably the harlequin support group have be resolutely campaign for its repair and reopen be delighted that under the leadership of councillor shelly newton who be one of the most tenacious local councillor have ever come across it have now be confirm that the million need for repair have be allocate all be well the theatre be expect to reopen by christmas mention that because my constituent would appreciate hear directly from the secretary of state and ministers that the local government reorganisation will not hamper such project which have be agree but will take some time to complete also make the point that the reorganisation be not the only challenge face by reigate and banstead borough council which have just have its housing target more than double by this government at time of great uncertainty and transition recipe for disaster want to focus mainly however on the future of the civic mayoralty in reigate and banstead reigate have have mayor since great history and tradition be associate with the role and the importance place on it can be see physically in the mayoral robe the chain of office and the mace which be still very much in use the government have be clear that their intention with the bill be to provide consistent model for how local government will be structure across england what be rather less clear hope that the minister or secretary of state will be able to provide clarity be what that mean for borough such as mine where borough council be intermeshe with long stand tradition of civic leadership in the form of borough mayor unlike metro mayor the mayor of the borough of reigate and banstead be no kind of political executive the role be that of civic figurehead non partisan ceremonial and community focus we have truly outstanding mayor councillor rich michalowski and before he councillor eddy humphreys be another dedicated and hard work public servant in the past civic year alone the mayor respond to more than engagement request host town hall tour for school and community group and oversee civic and charity event attend by nearly people not include the thousand more who attend remembrance sunday the position of borough mayor do real practical good their attendance at an event bring that extra sparkle which resident so appreciate through the mayor trust fund family in my constituency have already be support with grant this year single funding workshop lead by the mayor team unlock more than for local charity through sustained community engagement the mayor help connect employer with jobseeker donor with good cause and school with mentor they promote local artist support care home champion the armed force covenant and offer practical help to resident in crisis hope that ministers will agree with my constituent in recognise the great value of borough mayor and that they will provide clarity on whether such role will be preserve under the bill and if so how in practical term that will be achieve it be pleasure to speak on what may prove to be one of the most impactful and transformative piece of legislation of this parliament the bill represent one of the most significant shift in local government in more than half century it set out clear ambition to move power out of westminster and into the hand of local leader who know their community well for area such as cheshire and warrington that have the potential finally to give we the tool we need to unlock our full potential and to deliver real tangible benefit for our community on transport alone the opportunity be to talk no long about the decline in bus service but about how we be provide new route and to hear instead of that we have be campaign for bridge or railway link for year we have plan to deliver on skill instead of the drop in adult education starter that have occur in my area between and we can talk about how we will fix that it be important to recognise however that the approach set out in the bill be not without risk for cheshire and warrington with respect to police service the bill give power to the home secretary to redraw the police boundary to match the mayoral combine authority there be no consensus in cheshire that cheshire police should be reorganise to exclude halton which be currently part of the liverpool city region indeed quite the reverse it be feel that such move would be explicitly bad for halton and would damage the viability of the remainder of cheshire police when the minister sum up hope he will provide reassurance that there will be full consultation before cheshire police be reorganise and that it will not be reorganise against the wish of its community let turn to the bill provision on adult education the new duty place on strategic authority to secure appropriate facility for the education and training of adult age and over be welcome step in the focus group that have run with technology business across cheshire and the wide north west there have be clear divide between mayoral area and non mayoral area where with some exception business do not feel that there be good understanding of their need nor plan to deliver on they the mayoral combine authority present an opportunity not only to fix that but to think strategically about take advantage of project like hynet which will require mile of new hydrogen pipeline and people with the right skill to build it an important gap that the bill do not address be education local authority currently have duty to secure enough suitable education and training provision to meet the reasonable need of all young people in their area who be over compulsory school age but they lack any power to deliver this and neither can they meaningfully affect how further education be organise that be real challenge particularly in my constituency which have be leave with big gap in provision follow the review into education in cheshire and warrington contribute to neet level in winsford be five percentage point high than the borough wide average there be an opportunity for the mayoral combine authority to deliver well outcome for young people in my constituency but it need the power to do so urge ministers to work with colleague in the department for education so that we can use mayor to tackle entrench inequality and ensure that every young person regardless of background have access to high quality education and training that prepare they for the future this bill be not just handover of power but partnership between central government and local community between elect leader and the people they serve for cheshire and warrington it be chance to lead by example and to show what empower community can achieve when give the freedom to flourish also use to be councillor like many member across the chamber be deputy leader of chelmsford city council for five year and an opposition member at essex county council have see at first hand the work of local council and know that they do it in very difficult circumstance circumstance that have get hard and hard with dwindle fund and increase demand on council service despite the very good effort of council leader across the country and council officer who be often the unsung hero local government there be crisis in housing in special educational need and in adult social care we do not seem to have plan to fix any of they yet we seem to be rush ahead with local government reorganisation and devolution which to seem bit like put the cart before the horse be the good way to fix the crisis in special educational need or in adult social care or to truly deliver all the housing we need different form of local government why be these really important issue not part of the mix why do we not have plan to fix they first before we reorganise local government and trap ourselves in corner be in favour of devolution it be right to have power close to the people it affect want local community to be empower but this bill do not deliver that in fact although it devolve power relate to transport and skill and other thing in the bill be good too the local government reorganisation that go with those measure mean that this legislation do the exact opposite of deliver devolution let we take essex as an example choose essex because represent the constituency of chelmsford in the very heart of essex because use to be an essex county councillor and because essex be in the first wave of reorganisation essex will not benefit from the scrapping of first past the post so my constituent will not benefit from their vote truly be represent there be proposal to replace essex county council plus the district council with either three four or five unitarie if we include the other exist unitarie plus essex county council we be talk about council in total replace they with possibly three unitarie would be the exact opposite of devolution it would take power away from the people and make the councillor elect to represent the people far away from they be delighted to hear the hon lady speech she and be both essex mp and agree that we should not create these huge unitary authority because local council be truly in touch with local community and local need however do she agree that as havering be also part of essex we should be part of that discussion as well if my borough want to be part of an essex unitary authority such as central essex which would include chelmsford do she agree that my constituent should have the right to make that decision in democracy absolutely my problem with this bill be that it feel rush more people want to contribute to the discussion constituent want to be represent and to have local government reorganise in way that they have be able to contribute to that would truly be democracy what we be see right now be rush and be not proper representation of democracy the three unitary model be not the only propose model that be be propose by the county council but the model that have the most support from the local district council nine of they be the five unitary model certainly support that because if we have to go ahead with local government reorganisation surely it should be with the model that keep power close to people will the hon lady clarify if she would support the people of havering if they choose to be part of an essex unitary authority if that be their democratically choose wish think we be in danger of get into the weed on exactly how local government would be reorganise we talk about the size of the unitary authority that would be create the three unitary model in essex would instantly create three of the top five big unitary authority in the country after growth they would be three of the top four big unitary authority it would create enormous council with considerably less connection with the local community they serve that be the opposite of devolution and worry lot about the loss of identity that it could lead to lot of the talk be about saving the deputy prime minister talk bit about saving from reorganisation but there be very little evidence to support that use real world datum past model produce by consultancy have not use real world datum however accord to real world datum if the five unitary model be choose local government reorganisation be expect to save only million across the whole of essex after five year if the three unitary model be choose we will end up with million less than that this be huge undertaking with lot of resource go in for very little and we still do not have plan for special educational need adult social care and all the thing mention early the really important point be that greater essex contain thurrock which have very very big debt problem about million of unsecured debt there be no model of local government reorganisation or devolution in greater essex even keep the exist structure frankly that would be financially sustainable without central government step in and provide fund to cover thurrock debt the math simply do not work be look directly at the minister because we need solution there will be much more unity in essex on how to move forward if we can work out how to deal with thurrock debt it can not be that other local resident such as my constituent in chelmsford be ask to shoulder the blame for something that they do not bring about in the first place turn to essex county council election which be cancel last may we have absolutely no idea whether they will go ahead next may it would seem bit strange if they do but equally we want democracy can the government provide some clarity finally why be first past the post be scrap for mayoral election but not for local government or general election that seem rather inconsistent can not say that devolution be topic that come up very often on the doorstep but the issue that this bill be design to address too much power exercise by people far away too little say in shape the place where we live and too much confusion over where to go when we have problem or an issue that need resolve certainly do my constituent have raise those issue with time and again and devolution and the measure set out in this bill will tackle those challenge they will return power to local people empower community and power growth in area of the country like mine in norfolk in norfolk devolution mean opportunity it mean innovation and investment help create new job in emerge industry such as clean aviation and bolster our exist strength include financial service life science and clean energy devolution mean connectivity unlock well and sustainable transport which be essential in rural county like ours it mean enhance norfolk and norwich reputation and reach amplify our voice our contribution and our impact nationally as such welcome the bill and the fact that norfolk be part of the devolution priority programme current proposal will see an elect mayor for norfolk and suffolk alongside the establishment of combine authority but we must get the structure below that level right in order to take full advantage of this opportunity that be why local government reorganisation and the tool set out in the bill to deliver it be so vital it be once in generation chance to provide more efficient public service to end the overlap of council and to deliver well value for money be pleased to back the proposal support by six out of seven of norfolk district council to create three unitary authority in norfolk there would be greater norwich unitary with extended boundary and two unitary authority broadly cover the eastern and western part of norfolk grow up in norfolk we move there when be three know how essential it be that what be deliver be root in place and identity and believe this proposal will reflect norfolk and what be need there of course the specific boundary still need to be shape with the support of community engagement but it be the shape believe our county need with it we can unlock the full potential of norwich it be already key city for the region and our country with its economy have grow by since but we can do so much more to unlock our full potential as city of great innovation culture and prosperity drive growth across east anglia and beyond as the need for affordable and sustainable housing continue to grow see that the housing minister be on the front bench the establishment of greater norwich unitary authority will also offer more effective mechanism for address housing demand which be such pressure in our city devolution and effective reorganisation will be game changer for norwich and norfolk but only if we get it right fear that some of the other option on the table will simply not work the proposal back by the conservative control norfolk county council call for the creation of single county unitary in norfolk believe that would be just too big its footprint would cover thousand of square mile stretch tie between local councillor and the people they be elect to serve similarly model involve two unitary authority fail to recognise the unique growth opportunity in norwich which have set out although we may disagree on the model it be important that there be healthy debate on this subject thank all the councillor at all level who do so much for our community every single day and who have contribute to the discussion so far as these proposal be develop it be vital that we work collaboratively across party listen to our resident to get the very good for our community on that point ask the minister to underline that this bill will not affect town and parish council and indeed will recognise the vital role they play we have many in norwich north sprowston drayton old catton hellesdon and thorpe st andrew and they all play important part in our neighbourhood have one minute leave so as labour and co operative mp take this opportunity to thank the co op party and all its member for all the campaigning they have do to deliver so many measure in this bill include the community right to buy recognise that this process may not be easy but if we get it right the benefit will be huge for the constituent we serve and the place we represent rise as colleague can see from look around the chamber there be far too many speaker to be accommodate by pm when this debate have to end as such after the next speaker the speak limit will be three minute and you can calculate the number not everybody will get in even on that time limit call bradley thomas while the current devolution plan in this bill put politic before people the government be press ahead with the bill before the independent adult social care review be publish in believe that to reorganise local government without first confront the fundamental crisis in care be to put the cart before the horse effective reform can not be do in isolation the local government association have be clear in its view that devolution must be align with health police fire and integrate care board structure with council keep central to delivery accountability and collaboration at every level local consent should be priority throughout the devolution process any change in governance must be make with the full consent of the people affect yet this bill allow the secretary of state to impose new governance structure include strategic authority and regional mayor without local agreement that strip local people of their voice and run counter to the very principle of devolution local democracy be already be erode by the unprecedented housing target be force on community with local objection routinely brush aside resident feel powerless in shape the future of their town and village and trust in government be drain away rapidly this bill will only deepen that resentment because ministers promise devolution but community will actually receive less say while be treat as little more than an extension of nearby major city birmingham city with hectare of brownfield land and establish infrastructure be see its housing target cut by over meanwhile in my constituency where of the land be green belt target have soar by staggering that be not sensible planning it be an attempt to urbanise rural area against the will of local resident in her opening remark the deputy prime minister say that at the minute too much power be in the hand of the few when it should be in the hand of the many the government should therefore let local people have more of say in what the housing target should be if our current council in worcestershire be to be sideline it should be for singular worcestershire council to come into existence that can deliver value for money to the taxpayer provide the good possible service and keep decision make local we can not accept worcestershire involuntarily become an extension of birmingham in the name of devolution the bill proposal be model on city experience worcestershire be not the same as birmingham manchester or any other big city we have different need different challenge and different priority force city template on to rural area sideline community strip away their voice and sacrifice the fabric of rural life once again rural and semi rural resident be treat as an afterthought county shape by their rural character such as worcestershire be rightly proud of their identity and tradition if this bill be to touch our community it must first recognise their distinct need and be rethought to respect they refer member to my declaration in the register of members financial interests the fight to rebuild trust in politic must begin in our community in leigh and atherton people want to feel proud of the place that they call home they want visible investment and the power to shape their future and that be why welcome the second reading of this bill this ambitious bill be an important step in our devolution revolution represent one of the great transfer of power from westminster in generation it be the first uk bill in history to include the word empowerment in its title for too long devolution have mean power be shift between whitehall mayor and council without make meaningful contact with local people this bill offer meaningful step forward give our community the tool to take ownership of the space that matter most as labour and co operative mp welcome the introduction of the community right to buy in practice this mean that when asset of community value come to the market community get first dibs where we have lose such local asset it have mean not just loss of service to the community but further erosion of trust in local democracy be therefore in no doubt that give community strong voice in local decision making help to restore trust in politic from the bottom up in my constituency of leigh and atherton leigh spinners mill and leigh works stand as shin example of what happen when local people take the rein once derelict but now community own they have become an anchor for regeneration the mill and leigh works support job culture and wellbeing across the country people have see beloved community space force to close their door thousand of community centre youth club library pub and leisure centre have close over the past decade with this bill labour be rebuild the fabric of our community give local people the power to buy community space mean more asset own and shape by the people who use and love they we be help community to unleash the energy passion and creativity that exist in every community many member have point to greater manchester as blueprint and it do show what be possible when devolution be do right since we have build home launch the bee network and help more than resident into work have be strong advocate for devolution for many year my work as local councillor at wigan council and then at spinners mill reinforce my belief in give power to local authority and the community that they represent we must seize this opportunity to put power back where it belong and to build future where leigh and atherton and community across the country feel empower and proud of the place that they call home we have all be tell repeatedly that the government plan for local government will improve local service and save the taxpayer money but it be increasingly clear that the bill fail to deliver on those point this be forced top down change from westminster that will abolish effective local council and strip local people of their ability to have say on local issue in my constituency have two district council east herts and broxbourne as well as hertfordshire county council under this devolution plan they will be abolish and replace by new unitary council strongly oppose hertfordshire county council form single new unitary council cover million people and be pleased to learn that that have be rule out but the new unitary council will still be far large than the district council that we currently have be sure that many other member on both side of the house will share my experience that large local authority be often less efficient and deliver bad service than small more agile one the big council in the country be birmingham with population of more than million and doubt that anyone here would call it efficient while no council be perfect believe that council work well when they be close to the people they serve on top of that have serious doubt that these plan will actually save any money there be no way in which efficiency will cover the extra cost of spending by these bloated new unitary authority the process of reorganisation be expensive and disruptive and have yet to see it notably improve the finance of council that have go through it indeed many area will be bad off as result of it responsible conservative council such as broxbourne which have consistently keep within budget and keep council tax low will be force to merge with debt ride neighbouring council and raise their council tax level know that where unitarisation have happen council have go on to set up delivery of service base on the old district boundary anyway the efficiency expect by the government have not emerge believe that the government be go down this path of create big new super unitary council because of their failure to make progress on their target of build million new home the government be get desperate rather than build house where they be need in london and rather than build house where there be appropriate infrastructure or make developer deal with infrastructure first they be abolish local council in order to force through huge arbitrary housing target in all the wrong place on precious green belt throughout the united kingdom deliver more representative system locally as well as one that empower local government be necessary now give the palpable long term frustration with decision making that be perceive by community to be exclusively dictate by those confine to planet westminster or especially in falkirk planet holyrood we know from experience that devolution work well when it be root in economic regeneration with real impact on ordinary people life agree with the hon member for caithness sutherland and easter ross jamie stone who be no long in the chamber when he say that scotland be cautionary tale the cautionary tale for local government from year of snp government be about what happen when we do nothing which be what the conservatives and the liberal democrats will vote for tonight local leader can more effectively deploy policy lever in the collective national interest for instance the transport procurement policy of manchester and liverpool mayor have deliver hundred of order from falkirk bus manufacturer that be essential especially while our own devolve scottish government have their eye off the ball and on shiny new chinese bus when local leader with popular mandate have be able to take charge of industrial strategy and regeneration we see confidence return to community that for decade have feel leave behind reflect on the centralise tendency of my absent snp colleague observe that they have persistently ignore constrain and harm local authority in scotland be still wait for the council tax abolition that hear about in primary if we be ask our constituent to invest trust in their local leader and to engage in local decision make with the hope that it can change something we must also take microscope to the health of our democratic structure nationally turnout have be go down and we know why we keep hear from folk on the doorstep that they do not think their vote change anything with the removal of first past the post for mayoral and police and crime commissioner election be it not time that we give local government the option of drop first past the post as wales have do be it not also time for national commission on electoral reform that be the point be just about to get to in be elect as local authority councillor in third place under the multi member system and it do work many people would not have go to different political party or would not necessarily have come to speak to the labour representative but it help that they have diverse representation do think it be worth look at that system as be about to touch on as member of the all party parliamentary group for fair election that be why the provision in the bill concern voting system be welcome and why to echo my hon friend we should consider national commission on electoral reform commitment to foster national conversation about how we should be elect in modern britain and to build consensus and way forward different voting system be already use across the country for example for the devolved legislature in scotland wales and northern ireland for our council and for mayoral election here in england disillusionment do not start yesterday and any change to voting system will not solve the degree of disengagement that we have see in community but it could allow people to see their view always reflect in the institution that represent they as we see with falkirk council under the multi member ward system continue to rely on voting system nationally when nearly two third of people want change risk crystallise the disillusionment by formalise and extend devolution the government be today move to strengthen trust at local level by engage in serious exercise about how we be send to this place we can go long way towards renew it at national level too it be pleasure to speak on this important piece of legislation and declare my interest as vice president of the local government association this bill intention be to support further devolution something that the liberal democrats be in favour of however the bill fail to properly do so and instead only reinforce the overly centralised approach take by the last government alongside contiguous neighbour somerset be ready to move forward with further devolution over six month ago when it be part of the joint heart of wessex bid disappointingly the government choose not to include it in the devolution priority programme despite the proposal match the growth and economic objective set out in the government white paper and encompass nearly million people the deal would have provide great power for community struggle under national policy and give rural community confidence that their voice be be hear this bill fail to adequately deal with the ongoing and ever increase financial crisis face by council across the country despite the challenge liberal democrats in somerset have be get on with the job of fix council finance follow the wild mismanagement of the previous conservative administration just yesterday the council publish new year economic prosperity strategy which aim to build thriving fair and green somerset economy it be lead the way on low carbon energy aerospace and defence the bill make no reference to the unique nature of rural community for example somerset population be both old and age fast than the national average which will increase the amount of care need in the county as chair of the appg on rural service it would be remiss of not to acknowledge the additional financial challenge that rural authority such as somerset face over half of somerset budget go towards adult and child care there be shortage of social care provider which will be impact by the rise in employer national insurance contribution and as with so many local authority the pressure on the delivery of send provision be only increase the bill do nothing to stabilise the financial footing of rural council in fact it fail to even mention rural community we must also acknowledge that rural community be often at the forefront of environmental issue such as flooding last month riparian ratepayer in somerset be inform that the environment agency will cease main river maintenance work within the next six month be deeply concerned that this will put somerset at increase and unacceptable risk of flooding and environmental harm how do the government intend to implement all of this through devolution give that the exist authority be responsible for reinforcement enforcement and regulation welcome the bill and commend the deputy prime minister my right hon friend the member for ashton under lyne angela rayner for her leadership in bring it forward for too long decision about our community have be make far from the people they affect this bill signal profound shift put trust back into local leader strengthen council and ensure that community have real say in shape their future it provide the foundation for new settlement for england that value local knowledge and unlock local energy the return of the supplementary vote system for mayoral election key feature of this important bill be welcome and associate myself with the view of my hon friend the member for falkirk euan stainbank on the wide issue of proportional representation the bill place particular emphasis on neighbourhood work by recognise the importance of neighbourhood and the grassroots organisation that sustain they equally important be the measure to strengthen community right to buy which empower resident to take ownership of the place that matter to they most ensure they can be preserve and improve for future generation pay tribute to the deputy prime minister for her clarity in purpose in drive these change she understand that local government be not an obstacle to progress but the engine of it although the bill be about empowerment we must ensure that it do not undermine the principle of local choice however inadvertently since the announcement of the bill have have ten of email and more than letter on this subject in may the people of sheffield go to the poll in city wide referendum they vote decisively by move to modern committee system of government replace the old leader and cabinet model that be clear democratic decision it be also guarantee in law for at least year with the principle that any further change could be make only by referendum the provision currently in the bill would overturn that choice force sheffield back into governance model that its citizen have explicitly reject that can not be right it would break faith with local voter undermine the spirit of empowerment that run through the bill and send the wrong message about how seriously we take democratic decision if this legislation be to achieve its full potential council that have already choose to have committee system via referendum should be allow to retain that system just as with mayoral model know that local leader agree with on this and appreciate that minister have be meet local leader this be bold bill it be one that we should be proud of and that be proud to support it rightly enshrine the central role of council in shape and deliver devolution just hope that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater on the issue of allow local council to maintain their choose model the government talk about devolution but that be not what be go on with the bill or with local government reform power be not be hand down by central government but be suck up from district council to unitarie and from council to mayoralty govern enormous and very diverse territory from distant town and city in west suffolk we face suffolk and norfolk mayoralty probably run from norwich and new unitary council structure with either one council run from ipswich or three different council give our place on the map cambridge be more important to we than norwich or ipswich yet there be little in these proposal to help we to exploit the economic opportunity present by well transport connection and business opportunity come out of one of the most dynamic city in the country of course question about the tax burden and distribution of revenue be fundamental give the state of the public finance any saving make through local government reform might be snaffle by the treasury service provide by district council might be cut to subsidise service fund by the county council such as adult social care council debt across suffolk stand at billion but there be huge variation between the council in ipswich debt per person be nearly while in west suffolk it be less than there be similar story with tax ipswich charge the high council tax of any shire district in the country to equalise tax across single suffolk unitary council would mean massive tax rise for people live in west suffolk tax cut for people in ipswich which would retain service unavailable to my constituent or bad of both world combination suffolk council have their different proposal but ultimately it will be whitehall that decide be press ministers and those advocate particular model for we locally for the clear answer that we in west suffolk need and deserve first will all the money save stay in suffolk secondly will people in west suffolk pay more in council tax as result of this change will we end up funding service for ipswich that we do not get thirdly will town and parish council be give great say in the planning process fourthly will town and parish council have great power over thing such as road safety and speed limit fifthly will we get an absolute guarantee that there will be no merger between suffolk and norfolk police force this whole process be too rush and completely unsatisfactory it be wrong to postpone our local election this year the propose reform have not be think through and the consequence be not clear there may be some upside to reform and there may even be some upside in principle to unitary council but unless we get convincing answer will oppose not just this bill but the change to local government in suffolk this devolution debate today be continuation of the conversation that have be do the round in sussex since the announcement that we will be in the first wave of new region to begin the devolution process the bill will allow we to unlock resource at regional level and to use they to well serve the need of our community it provide the framework for cohesive strategic planning across sussex for the housing and service that we need generate good employment and the freedom to travel easily do right it be an opportunity for great democratic engagement and participation let turn to couple of the issue that have be do the round in this conversation in sussex the first be planning and transport business in worthe west and across sussex be currently gridlocke by fail east to west travel route and by public transport that be too often unaffordable unreliable or absent outside of our town centre regional transport authority with legal responsibility for bus train and active travel will be able to leverage investment and design service that actually meet the need of our community we want travel planning that connect people and business enable eco tourism to flourish in our beautiful south downs and let resident move across sussex without rely on crumble century system that be build around car and that no long serve we on housing and infrastructure with this bill we can align housing planning and infrastructure finally to deliver the right home in the right place across the region in my constituency almost one in four resident be now aged or above yet much of our housing stock be not fit for old age the shortage of suitable home limit our ability to attract working age people to the area along with so many other area we face dire lack of rented and affordable social housing only at regional level can we plan housing that meet our need now and into the future home that be accessible for our old population affordable for young family and support by infrastructure to create thriving mixed community networked and easily accessible across sussex finally will focus on the new duty on health inequality welcome the bill introduction of this duty which be crucial for the rural and coastal community in my constituency and across sussex the chief medical officer report be clear coastal area suffer persistent coastal excess of ill health even after account for age and deprivation rural area also face hide deprivation that regional average fail to capture limited service high fuel poverty isolation and inadequate access to care these be life cut short and opportunity deny the bill will compel leader in sussex to consider health in every policy transport housing and skill embed public health in all decision and that be something that we can learn from at national level too the bill brand itself as devolution by default but in practice it could be see as centralisation by stealth real devolution shift power out of westminster and whitehall to the people in local community but the bill risk do the opposite for instance clause let minister draw and redraw local map in order for area to have mayor clause let they bolt on new function by regulation with minimal scrutiny and clause create seven unelected commissioner answerable only to mayor it also fail to explain how it will all be pay for let we be clear local government be in serious financial difficulty east sussex county council be on course to exhaust its reserve by council across east sussex carry million worth of debt our inboxe be full of case that should be handle by council that no long have the staff or the funding reshuffling deck chair on sink ship will not save it without sustainable settlement for social care and child service structural change will fail some power be welcome if they be fund bus franchising can reconnect town and village but not on an empty budget require key route network and local growth plan add duty but at the moment without give resource new local audit office could help clear the audit backlog but it can not be both regulator and auditor no one should mark their own homework be particularly alarmed to read clause this issue have affect my community particularly heavily the clause enable force merger into new unitary council in my area brighton and hove city council have launch surprise consultation to push its boundary east to absorb newhaven kingston and nearby village in my constituency newhaven be distinct port town mile from brighton kingston iford rodmell and southease be rural community in the south downs national park have already write to minister on this subject they be not brighton neighbourhood and resident do not want decision make for they at hove town hall the government say that they want pace the east sussex proposal support by the county council and all five district and borough keep the county boundary intact and let east sussex move forward together brighton farcical counter proposal risk delay and confusion not least by propose to cut across the boundary of two county division and parliamentary constituency its consultation do not even consider westward expansion where the urban area of brighton and hove naturally continue it go straight into cut up east sussex here be the test for the bill overall do it move power and resource to people and place or do it pull more string into the secretary of state hand do it strengthen scrutiny or sidestep it do it fix the finance or dodge they at the moment it fall short on all these count hope the minister can explain the answer to those challenge devolution should feel like power in people hand not something be do to they our politic be not work too many people feel that what we do here have little relevance to their life they feel that their vote be less source of power and decision about our common future and more an expression the only way they have to demonstrate how bad the status quo have become often my constituent ask who be in charge of this who do hold responsible for fix it and so often it be shockingly hard to know or even find out our state and our political system have become so confused and centralised with so many compete boundary of responsibility that power slip through the crack and evade the grasp of elect politician to fix that we must go back to first principle this bill be motivate by fundamental principle that in our democracy sovereignty flow up from the people to parliament not down from parliament to the people the people be sovereign so the way we govern ourselves our constitution be not the unique property of member in this chamber it be something that all of we own as citizen we be represent as well as representative that matter because it change how we should think about the bill the control that the bill aim to give people be not new and it be not something that this place have the unique authority to give or withhold the bill aim to restore kind of local control that have for too long be gradually erode and its motivating principle be that through voting people should be able to change our political system the right to request power enshrine this principle in law enable strategic authority to be ambitious in request the power that the people who live in those area need to thrive know that andy burnham mayor of the town represent in wigan will be ambitious in use that power for technical education tourist taxis and employment support as the bill develop hope that consideration will be give to the responsibility to treat the request with the seriousness that they deserve greater manchester be shin example of how this work and it be the fast grow local economy in the uk at double the uk rate in taxi licensing we also have an example of how power can drain from elect official as local people can not hold to account the authority and police force responsible for their safety the bill be part of broad agenda that strongly support restore power to people choose by the public instead of independent agency expert or body of right and treaty to my mind when our politic be not work we politician have responsibility to think boldly about how to make it work well what we need be nothing less than moment of constitutional change and fresh and creative thinking about how to reform our system that be what hope the bill begin to do bring decision make close to local people and make it more accountable and more reflective of local need be laudable aim but that be not what the bill will do rather than bring decision make close to hard work local people it will cement the damaging present system of oversized unitary authority and dubiously useful mayoralty if we want our community to have responsive local government with easily accessible political leader who deliver on the desire of resident and be accountable at the ballot box we should not be push for large local government boundary if anything we should be reduce their size in scotland we have so call devolution but the reality on the ground be that the scottish government be centralise more and more power do my hon friend share my concern that the bill create the potential risk of that absolutely share that concern and will give my hon friend an example of what we face across the bradford district the people across keighley and ilkley have long know the danger to small community when such amalgamation occur in their well like and well remember council be abolish and absorb into large bradford council unitary authority which be one of the large in the country with population of the average size of unitary authority be about people since then bradford council have consistently prioritise its namesake extract ever high council tax and cost from outlying area such as my constituency and neighbouring shipley and funnel they into city centre project of no benefit to the people who have pay for they my friend be make some excellent point the good example which be from when this start be the creation of greater london in ever since then area like romford have be pay money into central london and lose our local control local identity and local democracy and it have be cost we an absolute fortune do my hon friend agree that the bill be lot of red tape and bureaucracy and the wrong direction to go in absolutely agree the bill be not about local democracy it be about take the power for decision make away from local people on where their council tax should be spend that be why be advocate that the government should stop the bill from progress bradford council be make up of councillor with bradford have great number of councillor on the council than keighley and ilkley combine that may be reflective of their rural population but it be completely airbrush out the distinctly different need desire and priority of area such as mine that be why will advocate continuously for we in keighley ilkley silsden and the worth valley and indeed the shipley constituency to have our own unitary authority outside that of bradford mayoralty have be arguably great challenge when constituent have an issue madam deputy speaker you and other members of the house know that they should not have any difficulty in contact their parliamentarian as our constituency office be on the high street and our email be always open we have personal and deep connection to the local community we represent and be familiar with the business and the people that make up those community but mayoralty operate over region with hundred of thousand if not million of resident within they if constituent try to contact their mayor it be highly likely that the correspondence will never cross the mayor desk mayoral region be simply too large for one person to seriously represent the community level aggregate decision making at the strategic authority level make exactly the same mistake if community want to make an objection it will have to do so no long to its local council but to strategic authority body not tie by history sentiment or even geographical area to those community but instead under direction send by the government if we be serious about devolution we would follow the lesson experience by keighley and ilkley and make local government work at community level we would empower not administrative monstrosity but parish town and small more regional council that be why will continue to advocate for my area to be take out of the bradford unitary authority and to create our own unitary authority advocate reverse the local government amalgamation make in the not double down on they the bill be wolf in sheep clothing and should not be support draw attention to my entry in the register of members financial interests have always be and remain vocal advocate for devolution and reorganisation get to witness the type of joy and hope want every community to feel when work in greater manchester during the establishment of the first devolve mayoralty have have robust debate with council and resident of all political persuasion on how local government reorganisation should good work in lancashire particularly when sense of place and home be so important to most of we the prospect of what we know to be our place change somehow can be unsettling but if we be bring along and engage throughout we can usually start to see the opportunity too will focus my comment on the most local level of our democratic structure the role of town and parish council which believe should be use to even great effect if we let it my constituency of ribble valley be significantly parishe in its rural area with parish such as broughton and balderstone while more suburban area such as lostock hall be not but have active community group such as the lostock hall village team therefore see the strength of both formal and informal community leadership in clause the bill rightly create clear requirement for local authority to create neighbourhood governance structure in statement to this house in june it be suggest that those could be call neighbourhood area committee lead by ward councillor however be concerned that the bill do not fully appreciate the role that town and parish council currently play and that the accountability of such neighbourhood area committee do not seem to be enshrine will cover couple of my concern first if the committee be lead by ward councillor such councillor be political in their nature whereas parish councillor be usually apolitical we therefore need to consider the ramification of change the focus of those local committee secondly how do we ensure that every area be advocate for by committed representative how do we tangibly protect area whose ward councillor be not active or who do not create neighbourhood governance structure do that remove the ability for involved resident to form group outside that we all know of councillor rare as they be hope who stand for political reason or otherwise and then do not drive thing locally even though parish and town council only cover of the population in england they cover some of its geographical area some may feel that such distinction mean that parish council be not so influential and significant in our country governance but that view do disservice to the land that we live in and on and be sustain by as politician and as resident in democracy we be responsible for the land around we and its resource indeed some of the big role for parish and town council be around planning the environment flood and ensure that local area the building the field the road and not just the people be manage well although to some this section of the bill may feel small and fairly niche if we do not pay attention to the conversation happen in the pub or the community centre and to the people there who understand their local area well than anyone we will struggle to understand what people want and need let be clear this bill be monumental but let we build on our fantastic exist structure especially those town and parish council that cover of our great country as have always be order call siân berry there be idea in this bill that devolve power that we greens can support layer of strategic government with funding and fundraising power could empower area of the country such as sussex to improve daily life for our citizen and could strengthen democracy however it be worry that the process for do that so far and the way in which decision be move forward on the reorganisation of local government have not listen to people who want to maintain their district and borough council and have not properly engage local people in devise new proposal rather than just comment on they if this be do without consent or respect for local area it will not be democratic or empower clause be very unfair in grandfathere in exist mayoral arrangement for local council but not preserve any committee system not even those choose recently by referendum on fair voting the bill be inadequate for the new elect mayor the bill specify supplementary voting system that be well than first past the post but as other member have point out that should be use next year in sussex also for the new authority where new councillor be be elect there be genuine miss chance to have fairer voting system for council too the bill be dangerously light on the democratic scrutiny of new mayor and combined authority and poor on standard in public life there should be transparency duty on mayor to disclose their lobbying meeting as minister do and all mps should mayor will also be able to appoint commissioner for different area of their power which will be powerful position that be likely to be well remunerate yet the bill appear to be silent on any high standard of accountability transparency or conduct for such people mayor and commissioner should all come under the advisory committee on business appointments as other people in this place do there be big miss chance in the bill in term of new duty for poverty and inequality climate nature healthy air land and water pollution and health particularly in relation to the impact of transport and housing policy on health determinant the bill mention prosperity but not poverty or inequality nor do it mention the huge chance to improve health by clean up filthy air pollution why not greens will be argue for all these goal and duty and more to be put in place firmly and clearly in the bill and for they to be match with power funding and the ability to raise and use investment for home transport education justice social justice public health and all these other thing to close the gap that have so shamefully grow under successive government and continue labour austerity this bill could help to deliver great thing but it will take many big change much work and much listen to good idea from this part of the house for the government to achieve that also welcome the shadow secretary of state to his new role the english devolution and community empowerment bill present great opportunity for southend east and rochford and for greater essex the bill be about give local people the right to make decision about the place they call home at its heart it be about empower our community community do not just happen when be grow up we have youth club football team and thrive heritage building we have strong sense of community over the past year many of these institution have be force to close devolution have already bring so many opportunity to area that have see more devolved power family in southend east and rochford and in essex deserve that same level of opportunity will the hon gentleman give way will make bit of progress widen devolution be chance to finally reverse this trend it introduce new community right to buy give community group formal right of first refusal to purchase asset of community value and it extend the time period to month for community to raise fund and negotiate purchase price for say asset it protect grassroots sporting facility as asset of community value which they be it end upward only rent review clause in commercial lease this will allow rent to increase and decrease at the rent review base on the current market rate this will prevent vacant shop and help to regenerate high street finally it provide measure for accountability to ensure that mayor from all party deliver the house transport and infrastructure that community need the essex economy have be hold back by power store in westminster if greater essex have the same level of productivity as the south east our local economy would be big it be time to unlock this economic potential and for greater essex to carve out its own industrial strategy and finally become the economic powerhouse know it can be devolution should mean give power back to people and community decision ought to be take as close as possible to those they affect but this bill impose top down model from whitehall with sweeping new power for the secretary of state mayor and their unelected commissioner rather than the real empowerment of council and resident my own constituency of stratford on avon be good example of why this matter in rural south warwickshire our need be very different from the urban north we face unique challenge such as unreliable public transport which leave local resident with poor access to key service our fire and rescue service have be reduce that be why support the two unitary council solution for warwickshire reflect the reality of our place and respect the local identity far we must not overlook the vital role that parish and town council play in community such as mine across stratford on avon from create neighbourhood development plan to support local group and look after our village green and recreation ground they do outstanding work and with the right backing many stand ready to deliver more for their community council be already stretch to breaking point with deficit run into the billion for those authority already in the deep difficulty devolution without proper funding be little more than rearrange the deck chair on the titanic unless ministers face up to the scale of the challenge and provide sustainable resource no new governance structure will succeed although bring back the supplementary vote be move in the right direction the government have miss real opportunity to restore trust in politic through fairer election if the government recognise that first past the post be not fit for mayoral election why be it fit for parliamentary and council election welcome the strengthening of the community right to buy scheme which will help safeguard value local asset particularly in rural area where protect much love asset and community hub such as our pub be so important the government must go far on this especially when asset be keep empty and derelict by landlord in conclusion the bill could have be the moment to show that national government be willing to put power in the hand of community instead by centralise rather than devolving the government have let the moment pass refer member to my entry in the register of members financial interests be in my year as member of thetford town council and serve as director on the charles burrell centre committee community benefit society in my hometown have serve on the town council the district council and the county council all three tier of local government so member will understand why have keen interest in the bill but it be my background in community that lead to get involve in politic in the first place the clause in the bill specifically around community empowerment be exciting and long overdue in my constituency of south west norfolk where be bear and raise have see the impact of community power at first hand when my former school charles burrell high school close in we be devastate it be partly the emotion that come from lose school of more than year but it be also that the physical building have be home to so many community group and other organisation for many it be so much more than just school as community we set about work to save the building at some square foot of former secondary school with acre of land it be no easy undertaking few think it would work but on saturday just go myself and hundred of local resident celebrate the charles burrell centre birthday over those year we have witness local people take responsibility for the site turn it into thriving community hub of more than organisation charity statutory body and small business it now create job support family and act as vital anchor for the community with an annual turnover of half million pound none of that would have be possible without trust in local people on strategic authority wonder if the minister could speak to my concern about opportunity for rural community strategic authority draw on metropolitan large urban area but have three market town and village in my constituency although individually their economic potential would be small by comparison collectively our rural community have so much potential and could significantly support the government growth agenda but they need support how those rural community link up and obtain that support as part of devolution and how they work with the strategic authority be key hope the minister can highlight how rural area will fit in want narborough in my constituency to have as much focus as norwich want ickburgh to be on the page when we be talk about ipswich particularly welcome community right to buy give local people the strong say they need on community issue sadly for too many community project get good idea off the drawing board be still far too difficult and hope these priority and other can support project like the charles burrell centre which be now under the excellent management of nicola welham support by fantastic staff and volunteer team in thetford this bill have miss the opportunity to introduce fair voting system the outdated first past the post system distort the will of the people while ignore million of voice across the country it be no wonder that so many people feel disconnected from politic this bill could have be an opportunity to restore the disconnect but it fail devolution must go hand in hand with reform that ensure that every vote count and every community have voice the bill will not result in that ambitious shift of power from westminster and whitehall to community and individual sadly it be miss opportunity for reform will the minister ask the deputy prime minister to commit to consider pr more carefully you never know madam deputy speaker it might help the labour party to hold on to few more seat at the next general election can not understand how anyone could speak against the bill it present real opportunity to do something different in our local community northampton have be under unitary system for five year now after the conservatives bankrupt our county council and no one there have ever say to wish we have more council and councillor people want simplicity and that be what the bill deliver the bill also deliver accountability my hon friend the member for north somerset sadik al hassan talk about the personal accountability of councillor in my area the former conservative leader have to stand down because of domestic abuse charge and former conservative cabinet member be in court on abuse charge alongside man who be charge with abuse child so would say that more accountability for our local councillor and politician be very important the bill drive growth speak to investor who want to come to the oxford cambridge growth corridor they have hear the chancellor talk about the opportunity in our region and think there be no single voice that can speak to but can go to west yorkshire south yorkshire or anywhere else around the country with big mayoral authority and find someone who be championing growth not in greater london they may well come to london meanwhile in the ox cam corridor and the south midland region we be struggle for single voice that be speak out for our area that be what devolution will deliver for we devolution also save cost be sure that all member have read the detailed analysis in the library briefing but pwc also estimate that it will save between million and million year for taxpayer it would be absolutely banana to vote against something that would reduce people tax bill there be some great local benefit for northampton will not talk about devolution because the minister know my strong view on the issue that face one that will not let slip through here be scooter licensing we have have long run scooter trial in northampton every single month people complain to about scooter litter it be important that local authority be able to well control those licensing agreement and hold the scooter company to account for ensure that scooter be in the right place we in london also face proliferation of scooter and bike the last conservative government absolutely fail to take any action on that do my hon friend agree that it will make huge difference to londoners that transport for london will now have the power to hold those company to account and clear the pavement could not agree more can not imagine how anyone can deal with the myriad company work across london have just one in northampton be challenge enough although it be good company local ownership be central to the bill and community right to buy will be fantastic people have talk about pub but number of different community organisation that have come to see in the past year the nigerian community association the albanian cultural association and our local ukrainian school be look to take derelict local property and turn they into great community hub the bill would give they more power to take on those community asset and create great place in northampton the bill protect small business for retail business on wellingborough road kettering road in the town centre or one of the shopping parade the removal of upward only rent review will mean that shop owner have more security and protection under this government overall be very excited about move power out of whitehall and into local community honestly have listen to the debate for good three hour can not understand how anyone could possibly vote against the measure it might surprise the hon member for northampton south mike reader but in my constituency people want good local councillor particularly the liberal democrat one who be work hard we liberal democrats passionately believe that power belong in local community not concentrate in whitehall although we welcome the drive for further devolution the bill sideline local council by hand yet more authority to regional mayor bath council know all too well the frustration of have regional mayor who do not listen to all the local authority they represent for year bath council want to bring bus under local control but we be stick with labour mayor who refuse to listen and spend million on birthday bus vanity project rather than deliver the change my constituent be cry out for the bill will enable mayor of strategic authority to nominate up to seven unelected commissioner to deliver policy accountable only to the mayor these unelected official add layer of unaccountable bureaucracy that community do not want and council do not need real devolution mean local community at the heart of decision making work collaboratively with the mayor clause and do not even clarify on which relevant local matter mayor must convene with local partner surely that can not be right also absent from the bill be visitor levy power for local authority bath council have long be advocate for the ability to introduce modest visitor levy we in bath be proud of the role we play in support the visitor economy but the system need to be fair recognise the cost as well as the benefit of such high level of tourism the government should give local authority these power through the bill to safeguard our hugely important and valuable tourism industry also miss from the bill be the introduction of public account committee to oversee and hold mayoral strategic authority accountable much like the public accounts committee do with government expenditure robust local scrutiny would reduce the dependence on upward accountability to central government and represent real progress in the exist local council and mayoral scrutiny arrangement if the government do support the principle of local public account committee the bill should provide timescale for their implementation we liberal democrats support the aim of the bill but it clearly fall short of real devolution what we have be bill that misunderstand the whole point of devolution namely decision making from the bottom up not the top down really welcome this pivotal bill when be deputy leader of southampton city council see at first hand how local decision make by local people be transformative for the community but also see over long year of conservative government how we be hold back by broken system that turn council into supplicant in constant competition with our neighbour force to put our begging bowl out for crumb from whitehall table that end with this bill and really welcome the change that it represent and the measure it contain also welcome the fact that southampton along with other council in hampshire and the isle of wight be part of the devolution priority programme allow we to take advantage of these power from next may the political benefit be clear and the promise in our manifesto be be deliver but the process matter so we have to get this right what be interested in be how these power improve the life chance of my constituent my message to all council leader include in southampton be that we must be clear about what we want to do with these power note that the conservative police and crime commissioner who be now run to be mayor of hampshire have say that her big priority be close hotel for asylum seeker and stop house be build to avoid upset tory district council that be certainly vision but it be disappointingly narrow than what this moment require for there be three basic test that regional devolution must meet to make this worth it first it improve employment and skill prospect particularly for those most marginalise from the labour market secondly it progress investment in and integration of our transport network specifically low pollute public transport that be well connected and affordable and thirdly it galvanise house building so that work people can afford to live and work locally that be especially vital in the south where housing demand be acute and nimby tory and lib dem lead council be fail to deliver for local people as an aside also welcome the return to the more representative supplementary vote system appreciate that local government reorganisation be separate process but in hampshire our local leader be be ask to endorse new council area alongside mayoral authority support the proposal back by out of the council in hampshire run by all party to establish five unitary authority across the area and have sign joint letter to support that urge ministers to not simply take the easy option and stitch together pre exist organisation as someone who also represent constituency in hampshire agree with my hon friend in term of the letter we have send would it not make more sense for boundary change to be part of the process as oppose to an add on at the end thank my hon friend and near neighbour for make that point absolutely boundary change must be look at sympathetically by ministers hope to get that reassurance in their comment because what we stand to gain in the short term from quick and easy decision we will lose in the long term if council find themselves saddle with nonsensical boundary have two other quick request the first of which be on mayoral council give mayoral council statutory footing would provide powerful forum for central government to meet devolved government and iron out policy issue secondly will the minister set out the government ambition and timescale for local public account committee lot of colleague have talk about restore trust in politic and think that openness in particular on public money can be deliver in that way in closing there be lot to be excited about in the bill be pleased to see this labour government fulfil another manifesto commitment and bring real change for our community have cut my six minute speech down to three be supporter of devolution and devolve power community empowerment and local decision making in my seat we have combine authority and as mention early the benefit bring by the west yorkshire mayor in transport with new bus station and in crime and policing however my community even after be part of the combine authority for so long be still not clear on where exactly the responsibility of the council stop and those of the mayor start or how they work together therefore stand here with some deep concern instead of empower community the bill risk recentralise power and bypass local ward councillor and local actor who truly represent our diverse community in kirklees we have cabinet system eight councillor none of whom be from dewsbury and batley make major decision that have an impact on every single resident and constituent in my constituency move to mandated cabinet system across the country be short sighted undemocratic biased and discriminatory the bill design place sweep strategic power in the hand of elect mayor and their appoint commissioner who be often unelecte that be not genuine devolution it be deception dress up as localism the second issue be lack of funding and financial transparency core fail of the bill lie in its fiscal ambiguity there be little detail on sustainable funding strategic authority may depend heavily on mayoral precept levy or council contribution risk instability and underfunde local service on transparency while the creation of local audit office be welcome this reactive measure attempt to patch break audit system where hundred of authority still face unaudited account without address underlie systemic weakness such as wasteful procurement practice lack of transparency and unequal distribution of spend across ward community voice be too often marginalise the bill do not prevent council from let vital community building be deliberately leave in disrepair then decide to close the building because they do not have the fund to repair or run they in conclusion this bill be not devolution it be shift of power from local council to centrally influence mayor with an opaque financial model and tokenistic community tool the bill must be update to restore genuine local leadership to guarantee long term transparent funding to ensure that procurement and audit practice remain accountable and community informed and to embed real neighbourhood level governance with proper funding and citizen engagement planning and influence english devolution be mess it be postcode patchwork of opaque system vary power and unclear line of accountability that be not just an historical failure but profoundly dangerous because when the public can not navigate their democracy or do not know who hold the pen on planning transport housing or skill they understandably disengage accountability be lose and in that vacuum politician can get away with anything will give the house one clear example in hartlepool the tees valley mayor have impose mayoral development corporation with very little consultation certainly not with the public planning power be strip from the council for large area of the town supposedly to be exercise by an appoint board we fight hard to secure some form of democratic representation on that board yet of its member only four hold elect office and only one be there because they have elect office in any event the mayor quickly outsource the majority of those power to private company in manchester so people who have never walk our street be now make the majority of the decision shape they do my hon friend agree that mayoral development corporation need to be bring under the remit of the new local audit office that be propose in the bill place the power to audit they beyond reasonable doubt agree that far great power be require to hold mayoral development corporation to account and that may be one way of do it the change be not just about plan power publicly own asset be be transfer from the council and other public body when labour councillor demand that those asset which include hartlepool civic centre would be return to public ownership if they be not develop or if the corporation be wind up that demand be refuse when we ask whether the council could resist this change the advice be stark we could not there be no veto and it could not be stop by the council when the council vote against mayoral development corporation just down the road in middlesbrough it be impose on the town anyway let be clear that be not oppose to the principle of development corporation be willing to support the one in hartlepool in the spirit of cross party co operation but the outcome have become confused with zero accountability and resident leave unclear about who to turn to especially as more and more house in multiple occupation pop up across our town centre put there by an unelected unaccountable company this be not power in the hand of the people devolution be suppose to mean decision make close to community but too often the reality be the opposite power hoard and push far away from the very neighbourhood that be suppose to be empower that be why support the we right here campaign which ask that power do not stop at the mayor office but flow to the people themselves it be champion by hartlepool own community leader sacha bedding it be way forward and hope that minister be listen we must ensure that there be accountability for mayor they can be the vehicle for deliver for the public but the power itself can lie only in one place with the people that bring we to the front bench spokespeople call david simmonds it have be wide range debate particularly thank my right hon friend the member for aldridge brownhills wendy morton and my hon friend the members for bromley and biggin hill peter fortune for isle of wight east joe robertson for reigate rebecca paul for romford andrew rosindell for bromsgrove bradley thomas for broxbourne lewis cocking for keighley and ilkley robbie moore and for west suffolk nick timothy for their contribution the range of issue that they and other member cover starkly highlight the wholesale inadequacy of the bill in relation to the scale of the challenge that our country and our community face there be big issue face local government which deal with some of the most difficult task face by any of our public service we know that the cost of social care be rapidly grow and will consume great share of the available resource since this government take office there have be collapse in the delivery of new housing it be down in the country as whole and there have be drop by large social landlord under mayor khan here in london as we have see in the news today the government chum in the union have vote to extend their strike until march the people of our second city be leave with their waste uncollected and population of rat as an mp for constituency neighbour birmingham see all too often the impact of the strike do my hon friend agree that this issue be absolutely shocking the one thing that resident expect from their local council be regular collection of their household waste and often garden waste and recycling as well birmingham city council be fail the resident thank my right hon friend for highlight that issue she have be champion for the voice of those affect by it while understand that minister have come to the dispatch box time and again and say that they must wash their hand of it the union say in their statement today that there be no point negotiate with the council because it lack the authority to resolve the issue the government need to roll up their sleeve and get involve while our second city struggle with these challenge here we have piece of legislation about tinker with structure not only that but as we learn just week ago it be an entirely uncoste plan the department have not undertake any assessment of the cost benefit of the measure contain in this legislation that come against the backdrop of the decision of this government which as we know be make the financial situation of our country more perilous by the day in the first few month of this financial year alone the government borrow billion more than they raise in taxis borrowing cost have hit year high level see only in the early day of the last labour government in this bill open the door to host of tax raise power as we go through the page and page of new power for ministers and the secretary of state to direct local authority in one way or another and to instruct community to accept this or that we see the prospect of local authority which be already leave net billion bad off by the government rise in national insurance contribution face the maxing out of parking charge huge increase in borrowing and big rise in business rate and council tax the billion black hole that this government have create just in this financial year will need to be bridge somehow the chancellor will be back to tell we how in few week or month time but think we can see clue already that local community and local authority will be the route by which those cost be raise when we read what this bill have to say about neighbourhood governance the threat be very clear even at parish council level those parish the small unit of local government but one with precepte power will be one of the local kitty that the government expect to raid to finance the consequence of their economic mismanagement when we think of sir humphrey famous advice that it be always good to dispose of the difficult bit in the title of the bill because it do lot less harm there than in the text we can see that when this bill talk about devolution it devolve to the local level the responsibility for those tax rise and service cut can the minister tell the house how many library will close to pay for this bill how many road project will be set aside how many more community such as those refer to by the labour leader of shrewsbury will lose their regular recycling and bin collection to pay for it how high will council tax go what be the limit that ministers will set on the tax rise that the bill will drive what be the maximum parking charge or fine that minister think it be reasonable for council to have what level of cost will local business have to face when we debate the bill on business rate that sit behind many of the financial element of this bill ministers say that they want to tax amazon but they end up tax our local high street store and our pub on average local pub alone have to pay extra year and that be before the billion that this government have borrow in the last few month be go to finish with direct plea to the minister for whom have great deal of respect he lead his party in local government he be its champion and for many year he be local councillor too earn huge degree of respect in this house and in that wide family as result of the work he do at the government favour population level for new unitary authority this bill abolish of all the councillor in england shire at the stroke of bureaucrat pen that be of the voice of those local community people such as chris whitbread who stand up for his community against this government over the bell hotel in epping these people have be the voice of their community on migrant hotel on protect their green belt and on air quality they be the people who stand up for their local community on issue such as the grooming gang which we hear so much about early from the under secretary of state for the home department the hon member for birmingham yardley jess phillips this bill could have be transformational chance to step up that voice of local community be sorry that the minister lose his battle to let those community keep their voice but he still have time to change course to support our reason amendment start again and build cross party consensus on the future of local government let this not be the funeral oration for local democracy in england thank hon member from across the house for their contribution to today important debate the sheer number of member who want to speak demonstrate how important these issue be and the passion and enthusiasm show by member of this house make absolutely clear their care for their community as well as their desire to see local economy thrive and for the benefit of growth to be feel by every community across the country this bill represent generational shift in power that will see community empowerment enshrine in law and local leader and mayor with skin in the game trust to get on and do the job they have be elect to do in new relationship of equal with central government one build on share commitment to people and place mutual respect and co operation the english devolution and community empowerment bill do exactly what its title say it effect top to bottom redistribution of power in this country put decision making in the hand of our region town city and community and deliver real change for work people in the place they call home bring growth and opportunity and empower local leader and our mayor to make the right decision alongside their local community as my right hon friend the deputy prime minister say at the start of the debate this be landmark bill that will help we build modern state base on fair strong partnership between central and local government for too long power and opportunity have be centralise in westminster and whitehall hold back growth across the country and deny million of people the opportunity to realise the potential they have within they our new approach to devolution and empowerment begin the work of fix that power up our region through devolution by default and the right to request as well as new power resource and freedom and introduce measure to fix local government and its fragile audit regime through sustainable structure and governance it also give real power to community through the community right to buy local asset root in our high street neighbourhood and sporting ground and it give they great say in local issue with frontline ward councillor give the respect power and tool they need to make difference in their community through neighbourhood work arrangement in every council across the country when we say this be top to bottom transfer of power we mean it before turn to the main issue raise in the debate will first address the reason amendment table by the right hon member for braintree sir james cleverly and also maybe touch on some of the point make by the shadow minister the hon member for ruislip northwood and pinner david simmonds anybody would think that the conservatives have not be in government for year absolutely smash local government to the core anybody would believe that council be not fall over like domino go bust on their watch and that the fragmented deal by deal backroom negotiate devolution we have have so far do not take place on their watch over year let we forget the past though and look to the future the reasoned amendment raise concern about local government reorganisation which as we have hear from member across the house be big and important issue it also talk about housing delivery and claim that the bill mean high bill for local resident can assure the house that those concern be misplace and frankly the opposition know that first the bill will not affect the process for the area already undergo reorganisation those area have respond to their invitation to reorganise already they have no choice they absolutely have choice it be an invitation that county have respond to demonstrate without doubt that the appetite and interest for reorganisation be there within community and they respond in that way this process will deliver strong sustainable unitarie capable of lead their community shape neighbourhood and convene local public service to deliver well outcome for local resident this process be separate from the bill in fact the devolution priority programme area of local government reorganisation will be submit their final proposal to government on september all other area will submit their final proposal on november before this bill even get out of committee local government reorganisation will have final proposal for the county in the two tier area the idea that the bill be bring an end to the two tier system be for the bird by the time it reach royal assent the work will have be do and the consultation will be take place and well under way the opposition know that of course because they use exactly the same process of reorganisation so many time when they be in government to reduce the number of councillor reduce the number of council and end the two tier system in county across the country to the opposition credit end the two tier system be proven model because once local government reorganisation have take place in an area by the way have not hear anybody call realistically for return to the old system saving can be make there be world of difference between those and the saving that government will take as central government be make no saving from local council that change give the freedom to move money up and down that two tier system to where the real pressure be be face adult social care and send in particular if we do not take action after year of inaction the system will fall over and we will not allow it to fall over on our watch however bad the inheritance might have be the opposition know all that because they lay the groundwork and be the architect of the current system this bill also give ambitious planning power for mayor to unlock housing and infrastructure work alongside parliamentarian and local councillor with power to intervene in major strategic planning application and to grant mayoral development order will the minister give way be afraid that with the time we have need to canter through the bill also allow mayoral development corporation to be establish and for mayoral community infrastructure levy to be charge so that we can unlock much need housing and infrastructure to get britain building once again thirdly the opposition claim that this bill introduce new precept and will raise bill for work people remind they that the mayoral precept have be in law since in fact it be conservative government who bring it into law give all mayor the power to introduce precept so we will not take lecture from they on those power will say this because believe in devolution pound for pound local people through their local council their local mayor and their combined authority see the benefit of that investment in real way in their neighbourhood their community and their town for large part of government spending for different reason they do not get that in tangible way the accountability that then come alongside it be important finally the reason amendment table by the conservatives claim that this bill fail to empower local people as the house have hear that be far from the case this be generational change move power away from whitehall with the tool need at local level to get thing go through community right to buy neighbourhood governance and all the thing that be be ask for we urge all colleague to vote against the reason amendment in few moment this bill see the system of devolution move away from an ad hoc inconsistent and deal by deal model replace it with model that be clear about what place can access when they can access it and under what condition our new system confer function on class of strategic authority to allow we to deliver our commitment for devolution by default and to streamline those function so that all part of england can be clear about what power they can access member have raise the supplementary vote number of time the government have no plan to change the electoral system for the uk parliament or for local council election in england the government believe that while the first past the post system have its place the sv system be the right thing to do for those executive position where an individual hold that executive power and the mandate from local people be important that have be raise number of time and hope that put that to bed on local authority this government have be clear that we will fix the foundation of local government and create system that be fit legal and decent change to governance arrangement be one way that we be simplify local government alongside our intention to strengthen the role of frontline ward councillor this will provide the tool that will make it possible to act on the local issue that people believe be important by abolish the committee system we will simplify local authority governance arrangement and ensure that all council operate an executive form of governance have hear the representation from sheffield members and other and meeting will take place to discuss that far but abolish the committee system will provide clarity and accountability for local people and importantly will strengthen that direct line of democratic accountability we have accept the continuation of the legacy directly elect council mayor while introduce measure to prevent the creation of any new one the subject of neighbourhood governance have also be raise the bill set out clear ambition for all local authority to hardwire community engagement and neighbourhood work into their governance do of course hear the call on behalf of town and parish council and share member commitment to that local level but if all we have be town and parish council operate at local level and no neighbourhood governance in the principal council we will miss the opportunity to hardwire localism in everything that council do we believe that we must have that hardwiring so that local people feel genuinely empower that be the only difference however this be completely compatible with town and parish council work in partnership when that be effective they work in unison for the benefit of the local community which be what we want to see from now on significant amount of attention have rightly be pay to the subject of asset of community value as we have all see community space such as pub cultural venue and place of worship be the life of our community they bring people together foster sense of community pride and support local economy however year of the previous government see total dismantling of that social infrastructure people will be far too familiar with the sight of high street be board up one by one and with community centre be sell off library be lose and park be forget place that once define locality have be strip away by lose year too many of those critical asset be be lose which be lead to soulless high street and less vibrant local community that be not because of lack of will in local community it be because they do not have the tool and the power to protect those asset and take they on with the bill we be start the work to build back strong community which be due in no small part to the significant campaigning of the co operative movement and the mps here in the house who have make the case clearly that in the end ownership matter we will give community the tool and the real power to take on the asset that they love because that be the right thing to do on all these issue the previous government could have do far more but what do we hear over the course of today debate we hear opposition member say you be go too far it be power grab and in the same breath you be not go far enough and you could have do more the truth be that this be generational shift in power which will see break up of the stranglehold that westminster and whitehall have retain for far too long against community across the country this will be do with local community not to they and indeed that be what have happen so far whether we be talk about our approach to fair funding and repair the foundation our approach to local government reorganisation or even our approach to devolution this have all be do in genuine partnership with local leader who be work together what find so astonishing and there be night and day difference here be the almost soulless response from opposition front benchers who decry all these measure omit to say that their own local councillor be lead the charge at local level the leadership that have be show even by conservative council leader put those opposition front benchers to shame do not know how many visit they make around the country but can not imagine that their local representative value the interpretation that have be present from the conservative front bench whether it be about election devolution or reorganisation we be not ask conservatives members to be as good as the government but we be ask they to be at least as good as their own councillor and to stand with they instead of stand against they urge all member to support this landmark bill question put

gp practice in burton dorset it be pleasure to be able to present this petition which have be organise by mr and mrs mackenzie cook of burton in christchurch who along with thousand of other local resident have be campaign for the reopening of burton only gp surgery which prior to its closure in august last year have serve the people of burton for over year with local encouragement another gp practice buy the premise early this year and everyone assume that its application to reopen the branch surgery would be formality but in april dorset integrate care board reject that application and we now need the government to overrule the unelected icb and show everyone that they be be genuine at the general election when they promise to increase access to gp service rather than to reduce it the petition state the petition of resident of the village of burton in the constituency of christchurch declare that the petitioner and other resident of the village of burton in the constituency of christchurch have the benefit of local accessible gp practice on burton green for over year prior to its closure in august be delighted that early this year south coast medical acquire the premise for the purpose of open new branch of the grove practice follow welcome refusal by the local planning authority to permit change of use on the ground of loss of community benefit and be outraged that the dorset integrated care board have since refuse permission for the re opening of the surgery the petitioner therefore request that the house of commons urge the government to overrule the dorset integrated care board decision to refuse permission for the re opening of gp surgery in burton which ignore inter alia the need and wish of the people of burton and the fact that new housing already in receipt of planning permission will generate demand from an additional patient for local gp service and the petitioner remain etc solar development newark motion make and question propose that this house do now mather madam deputy speaker can begin by thank you and through you mr speaker for grant this adjournment debate it be unusual to allocate adjournment debate to member of the shadow cabinet but want to raise this important matter on behalf of my constituent have write to the secretary of state for energy security and net zero on number of occasion ask he to meet but he decline to do so want to speak about the three propose solar farm in my constituency the one earth project the great north road solar farm and the steeple renewable scheme take together these project would be of continental scale between they they would cover at least acre of land make they collectively the large solar installation in europe to put that in perspective my constituency be large and rural one that stretch nearly mile from north to south and at least of its entire land mass would be turn into single industrial complex an industrial farm of black glass metal fencing substation and inevitably vast battery storage plant this be not just about newark across the trent valley in nottinghamshire and lincolnshire the cumulative impact be immense in my constituency the figure be in the constituency of my hon friend the member for sleaford and north hykeham dr johnson it be and in the constituency of my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh it be this be not scattering of panel across this part of the county it be the concentration of vast burden on one small corner of england countryside will the right hon gentleman give way call jim shannon to intervene on large scale solar development in the newark constituency this be not just about newark it affect its neighbour as well it be an issue across the whole of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland and these large scale plan will definitely affect we all understand the need for renewable energy but our farmer and their need and the food security of this nation must come first do the right hon gentleman agree that when it come to ensure that we have food security the same rule must apply across the whole of the united kingdom on side note see that he have be active in put flag up have some year experience of put flag up and would be happy to help he the hon member be always welcome to come up ladder with in newark perhaps will pay he visit as well to fix some union flag the hon member be right to say that these project affect constituency the length and breadth of the united kingdom many of they all three project be raise today be treat as nationally significant infrastructure project that mean the final decision will land not with local community or district or county council but squarely on the desk of ministers in whitehall it be right that debate like this occur and elect member such as myself have the opportunity to raise the argument with ministers before they ultimately make these crucial decision let make one point crystal clear at the outset this be not about nimbyism when be housing secretary hear member of this house begin speech with those word time and again and my heart use to sink because invariably they would go on to make an argument that be at its heart nimbyism however do not recall ever in my year in parliament raise in this house campaign against housing development in my constituency not once newark have accept thousand of new home and new estate and have support those development we have also accept our share of energy project we host small scale solar farm which have not object to we host battery storage facility and have absorb significant disruption from new and potentially exciting energy project such as the west burton fusion project on the site of former coal fire power station this be not constituency that resist change it be not part of the country that be immune to energy project the entire history of north nottinghamshire have be one of energy generation it be in the blood of my constituent my constituent be pragmatic reasonable and patriotic people who want to share part of the nation burden in meet its energy need as they have do for generation but what be be propose now be on an extraordinary scale it be disproportionate and damaging and it can not be justify this have become david and goliath struggle on one side be small village sometimes not even parish council but parish meeting and hamlet where neighbour have have to mobilise and join force to get their view hear on the other side be international company with deep pocket slick pr machine and army of consultant pay tribute here in the house to those parish council parish meeting and campaign group who have fight with such courage and determination they have have to master planning law pore over technical survey and produce community response all with minimal resource contrast that with the developer have find they at time aggressive loose with the fact and willing to submit survey that be frankly absurd so it be david and goliath situation why be we oppose this development first have never know an issue to arouse such opposition in my constituency survey resident and say no the community be speak with one voice and let say why first these solar panel be present as clean and green but as we all know in this house the reality be murky most panel sell in the uk contain material source in china often from region such as xinjiang where there be compelling evidence of force labour britain should take lead against exploitation not collude with it in our supply chain secondly there be danger from flooding and fire these project inevitably require vast battery storage installation around the world we have see that those battery can ignite and that catastrophic fire can occur sometimes release toxic smoke that be challenge to extinguish several such fire have already occur here in britain as they have abroad in the flood prone trent valley the risk be great put panel substation and battery in area liable to flooding present serious danger to life and property thirdly even if one support solar it should be put on rooftop and brownfield land first across britain there be acre of south face industrial rooftop warehouse supermarket car park yet they stand largely empty why be we sacrifice our fine farmland when those space be still unused community in newark be affect like community on ynys môn productive land on ynys môn create good agricultural outcome and mean good rural economy productivity on ynys môn be below the welsh average and build new large scale solar will have an impact on that do the right hon member agree that the government should reject project such as maen hir and undertake economic impact assessment on such development to safeguard rural economy the hon lady make an important point we should think about the impact on rural community large project such as those that be speak about will have profound impact on rural community to go back to the point be make why be we not use every incentive possible to ensure that such project be place on warehouse or factory rather than on beautiful and important countryside it make no sense fourthly let address the impact on the countryside itself these be some of the fine landscape in nottinghamshire and lincolnshire they will be scarred for generation some family will find solar farm just metre from their garden imagine walk the dog not along hedgerow but between two metre high metal fence bristling with cctv camera imagine go for run flank for mile not by roll british countryside but by metre high wall of black glass that be not the rural england that my constituent cherish fifthly there will be massive impact on rural life believe in house building but if we encircle village with solar farm we will make it nigh on impossible to have organic housing growth in those village in the year to come at time when our country need new house in rural community know that there be rule about shadow ministers speak in adjournment debate but with your permission madam deputy speaker would like to make an intervention my right hon friend have make an important point about the impact on the local economy and the option of farming and new housing if of the land area of newark be be cover in one thing that limit lot of other opportunity do he feel that the government have get the right balance in their push for net zero my hon friend make an important point the answer be no if we want to pursue net zero even with the zealotry of some in the government we have to strike balance it be not be pursue in proportionate and sensible way it be alienate people thousand of people in my constituency many of whom feel passionately about this issue but do not want to see their countryside destroy and their quality of life ruin my constituency have similar situation to the one the right hon gentleman be describe the village of scotton which be home to the house where guy fawkes grow up risk be encircle by similar sort of development people on the ground be pragmatic but the issue come down to planning rule and law it be simply not pragmatic or possible to get emergency vehicle or heavy good vehicle through those community do he agree that there need to be more common sense approach to tackle these issue in rural community certainly do the hon gentleman make an important point imagine the disruption even just for couple of year of construct acre of solar farm in small rural area with country lane it will be absolutely immense sixthly on food security the land that be speak about be not scrubland but some of the good and most versatile farmland in england to take it out of production for year be reckless report for the welsh government find that solar farm risk cause soil compaction and permanent damage reduce yield long after the panel be go in nottinghamshire and lincolnshire of solar installation already sit on our good farmland developer soil test conveniently downgrade land quality but those be survey they commission themselves once farmland be lose we become dependent on import which be often produce to low standard with great carbon cost and from country where we have no control that undermine not just food security but national security it be pleasure to come in on the side of david versus goliath be my right hon friend aware that the acre be propose in his constituency could be replace by acre of float solar on the reservoir of this country in my constituency have acre of raise reservoir they be all close site we can not see the top of they they be twice as efficient as land base system and they reduce evaporation by would that not be well way of strike balance than plaster they all over newark my hon friend make very good point and know he have speak about this before let we do exactly that let we have float solar panel if there be the appetite for they let we have solar panel on our factory and warehouse above our multi storey car park and on home frankly but let we not destroy the countryside for generation or more should note my entry in the register of members financial interests as landowner and should also acknowledge that the right hon gentleman be my member of parliament will make helpful contribution in moment but wonder what his view be on landowner choice in this one of the solar application he be reference be from single landowner who have make the choice to put the land forward for this purpose because he live long way away how do that fit into the argument he be make as presumably free market economist be not clear from the hon gentleman comment whether he support or oppose the vast number of solar farm be build in nottinghamshire of course it be free market in which landowner can choose to do as they wish personally would not do it because care more about food security and the countryside and would hope to be more concerned for my neighbour than some of these large landowner be but what be drive this be the economic of it the economic be set by government policy and the government have the ability to change the economic and change the planning rule so that this become difficult if not impossible will my right hon friend give way will briefly and then should conclude one way of deal with that would be for the government to prohibit the import of solar panel and insist that as condition of such solar farm panel must be produce within the united kingdom would that not be sensible policy my hon friend make very good point indeed the suggestion we have hear over generation that green job will come to the uk have turn out to largely be mirage because so much green technology be in fact produce overseas solar panel be almost exclusively make overseas often in china and that be grave mistake let close by make two final point the first be on the cumulative impact as say in my opening remark this be not about small solar farm of or acre this be about almost of the entire land mass of my constituency be cover in solar panel if these application be nod through by the secretary of state more will follow where do this end will we have situation in five or year where or third of the countryside in my constituency be cover in solar panel that do not seem in any way impossible to enough be enough and my constituent be sick to death of it we have to ensure that their concern be hear and the cumulative effect be take into account this matter not just to my constituent it matter to the country because the loss of food security in place like nottinghamshire or lincolnshire will affect all of we let give an example the three newark project cover acre amount to land that could support more than sheep or produce million loaf of bread or million weetabix that be food production on massive scale that we can not afford to sacrifice every solar farm will beget more new substation lead to more application then come the battery storage plant and soon the cumulative effect be devastating that be why my constituent oppose the three scheme with such passion that be why be in the chamber this evening to ask the minister to give the application due consideration when they land on her desk or that of the secretary of state in time appreciate that she may be limit in what she can say because of the planning process but in due course ask she to put herself in the shoe of my constituent to think how she would feel if metre solar panel be build next to her house or if the village that she love be ruin and how she feel about the future of our country if our food security be to be sacrifice in this way congratulate the right hon member for newark robert jenrick on secure debate on this important issue on behalf of his constituent as he have acknowledge be limited in what can say about specific project within the planning system but before move on to address some of the detail that he have mention in his speech will explain why solar be so important to our energy security to low bill and for climate action more than three year on from russia invasion of ukraine our energy system remain at the mercy of price fluctuation on the international fossil fuel market wholesale gas price remain high than before putin invasion of ukraine the simple fact be that the only way to get energy bill down for good be to reduce our dependence on fossil fuel that be why one of the government guide mission be to achieve clean power by solar as the cheap and most easily deployable renewable energy source be right at the heart of that mission our clean power action plan publish last december set out that gw to gw of solar power be require by up from about gw at present thankfully our vastly experienced uk solar sector stand ready to deploy at pace and at scale one of the first thing that we do on get into government last year be to consent to several major solar project that have be stick in the in tray solar be overwhelmingly popular with the british public our recent public attitude survey find that solar energy be support by of the public that figure have never drop below agree with the right hon member for newark however that if we want to keep support for solar that high it must be roll out in way that provide community with say and with direct benefit if they host clean power project first that mean protect local community and ensure that only the right project get the green light from the planning system all project be subject to rigorous planning process in which the view and interest of local community be consider that include thing such as the potential impact on biodiversity the local economy visual amenity protect landscape and land use secondly it be essential that community feel involved in the decision making on project developer of project large than mw which qualify as nationally significant infrastructure must complete considerable community engagement before any decision be take remind the right hon gentleman that we be about to return control over great number of those project to local authority by double the threshold to mw that will come into force at the end of this year for project of all size however the level and quality of community engagement by developer be take into account by decision maker the right hon member for newark express concern about the use of agricultural land the planning guidance make it clear that whenever possible developer should utilise brownfield industrial contaminate or previously develop land where the development of agricultural land be show to be necessary low quality land should be prefer to high quality land but it be important that we do not overstate the amount of land that be use for solar development in the solar road map which be publish in june we set out our expectation that even in the most ambitious scenario only up to of uk land would be devote to solar significantly less as member may be aware than be currently cover by golf course will come on to the issue of clustering and concentration in moment the right hon gentleman mention food security we do not accept that there be trade off between solar deployment and food security in fact the chief climate adviser to the national farmers union state recently that there be no threat to national food security from solar the right hon gentleman mention biodiversity there be evidence that solar can improve biodiversity when it be instal on agricultural land he talk about sheep and mention sheep graze under solar panel under biodiversity net gain project small than mw be require to increase biodiversity by and we be investigate the possibility of extend bng to nationally significant project as well do not know if he have read the recent study by the royal society for the protection of birds and the university of cambridge that find that solar farm in east anglia have up to three time more bird than surround arable farmland when local community do their country great service as the right hon gentleman say by host solar farm it be important that they enjoy share of the benefit in recent work paper we propose that it should be mandatory for developer to provide community benefit fund the work paper include call for evidence seek view on facilitate share ownership and on whether the government should consider expand shared ownership and we be currently work to get that framework right have work in the energy industry be strong proponent of local area energy plan that would empower community to plan their energy need one of the big issue for constituent be that energy planning feel very reactive and be base on what landowner choose to do it would be far more empower to encourage community to look at the land within their local authority or big area and to proactively plan just as we do with housing will the minister consider think about how she can work with other departments to encourage local area energy plan to have statutory basis be pretty sure that my hon friend have raise that issue at energy security and net zero question before will remind the minister for energy my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks to engage far with he about that on clustering and come to the nub of the right hon gentleman speech some community feel that what they be be ask to host be excessive have few response to that issue first the planning system include provision to assess cumulative impact under such circumstance so that should be part of the process secondly we will be change the way that we allocate energy infrastructure around the country to date developer have be incentivise to build project where there be spare grid capacity and in industrial area such as the midland that be why there be that attraction and that can lead to clustering in the future we will take completely different approach to the one that we inherit from the right hon gentleman government we have commission the national energy system operator to create strategic spatial energy plan that will set out strategy for how new infrastructure should be spread across the country by invest in our electricity network and our grid we can ensure that the grid will go where the project be rather than the other way around wish have time to answer all the other point that the right hon gentleman raise about storage and safety but will be happy to do so in writing finally want to focus on what we be do to accelerate solar deployment on rooftop we will encourage the installation of solar on new build housing and on commercial building through new building standard the vast majority of new home build under these standard will have rooftop solar fit we have permit development right to allow most rooftop project to proceed without an application for planning permission and we have just conduct call for evidence about add solar canopy in car park great british energy be put solar on school and on nhs site to bring down bill and build more local clean power next month we will launch our ambitious warm home plan with billion available to support people with the upfront cost of instal green technology include rooftop solar insulation of home heat pump and so on we be unleash rooftop revolution because we think that rooftop be so important but the scale of the challenge face we to get to clean power by and to ramp up renewable mean that ground mount solar and float solar which the government also support have to be part of the plan to sum up we take the concern raise by the right hon gentleman very seriously we want to take people with we on our clean power mission which will work only if we do so we be put measure in place to get the planning process right to ensure that community benefit from host clean energy and to support the strategic spread of project across the country include in urban area through our rooftop revolution be glad that the british people agree with we that solar be vital part of our future energy mix but we be never complacent about retain that support be grateful to the right hon gentleman for give the opportunity to set out in brief at least our position and he will appreciate why we can not be too specific about some of the point he raise question put and agree to house adjourn
