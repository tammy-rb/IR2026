the minister raise the important issue of the cost of living give the dire economic impact of brexit include food inflation be eight time high than it would otherwise have be and the cost of leave the european union amount to million an hour in accord to datum from the office for national statistics do he agree with that it make total economic sense for the uk and the people in it to use next week summit to start discussion with the eu on what the process of rejoin might be and the timing for that many people may still be find thing little bit gloomy and challenging as result of the mess leave by the previous government as be after month of be member of parliament but today be incredibly heartened it be probably the happy day have spend in the house yet because we have real opportunity to be hopeful and positive about the future of this country the ideology and chaos that have cause so much damage with the conservative government run frit from the reform party have now give way to party that be pragmatic and have prove itself to be competent would love at this stage to congratulate the government on their tremendous securing of trade deal with india and the usa be look forward to the hat trick where we secure trade deal with the european union that be even big and well than either of those two and all in the british interest what be absolutely clear to everybody know this in the labour party and it run through everything the prime minister have say be that this country need growth over the last year service have be decimate every time the new government open cupboard we find it bare we have to rebuild our public service and the swift way to get growth in the economy be by have good trade deal with the european union nothing will guarantee swifter growth for the economy find it very hard to take anything that the conservatives say with any degree of seriousness what be their explanation for why after year public service be on their knee and we have see collapse in the economy we even hear conservative front bencher the hon member for brentwood and ongar alex burghart say that there have be growth since leave the european union despite brexit even the conservatives admit that it be disaster nothing will deliver the growth that this country need fast than sign good deal with the european union slash red tape and reduce regulation with the big market on our doorstep open up market kick start growth boost export and investment and reduce price at home this prize would be welcome by anyone who be not crazy ideologue we on the government side be not crazy ideologue or prisoner of our past or of television programme from the past the action that the conservatives take while in government have damage the british people business across the country and in chelsea and fulham want we to get good deal from the european union people in my constituency do not want we to rejoin the eu and be not talk about rejoin they would like we still to be in it and they think it have do they damage the importer of wine in my constituency who have to pay for every consignment he now bring in would like we still to be in the eu and to not have to face that but they do not want we to spend the next five year renegotiate the deal oh it be sarcasm as be say be very pleased as many be with the government for be cool headed and have common sense approach we be go to reset our relationship with the european union and put britain first put britain first have to also mean put our young people first so be excite by the opportunity for young people in my constituency and every constituency to take advantage of time limit control visa base youth system which we already have with dozen country can tell the right hon gentleman what people in chelsea and fulham really want they do not want prime minister like the last one business prime minister who say that we would level up to help people across the country but then do nothing about it what they want be prime minister who will invest in increase skill and apprenticeship right across the country as ours say yesterday that he will that be what we need and that be what we be get now
