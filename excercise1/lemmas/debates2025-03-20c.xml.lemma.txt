oral answers to questions environment food and rural affairs the secretary of state be ask fly tipping what step he be take to help tackle fly tipping what step he be take to tackle fly tipping what step he be take to tackle fly tipping what step he be take to tackle fly tipping what step he be take to tackle fly tipping happy spring equinox and happy world sparrow day to you mr speaker and to everyone in the house fly tipping blight community harm the environment and place huge cost on taxpayer and business council deal with over million incident in some more than in the previous year this government will crack down on fly tipping by establish clean up squad comprise of those very individual who dump rubbish in our community we be also tackle litter by introduce ban on single use vape from june this year and deposit return scheme for drink container rochdale council have remove tip this past year alone the equivalent of tonne of illegally dump waste every month at cost of to local taxpayer but my council tell that there be real failure in the court issue consistent and tough enough fine do the minister agree with that it be time to crack down hard on fly tipper put much tight regulation on waste carrier and treat the fly tipper like the criminal they be by crush their car and put point on their licence could not agree more with my hon hear enthusiasm for his comment from both side of the house rochdale council have an exemplary record on fly tipping with fix penalty notice and prosecution which be admirable last week the environment agency work with the north west regional organised crime unit to arrest two man in manchester for fraud and money laundering follow an extensive investigation into packaging export note use by law abide firm to export waste that be unlawfully sell for our message to the waste criminal be clear we be seek power in the crime and policing bill and we be go to track they down fly tipping be scourge on local community and drain on council resource be they rural council like central bedfordshire or town council like luton in my constituency most recent figure show that there be over fly tipping incident in luton alone in but do the minister agree that we need co ordinate approach between the department local authority and the police to deliver holistic strategy to tackle fly tipping it be clear that my hon friend be right luton have particular problem with fly tipping but the council have be do good work with fix penalty notice and prosecution the department for environment food and rural affairs chair the national fly tip prevention group and we work with wide range of interested party include council the environment agency the national farmers union and the national police chiefs council to disseminate good practice and urge luton to join we in that endeavour although city of wolverhampton council be to be congratulate on introduce range of initiative to tackle fly tipping include deploy drone raise the fine for fly tipping to and reward those who identify culprit with gift card fly tipping in my constituency of wolverhampton west cost wolverhampton taxpayer around year and involve some incident during do the minister agree that we need strong disincentive to discourage those who fly tip so that that can be redistribute to where it be really need be interested to hear about the work my hon friend council be do with drone we use cctv but there could be lesson for other council in our manifesto we commit to force fly tipper to clean up their mess we be seek power to issue statutory fly tip enforcement guidance so we have consistent and effective approach but it be clear that the waste carrier broker and dealer and the exemption permit regime be not fit for purpose have ask my official to look at everything we can do to strengthen both of those fly tipping be blight on our community but in stoke on trent our labour lead council have work tirelessly to turn thing around under the conservatives resident be wait for over month for waste to be remove but under the leadership of jane ashworth and amjid wazir that response time be now under one week however council can not tackle the issue alone so will the minister outline what more the government can do to support local council to clamp down on fly tipping get tough on those who blight our street and create clean green community for all it be interesting what difference change in council leadership make commend councillor ashworth and councillor wazir on their excellent work this government will introduce mandatory digital waste tracking from april and will update the house on progress in may if people want their street to be clean up the answer be clear vote labour fly tipping be real concern in my constituency of woking but understand that the previous government introduce new power that enable woking borough council and other local authority to strengthen their action against people who fly tip what impact have those measure have we have not assess the impact but can tell the hon gentleman the late statistic for his own council there be more than fly tipping incident but just three fix penalty notice and no prosecution local councillor be clearly make choice we know that the late statistic for fly tipping show rise of so it be clear that under the previous government this environmental crime be allow to spiral out of control encourage all council of whatever colour to make good use of their enforcement power alas the last government do not take up my suggestion that the offender be garrotte with their own intestine the first problem however be to catch they be there any way that local authority can be encourage to take advantage of the collapse in price and improvement in quality of internet connect camera think there would be some human right implication with the garrotting option but share the right hon gentleman passionate hatred for these environmental criminal he be representative of the beautiful new forest where have spend many happy holiday and it really upset to see fly tipping on ancient woodland run by the forestry commission these be precious and irreplaceable area we have not look at that part of his suggestion but be very happy to join force with he and make it cross party mission that we sort the mess out once and for all conservative run east sussex county council have introduce booking system for the local tip in eastbourne that will make it even more difficult for many people to get rid of their waste many local campaigner be concerned that it will result in increase fly tipping specifically in area such as upperton in my constituency and we have already see it in hartfield square and upperton gardens how might the minister be able to influence east sussex county council to turn on its unpopular decision and to keep our community clean and free from fly tipping all council have be give an uplift under this labour government so they have more money to be able to deal with the priority of their local community and encourage they to think about where that money be spend there be also really important equality issue here if people do not have access to the internet in east sussex due to blackspot they might not be able to digitally book in so would look at digital exclusion the people who be least able to afford the internet should not be force into deal with unscrupulous rogue we know that fly tipping be an expensive and dangerous nuisance local authority such as conservative lead walsall council be take really proactive and determined approach to tackle it but with bin strike on our doorstep under the neighbour labour lead birmingham city council we fear more fly tipping particularly in the community that border birmingham alarmingly we be hear of rat the size of cat in britain second city and these squeaky blinder be definitely not welcome in aldridge brownhills what specific support can the minister provide to neighbouring authority in these specific circumstance and what can she do to bring the bin strike to an end obviously birmingham city council bin situation be matter for the council but as neighbouring mp in coventry we have not see any of the fly tipping that the right hon lady talk about see in walsall both side need to get round the table and sort this out for the benefit of the people of birmingham sewage discharge reduction water company investment what recent discussion he have have with ofwat on encourage water company to increase investment in sewage discharge reduction measure my official and have regular conversation with ofwat and other regulator as the right hon gentleman will be aware last year water company discharge record level of sewage into our waterway which be why the water special measures act give the regulator tough new power include the ability to ban the payment of unfair bonus to pollute water boss the government have also secure record billion that will include improvement to more than storm overflow and significantly reduce sewage spill over the next five year wish you happy world sparrow day madam deputy speaker in bramley in my constituency in sewage be spill into the local river for hour in godalming the figure be hour in chiddingfold it be hour and in cranleigh it be hour that be the equivalent of nearly two hour every single day it be totally unacceptable as result last year after pressure from and other thames water agree to invest million by the end of next year will the secretary of state meet and the chief executive of thames water to see whether that money be actually be spend the situation that the right hon gentleman describe be absolutely outrageous and member across the house will recognise similar situation in their own area we need to completely reset the water sector so that these situation can not continue which be why sir jon cunliffe be lead water commission hope that the right hon gentleman and other member be take the opportunity to feed their experience and those of their constituent into his call for evidence and would be happy to arrange for the right hon gentleman to meet an appropriate minister to discuss his concern get so many people in north west leicestershire tell about the toxic sewage pour into their waterway such as in the brook near donington le heath will the secretary of state assure that unlike the previous government when he say that he will hold the water boss to account he mean it absolutely that be why we have pass and my hon friend will have vote for the water special measures act which give the regulator the power they need to hold those water boss to account so that instead of pay themselves multimillion pound bonus they do not deserve that money be spend where it should be spend on fix our break sewage system so that we can cut the sewage flow that be pollute our river up and down the country agricultural and business property reliefs what estimate he have make of the number of farmer affect by change to agricultural and business property relief around claim each year will be impact our reform will mean that farmer will pay reduce inheritance tax rate of rather than the standard and payment can be spread over year interest free farm own couple can pass on up to million without pay inheritance tax in our view this be fair and balanced approach and should be see against the backdrop of the government commit billion for farming over two year the large budget direct at sustainable food production and nature recovery in our country history be start to feel like defra ministers be purposefully ignore and devon farming community have give the secretary of state since early december to answer my letter and my invitation to meet with devon farming community in order to explain how change to agricultural property relief and business property relief be go to affect they at the last defra question call out the secretary of state for not reply to any of my request the minister for food farming and fishery reply from the dispatch box that would love to meet farmer in devon so be happy to add he to the list for my grand tour across the country to reassure people that there be strong plan to ensure that farmer have viable report february vol so far those platitude have go unrealised with less than month until these change take effect devon farmer be still in the dark about how the change be go to affect they if this be how minister treat fellow mps be it any wonder that farmer up and down the country feel completely abandon by this labour government hear the hon gentleman complaint but have be to devon in my role before and will come to devon again be always happy to meet farmer have spend quite lot of time at this dispatch box answer question from conservative members so perhaps few question will mean more time to go out and meet farmer call the shadow minister back in november the farming minister unbelievably say from the government dispatch box that it be strike how many people be come up to he at farming event and say you right to be make these change to apr and bpr conservative members have be out and about all over the country indeed be in staffordshire warwickshire and shropshire yesterday and have not find one farmer who think that he be right in fact the level of anger and sheer disbelief among our farming community be immense as this government attack on our farming cash flow continue through the dramatic reduction in delinked payment the sudden stop of the sustainable farming incentive and the rise in employer national insurance contribution could go on business confidence be at an all time low so can the minister provide the name of just one farmer he have speak to who think he and his government be right to be pursue these change suggest that the shadow minister go out and speak to few more people because be stop in local village just this weekend and encourage interruption be not go to name name but he should check with some of his conservative candidate in election they say keep on go you be do the right thing the situation be not as the shadow minister describe he might do well to look at the figure for project farm business income for this year which show that in many sector those business income be do rather well that probably explain why people be not as exercise about it as he call the liberal democrats spokesperson be the minister aware that some of the farmer who will be worst hit by the apr change be those who farm in severely disadvantaged area in the upland around our country where typically property value be high and income be extremely low when the change be make just last week with people be exclude from the sustainable farming incentive people have enter the sfi in this session and only of they be hill farmer be he also aware that his own department figure show that at the end of the transition the average hill farm income will be of the national minimum wage do he not understand that his change be bring harm to the poor farmer in the prettiest place such as mine will he undertake to look at the liberal democrat proposal to bring in an uplands reward so that we do not plunge into poverty those people who care for our precious landscape the hon gentleman always speak with passion about his constituent and absolutely understand those concern he be right to say that the scheme we inherit do not reward those area as well as they should that be why in our announcement few week ago we increase the high level stewardship payment by million which will be of particular advantage to people in his area agree with he and the scheme we inherit be not good enough that be why we be revise they flood defences hartlepool what step his department be take to improve flood defence in hartlepool after year the conservatives leave our flood defence asset in the bad condition on record that be why this government be invest record billion over two year to improve flood resilience we will build maintain and repair flood defence to well protect property by march the flood defence in and around greatham creek in my constituency of hartlepool date back to the century and be come to the end of their usable life be campaign to secure the funding we need to realise the environment agency ambitious multimillion pound plan to upgrade these defence and create new habitat that extend biodiversity in that area will the minister commit to deliver that funding for hartlepool thank my hon friend for raise this issue and for his recent letter he be right to be angry about the poor state of his flood defence and be sure his constituent value he as local champion raise that in the chamber to rebuild after conservative failure we have have to urgently move million into maintenance funding this year as have mention the project to receive funding in the next financial year be be agree and will be announce shortly under the previous government there be prior to strategy from westminster to address flooding and coastal erosion across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland all the region be able to benefit from that include my constituency of strangford where coastal erosion be massive thing take away some of the major road and thoroughfare will the minister consider renew that strategy and start it again look at all of the united kingdom as one job lot that would thereby help we all to get the benefit in address coastal erosion and the flooding that the hon member for hartlepool mr brash refer to thank the hon member for raise his concern about coastal erosion and he be right it be huge problem and with climate change it be only set to get bad completely recognise how it be impact coastal community his suggestion to bring together the different devolve government to discuss this issue be really interesting so let take that away rise the question have to relate to hartlepool flood defence call the chair of the environmental audit committee the people of chesterfield have great empathy with the people of hartlepool as we face exactly the same issue new report by public first show that each year of flood event cause decade long downward pressure on the economy worth up to billion be grateful that the minister will shortly visit we in chesterfield to see flood project and vulnerability but do she agree that there be acute need for project like the one we require on the river hipper and the one require in hartlepool it endanger the government growth mission if we be not able to get these project go think we all have empathy with hartlepool so encourage more people to ask question on this issue look forward to visit my hon friend constituency to find out more about the project he mention he be quite right to say this be an argument that hope we will all pursue ahead of the spring statement that tackle flooding be good value for money investment because it help to protect our economy and ensure that we can have growth call wera hobhouse who know be now anxious like people in hartlepool we in bath recognise that the conservative government leave our flood defence in poor state and we welcome the extra funding that the bath flood defence scheme have receive however we worry that it have come too late in lot of case be there timeline for when my bath constituent will actually see improvement thank the hon lady for raise this issue as say we be deliver record billon investment in building maintain and upgrade flood defence and that money will be spend over the next two year we will shortly announce some of the project that be go ahead in the next financial year and next year we will announce even more

and improve flood defence up and down our country flood prone community cumbria what step he be take to protect flood prone community in cumbria as may have already mention we be put in record billion investment to build maintain and improve flood defence up and down the country which show this government commitment to make sure that our community and our farmland be protect from flooding thank the minister for her answer community in cumbria have see many devastating flood over the last two decade but flood action group in keswick have work hard with united utilities to develop scheme that use thirlmere reservoir as storm water store help to prevent flooding in the town all agree that more could be do although applaud their work note that there be no statutory requirement for water company to use their asset as flood defence will the minister look at how water company asset can be use to prevent flooding across the country be grateful not only for the work that my hon friend action flood group do but for the work that flood action group do right across the whole of his constituency he raise an incredibly important and interesting issue in the sir john cunliffe review we be fundamentally look at the management of water right across entire catchment area when we think about water management we need to consider not only whether community have enough water to meet their need but whether they have protection from flooding and drought holistic way of deal with some of the challenge we face be certainly one of the answer go forward my hon friend have give great example and would be happy to explore it far with he call the shadow minister the conservative government protect over property from flooding introduce the million frequently flood allowance and commit to billion investment in flood protection however we know that the mental health impact of flooding remain long after the water subside rural community face unique challenge include outbreak of disease such as avian influenza and foot and mouth clear and worrying threat give the recent case in germany and hungary unfortunately this labour government be exacerbate such stress with their family farm tax and by scrap the farming resilience fund which support mental health can the minister confirm for the sake of mental health what support will be offer to rural community in place of the scrap fund that all start so well we nearly manage to get through the question with agree with the hon gentleman he be quite right about this issue which he have mention before be in complete agreement with he about the impact of flooding on mental health and know that we all take it seriously we be invest in mental health charity to support rural community but completely recognise the devastation that flood cause and be always happy to work with member from across the house on how we can support people mental health environment act deforestation due diligence if he will take step to implement the provision of the environment act on deforestation due diligence the big driver of deforestation worldwide be agricultural expansion particularly the production of small number of commodity such as soy and palm oil this government be consider the approach to the deforestation regulation and nothing have yet be rule in or out thank the minister for her answer tomorrow be the international day of forests the environment act be pass over three year ago with strong public and cross party support yet the due diligence provision to prevent the import of commodity link to illegal deforestation remain unimplemented cause uncertainty for uk business will the minister provide clear timeline for when the secondary legislation will come into force and will she meet as co chair of the all party parliamentary group on global deforestation alongside other member to discuss how we can strengthen and accelerate its implementation the uk strongly support global effort to protect forest and we be advocate for the international commitment to halt and reverse forest loss and land degradation by while at the same time support forest dweller and economic development as say nothing have yet be rule in or out and would be happy to meet my hon friend to discuss this far prioritise british produce public bodies what step he be take to encourage public body to prioritise the purchase of british produce the new national procurement policy statement set out requirement for government contract and favour high quality product that we believe british producer be very well place to supply this will support our ambition to ensure that half of the food supply for public sector catering come from local producer or those certify to high environmental standard welcome the minister commitment to ensure that of public procurement be of british produce give the significant billion of bargaining power that this represent what step be he take to ensure that this lead to fair price for farmer and support the fundamental operating profitability of the sector be grateful for the question from my hon friend we be absolutely determined to make the good of this opportunity not least because the previous government do not know how much we be actually buy the secretary of state have announce that we will monitor the food buy in the public sector and that will inform our policy of make sure that british farmer make the most of the opportunity for public procurement call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee the secretary of state in her speech to the oxford farming conference speak about the plan for change which be go to include commitment to public sector procurement but that be in january and we be now in march with the closure of the basic payment scheme and the ending of the sustainable farming incentive farm income be under real cash pressure in the here and now so when will we hear more detail about the very welcome commitment that the secretary of state make at the oxford farming conference in january as say in response to my hon friend the member for st austell and newquay noah law the first thing we need to do be establish how much we be actually buy and that be now in progress absolutely get the point about the urgency the question be why do this take the previous government so long when they share our ambition we be determined to make this happen community vulnerable to flooding what step he have take to help protect community that be vulnerable to flooding what step he have take to help protect community that be vulnerable to flooding repair and rebuild our flood defence be priority for this labour government and we be invest at record level to improve flood resilience well protect property by this time next year the environment agency allocate its budget to carry out work on flood defence on the basis of funding formula but that formula do not give sufficient weight to agricultural land will the minister undertake review of the formula so that agricultural land get the flood defence it need thank my hon friend for raise this important issue completely agree that the previous flooding formula do not work for rural community which be exactly why we be consult to change it the consultation will be announce shortly and encourage he and every member across the house to get involve in shape the formula so we can make sure it deliver the right outcome for everybody up and down our country first thank the minister for visit lilford in leigh after the devastating new year day flooding we have

discussion be the minister have with the insurance industry on improve how they support resident it be pleasure to see my hon friend and see how tirelessly she be champion and support her local constituent after such devastating flood concern around flood insurance have be raise so the flood resilience taskforce be set up an insurance sub group through which some of its member will deep dive into the challenge and opportunity for improvement on flood defence if she have any further evidence that she would like to look at it would be very helpful to receive it thames water financial viability what discussion he have have with thames water on its financial viability be of course have conversation can reassure the hon gentleman that the company remain stable and that the government be closely monitor the situation datum publish this week in the guardian reveal that more raw sewage be discharge by thames water last year than in the previous month thames water be rack up billion of pound of expensive extraordinary debt while continue to pump tonne of sewage into our river despite bold target and kind word there be simply no action on clean up our river what will the government do to improve thames water performance the government be take step to improve the performance of all water company include through the water special measures act which speak about early sir jon cunliffe be lead review of the entire sector so that we can reform regulation and if need be the regulator to ensure that they be fit for purpose topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility our river lake and sea be awash with pollution the public be rightly furious about leak pipe and sewage spill and we have not build new reservoir in this country for well over year after year of failure this government be turn the tide the water special measures act be create strong regulation to hold water company to account we have secure over billion of private sector investment the large such investment in the water sector in its history to upgrade our infrastructure last week the water minister my hon friend the member for kingston upon hull west and haltemprice emma hardy and tour the country from windermere to the wye from hampshire to yorkshire and from suffolk and northumbria to somerset to see where that investment will build new home create thousand of new job and boost local economy this be cornerstone of our plan for change thing can only get clean in february lucy manzano of the dover port health authority come before the environment food and rural affairs committee and warn that if funding be not confirm before the new financial year check at our border would stop with the new financial year fast approach and another case of foot and mouth in europe will the secretary of state confirm that the government have finally secure that funding or will we be more at risk in april we take border security extremely seriously that be why we have the btom border target operating model system which we be very closely monitoring to make sure it be do the work that it need to do and why we be invest money in the national biosecurity centre in weybridge to ensure it do not fall into dilapidation which be where it be head under the previous government the conservative party allow the river and lake in my constituency to be pollute with raw sewage while water bill rise and rise do the secretary of state agree with that as he just say after year of conservative neglect thing can only get clean my hon friend be absolutely right over the past year thing only get filthy this government will turn the tide thing will get clean thank to the investment this government be bring in call the shadow secretary of state welcome the secretary of state back to the chamber he have be in hiding for week we be so worried about he that we be go to start where wally competition the reason he have be in hiding be that he be duck scrutiny of his dreadful decision to stop the sustainable farming incentive farm payment scheme immediately without warn conservative members have be inundate with message from farmer say that business will not survive this late assault by the government how many farmer will be bankrupt as result of the sfi stoppage there be unfortunately record level of bankruptcy of farm business under the previous government in which the right hon lady be member of the cabinet under this government we have more money in the hand of more farmer through sfi than at any point under the previous conservative government this government understand that when budget have be fully allocate you stop spend the party of liz truss prefer instead to keep spending bankrupt the economy and send mortgage spiral that be not good for farmer for the economy or for anyone the secretary of state can not find his way around farmyard he be certainly not speak to farmer we conservatives know that if the government continue to tax tax tax business they will break his answer show why we have see cold fury in the countryside at his impotence in stand up to the chancellor on compulsory purchase order the massive cut to de link payment the stopping of capital grant and sfi and of course the family farm fax ahead of next week emergency budget and spending review and give that the guardian seem to know more than he do will the secretary of state guarantee that his government budget will not face far swingeing cut the problem face farming be that it become unprofitable because of the action of the previous government who undercut farm business in trade deal undercut farmer on welfare and environmental standard and raise barrier to export to the european market cause export to plunge by since which lead to record number of bankruptcy this government have plan for change that involve turn farming into profitable set of business include by back british business through public sector food procurement and rule out trade deal that undercut farmer in the way the previous government be happy to do declare an interest as the chair of the all party parliamentary group on cat the animal

emergent feline breeding practice can assure they that we be carefully consider the committee recommendation farmer in north norfolk be an incredible bunch who have show resilience through tough time and be still innovate and diversify but there be more tough time ahead what one thing do the secretary of state think my farmer should be do to secure their future in the face of so many challenge the

and other hospitality venue or some kind of easement to help the situation we be introduce the big set of change to the regulation in year we be look at the issue of dual use but the real prize with glass be of course to get to reuse system instead of recycling system have be in touch with the drink company to look at how we speed up the start of that labour lead nuneaton and bedworth borough

hand their hard work to ensure that crime be successfully prosecute and that perpetrator be put behind bar call the shadow solicitor general the independent review of the southport attack condemn the cps and police near silence follow the attack and establishe silence as catalyst for medium disinformation and public distrust it state that silence in the face of horrific event of major public interest be no long an option do the solicitor general accept that government secrecy fuel conspiracy theory and thus erode confidence in our justice system or be the independent king counsel wrong madam deputy speaker you will not be surprised to hear that completely reject the allegation of government secrecy certainly when it come to southport those murder be some of the most harrowing in our country history and it be absolutely right that due process be follow to allow for the successful conviction it be vital that justice be do in those case the shadow solicitor general will know that there be issue around contempt which the law commission be look at the law commission have agree to request from the home secretary to speed up that review and it be vital that we get the result of that review as soon as possible the independent review warn that government silence risk far more prejudice to any trial than transparency indeed as be often say the truth can be the good disinfectant will the solicitor general therefore agree to great transparency around major event in future and to implement jonathan hall recommendation on the provision of information to the public to ensure that that never happen again the shadow solicitor general refer to jonathan hall and the terrorism review terrorism be of course something that the government take extremely seriously jonathan hall review have now conclude and it be right that his report couple with the contempt review be consider in full by the home secretary as an important step in address all those question crown prosecution service

prosecution service to help ensure the effective functioning of the court this government unfortunately inherit record crown court backlog with the human impact feel most severely by victim lengthy delay be much too common and victim attrition much too high the lord chancellor have set out swift action to address that include by increase the number of crown court sit day and increase magistrate court sentence power to take pressure off the crown court the effective functioning of the court rely on sound and sensible sentencing guideline in just day such guideline will no long exist and two tier sentencing system will come into force on the solicitor general watch this be the fourth time that the issue have be raise by the opposition hope we will have more luck in secure direct answer from the solicitor general do she agree with the justice secretary that the guideline will bring in two tier sentencing system and can she confirm once and for all what be be do to stop those sentencing guideline from come into force remind the hon member that the conservative sentencing minister at the time write to the sentencing council make it clear that they welcome the new guidance equality before the law be core to the application of the rule of law in this country and foundational principle of our legal and judicial system be sure that colleague will welcome the fact that the lord chancellor meet the chair of the sentencing council last week and they have constructive discussion around the guideline justice delay be justice deny will the solicitor general confirm that the court backlog be rise rather than fall and can she explain why the lord chancellor have not maximise the number of sit day so that victim of rape and other serious crime do not have to wait unduly for their case to be hear the criticism would carry little more weight be it not for the fact that the conservatives spend the last year drive up the record court backlog the root cause of the backlog be direct result of the conservatives choice the previous government close over court building and the record court backlog now stand at case as we have say the human cost of those delay be considerable victim be wait year for justice the lord chancellor be take robust action she have increase the number of crown court sitting day increase magistrate court sentence power and ask sir brian leveson to lead an independent review of our criminal court to look at option for long term reform the previous government do not act they drive up the backlog this government be take action call the chair of the justice committee as the solicitor general say the lord chancellor have substantially increase sitting day the lack of judge be only one reason that court stand empty in the first nine month of crown court trial be render ineffective because the prosecutor fail to attend what discussion have the solicitor general have with the cps on improve prosecutor attendance so that crown court can sit close to judicial capacity my hon friend raise an important point the shortage of counsel be indeed problem and have contribute to the record crown court backlog the crown prosecution service be widen their panel include for rape and serious sexual offence counsel have have regular discussion with the chair of the bar council around its work to try to ensure that criminal practitioner continue to stay in that line of work be also conscious that ministry of justice colleague be very much committed to the sustainability of the bar and be have regular discussion the previous conservative government preside over justice system where of rape victim abandon their case primarily due to the delay in court proceeding this government have prioritise victim by allocate record number of sit day do the solicitor general agree that despite opposition members expression of outrage their government fail to tackle the backlog and deliver timely justice to victim my hon friend be absolutely

against that anglia ruskin university have campus in the heart of my chelmsford constituency its relatively new medical school be do fabulous work teach the doctor and medical professional of the future member of the workforce that we desperately need in our nhs it be do that in new way when visit aru just few week ago meet three of the apprentice take part in the only medical doctor apprenticeship of its kind in the country that apprenticeship be aim at get more young people from disadvantaged background into medicine and it be structure in such an innovative way that those apprentice will remain in their local area to complete their foundation training that mean that they will have familiar local support system around they as they progress it be an excellent programme and exactly what we need to recruit train and retain young medical professional but it be level apprenticeship and the government be scrap they as this be clearly moral issue for the prime minister

to the shadow leader of the house she be right that get young people into work be priority for the government and it be important for the country that we do so we need to reform the apprenticeship

in too many family of positive male role model for many young boy grow up we all ought to be concern about that we have real problem at the moment because we have not really debate the use of slave labour in product in the uk there be really interesting point here because in america right now company that have fail to interrogate their own supply chain be be sanction not know be not good enough many of they be actually in use in the uk include three in particular parent company donghai jaisolar technology be be use at the ministry of defence hongyuan green energy which have be sanction by the usa be in use over here and so be jiangsu micoe solar energy other company such as jinko solar and canadian solar be ever present and they be all essentially guilty of the use of slave labour can we have proper debate about how we can stop that as the americans have be do for some time surely we now need to sanction company that use slave labour to get cheap advantage as ever the right hon gentleman raise an issue that know he have long campaign on and its implication for the uk he be absolutely right to raise it we should not tolerate slave labour be use in any of the product on sale or be use in this country and we need to do more to expose and have transparency around that think that would make very good topic for debate but will certainly ensure that relevant minister update

other my hon friend be right that not only be tackle climate change important for the future of our climate but it be vital to provide the job of the future that we need in this country and the energy

aid block by israel finally flood into gaza path out of this horrendous conflict appear open it be therefore matter of deep regret that have to update the house today on breakdown of the ceasefire and yet more bloodshed in gaza on the night of march israel launch airstrike across gaza number of hamas figure be reportedly kill but it have be report that over palestinians be kill in missile strike and artillery barrage the majority of they be woman and child this appear to have be the deadly single day for palestinians since the war begin this be an appalling loss of life and we mourn the loss of every civilian yesterday morning un compound in gaza be hit can confirm to the house that british national be among the wounded our priority be support they and their family at this time gaza have be the most dangerous place in the world to be an aid worker and share the outrage of the un secretary general guterres at this incident the government call for transparent investigation and for those responsible to be hold to account the uk be work closely with partner such as france and germany to send clear message we strongly oppose israel resumption of hostility we urgently want to see return to ceasefire more bloodshed be in no one interest hamas must release all the hostage and negotiation must resume diplomacy be the one way to achieve security for both israelis and palestinians the house will know that the ceasefire in gaza have last for almost two month the result of dogged effort by egypt qatar and the united states the deal reach in january see the nightmare of captivity for hostage end and the body of eight further victim of hamas return to their love one we all remember the joy of see emily damari reunite with her mother and family desperately need aid begin to flow back into gaza food medicine fuel and tent child in gaza have respite from relentless fear the severely injure could cross the border again for treatment palestinians have begin to return to their home and to consider how to rebuild their life in the first day of the ceasefire the uk move swiftly to invest in the peace we release million in additional emergency humanitarian funding for the promise surge in aid we bring our total support this year for palestinians across the region to million we accelerate work on the pathway to reconstruction support our arab partner very welcome recent initiative we work at every level to support negotiation for permanent ceasefire and the return of every single hostage in back extension to phase one of the current deal but negotiation have be gridlocke for several week hamas have be resist call for the release of further hostage in return for long truce israeli force do not begin to withdraw from the philadelphi corridor as agree and on march the israeli government announce that they be block all further aid delivery until hamas agree to their term for week now supply of basic good and electricity have be block leave over half million civilian once again cut off from clean drinking water and spark surge in the price of some basic foodstuff boon to those criminal who use violence to control supply as tell the house on monday this be appalling and unacceptable ultimately of course these be matter for the court not government to determine but it be difficult to see how deny humanitarian assistance to civilian population can be compatible with international humanitarian law although it be important to say that could have be little clear in the house on monday our position remain that israel action in gaza be clear risk of breach international humanitarian law the consequence of the ceasefire breakdown be catastrophic for the family and friend of the remain hostage include avinatan or the agony go on hamas kidnapping of those people and treatment of they in captivity the cruel theatre of their release deprive they of food and basic right those be act of despicable cruelty hamas must release they all now palestinian

united nations flash appeal be fund not even enough to get through to the end of this month health centre have have to close even as the devastated gazan health service have to treat another surge of those wound in strike hamas can have no role in gaza future but collapse ceasefire will not bring the hostage home to their family an endless conflict will not bring long term security to israel and deepening war will only set back the course of regional normalisation and risk further instability shortly after the houthis resume their unacceptable threat to shipping in the red sea since the renew outbreak of hostility have speak to secretary rubio to eu high representative kallas and to un emergency co ordinator tom fletcher and will shortly speak to my israeli counterpart gideon and palestinian prime minister mustafa we and our partner need to persuade the party that this conflict can not be resolve by military mean we want israel and hamas to re engage with negotiation we continue to condemn hamas of course for their action on october their refusal to release the hostage and their ongoing threat to israel but we be also resolute in call on israel to abide by international law lift the unacceptable restriction on aid and demand the protection of civilian many month ago only week into office conclude that there be clear risk of israel breach international humanitarian law in gaza it be that risk which first set out in the house back in september that mean that the government suspend relevant export licence for item for use by the israel defence forces in military operation in gaza the action of last week only reinforce that conclusion in the day and week ahead we will redouble our effort to restore ceasefire but we will also continue to work with our partner on the security governance and reconstruction arrangement those issue be not go away there remain no military solution to this conflict two state solution remain the only path to just and last peace at this dispatch box in january call the ceasefire deal glimmer of light in the report january vol it feel like the darkness have return former british hostage emily damari say that the

this be difficult and fragile moment for the middle east but several basic truth remain unchanged include the urgent need to return to their love one the hostage capture by hamas terrorist during the atrocity of october that be vital for achieve sustainable end to this horrendous conflict the incredibly brave family of those hold hostage remain firmly in our thought and we should be very clear that the onus be squarely on hamas hamas could agree to release these hostage now and avert any escalation this be the moment for the uk government to show leadership with the international community and exert maximum pressure on hamas to release these hostage we should all fully understand who we be deal with here brutal iranian back terrorist organisation that seek the destruction of the world only jewish state use its own defenceless people as human shield and have ruthlessly eradicate fundamental freedom in gaza anyone who have read the shocking report from lord roberts on october commission by the all party parliamentary group on uk israel will have see the harrowing detail of the real life consequence of hamas total disdain for human dignity utter disregard for human life visceral antisemitism and murderous intention their organised brutality murder rape and torture indiscriminately target baby child woman and the elderly as the prime minister himself once say hamas bear responsibility be that still the prime minister and the government position it be abundantly clear that iranian back hamas can have no role in the future of gaza and we have raise this many time in the house what exactly be the british government do at this moment in time to bear down on hamas and work with partner to put an end to this brutal regime what assessment have the foreign secretary make of the capability of hamas and the ongoing threat that the terrorist pose to peace and stability in the region do the government support the us proposal for secure the release of hostage what be his vision of the next step do he believe that phase of the ceasefire remain within reach or be he consider alternative solution there be too much at stake for britain to be bystander we must be proactive player with involvement the foreign secretary mention his talk with france and germany but what discussion be he have with egypt and other regional partner we need israel to continue see the uk as trusted partner the strength of britain relationship with israel also matter for our wide influence in the middle east if we undermine our relationship and influence with israel we also lose influence across the middle east careless comment do not help include the foreign secretary remark in this house on monday for which he have be rebuke by the prime minister will he apologise to the house and to israel the foreign secretary focus should be on secure the release of the remain hostage and this house should be unite in that those hostage have be hold by hamas since the atrocity of october and their release be important for sustainable end to this conflict let we be clear hamas have no respect for international law human life or human right do the foreign secretary agree that we must be unequivocal that there be no moral equivalence between hamas and the democratically elect government of israel we must have no more poorly judge decision on arm export design to placate government back benchers on the question of aid to on the question of aid to gaza which government back benchers would perhaps like to take seriously have say from the dispatch box that we expect detail about the government practical response on the ground how be the government work to unblock the situation and what be happen to british aid that be already in the region or en route what discussion have the foreign secretary have with israeli counterpart in recent day what be his assessment of the report of hamas stockpile aid and the impact this have on distribution to civilian in need have he hold discussion recently with the red cross on its important work on hostage release and aid delivery could we be do more to support the work of the international committee of the red cross on the region more broadly as the parliamentary commission report make crystal clear we can not ignore the role of the regime in tehran which have its fingerprint over so much of the inhumane suffering and bloodshed that we see today we need action to deter iran malign agenda so what option be on the table for tackle iran and the flow of weapon and support to its terrorist proxy what hard power option be the foreign secretary consider in respect of the houthis do not receive an answer to that in the house on monday also ask the foreign secretary on monday whether britain be in lockstep with the united states but he do not answer that now be the time for he to provide clarity and clear answer be grateful to the right hon lady and let make clear regard the charity worker who be injure that of course our ambassador and the foreign office be in touch with his family as she would expect we have make representation to the israeli government and will be speak to the israeli foreign minister in the come hour the right hon lady talk about hamas and have say at this dispatch box that the scene of those young man in balaclavas with kalashnikovs parade hostage be obscene and condemn they say in january that we would continue to stand with the hostage family and we will there be still dozen of family wait hop pray that their love one can return but the right hon lady will also have see overnight that many of those family be say that this be not the way to bring they home they fear that as consequence of this resume action their love one will perish and think that the tone of some of her remark do not sit with what see come out of israel at this time no one could not be absolutely touch and affect by the gaunt and malnourished hostage parade around in sick propaganda exercise we all condemn hamas the right hon lady ask what we be do what we be do and what the previous government do be support the palestinian authority with reform there have to be an alternative to hamas and that alternative be the palestinian authority we must work with it we have to give people hope and prospect that be not about terrorism and that be about support prime minister mustafa in all his effort that be what we have be do and why we have be work particularly with the arab quint she ask about how we be work with partner in the area and there be to be conference gathering in egypt this weekend it have be postpone but it will be important that we attend that gathering and work with our arab partner put on record our support for egypt and qatar in their conversation with hamas she know that we do not talk to hamas but we do work with those partner who can the right hon lady ask about future operation in the red sea and she know well that would never comment from the dispatch box on operational issue in the red sea she ask if there be any moral equivalence between hamas and the israeli government of course there be no moral equivalence between hamas and the israeli government and none of we have ever suggest that that be the case she ask rightly about the role of iran she be right about the malign affect of iran in the region and we will act to ensure that it do not get the nuclear capability that it be seek to secure discuss that issue with secretary of state rubio and my counterpart in france and germany call the chair of the foreign affairs committee thank the foreign secretary for his passionate and articulate plea for peace from the dispatch box in do so he speak for we all and know that he have witness the suffering and feel it very deeply as we all do the renew bombing in gaza can not be justify the renew siege of gaza can not be justify and it be difficult to see how either of those thing be compatible with international law it will be for court to decide and there will be reckoning the question however be what be go to happen now because whatever it be that the british government be do in the region it be clearly not work what be plan now that the israeli government have abandon the fragile course of peace what be plan for the west bank which still face the threat of annexation follow report that the strike may have american endorsement what be plan when it come to unite our international ally to make sense of this senseless violation of the peace process we must ensure that this be meet not just with word no matter how passionate or articulate we have to do something internationally and with our ally it be time to stop talk about it and to do something be grateful to my right hon friend and know that she be in the region recently discuss these very same issue at the knesset understand that the us envoy steve witkoff be fly into the region as we speak and hold out hope that we can once more get ceasefire that get we to the plan which be to the end of the passover period can not give up hope on that she say that we must have more than word and she know as do that the business of diplomacy be word conversation and use our influence to bring this about that be why we be work closely with the united states with our arab partner and of course with our partner in particular and the european union at this time and will do everything can to get we back to that ceasefire call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the foreign secretary for advance sight of his statement israel resumption of its military campaign in gaza be heartbreaking for all palestinians for the remain hostage and their family and for the world for two month the fragile ceasefire provide space for the release of hostage and until early march the flooding of gaza with vital aid to alleviate the suffering of palestinians the resumption of fighting now threaten the life of israeli hostage still hold in captivity by hamas and of palestinians who have already see their home and community devaste by month of war new ceasefire must be secure as soon as possible to that end what discussion have the foreign secretary have with the israeli government on rapidly recommit to ceasefire even before the resumption of military operation the israeli government have cut aid route into gaza as well as the supply of electricity that be illegal and wrong contravene israel obligation under international law in this house on monday and today the foreign secretary state that israel aid blockade be breach of international law will he outline what action he be take to ensure that there be consequence to breach international law hamas must now immediately and unconditionally release the remain hostage the treatment of whom while in captivity have be despicable we be also deeply concern by report that british bomb disposal expert have be injure in an explosion at un facility in the strip and our thought be with their family will the foreign secretary update the house on his safety and condition arab state have vital role to play in support the transition back to state of ceasefire their plan for the reconstruction of gaza also provide pragmatic proposal for rebuild the strip particularly when compare with the reckless proposal put forward by trump who describe his intention to remove palestinians from gaza will the foreign secretary confirm that he have engage closely with arab partner in the region around their plan for reconstruction as conflict return to gaza we must also give palestinians hope and show they that we support their right to statehood do the foreign secretary agree that the uk must now move to officially recognise state of palestine as vital part of two state solution that offer dignity and security to palestinians and israelis be grateful to the hon lady can assure she that since the outbreak of renew hostility have speak to secretary of state rubio and to eu high representative kaja kallas and we be closely co ordinating just last friday meet the emergency relief co ordinator tom fletcher in new york where we discuss the issue in gaza of course expect to speak to my counterpart gideon and to palestinian prime minister mustafa shortly we be work particularly closely with our partner and the hon lady will have see that there be closed meeting of the united nations security council on tuesday at which we make strong representation she will also be aware that these issue be discuss and she will have see the communiqué that flow from the foreign ministers meeting last week in canada as have now say on occasion since september israel action in gaza be at clear risk of breach international humanitarian law the government have be clear all along that we be not an international court and we could not make judgment as to whether israel have breach international humanitarian law but make decision back in september base on whether there be clear risk and for that reason we have suspend those sale to gaza and they will continue to be suspend on the british charity worker who have be wound we be of course in contact with his family and intend to keep the house update thank the foreign secretary for all the work that he and his team be do behind the scene on this horrific issue it be quite shocking that the shadow foreign secretary appear unable to say the word palestinian as someone who use to be an international aid worker and be in gaza let say that the life of palestinian aid worker be every bit as valuable as the life of international aid worker more than palestinian child have be kill this week alone and yesterday the israeli defence minister threaten the ethnic cleansing of madam deputy speaker wish to set the record straight order will assist the shadow foreign secretary once the hon member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward have finish her question please continue yesterday the israeli defence minister threaten the ethnic cleansing of gaza what action be the foreign secretary take to stop that and to hold the government of israel accountable for their action humanitarian aid should never be use as political tool and israel must restart the aid immediately lot of diplomatic activity be go on at this time as say steve witkoff the us special envoy to the middle east have fly into the area and we be in touch with the us be work closely with the and the eu in fact will be speak very shortly to my french counterpart we have not give up hope sense that there have be loss of hope that we can get back to the ceasefire from hon member in the chamber but tell they now this foreign secretary have not give up hope that we can get back to the ceasefire it be my job to try and do the good to deliver that and that be what intend to do in the come hour on point of order madam deputy speaker be the point of order absolutely relevant right now seek your advice madam deputy speaker on the suggestion misrepresentation that have not speak about the palestinian authority in this house because have do so from the dispatch box on number of occasion order this be very sensitive and important debate we need to ensure that language be temperate and respectful at all time our constituent be watch as indeed be the world so we must ensure that we in no way inadvertently misrepresent our colleague the right hon lady point be note we will now continue because we have lot of people to get through call the father of the house agree with everything the foreign secretary have say in particular that we have to give hope to the palestinian people to be fair to the israeli government position hamas could solve the problem now by release the hostage have say that do the foreign secretary agree that be quite wrong for any member of the israeli government to say that the gazan people could rise up against hamas if they do that they would be torture at good and probably kill the people of gaza be victim of hamas as much as anybody and it be quite wrong for the israeli government to inflict collective judgment on the people of gaza that will bring death destruction more radicalism and we will never get the hostage home the father of the house speak with tremendous authority as have say none of we stand with hamas we all want to see hamas remove but an alternative to hamas have to be provide it seem to that the alternative be the palestinian authority and work alongside people to undermine hamas we also have to see the end of hamas there be way to bring that about we do it in northern ireland with de arming but they be well do through diplomatic and political solution not military endeavour the double standard and injustice we be witness on the international stage be truly appalling it be obvious that israel be break international law as every serious legal expert on international law have point out it be shameful frankly that the government refuse to state that about israel but will rightly do so about russia violation in ukraine say to the foreign secretary that the concern and outrage that he express at the dispatch box be not end the bloodshed when will we get the scale of sanction on israel that its war crime demand the conflict have go on for painful day recognise the strength of feeling after more than people have be kill in gaza staggering number of people my hon friend would not expect to comment on any further sanction from the dispatch box but of course we keen those issue under close review it have be estimate that in the opening salvos of this appalling aggression the israelis kill palestinian child in the space of minute there have be report of child go through amputation without anaesthetic because of the blockade and that leaflet be drop across gaza last night threaten extermination surely even for the government the israelis have now cross monstrous red line the foreign secretary talk about equivalence be assume that he believe that the palestinian civilian and their life be equivalent to the life of israeli citizen and be also equivalent to the life of ukrainian citizen this morning ministers be on the airwave offer british troop to keep the peace between ukraine and russia what be it about the palestinian people that mean they be less deserving of that kind of protection whole generation of gazans be grow up in the most unbearable condition and know that the right hon gentleman have be champion for those child child who we see rummage around in the rubble child who be now orphan and the many thousand of child in gaza who be out of school it be absolutely right that he bring their plight to the attention of the house but the way forward that we be show back at the beginning of january be through ceasefire negotiation to get into phase and of that ceasefire and horizon for two state solution that be what will continue to fight for think we all share the foreign secretary shock anger and frustration at the breakdown of the ceasefire and the death that we be see in gaza as today debate show word matter want to follow up on the comment make by my hon friend the member for cowdenbeath and kirkcaldy melanie ward give that we be now hear report of ground activity in gaza lead by israeli force israel katz the defence minister claim that the evacuation of gaza would resume and he be threaten total devastation those be not the action of government who want peace they be the action of an increasingly authoritarian government who be more interested in their own political survival than in the survival of any innocent civilian be they palestinian or israeli this be not what the hostage family want to see and we should speak for they as much as for the innocent civilian in gaza and the palestinians whose life be be lose for the avoidance of doubt will the foreign secretary be clear that we do not agree with but condemn the word of israel katz as they be not go to bring forward the ceasefire or uphold international law if they be leave unchallenged do condemn those word and would ask minister katz who be very experienced to withdraw they the language that we use in this conflict matter we know what have happen and the foreign secretary have remind we today for week supply of basic good and electricity have be block to say that israel risk breach international law for have do that be to say that this country do not see those act as prima facie breach of international law that be how it will be hear in tel aviv be that really the government position the government position be base on the law that be set out in our export licensing regime which the right hon gentleman support in the last parliament the language of that legislation if he look at it closely state that as minister and on behalf of the government have to make an assessment of clear risk that be the language that have use time in this house since september stand by it and so should he thank the foreign secretary for his statement and for his absolute commitment to the end of the fighting in gaza the return of the hostage and ultimately two state solution be contact by constituent of all background and of all faith and none they stop in the street they see the mutilate body of baby and the consequence of the blockade on humanitarian aid and they say to what be this government do about it what be you do about it will he say to my constituent now what action the british government will take in response to israel action in gaza and the west bank let make it clear that when my hon friend talk about the horror in gaza she should reassure her constituent that the united kingdom announce million of funding for the occupy territory just in the last year which include million for the united nations relief and works agency that we be very clear that humanitarian aid should not be use as tool and that uk support have mean that more than half million people have receive essential healthcare people have receive food and people have improve access to water sanitation and hygiene as result of the british taxpayer in term of what we be do have be in this house for year my hon friend know that this be about diplomacy wish that could switch this off from this dispatch box she know full well that can not do that but what can do be engage in the issue in detail it be hard grind know that this be hard for many in this house but that be how we bring about ceasefire the shadow foreign secretary my right hon friend the member for witham priti patel mention the all party parliamentary group report on the atrocity commit on october which be brilliantly research by lord roberts and whole series of different individual the document be almost page long and contain the evidence of what happen not only on that day but subsequently commend it to the foreign secretary to read because in future it will be the definitive history of what happen on october will he therefore look at the fact that hostage be still in captivity it be understand that only of they be alive probably only barely alive and be dead the reality be that there be an opportunity for the deal as propose by the united states for ceasefire to continue for the release of the hostage and for hamas to lay down their arm that be still open to the terrorist in hamas to take up if they do so we can then all unite across the house and call for the end of death and destruction be very grateful to the hon gentleman for mention those hostage the question now be how do we get those remain hostage home and be the action that we have see in the last two to three day likely to bring they home or to see more of they perish want to stand with the many hostage family who say can we give the talk chance to succeed because think military action be unlikely to bring they home we have all be absolutely horrified to see the devastating impact of israel military airstrike the foreign secretary rightly say that this be an appalling and unacceptable loss of life and that our labour government oppose the resumption of hostility do he agree that there be no military solution to this conflict let state again there be no military solution to this conflict it be conflict that have go on for month have there be military solution it would have be find by now the way forward be political process and get back to those ceasefire negotiation the inhumanity and depravity that we witness on tuesday defy belief but it show that after month israel understand fully what impunity be because netanyahu shatter that fragile ceasefire kill civilian shelter in tent mostly baby and toddler know that there would be absolutely no consequence for his action can the foreign secretary think of any other conflict at any other point in history when the uk would have accept one of its close ally and military partner designate baby and toddler as legitimate military target the whole house will have hear the hon gentleman language think the whole house also understand that this be one of the most complex of atrocity there be atrocity on both side of this conflict just remind he of the scene of those murder horrendously on october what we need now be more light and less heat this ceasefire must be desperately salvage for the hostage they and their family have live through hell for day now and for the innocent people of gaza who need aid safety and security and have themselves live through hell in that time worry that hamas state that they want to repeat the action of october they be commit only to endless war what can this government do to ensure that they have no role in the future of gaza report have come in that hamas have now start fire rocket into israel and siren be at this time sound in tel aviv condemn hamas rocket attack want to reiterate that the only way through this be to get back to ceasefire it be unacceptable that israeli civilian be run for cover and that palestinian civilian be find that the casualty be rise there can be no place for hamas in the future of gaza which be why we be do everything to help the reform of the palestinian authority we believe that they must play role in gaza governance in the month and year ahead despite huge investment in our relationship with israel over so many year we appear to be reduce to the position of spectator on touchline shout at the player and be largely ignore to what extent do the secretary of state believe that our lack of leverage if any be consequence of policy decision take in washington think it be clear that the effort of us envoy steve witkoff and president trump bring we to place where we have ceasefire sometimes it can feel futile diplomacy can feel very hard the word of parliamentarian can feel like they have no effect but everything that every single one of we as member of parliament do in those month also lead to that ceasefire in january we wish that we could have bring it about soon and now we must act to get back to that ceasefire as quickly as possible it be obvious that say that we strongly oppose hostility and that we be appal by israel action be have absolutely no effect on netanyahu who say of the death of palestinians most of whom be woman and child that it be only the beginning it be not right that the ordinary people of palestine should suffer because of the action of hamas do the foreign secretary agree that we now need to send strong message to israel and go far perhaps by suspend all arm licence to israel and recognise the state of palestine we be three day into resumption of fighting that be three day too long and have lament the loss of life numerous time already in the chamber include in my statement however three day mean that there be more diplomacy that we can deploy to get that ceasefire back and that be what intend to do over the come hour and day thank the secretary of state for his statement it be never easy to come to the chamber and make statement on an issue as complex as this one we all watch with horror as israeli prisoner be release not release in sombre dignified way but parade about as an example of the control that hamas have as far as hamas be concern those prisoner be not human being instead they be trophy of abuse and hate those scene be etch into the mind of people across the world will the secretary of state confirm that now as much as ever israel must show her strength and her friend and show hamas to be the murderous scum that they be will he reaffirm his pledge to support those who stand against the evil personify by the hamas terrorist be very grateful for what the hon gentleman have say once again from this dispatch box condemn hamas condemn their activity and condemn they for not release those hostage that be the way out of this release the hostage let we get back to political process and ceasefire and stop fire rocket into israel thank the foreign secretary and his team for what know be personal diplomatic effort to play the uk government part in make sure that we can return to ceasefire however in the past few day hundred more woman and child have be kill in gaza we have now have confirmation from the foreign secretary that british national un aid worker have be wound and aid continue to be block for palestinians hope be move far away will the foreign secretary far reiterate his commitment to the government diplomatic effort and will he also give we sense of what the uk government be do at this moment in which there be such darkness for the palestinian people when they think about what may be come in the come day so that we can quickly return not only to ceasefire but to long term hope for that region my hon friend ask what we be do refer she to the communiqué that my partner and release which contain lengthy section on the situation in gaza discuss it with seven of our close partner then fly to new york to meet tom fletcher to discuss the situation on the ground meet our colleague in the european union kaja kallas just this week to discuss these very issue and know that she intend to be in the region to discuss those issue face to face with israeli counterpart my hon friend will have see the work of our un ambassador barbara woodward there be closed session at the un during which these very same issue be of course discuss with intensity want to reassure my hon friend that all effort be be make and of course we be support the reform of the palestinian authority that be why will be speak to prime minister mustafa little later today it be tragic fact that wherever they occur military conflict result in the death of innocent civilian among they many child we witness this day in day out on our tv screen israel have an absolute right to take action to recover the hostage but agree with the foreign secretary that the continue bombardment of gaza will not achieve that of itself do he agree that one thing it do achieve be to risk radicalise the young generation to become the hamas supporter of the future that be huge concern because we want to provide hope for those people and we want to provide an alternative to hamas repeat that there have be month of bombardment and if that be go to work it would have work it have not work and go back to that mean as night follow day that at the end of any military exercise hamas will still be there and we will still come back to political process let we continue with the political process and the ceasefire talk now let we extend phase to the end of the ramadan passover season and let we work hard to get to phase as the foreign secretary mention the ceasefire provide glimmer of hope for the innocent civilian flee the constant bombardment and bloodshed and for the innocent hostage wait desperately to be reunite with their family for israel to breach that ceasefire be indefensible the targeting of civilian and civilian infrastructure should not be justify under any circumstance thank the foreign secretary for the work he be do and the personal effort he be lead behind the scene include on the recent statement by the uk german and french foreign ministers as he know leadership require honesty with our friend and tell thing how they be will he commit to the uk show leadership in provide international clarity to end this cycle of violence and clarity on the really serious issue of international law breach commend my hon friend for bring her moral clarity to the chamber this afternoon of course can confirm that we will continue to do all we can and we stand by the judgment that we make back in september when we assess that there be clear risk of breach of humanitarian law israel be commit war crime in gaza block the entry of humanitarian aid cut electricity that be essential for drink water the forced displacement of civilian and now indiscriminate bombing that be kill and maim many many child those be not just clear risk of breach of humanitarian law they be clear breach and it be just not enough to say that we do not like it want to ask the secretary of state very specific question have he explicitly ask the israeli government whether any uk make arm or arm component be use in the mass air strike in recent day that break the ceasefire and have cause untold suffering to civilian in make our assessment of clear risk of breach of humanitarian law we suspend arm sale to israel and stand by that decision of the child kill in israel deadly day of bombing in gaza on tuesday three of they be brother they be son of karam tafeek hameid hassan who be nine mohammad who be eight and aziz who be just five their father tell the bbc they use to play around have fun they want to be doctor teacher be also the father of three son and it disgust that israel action seem to treat palestinian child life as somehow more expendable or less precious than those of israeli child be it not time that we have diplomatic coalition of the willing maybe start with the country of the uk france and germany to call out israel appal crime in gaza not just through word but through action as the father of an adopt child feel personally the plight of the many many child in gaza who have be orphan and who be subject to exploitation as result of the fact that they now have no parent it break my heart that more horror could have be deploy against those who be now injure or bereft who have lose their parent so understand the strength of my hon friend feeling that be why be do all can particularly with partner to try to halt this behaviour have the government receive any indication or form any view about what the current israeli government would do if admittedly against all expectation hamas be to release all the hostage forthwith that be very good question and it be certainly matter have discuss with the united states envoy steve witkoff indeed have discuss it with the israeli government the right hon gentleman will know that there be lot of politic in israel and it be my sincere hope that these judgment be not be guide by political calculation when they cut to the core of human life say to those in israel listen to the hostage family and listen to the way out of this let we get back to ceasefire because be quite sure that at the end of any military exercise the risk be that few hostage will be alive either way the israeli government will have to get back to negotiation because military endeavour will not see the end of hamas think we have all be shock and horrify to see the escalation in gaza over the past few day thank the foreign secretary for his word today what work be he do with the international community and directly with the israeli government to lift the blockade on aid and ensure that it can get to the palestinian people particularly give the escalation we have see in recent day my hon friend be right we have to lift the blockade on aid in particular and that be why we have increase our funding at this time we will be work closely with partner in the region to get that aid in let also take this opportunity to say that remember meet the family of three british worker kill in the world central kitchen attack john chapman james kirby and james henderson it be nearly year since that attack and their family want and deserve justice there be many other family and many palestinians who have lose love one with more than aid worker kill in this conflict we can not see the continued killing of aid worker in any conflict and we condemn it in this house begin with quote annihilate smash eradicate erase crush shatter burn be cruel punish ruin crush annihilate that be the genocidal voice of the israeli government as post on only last night by itamar ben gvir as he be reappointe as cabinet minister the foreign secretary recognise this week that israel be in breach of international law what further evidence do the prime minister need to recognise that and for the uk government to end their complicity in these crime by stop support for the israeli government commit atrocity against the palestinian people if those be the word that be use last night and have not see they all then condemn they categorically from this dispatch box thank the foreign secretary for his update what we be see be clearly appalling the signal come from defence minister katz be absolutely clear the israeli government seek the total destruction of gaza and they see the occupation of west bank as their objective the leverage over netanyahu government be from ben gvir and smotrich so my question be simple other than once again review all the arm licence and perhaps withdraw they and put in place sanction against israel what leverage do the uk government have over israel in this circumstance can not comment on future sanction designation but refer my hon friend to the sanction announce back in october raise concern in particular about settlement and settler violence particularly in the west bank condemn the expansion we have see more expansion this year than in any other year want to reassure he that we keep sanction closely under review million around the world see in real time last night the destruction of life the loss of child life more destruction and the israeli attempt to annex northern gaza if not the whole of gaza that be clearly what the whole agenda be about israel continue to commit war crime through the denial of food water and electricity to the people of gaza will the british government confirm that they be in breach of international law secondly will we cease all military co operation with israel include arm supply and the use of raf akrotiri as staging point for the delivery of weapon condemn any attempt to annex gaza or the west bank know that the right hon gentleman have raise this issue in the past it would not be appropriate for to comment on operational military matter but have be absolutely clear about our assessment under the legislation that he and support when it be put through this house under the last government the assessment be about there be clear risk of breach of international humanitarian law remind the house gently as lawyer that that assessment of clear risk be low standard but on the assessment that have see and continue to see that be my assessment therefore think the right hon gentleman should be comfort that we be not assist in what we be see in gaza may correct my right hon friend when he use the word both side since neither the israeli government nor hamas represent the interest of the palestinian people we need to recognise that they do not have the voice necessary to bring they the protection that they need however want to raise the definition of genocide many time my right hon friend have rightly say from the dispatch box that it be for the court to determine whether or not genocide have be commit can he say what effort he have make to ask the court to make such ruling as my hon friend probably know meet from time to time with those who lead our international humanitarian law architecture include the international criminal court in particular and the international court of justice these be constitutional matter for they and we must stand by the separation of power and therefore it be right that they get on and do their proper work we as politician make our judgment but we be not court we can not pronounce that from this dispatch box certainly not on behalf of government in free democracy back benchers be of course free to say whatever they feel in this house and that be proper but speak on behalf of government it must be right that court make these determination the late scene come out of gaza be truly horrifying unicef say that the report kill early this week of more than child would be the large single day child death toll in the past year as mam and mamgu and just as human being actually find that truly abhorrent be the minister comfortable with the possibility of uk arm be use by israel against child and if not will he end not postpone all arm sale immediately refer the hon lady to what have already say to my statement back in september and to my reassurance that we be absolutely not in the business at the moment of sell arm that could be use in gaza under our licensing decision save of course for the decision we make on that be because in look at the supply chain and recognise risk and conflict in other part of the world include in the euro atlantic we have to make some serious judgment fail to act in the face of israel break the ceasefire in such violent manner have consequence it undercut moderate voice in israel damage the uk reputation internationally and compromise our support for international law and the rule of law will the foreign secretary look again at government policy on recognition sanction trade and arm supply while the atrocity continue against palestinian civilian be grateful to my hon friend for raise the issue of recognition which know be dear to he and other in this house it be serious issue he know that recognition in and of itself do not deliver two state solution he know that we want two state solution and the recognition of palestinian state but that be well do as part of process that actually get we to two state he will recognise that the decision by other partner to move to recognition have not alleviate the suffering before our eye which be why there must be careful balance recognise that different government and members will come to different judgment but be hold out for two state include an actual state for the palestinian people which be just cause and not just for symbolic act along with billion muslims around the world begin my fast on tuesday morning have take some food and water with the scream of innocent man woman and child ring in my ear as they be burn alive in their makeshift tent object to the resumption of the conflict and the cessation of the peace deal the israelis have continue to kill hundred of people include freeze baby and to proceed with the gazafication of the west bank through the removal of people the minister will be aware of the peace deal that be available in may accord to president biden the hostage be not priority for the israelis sentiment that be echo just the other day by the hostages and missing families forum which accuse mr netanyahu of complete deception and say that the israeli government have choose to abandon the hostage the fact be that the foreign secretary be aware of all this as we continue to provide israel with military support and the use of our air base in cyprus and to give it moral economic and political support hope that he take my sincere question as it be mean he have speak passionately about his heritage and his ancestor who be shackle in the chain of slavery to unshackle his own chain will he immediately cease all arm licence despite the billion worth of economic tie between israel and the uk will he impose economic sanction and put in place viable process for recognise the state of palestine the hon gentleman bring powerful rhetoric to the house this afternoon notwithstanding the horror of the conflict that have begin we be three day into it in the end it be the ceasefire that will alleviate the suffering it be my job to use all endeavour to get back to that ceasefire that be my job and that be what intend to do in recent week have hear my constituent express their relief but also their fear that this exact moment would come thank the foreign secretary for all the work that he have be do to secure last peace and be glad to hear he speak of the need to send clear message to israel that the resumption of airstrike be unacceptable but worry that this message will be hear only if it be convey through both word and action can he reassure my constituent that he be look at what further action may be need include on sanction to get back on the path to peace be grateful to my hon friend for her remark can not comment from the dispatch box on further action or sanction just pray in aid what have already say about diplomatic effort hope we can see the resumption of ceasefire as soon as possible all power to us envoy steve witkoff in the come day as he seek to use us influence to bring that to pass be grateful to the foreign secretary for have make time to meet so that could share some of the concern outline by many people in newcastle under lyme nobody have monopoly on decency and compassion some member of this house ought to keep that in mind the scene from gaza on our tv screen have be beyond horrify the breaking of the ceasefire have see more innocent people kill without question we need all hostage to be release and we need this war to end now what specific discussion have the foreign secretary have with his counterpart in saudi arabia egypt jordan and the rest about the noble aim of save the life of innocent people and deliver the long overdue two state solution that we desperately need meet many partner at the few week ago and as my hon friend will know have also speak to many partner particularly from the arab quint on the phone suspect that will be in the region in the come week as consequence of what we be now see this destruction and kill during the holy month of ramadan be horrific and inhumane yesterday with colleague from this house meet palestinian student study in the uk one do not know if her family member be alive another could not attend because she have just hear that her father have be kill the night before we must ensure that the international community work together to outline the consequence of the attack for the israeli government can the secretary of state confirm that the uk government will abide by any international court of justice ruling regard breach of international humanitarian law in the region reassure my hon friend that yes we will over people have be kill the majority of whom be child aid supply have be block and aid worker kill and the rhetoric from israeli ministers be get bad all this have happen under ceasefire know these matter be complex but at what point do we change our posture towards the israeli government when we be talk about israel we should remember that we stand alongside the israeli people at this time and we think of the many hostage who be underground and in desperate condition in gaza israel be democracy which be why we see people take to the street and make their voice hear we see heated debate in israel as the good way forward yesterday the international development committee return from geneva follow our inquiry into international humanitarian law the message be very clear the ihl framework be robust but we be fail on adherence and compliance under ihl aid worker should be protect welcome what the foreign secretary have say so far but the death toll continue to rise in gaza and most of the aid worker be local can the foreign secretary expand on what we will do to protect aid worker include through the ministerial group for the protection of humanitarian personnel we meet representative of that group yesterday be grateful to my hon friend for raise this issue we continue to work with un colleague to ensure that aid worker be protect just as we continue to work with our eu colleague on that we condemn the tremendous loss of life in the bad conflict for aid worker and we continue to call for justice particularly for those kill in the world central kitchen and for proper investigatory process in israel that see accountability for such act thank the foreign secretary for today statement and for all the work that he and his team have be do over so many month to try to find resolution the action of hamas be both brutal and unacceptable but for democratically elect government to bombard innocent civilian and to deprive they of food water and medical supply be totally reprehensible the foreign secretary be quite right to say that word be the language of diplomacy but sometimes symbol matter too give the fear that israel ground invasion be an attempt to separate the north from the south lead to annexation be it not time to recognise the state of palestine and show that we stand with the people of palestine thank my hon friend and recognise the strength of feeling in the house about want to see alongside israel home for the palestinian people that be safe and secure however as have say to she before we keep this issue under review and we work with close ally such as france on these issue my own judgment be that the moment will be right when there be process that actually lead to two state have hop that as result of the ceasefire back in january and our get to phase and we be get close to that process and will do everything can to get we back to that place in the come day like many be horrified to see the resumption of airstrike in gaza and the loss of so many innocent life this week civilian in gaza and the remain israeli hostage who be abduct in the appalling hamas terror attack of october desperately need ceasefire back in place and the hostage must be release will the foreign secretary join in condemn comment from the israeli defence minister who threaten the total destruction of gaza will he also be clear that the terrorist of hamas can have no role in the future of gaza yes will thank the secretary of state for his statement and for his relentless effort to bring all party back to the negotiating table think we have all be horrify by the scene we have see on tv the resumption of the violence that have see the loss of hundred of innocent life and the blockade of lifesave aid we must never forget the hostage who be wait to come home and their family who be wait for they as well as the horror they have experience give the email of concern that have receive from my constituent must say that people be now ask what next they be do so because despite all these effort we have reach point of utter desperation and hopelessness can he give assurance that arm licence will continue to be under regular review and that sanction will be actively consider hope that both those measure will bring people back to the peace table arm licence be of course continually review and as my hon friend would expect we always keep sanction under review in recent day nearly palestinians have be kill or injure and once again many more be be displace the humanitarian situation be get bad in gaza as israel refuse to let through the aid truck the crossing have be close for continuous day which be surely breach of international law more than million people have be leave without food parcel and one in five pregnant woman and breastfeed mother be malnourished we need return to the ceasefire and the return of the hostage but the action of the last week demand that the uk government take further action israel continue to breach the term of the ceasefire we should not do trade deal with israel while the ethnic cleansing of palestinians be real possibility urge the foreign secretary to consider sanction against some of the key israeli actor what further action will he take in the light of these recent escalation have deal at the dispatch box with much of what my hon friend raise but let say that although the uk have difference with the israeli government we do not have difference with the israeli people the secretary of state for business and trade have take the decision to restart negotiation on free trade arrangement with israel there have not be any ministerial meeting but it be important that we do not act against the people of israel many of whom be take to the street at this very time bombing civilian and prevent access to basic humanitarian supply as tactic of war be war crime thank the foreign secretary for his statement and for his tireless diplomacy call for full transparent investigation be welcome as be call to return to ceasefire however give our strong opposition to the return of hostility and the bombing by the israelis we must now go beyond persuasion their action be incompatible with international law be it not time to make direct response beyond persuasion what strong option do the government have which would assist diplomacy know he can not speak about specific but can he confirm that these option be be consider so that we can send clear message now and help stop the bloodshed as one of the five permanent member of the un security council we of course have an arsenal of diplomatic tool which we deploy as appropriate and keep under review want to reassure my hon friend that we be do everything we can to get back to that ceasefire many of my constituent have be in touch in recent day to express their horror and their devastation at the loss of life in gaza after israel resume the bombing the foreign secretary be absolutely right to say that diplomacy be the only way to end the bloodshed but can push he on the resumption of humanitarian aid it be unacceptable that we have continued blockade what lever do we have to get israel to end the blockade on aid and what be the likelihood of aid go in in the come day know my hon friend constituency well and can imagine that her constituent be react with real horror to what they be see at this time there be lot of comment about humanitarian aid the inability to get aid in and the barrier to get aid in that hear from some colleague in israel but when we get that ceasefire the number of truck crossing exceed expectation and the aid suddenly get in it have now be think or day since the aid stop and there will be tremendous suffering as result aid should never be use as tool in any conflict and that be why we want to see the resumption of aid we now know how many truck can get in so let we get back to those number would like to commend my right hon friend for all the hard work he have be do to secure ceasefire in gaza and indeed for maintain accountability to this house as he have do today in so much detail it be devastating that israel have resume the indiscriminate bombing of palestinian civilian while the ceasefire hold there be comment from those on the treasury bench about the possibility of trade deal between the uk and israel do the foreign secretary agree surely he do that trade deal between the uk and israel must be completely out of the question now that the ceasefire be over my hon friend have make her view know there have not be any ministerial meeting on any such trade deal always want to keep in mind the israeli people such deal be not as it be for the government it would be do on behalf of the people of israel but ministers will have hear and the whole house will have hear her remark this afternoon disabled people access to transport transport committee select committee statement we now come to the select committee statement on behalf of the transport committee ruth cadbury will speak for up to minute during which no intervention may be take at the conclusion of the statement will call member to ask question on the subject of the statement these should be brief question not full speech emphasise that question should be direct to the select committee chair not to the relevant minister front benchers may take part in the questioning thank the backbench business committee for allocate time for to make statement to the house to mark the publication of the transport committee first report of this parliament our report be call access deny right versus reality in disabled people access to transport it bring to conclusion work do by our predecessor committee on which sit for while in the previous parliament and for which we thank it the report first set out the evidence we receive from disabled people about their experience of use transport network in this country their experience will come as no surprise to most hon member whose constituent tell we about rail station that remain stubbornly inaccessible taxi service that have refuse carriage because of assistance dog and be leave high and dry at airport or on train when they have book passenger assistance that just do not arrive on time no mode of transport be free from problem despite most notionally have accessible facility and policy those failure affect people with all kind of disability and access need the need of wheelchair user and people with sight loss might seem obvious but the committee also hear from people with health condition who need easy access to toilet and from those with autism who describe how overcrowded or unpredictable transport affect they perhaps most shocking of all of disabled people who respond to our survey say that almost every journey be beset with problem more than third say that more than once week they decide not to make journey because they know it would be too complicated too unsafe or that thing be likely to go wrong that be simply an unacceptable infringement of people human right to go to work to access education health care and family to participate in society and just to have fun transport be not an end in itself it be suppose to be an enabler but far too often it be disable people around one in seven in the uk population have disability one respondent to our survey tell we there an assumption that disable people time be less valuable that it okay to make we wait for rail worker to turn up with ramp ve be late to important meeting because of this and it make feel like second class citizen barely go to see my mum or friend at home because the transport be so bad for wheelchair user do know how do it it affect my friendship relationship and work life and it be embarrassing just want to be able to use public transport like everyone else in theory we have law to promote accessibility and equality but they be clearly not work there be raft of equality legislation and specific regulation about transport that if implement consistently ought to guarantee access and freedom from discrimination from the equality act and the public sector equality duty to the minutia of vehicle regulation we have the framework on policy in the government adopt an inclusive transport strategy that aim to achieve equal access for disabled people use the transport system with assistance if physical infrastructure remain barrier by minister in the previous government tell the committee they think progress towards that goal be on track the reality seem to be completely at odd with the right and with policy aspiration our report aim to set out why that be and what should be do about it we set out example of accessibility be deprioritise often because it be see as too impractical or costly to achieve it plan for implement step free access on the rail network for example have be beset by halt progress and many of we be still await an update on the access for all step free project at our local station we argue that certain level of failure seem to be deem acceptable by transport provider such as when provide passenger assist service we describe how accessibility be not take into account early enough in the process of policy development such as when proposal to close railway ticket office wholesale make it to consultation the public say no but they should not have have to we discuss the vital role of sufficient staff who be well train in how to support travel need of people with different need change of mindset throughout the system from the top down be need urgently failure should be vanishingly rare not commonplace access to transport must be recognise as human right not as matter of customer service concrete plan and real resource need to be put behind new inclusive transport strategy one that set out realistic pathway to achieve that goal of equal access the routine everyday nature of access failure stand out in our inquiry but it be punishingly hard to hold anyone to account for failure seek redress or even just report they to the responsible body be huge exhausting and often thankless burden in theory individual can take legal action under the equality act but it be costly risky and time consume so few case be bring even when case be successful lasting systemic change do not happen more of the heavy lifting need to be do by regulator and enforcement body they currently often have neither the mandate nor the resource to involve themselves at low enough threshold only long stand organisation wide failure tend to be pursue and only then when informal measure have be exhaust as result while individual disabled people often lose count of the number of occasion on which they have be fail regulator can generally count on the finger of one or two hand the number of formal enforcement action that have be take we must bring that into balance there have to be consequence for failure that be why our report ask ministers to move towards more robust active enforcement regime we invite government to consider whether single body with expertise in and responsibility for accessibility across transport mode would be more effective model we recommend unified service to receive and triage accessibility complaint to ensure they reach the relevant operator or authority to follow they up if not resolve and ensure that systemic issue be identify we also ask for review of the legal framework to replace the patchwork that have grow up ad hoc over time user find it difficult to know what they be entitle to operator find it difficult to know what they have to provide and change in technology and travel trend leave gap in the law in our report we invite the government to consider whether framework base on more explicit standard would be more effective and that the framework design and outcome must include disabled people at every stage to conclude thank not only our predecessor committee for take the evidence on which this report be base and the committee staff who work so hard on the inquiry and the report but more important those who give evidence especially about their own experience of travel as disabled person and their expert analysis of what be go wrong particularly thank claire lindsey and alan benson champion for disabled people right on transport who sadly pass away last year alan and claire take through london at the start of the inquiry and open my eye to the issue that affect people with autism and those with restricted mobility when travel the word of disabled people quote throughout our report be call to action that we expect the government to heed our committee will hold the government to account for do so and for bring reality in line with right commend our report to the house and we look forward to receive consider response from the government in due course thank the chair of the transport committee for the report which be most welcome will read it with interest she reference the access for all programme which hit the buffer during the previous parliament with few than half the promise project come to fruition she say much about what go wrong how confident be she that we can avoid such problem happen in future the report have recommendation but the last one be the most important an overarch body with responsibility for standard enforcement across transport mode which would replace the hotchpotch of law policy and process that disabled people must navigate with more effective approach to assert the right of disabled traveller thank my hon friend for such brilliant report welcome the commitment to an accessible road map as part of labour transformational great british railways reform what positive role do my hon friend see this road map play in improve accessible travel across the country agree that the formation of great british railways provide an opportunity to bring together all the player in passenger rail many of which have different standard different policy and different training regime with single command body think we have real chance of bring those process together however that do not stop rail operator carry out their responsibility day to day it be not just about policy but about how it work every day order we have several minute only so question and answer must be short compliment the transport committee and its chair on this report which from what have read so far be absolutely excellent have two very short point for the hon lady in london ticket office be close by transport for london some time ago do the report include anything about the possibility of reopen those ticket office or have well information available for people particularly those with sight or hear difficulty go to station secondly there be still large number of underground station with no lift access whatsoever what evidence have she have that transport for london will bring forward programme to make all underground station fully accessible for everyone thank the right hon gentleman for his question under our proposal tfl would need to be part of that new process take the example of vienna year old bahn system where there be programme to make every station accessible within year london be big and it be big challenge but it be not impossible call transport committee member laurence turner pay tribute to my hon friend whose determination as chair have mean that this important report from the previous committee have see the light of day do she agree that the reasonable adjustment framework under the equality act be the right one and that the problem be the lack of implementation and awareness if we have clear statutory guidance as exist in some area disabled passenger and other transport user would face few barrier thank my hon friend for the support he give in draft the final part of the report he be absolutely right disabled people and operator currently use system that be hotchpotch of sometimes conflict and very complex bit of legislation some of which be bring over from eu law and some from the equality act when that be address it will be much clear to bring forward more specific regulation thank the committee chair for bring forward this report access to transport relate not just to disabled people but to parent with pushchair people with luggage and so on it benefit we all be often contact by constituent about the condition of lift at sutton station focus on accessibility with investment not only in improve step free access but in maintain it be an opportunity provide by the reform to transport under great british railways do she agree that the government should focus not only on the roll out of additional step free access but on well maintenance and well programme to ensure that the exist facility remain accessible for as long as possible absolutely agree with the hon gentleman in addition thank to digital technology we now have real time knowledge of when lift be work or not call transport committee member alex mayer our report highlight that the understanding of disability have change since many of the relevant law and regulation be put in place this issue be about not only ramp for wheelchair for example but condition such as neurodiversity do my hon friend agree that make transport more accessible for those with hide disability be important not least because for economic growth we must use the talent of all my hon friend be absolutely right as say claire open my eye to her need with thing like have to find an access information point outside the station where she can summon passenger assist so that she do not have to go through the confusion noise and crowd of station as well as the design of the wall in tube station which impact her ability to move through station my hon friend be absolutely right hide disability be as important as those we can see with wheelchair or white stick londoner often complain about their train service but actually it be pretty good with the overground the underground and network rail however it be bar to many disabled traveller take an example at random kew bridge and gunnersbury station which serve my constituent and those of my hon friend the select committee chair need step free access what can we do to change feasibility study into actuality in such place thank my hon friend and neighbour for raise the issue of the two station where both of our constituent need step free access have not yet have an answer from the rail minister on the access for all programme for those two station but will keep chase thank my colleague on the transport committee for their work on this important report have be campaign to make atherstone station in my constituency more accessible and will be use this report to help achieve that goal the previous government recklessly overpromise on access for all misleading disabled passenger who have be leave strand for too long do my hon friend agree that disabled people have be let down over the past decade and that this government be right to tackle the situation now and improve service for the future my hon friend be absolutely right one of the criticism of the exist access for all programme be the expense of the project that have be deliver have road map of the station upgrade to provide certainty and consistency for contractor would speed up the delivery and reduce the cost of deliver lift in the station where they be so badly need commend the chair for this excellent report and for shin the light on such an important issue can think of numerous time when have be on bus and have have to be very curt with the driver to argue on behalf of disabled person in wheelchair who want to use the space after the driver have blatantly tell they to wait for the next bus that sort of thing be unacceptable do she agree that we need to look at the enforcement of the equality legislation as it stand and at well training and awareness so that disable people in wheelchair can use public transport absolutely agree with my hon friend who chair of the housing communities and local government committee as say the culture change go from the top to the frontline and staff need both to be train and to have the confidence that they will be support if they do assert the right of disabled people as the parent of wheelchair user with severe sight impairment see many of the issue the report highlight on daily basis the report highlight the issue with aviation and the difficulty the civil aviation authority have face in enforce regulation on behalf of wheelchair user and people with severe sight impairment will my hon friend join in ask the government to fully consider the recommendation of the aviation accessibility task and finish group when it report in the summer along with the principle of my aviation accessibility bill to finally make change for disabled people on airline be happy to be co sponsor of my hon friend bill on aviation accessibility fear that one of our finding be that the caa put too much emphasis on what it call reputational enforcement rather than proper enforcement the relevant minister in the previous parliament say that the caa need additional power and hope this government will support those word thank my hon friend and her committee for fantastic report will she join in congratulate disability right activist such as my former constituent sam jennings who know be thrill by the report which hope my hon friend would be happy to hear it be important that we congratulate these activist who have be look for report like this for long time sam certainly open my eye to number of different issue if the government accept these recommendation which they should it will be due to their fantastic activism people such as sam be amazing activist as have say they be major contributor to our inquiry but they also need to be major contributor to the solution royal assent have to notify the house in accordance with the royal assent act that his majesty have signify his royal assent to the follow act finance act backbench business knife crime children and young people before we begin the debate may remind member of the house rule on matter sub judice member should make no reference to live criminal case in which suspect have be charge beg to move that this house have consider the matter of knife crime amongst child and young people first let place on the record my gratitude to the backbench business committee for grant this time in the house of commons chamber also thank all those from both side of the house who support my application for debate on this topic there be some issue that believe rise above the punch and judy vaudeville that characterise so much of our political debate call for this debate because believe it be topic that parliament need to discuss bravely honestly frankly and robustly believe it transcend party politic and party line and have be call for it for several year since long before become member of parliament wholeheartedly welcome this government pledge to halve instance of knife crime over the next decade the previous government seek to tackle knife crime but sadly be unable to do so effectively although do not doubt either government intent and desire to achieve that aim be sceptical that this government will fare much well than the last for all the hype and the fanfare this be an issue that repeatedly fall by the wayside until it be thrust back into the spotlight with the tragic death of yet another child put simply do not believe that government of any hue have show the mettle require to tackle this with the resource approach and focus that be require there be no easy solution to this issue the government most recent datum show that of offence result in caution or conviction for possession of knife or offensive weapon juvenile age to year old be the offender in of case community sentence be the most common sentence give to those to year of all knife and offensive weapon offence across that age demographic over the past decade to year old offender show the big decrease in average sentence length with decrease from month in march to month in march around of youth offender be commit their first offence in the month to march young people age under be murder with knife or sharp object of whom be child age under in the most recent year for which the data be available just of knife and offensive weapon offence result in immediate custody with chance of not go to prison why should anyone carry knife fear the law before become the mp for huntingdon spend decade work in london and live in haringey north london at that time haringey have the second high rate of knife crime in london it be difficult to explain what it be like to live in an area of london where murder and stabbing become so commonplace as to elicit little more than shrug from local resident where police tape close road or local park be normalise to the point of merely be an inconvenience where the murder of child do not make the national news and where five child be charge with murder do not make the national news as with the case of the murder of taxi driver gabriel bringye in this desensitisation be but one part of the problem over three year period there be at least dozen fatal stabbing within mile of my front door several of those victim be child half of those arrest in connection with the crime be child as be the perpetrator too remember the murder of year old stelios averkiou he be stab multiple time by his assailant after he resist his mobile phone be steal in lordship recreation ground be in the park shortly afterwards and see the aftermath remember for week afterwards the handwritten poster on the tree around the park ask for anyone to come forward with information remember the murder of year old anas mezenner fatally stab near turnpike lane station in another fight over mobile phone the year old boy guilty of the stabbing have dozen of video of himself on his own phone posing with large blade while on remand in recorded phone call he have state just want my little chinge to get it my first little juice on my blade it just go in my man arse the whole go in down his arse ana die from fatal stab wound to the buttock from knife with cm blade all five charge with the murder be child remember the murder of year old ali baygoren stab in the neck twice outside his home just across the road from the tottenham hotspur stadium his murderer year old boy be on bail have only nine month previously stab year old boy in dispute over light leave knife bury in his chest that boy survive there be dozen more on tuesday year old boy be stab after mass brawl involve young man arm with machete erupt in forest gate east london on monday afternoon year old boy be stab in broad daylight in turnberry park in birmingham on saturday year old be stab in mcdonald in southall and two year old be arrest last friday in oxford year old boy be stab and two year old and year old be arrest last thursday year old boy be stab at the bobby moore academy in stratford three boy be arrest last week in yorkshire year old boy be find guilty of the attempt murder of year old girl with samurai sword on camping trip last november she suffer wound include damage to lung and her liver the forensic pathologist report say that she be lucky not to have be kill the court hear claim that he have be offer by friend to attack she these be not isolate incident but daily occurrence across the country these be vicious feral derange attack that be traumatic for the victim and for those involve yet they be often little more than pass headline in list of other more newsworthy tragedy we be all aware of the role that social medium play in this context and how its algorithm can facilitate dangerous influence on young user for child and young people their world be small often limited to their school their friend and people they know in their neighbourhood but with access to social medium that change their world remain small but the issue within it be amplify blow out of all proportion in its paper knife crime in the capital policy exchange write that the frequency with which young people associate with gang be confront with violent video on social medium shift their perception of normality desensitise they and increase the chance that they will react violently it also reinforce the perceive need to carry weapon for protection in the intervene period since that paper be write that same influential factor have ripple outward to child who although not associate with any gang exist in very online world where it be all too easy to become seduce by the belief that carry knife be normal and essential aspect of everyday life that the threat of attack be ever present and that carry knife be key component of self defence police force have even now alter their approach to share image of weapon seize during operation after feedback that this in itself contribute to the process of desensitisation and simultaneously make young people feel that their local area be unsafe thus encourage they to carry knife themselves but we need look no far than the social medium platform that we ourselves use instagram snapchat tiktok use youtube every day but scratch the surface and we can find harmful content such as scoreboard video outline who have stab or kill whom in localise turf war for gang supremacy these scoreboard video brazenly chase clout highlight those involve outline who wet someone who burst someone else who buss their away with it in court and who therefore remain dangerous and at large this illustrate that those involve can often enjoy degree of impunity thank the hon member for make such an impassioned speech he have just outline some of the role of the social medium company do he agree that the same rigour that we rightly use to catch some of the perpetrator of these crime should be apply to the social medium giant who refuse in some case to take down really explicit and graphic image on their website say that they do not breach their content policy that be very valid point the social medium company themselves know full well that this content be there and could easily create an ability to moderate it these be billion dollar company and if they want to take down this stuff they could it be about willpower it be part of our responsibility in this house to make sure that that happen fear of be stab or kill far outweigh any fear of the police we only need to watch one of the video mention to see how an endless immersion into this world can cloud people judgment when ask justice minister whether such video could be use as evidence to prosecute the government new law of possession of knife with violent intent do not receive an answer and be not sure whether the minister quite understand what be make reference to ask the minister for crime policing and fire whether she could address that specific point in she sum up at the end of the debate congratulate my hon friend on secure this important debate and on make an impassioned speech he be talk about the danger of social medium influence boy and young man one of the key aspect of that be their role in society and the lack of clear role model will he join in pay tribute to the former england football manager sir gareth southgate who in his richard dimbleby lecture this week articulate the importance of role model and of boy and young man get involve in active sport so that they then become normalise in that setting and be not draw into this dreadfully violent world agree and will mention later the intervention to try to get people in more collegiate and embrace atmosphere role model be valid issue sadly my speech be already long but would have love to cover that in more detail because it be huge part of the reason why young man be draw into this type of violent world scoreboard video be inextricably link to drill music which be genre but also the medium by which various group cum gang be able to taunt their catalyst for multiple stabbing often fatal the line between gang and group be blur to the point of irrelevance meanwhile the medium either do not know or do not care inner city black youth be consciously or unconsciously expendable and interchangeable overrepresente in statistic as both victim and perpetrator the soft bigotry of low expectation make black culture ripe for exploitation as cheap way to appear edgy irrespective of the upstream impact large medium corporation even the bbc play their part in the creation of this milieu lean into it and give it validation the cynical valorisation of the most detrimental aspect of urban black culture and the celebration of criminality via musician be one of the most toxic overarching influence in push this

last year kemani duggan be sentence to five year in prison for possession of tokarev pistol and calibre ammunition with intent to cause fear of violence the violence for which drill music have be demonise that be precisely the type of irresponsible medium valorisation that illustrate my point congratulate my hon friend on bring to the house this horrific catalogue of embarrassing incident embarrass to member of this house and previous administration because we have be asleep on the job the legal authority be able to stamp down on last summer riot in southport so effectively by take tough measure do he agree that that be call for now talk about reduce the incidence of knife crime by half over year be totally inadequate immediate action be need to make an example of this type of crime and deter other from participate agree the law simply do not act as deterrent to many of these people they be far more scared of their immediate surrounding and the danger pose to they in everyday life than they be of be arrest by police officer know full well that they be unlikely to go to prison unless they have do something as heinous as some of the act that have describe ciaran thapar the author of the piece that just describe appear before the youth select committee last december in his new role as director of public affair and communication at the youth endowment fund there he explain how drill be an outlet for those involve to express the trauma that they have experience in their life adverse childhood experience be key part of fuel the likelihood of vulnerable individual become involve in knife crime there be broad question here about immigration particularly from country where experience of trauma brutality and war be contribute factor in youth behaviour within multicultural inner city community the youth endowment fund do important work on knife crime and its toolkit be often cite as key resource in provide the tool require to reach child last week speak to sharon ward the serious violence duty co ordinator in cambridgeshire and peterborough cover my constituency of huntingdon the serious violence duty be introduce by the previous government in january and require local agency to share datum and information to help identify the root cause of serious violence occur locally when speak to sharon about this in depth she explain that they use multi agency public health approach address the underlie risk factor that increase the likelihood that an individual will become victim or perpetrator of violence in the first place the most vulnerable time for child and young people be from pm to pm as well as later in the evening from pm until am diversionary activity be key to reduce those vulnerability sharon outline how the path to become involve in violence be slippery slope where participation in antisocial behaviour be link progression to more violent crime be sure that the subject of funding for youth service and cut under the previous government will be raise have focus on less discuss aspect of this wide issue in my speech however the part play by youth worker in reach child and young people who be vulnerable and at risk of embark on the wrong path be well document cambridgeshire and peterborough currently have intervention fund by the serious violence duty they range from sport base intervention to mentor and relationship building but all be design to help those assess as vulnerable we must also be mindful that it be not simply about child from certain background child from all background be vulnerable to exploitation by gang those child do not realise that they be be exploit because of the way that they be be groom they be give new trainer playstation game or bike by an old person they look up to or be fearful of seemingly with no string attach then they be on the hook and owe they at good favour or at bad debt congratulate my hon friend on secure such an important debate he have make the point about child number of time do he agree that educate our girl and our boy about the importance of respect themselves and each other be an important part of tackle not just knife crime but all crime do he also agree that it be matter for all government to do much more on prevention and early intervention wholeheartedly agree child seem to find themselves in general atmosphere in which there be constant need for validation and for they to twist themselves into something that they be not my honest belief be that social medium have play huge part in that it come across as facile answer to give but when we delve into it it be far more complex and damaging than we be prepared to credit any child can fall into criminality in this way sharon explain how parent need to be part of those discussion and alert to the warning sign it be vital that scheme such as the serious violent duty continue to be fund though ask the government to ensure that such funding be approve well ahead of time rather than within few week of its end give the uncertainty that that often generate welcome the government decision to ban zombie knife any step take towards reduce the chance of fatal stabbing be move in the right direction but we must not smugly pat ourselves on the back and assume that that be all that be require be as critical of the previous government attempt to ban zombie knife as be of this one not of the intent but of the way that it be announce as the solution rather than tiny piece of the overall problem zombie knife account for just of fatal stabbing the same as lock knife screwdrivers be more commonly use weapon however by far and away the most common be the kitchen knife of fatal stabbing involve the type of knife that we all have and probably use this morning or last night in our own kitchen yes the zombie knife should be ban but give its use in small minority of fatal stabbing that be not the panacea that it be present as there have be proposal to change kitchen knife to have rounded rather than pointed tip as outline in research by professor graham farrell and toby davies and as champion by idris elba in his drive to tackle knife crime would be interested to hear from the minister what consideration have be give to that idea but we can not pretend that kitchen knife be not and will not continue to be easily available to anyone with the intention of use one the hon gentleman be make an important and passionate speech historically my area of fife have not be synonymous with knife crime and we want to keep it that way but the possession of weapon in fife have increase by in the last year do he agree that figure like that along with concern recent footage on social medium of young man brandish knife shortly before he be attack be warning sign that we need to act now to prevent bad development wholeheartedly agree area that traditionally have not be plague by such violence be increasingly find it ripple out into their community it be no long just in large city and area that we would traditionally associate with it we be find it slowly move into the suburb we need to nip this in the bud if we can to prevent any more tragedy key question be why be child now prepare to murder other child it can not be ignore that we see countless example weekly even daily of child be stab by another child when do child develop nihilistic worldview and willingness to take the life of another child in my previous career as an army officer instruct new soldier in phase one training so know how long it take to train teenager to be prepared to kill how and why be some child develop that mindset all on their own fear be huge driver of knife carrying the ben kinsella trust keep young people safe report illustrate that it drive the normalisation of carry knife in the report two third of respondent to survey of some young people say that they harbour anxiety about knife crime shockingly the survey show that child as young as or year old be consider carry knife though the number be very low that show that the idea of carry knife be within the scope of child who have only just stop believe in father christmas be child murder other child solely out of fear these child be not actually under threat these be fight over little more than perceive slight but somehow we have reach stage of such frenzied paranoia among child of school age that they believe not only that they need to carry knife but that take life be somehow reasonable rational response to these situation there be sensible argument for access to therapy as potential solution but appreciate that that be easy to suggest and unrealistic to facilitate and implement have go on long enough want to give other an opportunity to speak hope to hear many important and interesting contribution from hon member open the debate to other commend the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for bring this important debate to the house this be national emergency and huge threat to our society and our young people wish to associate myself with many of the thing he say and totally agree that we have to stop this be not interested in who say what and when politically be interested in all of we work together to resolve this issue we have to deal with it will give voice to victim and family because it be important that we remember that behind every stabbing there be victim and behind every victim there be family wish to mention two in particular my constituent beverley davies have be to see few time beverley son be stab over time on parbold hill in lancashire few year ago alex be his name and he be the individual who murder he be also they meet online on platform that be use to lure alex to his death beverley feel wholly let down by the justice system and the support and communication that she have receive since this appalling event the justice system around the country be piecemeal it must be improve for our victim and family child survive the southport attack she be stab over time she and her family live in my constituency will not give her name or that of her parent but ask they if they wish to have their voice hear today in the chamber commend they because they ask to read out the follow statement we welcome tough law around the purchase of knife and the wide work to reduce knife crime we be extremely focused from our direct experience on male youth violence against woman and girl but also recognise that knife crime cross many other area of our society and tackle this be complex to reduce knife crime and other act of violence perpetrate by young man and boy against woman and girl we must look at the motivation the narrative and the environment they be immerse in for we this be the hard work the work that require sustained commitment that commitment must come from we the statement go on the work to reduce knife crime must begin before young people go out to obtain knife it be sensible to make it hard to purchase knife and to tighten the law on carry knife these be tangible solution that provide quick reassurance and result but if young person be look for knife then we be too late and they be already on path to cause harm we must support parent caregiver and school well not only in how they identify and support young people who may be at risk to themselves or other we can all agree that these pathway need overhaul and the southport inquiry will serve this purpose but before that work with all child establish the fundamental of healthy relationship friendship and girl and boy be equal our young people must be expose to counter message from what they may be consume online or at home the work require be vast and complex but the long term reduction in knife crime will only be see if we go back to the start and raise our child well in the context of violence towards woman and girl current topic be important netflix show adolescence have open conversation about our child exposure to harmful messaging and theme about woman and girl we be grateful for the coverage happen this week which be far highlight the terrifying impact of andrew tate and other on vulnerable young boy commend that child parent for have the courage to write that they be clearly concerned that this will happen again urge all hon member of the house to please work together for the victim and the family let we please deal with this once and for all thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure this important debate and for his thoughtful speech join he in pay tribute to ciaran thapar whose

condolence to the family and friend of the young man who lose his life we do not yet know his identity but we know that there will be people who love he and who be suffer the most visceral pain and loss today also pay tribute to the emergency service who attend the scene this morning when this young man name be release it will join the name of other who have lose their life to serious violence and knife and gun crime in my constituency since be first elect to this place in they be jude gayle kyall parnell john ogunjobi donnell rhule glendon spence dennis anderson beatrice stoica filipe oliveira chino johnson ronaldo scott and keelen wong each one be love by their family and friend and each one leave community traumatise by their loss and the circumstance of it when knife or gun crime be report in the medium we see the name in the headline for few short hour and maybe again if the case come to trial we never hear about the ongoing trauma leave behind in the local community and the sense of loss feel not only by the immediate family but everyone who watch that person grow up and see they out and about daily those whose child go to school with they and those who recognise and know they there be sense of fear among parent that next time their child might be the victim and there be the mental health consequence of live with loss fear and anxiety the cause of knife crime be complex we need to take public health approach to it as though it be disease we should understand its pathology and take step to prevent it take hold stop its spread and treat the cause and the symptom introduce private member bill in the last parliament to stop the availability of the most horrific weapon on our street have meet the lead consultant in the emergency department at king college hospital who describe the horrific injury that be inflict by machete and zombie knife weapon that can cut through bone and serrate blade that inflict the most complex injury on internal organ they speak about the survivability of many such injury compare with wound inflict with domestic knife and describe machete and zombie knife as weapon of war on our street no one in our community need machete or zombie knife for any legitimate purpose but they have be readily available for purchase online for as little as therefore welcome the government action since july to far restrict their sale want further action on domestic knife in particular we should look at whether further restriction can be introduce regard age verification of those purchase knife with pointed blade also want action far up the chain to tackle those who exploit and groom our young people into serious violence the county line exploiter the drug dealer and the serious organise criminal who be not speak about enough in these debate in my constituency in part because of the tragedy that we have experience we have see inspire response from community organisation work with public service the embed of youth worker in hospital emergency department be pioneer by redthread at king college hospital they provide option for young people who have be injure or have see their friend injure allow they to access support to keep themselves safe welcome the government roll out that intervention in other part of the country be also grateful to the mayor of london violence reduction unit for fund ecosystem coldharbour through the my ends programme ecosystem coldharbour be coalition of grassroots organisation work with young people and family in the brixton part of my constituency it have be work for the last three year and have deliver some really impressive result it have build up the trust and confidence of young people and family so that they can access help and support it provide mentoring and training opportunity and lead the community response when tragedy occur it deliver trauma support to family and community our community feel empower by that work it be particularly inspirational to see group of mother who have all lose child to serious violence work together under the banner circle of life ignite to support each other and prevent further death be inspire by the way that young leader have be equip through that work pay tribute to the work of abdoul lelo an extraordinarily impressive young man who have be work with mcdonald in brixton to embed youth service in the restaurant it take support and positive opportunity to young people where they be there be also benefit for the staff who have often feel unsafe and overwhelmed in their workplace also pay tribute to the work of sergeant nigel pearce from central south basic command unit who have pioneer different approach to community policing base on trust and listen to the community and respond respectfully and supportively to their need and experience if we have more officer work in this way across the metropolitan police trust and confidence in policing would be much high the partnership in my constituency be call ecosystem because of the belief of the organisation in it that all the solution to serious violence be in the community but the community need help and resource to find they that be what we have have through the violence reduction unit my plea to the minister be that fund for such vital work be put on long term footing so that we can keep on deliver and work to tackle the scourge of serious violence in fact as the minister think about the design of the government young futures project invite she to visit ecosystem because we have much good practice to offer for the development of that national programme the debate today be about young people and knife crime but to tackle the scourge of knife crime we must properly understand the nature of the problem and who be affect of the victim who have be murder in my constituency since only two be under the age of the majority be young man in their cohort who grow up at time when fund for youth service be be strip away who may find themselves unable to access employment often due to minor criminal conviction who often have very poor mental health who be access deeply damage online content and for whom society can seem like it have very little to offer there be currently no protocol or good practice for tackle serious violence in that cohort the only part of the system oblige to try to help be the criminal justice system if the person in question have commit crime social service have no formal role or responsibility and mental health service be not design with this cohort in mind despite the fact that they be so often traumatise by the experience what they have witness in their community and what they have see their friend go through if we want to end the cycle of violence in our community we must turn our attention to that group they be sibling cousin and parent to the next generation the key to prevention must therefore lie in help they to turn their life around make support service more visible in our community make it easy to ask for help through service that be design with their need in mind and properly resource effective rehabilitation welcome the government focus on halve knife crime my community have suffer far too much from its devastating effect and we continue to suffer today urge the minister to work with we to devise service and intervention base on the experience in our community because we utterly reject this violence and we just want to see it stop before call the next speaker want to try and get everybody in so please can people stick to around four minute be grateful for the opportunity to speak in this debate on knife crime among child and young people an issue that continue to devastate community across the country thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure the debate very few people can say that they be not deeply concerned about the rise level of knife crime particularly among child and young people as have be hear from my constituency neighbour my hon friend the member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes in the early hour of this morning young man be stab and kill in brixton town centre that we share along with my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi our thought go to the young man and his family at this time it be tragedy but even more sadly it be tragedy that we hear far too often the late figure show that there be more than knife relate offence in england and wales last year alarmingly around one in five knife possession involve young people under the age of in there be record of homicide use sharp instrument where the victim be age between and year though those statistic be alarming we have to remember that they be not just number but young life that be be lose and with each one come family that will be leave grieve and community that be scarred know that many hon member will point to the need for more policing increase stop and search and harsh sentencing and restriction on who can buy knife as solution indeed successive government include this one have introduce measure along those line to tackle the surge in knife crime certainly will not stand here and argue that we do not need to review how we police the issue although believe that increase police measure such as stop and search need to be thoroughly think through and must be intelligence lead increase policing and sentencing be not the only solution and can not work on their own youth and knife crime be wide societal issue that require holistic approach if tough sentencing and more stop and search power be all it take we would have solve this crisis long time ago we can not take reactive step alone we have to take preventive one know conservative members do not particularly enjoy our point out their record in government but we can not let this debate go by without mention the impact of the past year this be not political point but factual one because over that time we see the systematic dismantling of the support system that help keep young people away from crime research from the ymca show that youth service have be cut by since with over youth centre close and the number of youth worker fall by third to full time equivalent role the result have be few space mentor and positive role model for young people recent unison report reveal that in england council run youth centre be close between and and only remain open in april funding for sure start child centre which provide early intervention and family support have be decimate funding for police community support officer who play vital role in build trust between police and young people have be drastically reduce school budget cut have squeeze pastoral support mental health provision and behavioural intervention increase exclusion overall the link between school exclusion and serious violence be well know exclude child often fall through the crack many enter pupil referral unit where gang recruit vulnerable young people other disengage entirely make they more susceptible to criminal activity those cut have consequence and when young people lack support opportunity or hope they become vulnerable to criminal exploitation gang step in where the state have step back it be no coincidence that as these service have disappear knife crime have rise conservative members can not ignore the direct correlation between austerity and serious youth violence but equally labour member can not either if we maintain the cut or extend they even far that be the definition of insanity do the same thing over and over again and expect different result as starting point for tackle youth violence and knife crime strongly urge the government to look at reverse the cut and invest in youth service also urge the government to look at how local council tackle the issue point to my council in the borough of lambeth lambeth make safer be launch in by councillor jacqui dyer it take public health approach to violence reduction focus on prevention early intervention and community lead solution it prioritise target outreach family support and investment in community initiative it be obviously woefully under resource but it be the sort of initiative and community drive approach that should be roll out nationwide there be no single solution to this crisis but we can begin to address it by ensure that young people have the wraparound service that we know prevent they from be involve in or the victim of crime we will now start with formal four minute time limit thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure this important debate knife crime continue to cast dark shadow over our community claim young life shatter family and leave trail of devastation in its wake last year people be stab every week in birmingham statistic that be both alarming and unacceptable within my constituency cover erdington kingstanding castle vale and south oscott the postcode have be particularly affect in it record the high number of knife relate incident in the entire city but behind those statistic be real life real family and real pain when knife crime tear through family it destroy life and devastate entire community just week ago this crisis strike my family turn our world upside down my nephew kind hearted wonderful young man be brutally attack in an act of senseless knife violence his crime be be in the wrong place at the wrong time while his wound be heal it will take month for he to fully recover the emotional trauma inflict on he and our family however be immeasurable this be pain no family should ever have to endure yet it be pain that far too many be force to bear knife crime thrive in the shadow of neglect fourteen year of austerity under the last government gutte our community strip away of the support system that once guide and protect young people in erdington the closure of the malcolm locker youth centre in mark the end of the last council run youth service in my constituency the cut have leave void that be too often fill by despair and violence be glad that this government have recognise the problem of knife crime and include provision to address it in the crime and policing bill but we can and must do more have always say that prevention be well than cure and while the police play vital role in tackle crime sustainable solution require preventive community lead and partnership drive approach in birmingham we have inspire example in organisation like bringing hope which have work with for many year which work relentlessly to tackle knife crime among child and young people similarly the ymca in erdington be unwavere in its dedication to our young people on my recent visit celebrate with they the purchase of flat ensure that young people have safe place to live and access to the support they need initiative like those show we the way forward we must create great aspiration and opportunity for young people offer they future beyond life of crime that require long term investment in our community our youth service and the organisation already make difference say that we can always go even far upstream to support family and end deprivation in community like mine my nephew do not deserve what happen to he nobody do yet too many family be still leave to feel this pain and too many young people be still become victim we can no long afford to be complacent every moment of inaction put another young life at risk we must come together across the house and within our community to break this cycle of violence thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for bring forward this important debate and for his move speech also want to mention my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton be sorry for what happen to her family knife crime devastate community across the country as organise criminal gang lure child and young people into county line network and organised criminality too many community have see child criminally exploit and sadly we have see the devastating consequence of knife crime in my constituency in huddersfield khayri mclean and harley brown sadly lose their life to knife crime in recent year these be young life cruelly take too soon too many parent be deal with consequence that no parent should have to face community be leave break and too many child and young people be leave with mental scar the home secretary announcement of ronan law along with the launch of the coalition to tackle knife crime the young futures prevention partnership and the young futures hub be all welcome and important step forward by introduce strict regulation on online knife sale and develop an extensive understanding of the root cause of knife crime we be make it hard for young people to access those weapon in the first place and encourage different safe pathway the measure be welcome but alone they will not be enough hon member have raise social medium company and the use of spotify by gang member and so call influencer whereby algorithm be unfortunately drive this divisive behaviour but that can not be see in isolation from what be happen on the ground kirklees council cover my constituency of huddersfield have see decrease in funding for its youth service since we know the loss of youth service have be link to rise in youth crime within six year of the closure we must invest in youth service community outreach and early intervention despite the difficult financial outlook many incredible organisation support young people in my constituency include positive stepz conscious youth central stars youth club team kickstart yorkshire community development empower boxpower and temple well be the deputy mayor of west yorkshire have also introduce an navigator and community link programme as other member have mention those help to identify and signpost young people to the right support network at the early opportunity those organisation deliver outstanding community service to our young people offer they experience opportunity and environment that allow they to thrive however despite their good effort the financial constraint that they face have result in many have to reduce their service they continue to have to fight for small pot of funding which be not sustainable in the long term the evidence be clear when youth service be cut young people suffer will the minister provide detail of when the young futures hub will be introduce be keen for huddersfield and town like our to be early adopter alongside city we must also give community the tool to tackle this problem from the ground up it be usually local people and local community who well understand the issue but they often find themselves fight against the system rather than be support by it no parent should ever have to bury their child and no community should have to live in fear look forward to continue to work with member from across the house alongside the government to stamp out this epidemic of senseless violence thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for bring this debate to the house and commend colleague for their powerful speech it be clear that there be an undeniable consensus across the house on the need to get this right however consensus alone be not enough national crisis have devastate family and shattered future and it continue to cause damage the office for national statistics report knife relate offence in in just one year life be affect and there be incident of fear injury and sadly for some tragedy in my gillingham and rainham constituency we have several incident in recent year include the stabbing of year old boy in the town centre by two other young people member across the house will be familiar with visit local school in their constituency and many will agree that student be often the tough crowd never shy of ask direct and uncompromising question with grilling that would put any select committee to the test time and again however one issue persist safety student ask why they should feel afraid to walk through their high street in the evening why their community do not feel safe and why more be not be do to protect they it trouble that most of that stand in stark contrast to my own experience grow up in the very same community and in the same area wish to tell those student that the fear and the sense of abandonment that they feel today be not inevitable some of it be the direct result of year of neglect in reality the conservatives leave behind legacy of cut and at time indifference to the future of young people across this country they dismantle the very support system design to keep young people safe billion be strip from youth service youth centre be shut down and youth worker be lose the evidence be clear every invest in youth work prevent great cost down the line in view knife crime as the public health crisis that it truly be we must recognise that the principle of upstream prevention have never be more pertinent the truth be that by the time young person pick up knife we have already fail they that be why the government coalition on knife crime be significant step in the right direction allow we to get to the root cause of knife crime not just the symptom also welcome the home secretary commitment to bring back neighbourhood policing which will work towards restore the trust and presence that have be dismantle community such as mine be desperate for officer who will build relationship prevent crime before it happen and reassure those who have lose faith however we can not arrest our way out of this crisis we must invest in young people not only to steer they away from crime but to offer they future beyond it like many other have binge watch the compelling drama adolescence which highlight so well the toxic online culture that our young people be expose to do my hon friend agree that when we think about violence against woman and girl and role model for young man we need great focus on protect the future of our young man include by think about how we can help they to deal with the challenge they face in order to make they safe and give they space within our community completely agree with my hon friend we must support our young man the start of that journey be to tackle the toxic and concern material find online we must ensure that the social medium company with their billion be do the right thing in manage that content which do not believe they be do at the moment we must tackle head on that culture that seek to legitimise and glorify misogyny gang violence and exploit vulnerability we must prevent our young people from be drag into cycle of harm before they even realise what be happen this be our opportunity and our responsibility to work across party to break the cycle rebuild what have be lose and assure our community that never again will generation grow up believe that carry knife be their only protection option and future pay tribute to the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure this important debate and for his powerful speech the devastating impact of knife crime be feel at the heart of my vauxhall and camberwell green constituency the most heartbreaking thing do as an mp be speak to parent who have just hear that their precious son or daughter have be take away far too young by knife crime no parent should have to bury their child when sit there try to comfort family through something so horrific glance over their shoulder and see the picture of that smile face of the innocent young life that have be rob should never have to get use to that but we all have to do it as member of parliament my hon friend the member for clapham and brixton hill bell ribeiro addy highlight some of the statistic and as awful as they be in their own right we must remember in talk about they that someone love every single one of they friend an aunt an uncle brother grandparent mother sister family they be now devastate about lose someone who have barely start their life let touch on the wide impact of knife crime on community which we do not focus on enough when be on the london assembly author the gang associated girls report in which we consider the impact that knife crime can have on girl and young woman who if we be honest may not often be view as the immediate victim of knife crime but who go through long term trauma as result of their experience in number of incident it be young woman and girl who be the first at the scene it be the same young woman and girl who help the community grieve it be the same young woman and girl who organise the funeral and when the glare of the medium have go and the incident be out of the news cycle it be the same young woman and girl who go back to lay flower at the cemetery remember the key anniversary even if those young woman and girl be not present at hospital after knife crime we must remember that this be also about their long term trauma it be important that we do not forget their voice in this debate that be why we need holistic approach to address this issue the whole community need to come together if we be to break the vicious cycle of knife crime and the chain of trauma that impact so many of our young people rob they of their future it sadden that just few week ago there be tragic shooting in my constituency and in line of sight from playground at primary school be the blue line that say police line do not cross imagine the impact on those child it be vital that we continue to work across party to address knife crime it be not about politic it be about young people die on our street up and down the country be pleased to see the government commit to the young futures programme which will champion the vital youth worker who be the lifeline that many of these young people need if we be honest those youth worker have not be pay properly and many have lose their job and see their youth centre close we need to continue speak about this and know that the government will continue to work with we to make sure we address the vicious cycle that be rob so many of our young people of their life congratulate the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty and all those who have work to secure this important debate on knife crime which have be deeply vexing issue in our society for decade today we be once again at point where further action be need to save life as we have hear in so many powerful contribution from member across the chamber be pleased to see in the excellent briefing for the debate by the safer knives group that professor john crichton of the royal college of psychiatrists in scotland have bring his expertise to the work of that group his study on knife crime reduction in scotland show that the scottish violence reduction unit strategy of target young man carry knife in public lead to reduction in offensive weapon charge and drop in sharp instrument homicide between and these approach show that restrict immediate access to knife reduce offence and save life but crucially as other member have point out they must be complement by preventive approach to knife crime focus on possession of knife among young people and on awareness at the time of that important work be initiate there be huge concern in scotland about the level of knife crime in the police in scotland catch someone with knife every minute in the scottish parliament hold knife crime summit follow petition bring to the parliament by john muir of greenock whose son damian be murder with knife in it be privilege for to work alongside john in his campaign in my role as shadow justice secretary in holyrood at the time although john campaign do call for tough penalty for knife crime in sentencing it also focus on the need to raise awareness of the trauma that so often follow someone decision to carry knife for which there be often many complex reason as we have hear today john go into school to take his powerful personal message to young people which really have an impact at the time today in scotland sadly there be worrying trend on knife crime in the wrong direction the crime statistic for scotland show that in there be nearly offence of handling of an offensive weapon an increase from the previous year and there have be an increase in homicide in methil in my constituency the community have be particularly disturb by social medium post of violent attack in the community in one post young person brandish knife and they be later attack with knife and slash in the face the fear be that if further action be not take to address these incident more young people will be seriously injure and could lose their life scottish ministers must ensure that local police have the resource they need to deal with these incident alongside the other intervention in the community that be require to support these young people we must have the right legislation in place to restrict the sale of knife so welcome the measure bring forward by ministers particularly in the aftermath of the horrific attack in southport which my hon friend the member for south ribble mr foster speak powerfully about we be once more at point where further measure be urgently need to protect our young people from knife crime in community across the uk the impassioned call for action from those whose life have be devastate by these crime have be give voice by member across the chamber and my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton speak powerfully about her personal experience this must move we all be confident that these voice have be hear and that this parliament will act and do more to protect our young people from knife crime norfolk as rule be safe county with generally low than average rate of crime it be wonderful place to live and many people who grow up there as do have fantastic childhood but that be sadly not the case for every young person we face an increase challenge with the intertwining of knife crime and county line activity in our area which be have devastating effect and will focus my remark on that element since become member of parliament have meet emma and phil dix whose year old son joe be tragically stab to death in my constituency in three young man be find guilty of his murder joe parent have speak about how they feel joe be exploit by county line drug dealer and become trap in vicious cycle want to quote what emma his mum have say do think we ve really tackle the root cause of why people be carry and use knife particularly in norfolk unfortunately we ve bury it under the sand for quite while some of it go to be relate to mental health exploitation and groom as well we know that with lot of incident cause through county line people will go to the police due to their fear of repercussion as the minister know the term county line refer to the mobile phone line use to take order of drug and it have be strongly link to violent offence include knife crime recently meet she to discuss this issue and welcome her engagement on it it be also focus for police in norfolk since its creation five year ago norfolk county line team have reportedly investigate more than phone line with charge and more than year in prison sentence welcome that because it be vital that those run these line who so often cruelly exploit young people be bring to justice emma and phil have since set up the joe dix foundation and they have welcome the government plan to recognise child criminal exploitation as stand alone offence in the crime and policing bill they have also call for national register for all perpetrator who be convict of child criminal exploitation and wonder whether the minister could reply directly to that in her response their story like that of so many family across our country underline why this government commitment to tackle knife crime be so important and it be why welcome this debate and thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure it to tackle county line and knife crime among young people we must focus on prevention intervention education and tackle the root cause welcome the recently launch coalition to tackle knife crime which emma and phil be member of it be welcome collaboration because it be only through listen to the voice of those on the ground that we will find solution to these issue recently hold youth engagement forum with community group and young people across norwich north and the overall message be the importance of multiple organisation collaborate on early intervention measure to prevent young people from go down dangerous path and to give they opportunity agree strongly with the call for public health approach as councillor in london in the constituency of my hon friend the member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi see that at first hand as well as the work of many community group there in my constituency organisation such as the joe dix foundation map norfolk ymca sprowston youth engagement project future projects and the district council all do fantastic work and pay tribute to they most importantly we must listen to young people young people at that roundtable raise range of issue we have cover today include the need for more youth friendly space the lack of opportunity for work experience and employment and the need to tackle online harm particularly welcome the young futures programme and the hub that will be set up only by take holistic approach to combat knife crime will we begin to pull it out at its root be clear that collaboration with young people and those on the frontline be key the youth endowment fund have highlight many of the most effective solution when it come to reduce violent crime we have the evidence with this government we have the political will we have consensus on both side of the house that we must work together to tackle knife crime because none of we can sit back while precious life be be lose and young people life be be destroy thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure this vital debate knife crime among child and young people be some of the most devastating incident to occur in our constituency last summer in southend east and rochford there be multiple machete attack on our beach and high street that be incredibly troubling and set about meet the family and business affect be also currently in the process of commission youth summit to see what we can do and to find the gap in the community and the thing we do not know through the eye and voice of our young people as hon member may or may not know essex be in the top county for report knife crime as parent friend and family member of young people be sure we all feel sheer horror when we hear about incident involve knife and every single offence be one too many as young man as boy be attack number of time with knife and be very lucky to survive it break my mum heart know that she could not protect every time leave the house and that be one reason why have not share this story publicly too widely have spend the last year mentor and support young people can see how hard it be traverse neighbourhood and as my hon friend the member for birmingham erdington paulette hamilton say sometimes someone be just in the wrong place at the wrong time knife crime ruin live and this debate be particularly tough have known people include childhood friend who lose their life from knife crime or drug crime have sit in the living room talk to family who have lose young person and that be scenario and set that no one ever want to go through the pain that you see and feel emanating from the parent and family because of the loss of that young person be something you just can not describe wholeheartedly welcome our labour government commitment to halve violent knife crime in decade and we have not waste any time to deliver on that commitment ronan law introduce strict online sale regulation to prevent weapon from fall into the hand of young people that include new offence such as possess knife or an offensive weapon with intent and it increase the maximum penalty for manufacturing sell hire or lend prohibit weapon it create new offence of child criminal exploitation and cuckooing which be often associate with county line it be essential not only that we ban the selling of machete and sharp weapon but that we make kitchen knife safe and have strategy of prevention young people in southend east and rochford much like in other coastal community face unique set of challenge the conversation today be not just about urban community or even immigration it be about validation self esteem boredom and role model or the absence of they such thing be huge contributing factor to what we see play out with the violence that our young people be enact on each other we have high unemployment and high level of health inequality and we often feel the brunt of the lack of transport and connectivity the change that the government be propose can not come quickly enough rise to speak on behalf of my constituent across luton south and south bedfordshire who have sadly have to come together to stand against knife crime on too many occasion in recent year there be consistent failure by the previous conservative government to toughen up legislation on dangerous weapon as well as failure to ensure proper funding for our police force as we have hear from many member across the house and agree sustain cut to youth service combine to allow knife crime epidemic to take hold in our town and city knife crime destroy life devastate family and leave last trauma on community and behind every one of the statistic be person whose life remain ever change or sadly be needlessly lose sadly in luton we be all too familiar with the devastation that knife crime cause but perhaps

conservatives our labour government have be ambitious in our mission to get knife off our street and ensure that people across our town and community be safe from violent crime with our commitment to halve knife crime in decade our labour government have already ban the ownership of zombie style knife and machete and measure in our flagship crime and policing bill will go far to crack down on knife crime like other welcome the emphasis on prevention through our young futures programme and other initiative tackle knife crime be also an important part of the police and crime plan of bedfordshire labour police and crime commissioner john tizard work jointly with bedfordshire veru will the minister inform the house whether any additional funding will be announce for bedfordshire veru to ensure that it can continue its excellent work to keep our local community safe take together these measure will directly improve support for child and young people who be sadly often most at risk of be perpetrator but also victim of knife crime thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure this important debate knife crime among child and young people be national emergency that should shame we all with knife crime offence involve child report in the year end march this crisis can not be ignore each one of those offence represent young person catch in violence someone son someone daughter someone who deserve well in croydon where we have some of the high rate of knife violence in london and where too many young people have lose their life we know the impact

commitment to halve knife crime over the next year and the urgency with which they be take action include go after the criminal gang that be groom our child into crime and traffic they across the country introduce ronan law to crack down on the online sale of knife and ban zombie knife however it be not enough to be tough on knife crime we must be just as tough on its complex cause welcome this government plan to roll out the young futures programme as be often say it take village to raise child but with universal youth service see cut in funding since and young people often stick for year on waiting list for child and adolescent mental health service where be that village today what can young people point to that demonstrate that this country be willing to invest in they to back they and to support they urge the government to move fast in prioritise the wellbeing of our child because as be also say if child be not embrace by the village it will burn it down to feel its warmth

croydon university hospital the groundbreake my ends programme reach higher which support young people in school community and at home croydon drop in which offer free mental health support and

provide outreach and run youth hub in hard to reach area put simply croydon youth engagement team save life as the government build their young futures programme and look to create national youth strategy urge the government to ensure that they work with and not against the grassroots organisation that know their community well provide long term funding for youth centre provision in local area and look at increase statutory protection for local youth service so that they be give the priority they deserve knife crime among child and young people be devastating but not inevitable now be the time to invest in prevention as well as enforcement to listen to those work on the frontline of this crisis and to give our young people the support they need because our community family and young people deserve well this be timely debate as members consider the knife crime provision of the crime and policing bill only last week congratulate the backbench business committee on grant time for it and thank the hon member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for his compelling speech we have hear some emotional speech which show the empathy that member on both side of the house have for victim of knife crime and their family over the year have meet constituent who have have their life irrevocably change by knife crime whether it result in the murder or love one or serious injury have speak with mother who have lose their child and adult child who have lose their elderly parent after they be stab to death knife crime can affect anyone and the pain that the survive family member live with after such horrific event be palpable the minister will know that want to talk about harm reduction have speak about this in this house and with she on several occasion two third of knife that have be identify as have be use to kill people be kitchen knife that be in death where we know what the weapon be that statistic should not be surprising many murder be unplanned and commit on the spur of the moment with little thought and kitchen knife be the weapon most readily to hand there have be much in the medium this week about the new netflix drama series adolescence which be commentary on the many problem face by young people grow up not just knife crime but it highlight how an easily accessible weapon can be use to cause devastation and change the course of many people live forever for year bereaved family support group youth group and school have call for the government of the day to do something tangible to stop this and to allow child to have childhood their call be now join by prominent voice such as those of idris elba and stephen graham the latter describe pandemic of knife crime in our country know that this government be listen and want to make change but we need to do it quickly and thoroughly the previous government measure do not go far enough the new measure in the crime and policing bill go far but more can still be do there be grow campaign to phase out kitchen knife with pointed tip as an everyday household item and replace they with kitchen knife with rounded tip as the hon member for huntingdon mention it be well document that point knife be more likely to pierce vital organ and sever artery injury that be far more likely to be fatal rounded knife be much less likely to cause lethal injury and most of we rarely use the pointed end of kitchen knife when cook the crime and policing bill limit the purchase of new knife but there be already million of pointed kitchen knife in drawer around the country the safe knife group of which be member have suggest pilot scheme to convert pointed kitchen knife into safe rounded tip knife we need to encourage manufacturer to replace pointed knife with rounded knife and to discourage the sale of pointed knife by create price differential as have say make knife safe be only one step in reduce the number of death and serious injury education intervention and support follow the method of the scottish violence reduction unit would produce long term solution it be also vital that we collect more datum on the type of knife use in any knife relate crime information policy change legislation and expert advice be all important but it all have to lead to change of behaviour so that community stop kill each other with knife and that must be national priority know the minister agree with on that but we must see action and we all have to work on that call the liberal democrat spokesperson the epidemic of knife crime be an issue that have address many time in this place although never in debate specifically target its impact on child and young people commend the hon and gallant member for huntingdon ben obese jecty on secure this debate on such significant matter in britain we face hard truth young people be increasingly involve in violent crime and the cycle be become ever more entrenched figure from the ben kinsella trust show that across the country some young people under the age of have be kill by knife crime in the last year of they be year old or young child be be expose to the tragic normalisation of stabbing we have sleepwalk into scenario in which many young people feel it be safe and easy to carry knife to defend themselves in this context threat of punishment be unsurprisingly fail to deter violent behaviour knife crime should be treat as the societal disease it be and we can not afford to just treat the symptom any more if this government be to truly tackle knife crime they must address its root the deep seat factor that drive young people to such violence in the first place to tackle knife crime we must stop it before it start we must use public health approach that address the root cause fear trauma lack of opportunity and social exclusion this approach have many tenet some of which will outline today and begin with education when young people carry knife it be often out of fear not necessarily desire to harm other study by the ben kinsella trust reveal that over one in three young people do not feel safe in their own community some do not feel safe walk the street and two third report anxiety over knife crime in their area the teenage brain be wire differently from that of adult we know that tendency towards impulsive and risky behaviour be much more common during adolescence study show that in many case knife crime occur in the heat of the moment when an altercation could have be resolve without serious injury if weapon have not be present that be exactly why we must address knife crime before it happen before knife be pull from pocket and the situation escalate beyond control education can play principal part in challenge the misconception that carry knife somehow make person safe we can teach young people the real consequence of carry such weapon how it destroy life impact family and perpetuate fear among their peer and in community the hon gentleman be make an excellent speech that think all of we across the house would agree with have speak number of time with harlow police about knife and knife crime not just in harlow but across essex they do lot of work with school do he agree that it be important that school fully engage with the police on these issue and do not feel that there be stigma in do so all school need to engage with that process completely agree will come on to that later in my speech have speak to the organiser and leader of the chris donovan trust in my constituency they speak about the challenge of get into some school to talk about knife crime because of the perception that talk about it be problem in itself that be so frustrating to hear we need to have honest open conversation with young people in school teacher must be equip with material to educate the next generation so that we break the cycle of violence even if child be not at risk of commit knife relate offence educational programme serve critical role they can teach child about the consequence of knife crime long before they consider carry weapon that be vital we need to reach young people and win the war for their heart and mind before the prevail climate of fear and the harbinger of toxic mindset start their offensive urge the government to consider introduce mandatory personal social health and economic lesson on the consequence of weapon possession and to put the principle of restorative practice on the curriculum in recognition of the great work of group such as the chris donovan trust in my constituency we teach child from an early age about the danger of disease cause by smoking or alcohol why then be we not have open discussion with they about the health risk associate with carry knife create safe space for discussion and build relationship with young people can ensure intervention before thought of crime arise and death can be prevent to fully realise the nourishing community focus element of public health approach though we must invest in youth service and community programme that engage young people win the war for heart and mind mean provide young people with opportunity to build skill pursue education and find alternative to gang culture and criminal activity however as be mention in many speech we have see dramatic decline in youth service fund over recent year with cut total billion since this have leave too many young people without the support they need invest in youth service be not just about provide safe space it be about provide young people with alternative to violence so that we break the cycle of crime shift the culture of violence and empower community to work together to prevent crime before it escalate the target early help and integrate support team at sutton borough council in my constituency do exactly this kind of work offer opportunity to young people who be not often afford the luxury of such attention elsewhere in their life however these programme rely heavily on grant from the mayor office for policing and crime the ministry of justice and violence reduction service those grant be subject to constant uncertainty often approve at the last minute and often only allocate for month to two year period prevent proper forward planning we must do well than that we need to consistently get serious funding to these initiative in timely manner echo the call from the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes about fund for these community scheme lib dem members will continue to push the government to make youth diversion statutory duty so that every part of the country have pre charge diversion scheme for young people up to the age of that will ensure well outcome for young people and less strain on police resource but let we be honest with ourselves police resource be already strain beyond break point in too many place and education and early intervention alone be not enough to properly implement public health approach visible community police start with actual police number in our london borough to tackle knife crime it be important for young people to see bobby on the beat in london their active and engaged presence create sense of safety and security we have to get back to meaningful community police return the police to their proper duty as positive engaging arm of the state in people life build trust between young people and the police be also crucial this trust communicate that there be no need to carry knife for protection as young people know that the police be there to keep they safe as have say before when year old ilyas habibi be stab to death outside sutton station in my constituency in december he be just minute away from police station if we can not expect visible policing in town centre and the area close to police station how little have we come to expect of community police to be clear that be not criticism of the police but criticism of successive government and mayor who have consistently fail to get the police the resource they need to do their job in london far too many police be abstract away from the community they be suppose to serve to help plug gap be deeply concerned to learn of sadiq khan budgeting decision which have lead to dedicated police officer in school in london be remove under the new met for london plan officer will no long be station in school as part of the safe school officer programme while the plan claim that officer will still work closely with school the change reduce the consistent direct contact between officer and young people that contact be crucial in build relationship with young people to foster trust there should be plenty of positive interaction and experience with the police throughout young people formative year that can be achieve through school assembly or classroom workshop young people need to understand that the police be there to keep they safe on the street and be not the enemy but when sparse police resource be focus on only the most extreme form of deterrence such as live facial recognition and stop and search and when there be no community focus it be unsurprise that they do not the hallmark of meaningful public health approach that invest not just money but serious political capital be that it bring together all group in our community it create coalition of care break down the silo between project and build team across society commit to do what it take to rescue young people on behalf of countless expert professional and parent and on behalf of young people implore the government to build that team to create that coalition of care and to finally implement meaningful public health approach to knife crime call the shadow minister first and foremost pay my respect to all those mention today who have lose their life due to knife crime and to their family too many family and community have be and be be tear apart by knife crime welcome the constructive compassionate and collaborative approach that member from all part of the house have take to the debate this matter be far too important and the impact be far too devastating for anything but share focus on address and reduce this most violent of crime we can not allow ourselves to be back here in few year with more name and more story but no meaningful progress no family friend or school should lose love one to knife crime yet far too often that be the reality as other have do put on record my gratitude and admiration to our courageous police officer across the country who work tirelessly and fearlessly to help keep we and our community safe thank my hon and gallant friend the member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure this vital debate and for its emphasis on knife crime among young people we all recognise the prevalence and impact of knife crime as whole but the nuance that affect young people be integral and develop an understanding of this problem both as it stand today and as it will develop in the future be important as my hon friend and other hon member have say the world that young people occupy be multilayere it be hybrid of online and offline where boundary merge coercion persist and the reality of the consequence of action be too often overlook until it be too late young people be be expose to thing at much young age than ever before and the impact of normalising and desensitise they to crime and violence be still not fully understand although the number of hospital admission for knife crime have decline from its peak the figure remain far too high we know the impact that knife crime have on young people so we must work to get knife out of perpetrator hand thank to research by the youth endowment fund we have relatively clear picture of knife crime rate among young people small but by no mean insignificant number of young people carry offensive weapon in the last two year of the to year old survey admit to carry offensive weapon of which be knife this illustrate that while only minority of those involve in serious offence be knife carrier their impact on community be significant of course that be nationwide figure and rate will be significantly high in part of the country where knife crime be especially prevalent over the past decade number of step have be take to reduce knife crime although violence against the person have decrease significantly since knife crime remain stubbornly high this suggest that specific targeted action be require to reduce knife crime offence particularly among young people much need measure to close loophole and introduce restriction on zombie knife be put forward and pass under the last government and implement by the current one additionally welcome the measure in the crime and policing bill that replicate those in the last government criminal justice bill by place more stringent rule on knife possession and expand police power three key measure outline in the bill the creation of an offence of possess bladed item with intent to harm the increase in the maximum penalty for sell weapon to and the power to seize retain and destroy bladed article have all rightly be include increase the penalty for those sell knife to be clearly step forward in enforce strict law and protect young people ensure that there be penalty for range of weapon be use by young people be vital as the police have highlight that individual use social network specifically to advertise range of weapon to stephen clayman review provide detailed assessment of the online sale of knife understand that the measure draw from the assessment will be introduce as amendment to the crime and policing bill so it would be useful to hear from the minister what impact she believe they will have on knife sale do she expect significant reduction in accessibility for those who currently acquire weapon online when consider online sale we must not be naive datum show that significant number of weapon hold by young people be kitchen knife which as note by my hon friend the member for huntingdon be widely accessible as member of different party have highlight today engagement prevention and police intervention be crucial tool in not only prevent individual from commit crime but protect young people who be far too often the victim of offence commit by their peer stop and search save life and must play role in address and prevent incident of knife crime by disrupt and remove weapon from the street the police must have the necessary power to prevent crime because far too many life be be violently cut short research publish in the oxford journal of policing find that attempt murder could be reduce by through stop and search know that the police can stop and search be powerful deterrent thank the shadow minister for her comment yes the police have vital role to play in deal with knife crime do she agree that our youth worker who work with some of the most vulnerable young people up and down the country be also key defence in stop knife crime in some instance young people who be catch up in vicious cycle of crime trust youth worker more than they trust the police thank the hon member who be so engaged and invest in this issue for her comment youth worker teacher and guardian anyone whom child trust be important in address this issue and we must ensure that everybody have the power and that society have the power need to address knife crime any action that help reduce knife crime be an action that we should be look at as well as stop and search emerge technology for example device that allow the detection of knife at distance and in crowded street could allow officer to more precisely identify and remove knife from would be perpetrator alongside enforcement prevention and early intervention require attention and the conservatives do make advance on that while in government between and violence reduction unit be fund in area of england and wales where there be prevalence of violent crime accord to home office evidence these have lead to statistically significant reduction in hospital admission for violent injury since the funding begin an estimate hospital admission for violent injury have be prevent in these fund area we must also ensure that the police have the ability to be in the right place at the right time as we have hear from member across the house too often it be be in the wrong place at the wrong time that lead to injury through knife crime this be particularly crucial for young people who congregate in hotspot area so ensure that our police force have the resource to increase patrol and increase their presence in such area play key role in both prevention and response acknowledge that the government have place significant emphasis on the delivery of young futures hub to identify the young people most at risk of be draw into crime while we all recognise the benefit of provide support to young people the effectiveness of the hub will depend on implementation resource must be distribute effectively to ensure that young people receive the support they need particularly give the range of activity that the government intend the hub to carry out alongside the reduction in knife crime may therefore ask the minister how the hub will be structure and what work will take place outside their physical space to ensure effective engagement and early intervention we have see police and crime commissioner use their independence to explore programme that can provide early intervention for instance thames valley pcc matthew barber operation deter youth ensure that youth offend service make contact with arrest for weapon or violent offence within minute of notification of arrest follow by house visit within hour be not ask the minister to be prescriptive but will she ensure that police force have the government backing to trial innovative technique such as knife scanning and new preventive technique to help save young life fundamentally what be her plan to change the mindset that have develop that enable child to stab and murder other child reduce knife crime among young people be critical task for this and any government when we hear the name that we have hear today of some of the many too many young life that have be lose to knife crime we be remind that these be not just statistic but devastating event that bring untold anguish to family we must do everything possible to bring down the number let start by thank the hon and gallant member for huntingdon ben obese jecty for secure this debate on an issue that matter enormously to we all as ever his opening speech be

want change and we be determined to deliver it call ben obese jecty to wind up quickly knife crime among child and young people have for too long be stain on this country and our community and blight on our collective social conscience the increase involvement of child both as perpetrator and victim can not and should not be ignore it be this at its heart that collectively we must change and look to the government to grasp the nettle on that although the public health approach that they be likely to adopt have merit there be need for sustained impassione intervention to prevent our child from become murderer and to remove this fictional threat that they be buy into to make they feel safe even when they actually already be thank all member who have speak for take the time to contribute to this important debate and for pay tribute to those who have lose their life be pleased that we have be able to put heat and light on some of the often overlook aspect of the cause of this issue and on the potential solution too there be much to do in address the root cause of this issue and we have try to cover myriad factor as broadly as we can but be conscious that this topic be too broad to solve in just one debate hope that collectively we have raise issue that give the government pause to consider when develop their own strategy to achieve their aim would dearly love it if none of we ever have to raise the issue of knife crime in this house again question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider the matter of knife crime amongst child and young people coastal communities beg to move that this house have consider coastal community be delighted to be lead my first ever debate in this chamber on the vital topic of coastal community be very grateful to member from across the house who support my application for the debate and thank the backbench business committee for grant it this be the first debate on coastal community of this new parliament and it could not come soon enough there be number of traditional divide into which people break our country rural versus urban affluent versus deprive industrial versus agrarian however the divide between coastal and inland community be often overlook yet this divide have wide range impact and lead to unique situation for these area in fact many of my constituent in north norfolk may share far more similar experience with our coastal sibling in cornwall almost eight hour away than with those just half an hour down the road in norwich what coastal community across the country often feel be that despite the incredible contribution they make to our country economically culturally and environmentally the system be not work for they our health and economic outcome be poor than those of our inland neighbour our environment be battle the challenge of climate change coastal erosion and the sewage dump scandal but despite that the government do not seem to think that we be worthy of proper representation in the form of dedicated coastal community minister turn now to the health challenge face by our coastal community in professor sir chris whitty publish landmark report into the health outcome in seaside town and coastal community what he uncover be shocking we have high rate of poor health and disease the rate of cardiovascular disease and cancer be high and those diagnose with these disease have poor outcome they also suffer with they for long datum show that on average resident in hull live more than of their life in poor health around quarter more than the national average that result in low quality of life and wellbeing great reliance on the health service and short live overall the work of hull public health department under the leadership of mike ross and the liberal democrat lead council there to tackle these challenging statistic be commendable but coastal health inequality need to receive more direct government attention the disparity in life expectancy that be find be particularly shocking want to take member on brief tour of my norfolk neighbour to outline this point for they to the east of my constituency be great yarmouth and to the south be broadland these area be very nearby they share similar amenity in many situation and they have share frustration with the however baby bear in great yarmouth have life expectancy four year short than that of one bear just over the border in broadland both these baby would be proud norfolk resident both live within touching distance of our broads national park both may even grow up sit in adjacent seat at carrow road football ground but the challenge that we face in coastal town and community mean that there would be disparity in their health in their wellbeing and even in how long they live for community so nearby so similar this can not be see as an acceptable status quo our coastal community deserve to live long well healthy life than they do now north norfolk face its own coastal health challenge we have lose the blakeney surgery which serve many coastal village with otherwise poor transport link benjamin court reablement centre have be close down for now remove vital asset that allow local people to recover outside of hospital and nearer their family cromer hospital also need the support and funding to provide more service close to our coastal community prevent they from have to travel to norwich for vital healthcare professor whitty point out that coastal community share many more of these challenge with each other than with their inland neighbour it be clear to he that action need to be take we all listen to he when he be on our tv screen during the pandemic and hope that the government will take his advice just as seriously now our coastal community be major economic driver we have thriving tourism industry which contribute billion year to our economy before the pandemic strike it support hundred of thousand of job across the country our hospitality industry play host to talented hotelier chef publican chip shop owner and many more visit to the blakeney hotel enjoy lobster and crab at rocky bottoms in west runton pint at the hill house in happisburgh or some dessert at crumble crib in sheringham be all excellent idea for anyone take trip to our part of the world tourist have be do this for century jane austen sing the praise of cromer in my constituency in emma describe it as the good of all the sea bath place although must say that the whole of north norfolk qualify for that level of praise my constituency could not be further from the sea however have spend many happy holiday in cromer and sheringham and be delighted that he have be return to the house as the representative of those wonderful community will he tell how wonderful cromer sheringham and the north norfolk coast be prefer to swim in the sea in sheringham rather than cromer do he agree make absolutely no comment on the latter question but welcome the hon member contribution no advance sight be give of my speech her presence here serve to remind we all that it be not just mp represent coastal community who have stake in their prosperity thank she for she almost perfectly time word in more recent time we have the pier of the year in cromer the excellent north cottage in cromer run by andrea and jerry be recently award self cater accommodation of the year at the suffolk and norfolk tourism award cromer also play host to banksy artwork from his tour of the east coast the artwork of queue of hermit crab look on at empty shell highlight one of our great challenge in coastal community second home and the wide housing crisis in north norfolk we have be plague by huge number of second home and empty home outside the city of london we have the high number of empty or infrequently use home in all of england these property be carve the core out of many small and historical community and in too many case contribute very little back our poor be sit on ever grow waiting list while the rich treat our coastal village as setting for jane austen era summer jaunt leave they to suffer for the rest of the year in wells next the sea of the town be second home and holiday let in some part only one in home be someone main residence be delighted that after year of lobbying we be able to levy council tax increase on those second home that will bring in million for the district council allow it to support more affordable housing and provide homelessness service jane austen mention not only cromer but ramsgate in pride and certainly in less salubrious way than she may have refer to cromer ramsgate and wells next the sea share the concern that the hon member mention about short term holiday let do he support the call that many colleague and have make for not just registration scheme but licensing scheme for short term holiday let in order for local authority to be able to control and shape their own local economy it be not ideological we must be pragmatic in these thing the right sort of holiday let can bring in welcome tourism to north norfolk but there be safety issue regard regulation which be very sympathetic to would be very interested in talk in more detail about our share interest in this matter at another time congratulate the hon member on secure this important debate that affect so many constituency around the country in sea view street in cleethorpes there have be noticeable uptick in the number of airbnbs that street have unique identity and the airbnbs be take away from the impact of local business and the local tourist trade because they be use those shop façade do he think that more should be do to reduce the airbnbs and protect the unique identity of some of these shopping street do think that more should be do it be classic example both of unintended consequence from the explosion of successful tech platform that be originally design for people to let out spare room and be now mainstream booking platform and of the inevitable fact that legislation move more slowly than life again would be interested in further discussion on that topic which affect we both in cornwall we be not alone in the struggle about second home be sit empty while it be also in the midst of critical housing crisis be the hon member surprise to hear that reform be campaign locally in cornwall against second home yet nationally it vote against taxis on second home thank the hon member for his contribution be little surprised be not too familiar with reform tax policy but be not sure whether that be just or most of we nevertheless hope that have do my neighbour the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice favour by raise some of the challenge in his constituency be sure that he will be most supportive of whatever be in its good interest cornish liberal democrats include my hon friend the members for st ives andrew george and for north cornwall ben maguire be fight hard on this issue to their great credit as be many in the house our coastal economy do however face struggle from to half of coastal town see decline in employment compare with only of inland community we have much high rate of self employment and part time employment and by the nature of our tourist drive economy we have significant seasonal variation as well many small local business be deeply concerned that after year of feeling leave behind increase to national insurance could squeeze they even far for some it might be the final straw our economy be also change to meet the opportunity of the future coastal community have be at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution and be key part of the manufacturing process for wind turbine or host the site where the cable for their energy make landfall in bacton in my constituency there be amazing opportunity for carbon capture and storage and for hydrogen generation as we undergo green transition our coastal community have so much economic potential and opportunity just wait to be unlocked hope that the government can support and enable they to flourish in the year to come one of the most special thing about our coastal community be the environment that they possess visitor to salthouse marsh in my constituency might be lucky enough to catch glimpse of the migratory snow bunting move north in holkham and over the border in holme dune live some of the ever decrease number of natterjack toad those be precious unique and environmentally important landscape and area but they face significant challenge too anyone who live in coastal community will have be furious at the shameful sewage scandal which have be unfold for year the tainting of precious beach through the dumping of raw sewage by water company be national disgrace and show no regard for the importance of the coast to its wildlife and resident be delighted by the work that we have do locally to secure blue flag beach for much of north norfolk but there be still so much to do the hon member talk about the environmental challenge of our coastal community one of which be that many of they face thousand of pylon along hundred of mile move electricity from one place to another do he agree that we need to find way to put those cable underground to protect our beautiful coastal community thank the hon member for his intervention and be pleased to associate myself with the sentiment behind his remark think it be my right hon friend the member for kingston and surbiton ed davey when he be energy minister in the coalition who scope out the possibility of an offshore ring main for east anglia which be an even well solution than try to bury cable under the ground our coastal community be also on the frontline in face down the effect of climate change have speak many time in parliament about the coastal erosion that we face in north norfolk make no apology to hon member for sound like broken record but as result of man make climate change north norfolk coastline village such as happisburgh trimingham and overstrand be rapidly be claim by the north sea we be not alone in this fight as community along the north sea coast be face similar worry and new modelling show that the concern be more widespread than previously think with area of the south west now under threat of erosion too my constituent look at project such as the thames barrier where we have rightly take bold step and build infrastructure to protect community from the effect of rise sea level and extreme weather event and wonder whether the government would deliver the same level of attention to they will not allow our community to be leave behind or write off we must fight climate change and mitigate its impact which we be already face fantastic book by madeleine bunting the seaside england love affair chart the story of our seaside town over the past several decade it be story of decline that must be reverse but it be also story of hope and resilience can absolutely see the balance she describe the fragility of life cling to the cliff but also the social strength the raw beauty and the economic opportunity support our local coastal economy do not have to mean billion in investment it need advocacy and action at the top table and the right support from government to help people help themselves madeleine bunting give the reynolds lecture in and make this salient point seaside town do fit into the public debate about the north south divide nor have their decline ever dominate the national narrative in the way that inner city do in the as focus of public policy or like the former mining and industrial town seaside town have be leave to struggle with their own decline have cover just some of the key pillar of the challenge that our coastal community face as well as their resilience and our opportunity as whole country to support they what frustrate greatly be that despite the wide range and various challenge responsibility for support they be fragment and siloe across government be delighted to see the minister in his place however his remit contain only the community aspect of our coastal community we have unique health challenge economic challenge and opportunity of major environmental importance our coastal community be too important to be bit part of different portfolio and we urgently need to take holistic approach to support they understand how the different factor interact with one another we need to be able to see and understand the impact of economic outcome on health and wellbeing and how environmental challenge and renewable energy opportunity can go hand in hand that be why have be call for the creation of minister for coastal community to give we specific representative speak up for our area in government that call have cross party support with mps from across the house support it in the previous parliament hope that the wide range of members present today show the government that similar consensus still exist for get we seat at the table and make the need and opportunity of coastal community hear and act upon will draw my remark to conclusion as be keen and excited to hear the contribution from all those present about what make their community so special hope that everyone will think about how coastal community have impact their life whether as summer holiday destination weekend getaway university town or the place they have call home for generation let we think about why they matter to we and what they have give to we all not just in economic contribution but in memory and in experience there be the memory from holiday with family and love one the laughter and smile at build sandcastle on our beach as child or with child of our own the timeless enjoyment of windswept fish and chip warm we as we watch the wave crash against the shoreline the way that turner or constable capture coastal beauty in their art work and coastal walk arcade swimming surfing and even seal spot let we remember what coastal community have give to we today we can come together and make sure that we give back to they protect they and let they create many more memory for generation to come member will have notice that there be lot of people on their foot want to speak so will try and get as many people in as can be impose an immediate three minute time limit for nearly four decade our seaside town have shape the outcome of election yet despite that significance we have be overlook struggle with deprivation economic decline and crumble infrastructure the crisis be particularly evident in my constituency of blackpool north and fleetwood which bear the scar of deindustrialisation and the decline of the fishing industry income deprivation be rampant job opportunity be limited health inequality be stark and our infra structure be in disrepair coastal resident on average earn less than those inland and crime and antisocial behaviour be high our health crisis be also dire with resident more likely to suffer an early preventable death cancer mortality rate be high on the coast and our rate of respiratory disease be three time the national average our coastal property be also third cheap lead to more house in multiple occupation and poor living condition these challenge be not abstract number they be the lived reality of family struggle to make end meet young people seek opportunity that do not exist and community suffer from the daily impact of dirty business and historical contamination labour be work to reverse that with its ambitious plan to grow the economy and its commitment to fix the nhs blackpool north and fleetwood be found on ambition our forefather envision thriving model seaside town combine prosperity tourism and industry yet sadly today they be shadow of that vision it be time to restore that ambition with real investment and leadership the government move towards regulatory reform be essential but our community be impatient they have be let down for too long and need to see tangible delivery now to truly deliver we need minister for coastal community coastal community face unique challenge that require dedicated voice in government minister who understand our specific need and ensure they be address through co ordinated strategic approach to investment and regeneration while top down reform provide essential structural change they must be match by bottom up solution shape by local knowledge and intelligence minister for coastal community could help we seize private sector investment in the clean energy transition to enable growth now revitalise our dock improve transport link and create long term sustainable employment coastal community have be part of this country success for generation it be time we give they the investment and leadership they deserve or we risk lose they forever as native of coastal community in devon be well verse in the challenge that live there present however we must also highlight the opportunity its present it be all too easy to depict coastal town city and community as run down and tired place where people retire or only have work six month of the year when the tourist roll in while there be undoubtedly lot of truth in that there be also huge amount to value and celebrate about our coastal community because if there be not why would people flock from right across the country and indeed the world to visit my constituency of south west devon have the significant suburb of plymouth plympton and plymstock and swathe of the coastal south hams and dartmoor the challenge the coastal community in my constituency face be much like those elsewhere include housing for local people and transport connectivity my hon friend have begin what be sure will be an exquisite speech and she hit the nail on the head when she talk about transport connectivity one of the great problem that unite all our coastal community be that it be difficult to get anywhere for community like mine in dumfries and galloway it be mile to the near hospital perhaps rather than new minister look at coastal community we need exist transport ministers to put their foot down my hon friend make valuable point and although my constituency be long way from his we too have significant problem with transport we be on peninsula and if the train stop we can not get in or out so completely understand the need for focus on transport we also have the health and education inequality that have be mention and the new government attack on business with increase employer national insurance contribution that affect not just business but our local st luke hospice and vital community pharmacy such as tubbs in newton ferrers the change to business and agricultural property relief be also threaten the future of long stand family business arguably one of the big opportunity for south west devon be the continue growth of the marine autonomy hub at turnchapel wharf in plymstock with over year of history as shipyard and naval base it be sell year ago by the ministry of defence and buy by yacht havens group over the last year it have invest in the hub and attract more and more marine base business with specific focus on marine autonomy develop autonomous vessel for the future of scientific surveying defence and humanitarian work at sea the development highlight some of the unique opportunity we can have in the coastal community of south west devon and plymouth with the easy and quick access from land to deep water in the country my constituency be perfectly place for business look to do sea trial underwater niche but essential opportunity for our local coastal community last friday thales deliver the first end to end autonomous maritime mine hunt system to the royal navy from my constituency the project be part of the organisation for joint armament co operation and it have serve the french navy as well as the royal navy it be vital however that we do not fall into the trap of look at coastal community solely through the lens of build up area town and city the coastal community in my constituency have wide range of identify factor as the government local government reorganisation work progress and council across the country consider how they can well serve their own interest it be important that they look at the interest of the place that they seek to absorb edging plymouth unitary authority with its own proud identity with part of devon county council and two district council will mean very different future for much of my constituency but take in the rural character of community such as mine be essential although the population of town and city such as plymouth may significantly outnumber the population in the rural part it be essential to place value on both population size and land mass identity matter and people often choose to live where they do to be close to the sea but that do not always mean that they be in build up town and city local government reorganisation must be in the good interest of everyone not just people in urban area be they on the coast or not to conclude the previous government recognise the challenge face and invest significant sum of money in community such as mine to help they close the gap with non coastal community go forward we must be proud of coastal community which be such key part of our national identity as an island nation be committed to find the balance between pursue opportunity and tackle the challenge that we all face it be privilege to represent east worthing and shoreham fabulous stretch of the stunning sussex coast where the sea meet the shore at our beautiful collection of town and village which then give way to the breathtaking south down too often coastal town have be treat as thought once vibrant hub of industry culture and trade too many now struggle to cope with rise inequality economic stagnation climate change and housing crisis that be force family out of their neighbourhood however there be hope on the horizon and the tide be come back in the new labour government be commit to steady the ship pull our coastal community out of the sewage blight murky water and set sail towards bright future the housing crisis in our coastal area can not wait the skyrocket cost of housing have make it nearly impossible for many of our young people and work family to find affordable home house price in my constituency have rise by in the past five year but wage have not keep pace the median house price be almost high than the national average but our median weekly wage be low than other across the country the new home that the government will build can not come soon enough to ensure that local family be not price out of their community and people child and grandchild do not have to move away to get on in life indeed that be huge factor in last year election campaign meet couple in their who be vote labour for the first time ever because their work adult child be still unable to afford home of their own they be not just first time labour voter this lovely couple meet year ago at the local conservative dance party the labour government be not only make it easy for people to own home of their own we be also through our renters reform bill support the of household in my constituency in the private rent sector by end no fault eviction ban rent bidding war and drive up standard be glad to be part of the work of labour members to bring an end to the exploitation of resident in coastal community like mine by poor manage agent who take they for ride with excessive charge and poor service we be address the issue of climate change we be commit to build climate resilient future by invest billion in flood defence will make the case for east worthing and shoreham get its fair share of that funding give our experience of flooding include in shoreham last april we be also act on the cause of climate change through our aim to achieve clean power by be proud to support an extension of the rampion wind farm in the sea just beyond our shoreline which will produce enough electricity to power the whole of sussex if complete we need investment in our coastal community not just for the resident live in they but to revive our tourist economy and give we the opportunity to show off the delight of our splendid seaside town time be short and can not talk about too many of they but they include worthe pier which suffer closure last year and worthe lido which hope we can restore the time for change be now our coastal community have give so much to the country over the year and it be time that we give back hope that will come in the form of coastal community strategy so that the government can deliver real change for our neighbour thank the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone for secure the debate and for his excellent speech my constituency of aberdeenshire north and moray east be coastal community it boast beautiful view of nature bustle port and delicious local produce peterhead be the large fishing port in europe with huge daily fish market fraserburgh be fantastic port town and my home fraserburgh harbour have develop million master plan which if bring to reality could deliver more than new job portsoy have remarkable harbour with unique local product each july portsoy host the scottish traditional boat festival which celebrate the craft behind boat with tremendous event and music there be many more coastal community such as buckie which have large marine industry golfing be popular leisure pursuit in the constituency with many world class golf course find right across it cruden bay and fraserburgh be only two among many across scotland there be more than active scottish fishing vessel and three quarter of they fish primarily in inshore water the inshore fleet be diverse and include trawler creeler netter dredger and diver in there be an estimate people directly employ in the seafood sector many in remote coastal and island community fishing be far more than an industry it be part of our identity in coastal community do the hon member agree that sustainable inshore fishing industry be vital to our economic growth completely agree for the industry to be sustainable it must have access to labour the inshore fleet in the hon gentleman constituency like the one in mine will doubtless be cry out for labour to come in from foreign country it be not able to because of the way the visa rule be structure believe the prime minister himself agree with on the issue of labour shortage very recently some of commercial fishing job be locate in area of scotland that together be home to less than third of the total population do the hon member agree that we desperately need proper fully think out fishing strategy to support this vital industry in our local community that be reasonable point but some of these matter be devolve so it might be difficult to have uk wide strategy in scottish export of fish and seafood be value at billion account for of total scottish food export and of total uk fish and seafood export scotland sea around our shore make up over of the uk total water however fishery need confidence to operate aberdeenshire council recent decision to cut the night watch service at macduff harbour be ill think out and economically illiterate this be despite an economic development plan for the harbour that be accept by the council harbour sub committee only last december in which it highlight that the harbour support around job and inject million into the local economy there be many thing could complain about depopulation unemployment poor access to healthcare or transport infrastructure which the hon member for dumfries and galloway john cooper mention but let we look hopefully to the future the continued growth of scotland renewable energy sector will be an essential feature of our future clean energy system and potential key driver of economic growth for many of these community not least in my constituency want to reassure the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice about pylon none of the cable that be come ashore in my constituency will see any pylon development within at least to mile of the shoreline which be very reassuring an abundance of renewable energy resource create opportunity to meet domestic need to exploit new technology in carbon capture wave power and hydrogen production and to export low carbon energy to other in these island and to europe these development bring great hope to many struggle coastal community in scotland not least my own thank the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone for secure this debate which be timely and overdue be glad to hear from member who live in coastal community all round this great country about the place they represent many of which this be where be grateful to my parent visit on caravan trip around the country when be young the tourism industry in this country will be pleased about this debate but be also grateful to hear about the challenge and inequality that many of our community face the report by professor chris whitty be important for when be work at the nhs it flesh out some of the unique challenge that many coastal community share include inequality in access to healthcare and in health and employment outcome as well as transport difficulty the list go on the coast of this country be not only the interface between land and sea but the interface between many of the great challenge that we face as country be pretty certain that every member in this debate will be able to give example from their constituency of high level of inequality of social deprivation or of challenge often against backdrop of beautiful stunning landscape access to nature and place where people want to live and where many not just those on holiday in caravan want to visit on daytrip or retire to it seem terrible shame that somehow we have get ourselves lock into system in which place that should be among the most desirable in the country face some of the big and most entrenched challenge some of those challenge be intrinsic to be by the water for example damage to building and the maintenance cost of housing and infrastructure be high at the coast yet that be not accommodate for in lot of our public spending decision when we think about our infrastructure and how we support people in maintain their house if anyone go to sheerness in my constituency and look around they will see that much of the social housing in that coastal town be damage and degrade largely because of the impact of the sea it also face the financial challenge that the rest of the country face sittingbourne and sheppey have some unique feature it be rural community but there be two industrial town in my constituency there be coastal community with nature reserve and wildlife but there be also big industry big power station and massive paper mill there be real opportunity that think we can capture and build on the reason have twin town in my constituency be because of the sea and access to water yet we be not take advantage of that in transport term very much endorse the call for minister for coastal community but the one thing would really like the government to commit to be develop cross cut coastal strategy that address all those need it be pleasure to follow the hon member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna do not need to repeat everything he say because it all apply in spade to my constituency which be very much coastal constituency which include not just harwich but manningtree mistley brightlingsea and west mersea those be all place of vary economic prosperity but wish particularly to talk about harwich because it be so typical of what have happen to very prosperous victorian port town where glorious terrace of grand house would be worth million if they be near london but instead they be bedsit territory for some of the most unfortunate in our society who find themselves get off the train and look for somewhere to stay have say that as the hon gentleman and the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone say in his opening remark thank he for secure this important debate although obviously we have much too short time these place be full of potential harwich be unique historic town it be where the mayflower sail from in the captain of the mayflower live in harwich and his house be now museum when we say to the americans do you realise that you originally come from harwich their eye be open they think it be all about plymouth but they be not right when we tell they what they could come and see and that instead of some fake victorian step they could come and see the real house of the captain of the mayflower they be amazed it be an important napoleonic port it grow from wonderful medieval naval base to be very important naval base during the first and second world war and the entire german submarine fleet be gather in the estuary harwich be full of potential we have the freeport the offshore wind industry and wonderful manufacturing business provide stable employment to their workforce the place be full of potential but worry that without be champion by our own tendring district council which have do marvellous job but be be line up for abolition we will not get the same support when he wind up will the minister assure we that coastal community will get the same support under the new local government set up that they have always enjoy from their district council have my doubt be afraid so would be most grateful if he can address that in many way my constituency of southport be typical coastal community and like many coastal town it have see well day it be cop with challenge that do not necessarily impact inland area to the same extent part of that negative change be due to the nature of the town economy but big part of it be due to its geography it be seaside town what make many of our seaside town successful originally the sense that they be trip away from the big city and that people could travel for mile through the countryside to get to they now militate against we while it once might have be appeal for family from manchester to take pack lunch to the seaside and enjoy the scenic train route through lancashire it be no good for our commuter to still be stick on that scenic route trundle across the north west to get to work and back every day what be once our strength have now become our weakness austerity have hit we hard too the former government remove in excess of million year from the local area the multipli effect of that have have an impact on private business in the town because when so many customer see that their wage be not keep up with price then small business fail we have see lot of that in southport in the past decade austerity manifest itself in different way in different area and in my town austerity have manifest itself most prominently in the closure of the town seaside pier botched repair job year ago mean that there be now structural problem estimate to cost over million to fix the pier be in local authority ownership and thank to the previous government the local authority have not get the money to bring about the necessary repair have be campaign on innovative way to ensure that pier across the country be safeguard for the next generation this labour government have more coastal mp than at any point in our country history as be evidence by the overwhelmingly empty conservative benches the common issue face by coastal town be feel keenly by my colleague on the labour benches with that in mind be pleased that the government be willing to commit to support our coastal community and too put on record my wish to see the creation of specific minister for coastal community the issue our area share be so specific to the coast common to each other and important to our resident that government will gain greatly from dedicated minister ensure that the view of our town and area be hear in this place be sure that if government step up and meet some of the challenge that our town face the decade of national renewal that we know the country need could be implement order with an immediate two minute time limit call siân berry be pleased to speak in the debate and thank the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone for secure it in house of lords report on the future of coastal community call brighton probably the uk most successful seaside community and we be be very pleased that the city council have recently set up new seafront development board and have already have positive meeting with its chair to discuss how we continue to make our seafront well to support and grow our city wonderful reputation for heritage music the art shopping amusement community action diversity nature and wellbeing as other have say there be currently no government funding scheme specifically for coastal area and there be no ministerial focus echo the comment of everybody in this house on that we need focus on the specific challenge that our coastal community face because austerity and brexit have bite brighton community too our people have big problem with housing cost holiday let employment health transport and health inequality which all need deal with do the hon member agree that brexit have do immense harm to place such as brighton and other coastal community could not agree more the amount of different sector of the economy in brighton and hove that have remark to on the impact of brexit be huge not least the cultural industry will echo other and talk little about the regularly appalling state of our sea water which be genuine threat to our success southern water have be take to court and find guilty of criminal behaviour and lying yet we still have sewage overflow off the south coast on regular basis have meet sea swim group and individual constituent who have be very sick after swim in the water around brighton and the only way to get that properly under control be public ownership my green colleague and will continue to push for that in this parliament will very quickly shout out lucy davies the brilliant and enthusiastic new director of brighton dome when meet she recently she tell about the excellent collaboration happen between cultural institution along the sussex coast the coastal catalyst programme will support creativity and culture for young people from bognor regis to bexhill and it be exactly the kind of co operative work that need to happen there be no single solution to the challenge that impact on our coastal community but we need ambition vision dedicated minister and proper package of strategic initiative and funding as mps we can help by work together and with local leader to build on the idea build up new initiative that we all agree our community need because of their very special nature and put on the pressure for that to happen for too long coastal community such as blackpool have be leave behind despite our stunning coastline proud heritage and incredibly resilient people westminster have neglect we for far too long now with new labour government in place we have the opportunity to turn the tide to ensure that blackpool and other coastal community finally get the support they deserve nearly one in two child in blackpool live in poverty recently submit report to the child poverty taskforce base on the experience of parent and those work with child in blackpool almost of those survey say that financial strain be damage child enjoyment of childhood that be unacceptable and we must change it blackpool economy have long rely on tourism and associated job role that historically have be seasonal insecure and low pay local effort have do much to create year round economy and the government must support they that mean target investment in the sector that can provide long term career help business to grow and expand skill training to prepare our workforce for the future with the right support we can unlock blackpool full potential do my hon friend agree that with the new government north west town have the good opportunity for generation to turn the tide on year of tory decline and ensure that their good day lie ahead completely agree have many happy memory of my hon friend constituency of southport my family would go from blackpool to the pontins in southport but my dad would always go the long way round on the motorway so it feel like we be go far away than we be as be say this do not mean turn our back on tourism and hospitality it mean invest in they however the rise in employer national insurance contribution present significant challenge to they and job be at risk if we be serious about grow our economy and support work people we must give this sector the support it desperately need vat reduction for hospitality and tourism would boost turnover create nearly job over the next decade and deliver billion in tax revenue that be the kind of bold ambitious action that place such as blackpool need to thrive for too long place such as blackpool have be leave behind but with the right plan and with the determination to see it through we can change that my constituent demand voice so be also call for the appointment of dedicated minister for coastal community the last labour government rebuild our city this new labour government have the opportunity to rebuild our forget coastal town we must deliver cross government strategy dedicate to improve the health wellbeing and prosperity of coastal community the chief medical officer have rightly say that strong target long term action can lift our coastal town and create fairer healthy and more prosperous future for all my constituent deserve nothing less congratulate my hon friend the member for north norfolk steff aquarone on secure this important debate we desperately need minister for coastal community as have be highlight in some outstanding speech this afternoon the fact that my constituency of torbay be the premier resort for the united kingdom be of great pleasure to we have six blue flag beach across the bay however once upon time at the turn of the century torquay be the wealthy town in the country sadly torbay be now one of its most deprived community and be the most deprived community in the west of england one wicked issue that face we be pollution in our sea while we have those lovely blue flag beach from time to time particularly with climate change and the propensity towards heavy water use in the summer our sewage system get overwhelmed it be great sadness that local have to look on the surfers against sewage app to determine when it be safe to swim in our sea we also face wicked issue and challenge in our nhs include our crumble hospital do my hon friend agree that hospital face challenge not just with their state or accessibility but with the affordability of housing for nhs worker my hon friend be spot on whether we be in north norfolk north devon or torbay we face challenge with our nhs and we also face lack of affordable housing we have see that challenge put on steroid by the pandemic during which we see house price and rent rise with people flee from metropolitan area to live in coastal community let we ensure with the appointment of dedicated coastal community minister that coastal community be not leave on the edge geographically or economically declare an interest as chair of the coastal parliamentary labour party and co chair of the all party parliamentary group for coastal community alongside my hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby alison hume we be in danger of violently agree with each other so will not repeat much of what have be say needless to say much of it also apply to east thanet what will cover however be the potential that coastal community have to drive economic growth across the country through our people our heritage and our environment take the government mission to build million home east kent colleges group be work with house builder and construction company such as ww martin offer apprenticeship to develop the next generation of worker there be demand for non graduate job in our community and if we tap into that potential there be no reason why it could not be worker from coastal community who build those million home across the country and refurbish our shoddy draughty and damp housing stock it be important that we build on people identity and heritage to develop resilient coastal community in east thanet we have tap into our artistic heritage of charles dickens and turner the turner contemporary gallery in margate be monument to what can happen when energy and resource be focus on regenerate coastal town of course our natural environment be not just nice to have it be an integral economic asset however we can not talk about increase opportunity without first provide people with security how can people look to the horizon when they be have to watch where they step this be mission drive government with five mission to transform the country do my hon friend agree that strong enable state bring forward those five mission and invest in progressive industrial strategy can help our coastal town thrive in the next decade indeed we need place base approach with that active state if we want economic growth that reach all part of the country invest in coastal community if we want public service that really improve the experience of people who be most alienated because of state failure invest in coastal community if we want to create an environment that work for nature and people invest in coastal community be speak not just about financial investment but about investment of government time energy and focus when colleague and be try to work out which department would be answer this debate we literally do not know while be obviously delighted to see the minister in his place the issue raise in this house today span all departments whether that be health transport environment education the home office the treasury or many other simply note that if there be not one minister who fit the portfolio there should be one minister for coastal community who can focus on regenerate our town and grow our coastal economy will end with point about the previous labour government in the city be not the place they be today that labour government have relentless focus on improve they and the regeneration we have see be testament to what can be deliver coastal town be in the same position now and the labour government have not only order member will be aware that will

social care retail and hospitality which be all usually low pay sector accord to the independent commission on neighbourhood southend east and rochford contain neighbourhood identify with the high need high deprivation and lack of social infrastructure have have knock on effect on life expectancy education outcome and job opportunity where someone live should not negatively impact their future my constituency be centre for creative art and heritage building such as the freight house the kursaal the cliffs pavilion southchurch hall and more resident have passion and determination to create sustainable future for southend east and rochford as do but we need coastal community strategy that differentiate coastal community from our inland and rural partner and seek to address the unique challenge we face for long term change we must diversify industry in coastal community so that hospitality heritage and tourism can thrive alongside finance tech and industry our coastal community be likely to have high deprivation live alongside great wealth they be often creative hub cornwall attract many artist and musician and falmouth have the world class falmouth university which grow out of

beach cafés car park and economy in cornwall the port of falmouth be still very significant we maintain and repair ship include military ship we host cruise ship with new green energy onshore plug in and we have plan to regenerate the port to service float offshore wind and to reinstate the freight railway however wage be low than the national average many job be seasonal and insecure and hospitality business struggle with low margin the permanently low business rate that will be introduce in april next year after the business rate discount expire will help great deal as long as the rate be permanently low than the current rate rather than the full rate from pre covid skill shortage be significant particularly in hospitality but also in other skilled profession and house price be time wage there be property for short term let in cornwall up on while household be on the social housing waiting list second home account for nearly of our housing stock welcome the renters rights bill but we also need toolbox of measure to tackle second home and short term let include registration or licensing scheme good holiday company be actually call for safety inspection measure and for

tourism and increase prosperity and employment leigh on sea have be synonymous with cockling for wait for year the industry be vital part of leigh on sea heritage with the old town cockle shed serve as reminder of its maritime past and huge boost to our tourism sector the north thames cockle fishery which be one of the old in europe have implement measure such as seasonal operation and total allowable catch level to ensure the sustainability of cockle stock and it be give maritime stewardship council sustainability award in it be perfect example of sustainable fishing however there be issue that need to be address as hear from our fifth generation firm of cockler osborne fishmonger be tell that people in this country do not eat much shellfish especially the young generation this be not trade that we want to die out and support initiative such as seafood in schools and fish heroes the cockling industry in leigh on sea bring significant economic benefit to the local community but it face several challenge its representative have tell that increase pressure to operate more efficiently and sustainably require long term investment after the new cockling licence be finally pass by parliament follow delay in the previous parliament osborne and other would like to see their individual licence grant preserve local industry such as cockling in leigh on sea be vital for coastal community we must continue to support they my constituency of scarborough and whitby include some of the most beautiful town and village in the country but it also have some of the bad health outcome

scarborough university technical college be already train the engineer of the future who will work on the wind farm off our coast the construction skills village in eastfield be train apprentice in bricklaying plastering and other trade to help build labour million new home however we must deliver year round non graduate career for our coastal kid and ensure that funding be funnel not into city and university but into coastal community only by do this will we deliver on our mission to break down the barrier to opportunity thank the hon lady for be so brief that bring we to the front benchers congratulate my hon friend the member for north norfolk steff aquarone on secure the debate although on beautiful day like this be sure be not the only one pin for the beach great britain be an island nation with proud maritime history coastal community be central to our cultural identity our national heritage and of course our economy yet time and again they have be overlook by government in london from under investment in infrastructure and transport to the devastating impact of water pollution and the broken business rate system coastal community face unique challenge that require target solution it be time for proper investment fair funding and real plan for the future my constituency of west dorset be home to the famous jurassic coast unesco world heritage site and as in many coastal community tourism be an essential industry for the area but it also place increase strain on local infrastructure public service and emergency response team although dorset experience increase in population during peak season such rural and coastal area remain chronically underfunded the current funding formula fail to account for rurality and for the seasonal population fluctuation that we experience rural local authority face high service delivery cost yet the government decision to repurpose the million rural service delivery grant on new need and demand basis have remove crucial lifeline for council try to provide transport emergency service and social care in remote area that be simply unacceptable one of the great threat to coastal economy and to public health be the ongoing sewage crisis and the figure be staggering in alone over sewage spill be record across england as result england be rank among the low for water quality in europe meanwhile water company pay out billion in dividend in alone and million in executive remuneration between and all while fail to invest in critical infrastructure to prevent these spill it be nothing short of national scandal that be why the liberal democrats be call for the creation of clean water authority to replace ofwat as well as strong regulation increase funding for water regulator to hold polluter accountable and dedicated minister for coastal community to oversee regulation on sewage spill and coastal protection must raise the issue of business rate small business be vital to coastal economy yet the broken business rate system be hold they back the government plan to slash relief for retail hospitality and leisure business from to just will be devastating blow for many small coastal business that be still struggle to recover from the pandemic and the cost of living crisis that be important because tourism number be still down third on level the uk tourism sector directly employ over million people but it have experience heighten job insecurity and reduce hire rate since that time our tourism sector need targeted support not short sighted tax hike as member have outline coastal community be also face housing crisis that be why the liberal democrats be call for council tax surcharge on second home in housing shortage area new planning restriction on second home and short term holiday let to prioritise local housing need and requirement for all holiday let owner to pay council tax end the loophole that let they avoid pay anything at all these measure will help protect the character of our coastal town and ensure they remain thriving community not just seasonal destination post brexit fishing and farming policy have leave many coastal community struggle the last government botch brexit deal throw the uk fishing industry into turmoil and as we approach the end of the transition period in uncertainty be grow too many fish be export abroad for processing before be reimporte lead

remain postcode lottery in rural and coastal community in west dorset only nhs dental practice serve population of leave many without access to care people live in coastal community across the country face stark health inequality compare with those in other area report such as the one by sir chris whitty consistently show that rural community experience poor health outcome drive by deprivation limited access to healthcare and persistent workforce shortage these challenge be not inevitable they be the result of neglect the liberal democrats be call for strategic small surgery fund to sustain struggle rural gp service and dental rescue package to fix the broken nhs dental contract and guarantee urgent dental care for all will the hon gentleman give way be afraid will not because be very keen for my hon friend the member for north norfolk to have time to wind up digital exclusion remain press issue many coastal business and resident lack reliable broadband and mobile connectivity impact everything from emergency response time to economic opportunity the government must commit to full fibre broadband and reliable mobile coverage for all coastal and rural community coastal community have long be overlook as the hon member for blackpool north and fleetwood lorraine beavers and other have eloquently outline it be time for dedicated minister for coastal community to ensure that our voice be hear in every government decision we deserve clean water thrive business secure job and infrastructure that meet our need it be time for bold action not just warm word if we be to secure the future of our coastal community for generation to come it be pleasure to wind up on behalf of the official opposition this debate on the importance of our coastal community of which my own constituency be proud one those community be rich in history industry and natural beauty but they face significant challenge they be home to thrive tourism fishery and local business but they continue to struggle with economic inequality housing pressure and environmental concern it be our duty to ensure that coastal community receive the attention they deserve in that spirit congratulate the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone on secure the debate his opening speech show clearly that he be committed to his constituency and care deeply for the people he represent many hon member touch on the unique and impressive heritage of their respective coastal community from their evolution as trade hub shipbuilding harbour basis for fishing fleet and tourist destination to the modern and diverse settlement of today hope hon member and you madam deputy speaker will permit minor indulgence as add my homage to my coastal constituency straddle the hamble river from which my constituency get its name the community that line this strip of the hampshire coastline be as venerable as they be beautiful snake down from charming curbridge past beautiful burseldon and stunning swanwick all the way down to hill head into the solent past scenic marina and yacht club and many wonderful pub which as the weather warm up and the sun come out will be pleased as be sure all member across the house will be to visit more and more often it be hard life be the mp for hamble valley but someone have to live it however it be not all blue sky and calm water all the time as member have say there be challenge face coastal community and we can not ignore their impact as in my constituency coastal town and village struggle with restrict accessibility from poor transport link and increase environmental risk high than average unemployment compound by seasonal job instability disparity in housing income low educational attainment and the upward mobility of skilled worker cause brain drain that further exacerbate all those issue part of the problem stem from the fact that there be currently no national strategy for coastal area coastal town be usually low population area and be often conflate with rural area which obscure their unique challenge as we have touch on coastal community be already grapple with economic inequality yet this government continue to burden they far average annual pay in coastal town be low than in the rest of great britain and their national growth rate be much low despite the historical industrial and commercial strength they exhibit in the past now they face tax increase decline support for high street and rise employment cost which threaten to undo year of progress in just matter of month instead of foster economic growth we be see policy that stifle local business and weaken our high street for example with the government hike in employer national insurance contribution to we can see the fallout that poor economic choice deliver business have speak to include pub and restaurant in my constituency which rely on seasonal tourism and be already struggle with high cost be now have to make difficult decision about lay off staff not take on more staff and in extreme circumstance closing venue that be the exact opposite of what our local business need the government say that their first priority be deliver growth yet the policy they have choose to implement will bring about yet more economic uncertainty financial worry and labour market instability in coastal community with the government recent housing algorithm change we be also see dramatic increase in housing target in coastal community in coastal community near hamble valley such as new forest fareham and gosport we be see target rise by up to cornwall dorset somerset and north yorkshire be all be task with deliver thousand of new home yet infrastructure and public service be not keep pace many of our coastal community depend on strong and sustainable fishing industry the previous government work hard to strip eu impose quota that constrain our fishing fleet however this government continue pursuit of close alignment with the eu raise serious concern about access to uk water will the hon gentleman give way do not have time be afraid the previous government make significant investment in our coastal community through the coastal community fund million be invest across project create over job and bring more than million visitor to our coastal area furthermore the future high street fund town deal the levelling up fund and the uk share prosperity fund provide much need support to local economy these initiative renew town centre safeguard business and create thousand of training opportunity but we see no commitment to continue they today the government have already announce that there will be no new funding for the town fund which think be betrayal of the commitment make to our coastal community coastal community be an integral part of our national identity and yet they continue to be overlook by this government instead of support local business they raise taxis instead of invest in our high street they cut funding instead of protect our fishing industry they seek close tie with the eu that threaten our independence it be time for this government to change course we must ensure fair housing policy sustain economic investment strong and independent fishing industry and robust flood defence our coastal community deserve well and urge this house to take action to protect their future thank the hon member for north norfolk steff aquarone for secure this debate and for the way he lead it he say that it be his first opening speech it be an excellent one admire both the poise and the clarity with which he speak in his first backbench business debate there be clearly more excellent debate to come but he will struggle think to top today topic the official record of this debate will read like love letter to our nation coastal community one in which we can all see ourselves and our treasured memory whether we represent coastal community or for member like myself who do not spend our childhood at southport blackpool skegness or elsewhere around the country the hon gentleman set out very clearly the opportunity for our coastal community be they tourism energy or natural beauty but also the profound challenge which be echo in the contribution of number of colleague such as slow economic growth high level of deprivation and real challenge in healthcare he say that he feel the system do not work share lot of that and have some suggestion for how the system might change the hon gentleman be also very clear that he would rather that dedicated minister respond to the debate rather than will try not to take it personally and will address that directly in moment first want to cover number of contribution from colleague my hon friend the members for east worthing and shoreham tom rutland and for east thanet ms billington and the hon member for torbay steve darling speak about the integral challenge with housing in coastal community with too little building for too long this government be go to change that with million and half home in this parliament say to colleague and to anybody listen who be passionate about their coastal community that the way to ensure that be do in the right way way that respect local heritage local demand and area of natural beauty be to be involve in the local planning process that be how to set the blueprint for excellent development in our community as my hon friend the member for scarborough and whitby alison hume say that will bring job as well with opportunity for all year round job great career and skill of course that conversation on housing include an important point that be raise by number of my colleague especially my hon friend the member for truro and falmouth jayne kirkham which be the matter of second home and short term let she and have speak about that lot over the year along with my hon friend the member for camborne and redruth perran moon this government be introduce short term let registration scheme to protect the spirit of our community notwithstanding the importance of short term let to the economy we be abolish the furnished holiday letting tax regime to remove the tax incentive that short term let owner have over long term landlord from this april council can opt to charge council tax premium of up to on second home however we recognise that more will need to be do and we be very keen to have that conversation with colleague we be consider what additional power we could give local authority to enable they to respond to the pressure create by short term let and holiday home number of colleague include perhaps unsurprisingly my hon friend the member for sittingbourne and sheppey kevin mckenna make important point about healthcare would trumpet the government year health plan to reform the nhs which coastal community in particular will benefit from the minister for care my hon friend the member for aberafan maesteg stephen kinnock be sit on the bench next to with the three big shift the move from hospital to community from analogue to digital and from sickness to prevention there be lot in that plan for coastal community again encourage colleague to lean into that my hon friend the member for southend west and leigh david burton sampson draw on cockle osborne sound like it be the real backbone of his community but clearly it be face some real hurdle if it be of any value to he would be very keen to meet the firm representative and have the chance to have that conversation in full my hon friend the members for blackpool north and fleetwood lorraine beavers and for blackpool south chris webb touch on partnership with central government local government and local community can point to significant money come from this government million for housing redevelopment in blackpool and million for the further education college and the new civil service hub we believe that blackpool good day be ahead of it and be very keen to work with my hon friend in that regard the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith talk about the strong opportunity for development in the private sector would add to that the billion for the naval base at devonport we also have the excellent tool of the freeport that we can work on together to draw in investment which and my colleague be very keen to do the subject of freeport take to the essex coast and to the hon member for harwich and north essex sir bernard jenkin he want to hear from this dispatch box commitment to his community and can give he that commitment our renew commitment to freeport which we inherit from the previous government show that we believe in the potential of his community there be change to local government come and the possibility of devolution be outstanding but know will speak to this point later when address the matter of dedicated minister that his community have the skill the knowledge and the experience to shape the area for the well and build it for the day ahead our commitment be to give it the power and the tool to do so and be very happy to recommit to that today will my hon friend confirm that this government understand that there be clear distinction between the challenge in rural community and those in coastal one notice that the liberal democrat spokesman use the word coastal and rural almost completely interchangeably and we know that the level of deprivation and the challenge in coastal community be significantly different from those in rural community can he give that confirmation from the government that be an important point rural community can be coastal community and vice versa but not always and their challenge manifest very differently the challenge that come from be community at the end of the line can be significant and profound and we absolutely accept that turn to the point that the hon member for north norfolk make about have dedicated minister as other colleague have say think he be sell himself short the reality be that this be not about have minister in government pull the lever for north norfolk hamble valley or anywhere else to transform its community this be an inside job the promise from this government be to shift power and resource from this place to those community so that they can change thing for themselves we have make down payment with our plan for neighbourhood which cover peterhead for example hear some of the frustration but give community power and resource be way to rebalance thing and it will enable they to change thing for themselves of the area in the plan for neighbourhood be coastal which will mean million commitment my hon friend the member for southend east and rochford mr alaba talk about the independent commission on neighbourhood and much of its work be reflect in what we have do say gently to the opposition spokesperson that we want to move away from the broken begging bowl culture of level up fund where community be pit against each other to more long term sustain funding base on the need of community the money be one thing but for the power be the real thing and it underpin our plan for change be talk about the shift of power from this place to our local community that we be see through devolution we already have five elect mayor represent coastal area with two more still to come in may hull and east yorkshire and greater lincolnshire that give those community power over housing planning transport energy skill employment support and more so that they can shape their area six more area be come down the line include five coastal community in the devolution priority programme that be shift of money and power from this place to coastal community to take on the challenge that they have have in the past and in partnership with central government to build very exciting future be they in tourism in climate or in housing that be what this government offer that be what the future offer and that be something to be really excited about be immensely grateful to member from across the house for their contribution and for echo my call want to mention couple of point that think be exceptionally noteworthy my hon friend the member for torbay steve darling and the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith speak about the pride and opportunity in their area not just the challenge the hon member for southport patrick hurley speak about the challenge of be asset custodian of pier and other such thing be delighted to hear the hon member for scarborough and whitby alison hume and for east thanet ms billington talk about the opportunity for skill development and young people time do strange thing in coastal community leave hon member with final image that think of as listen to colleague the volunteer lifeboat crew off the north norfolk and how much they do to support and protect all of we in this country question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider coastal community face to face gp

be give the result of those test sadly the cancer have spread to such degree that nothing more can be do just three day later they pass away it be impossible to imagine or to understand this but it be the tragic story of laura barlow age just the mother of three young daughter summer skye bonnie rae and bella mia her husband michael barlow be here in the gallery with friend his campaign after the tragic loss of his wife laura be for more face to face appointment and for patient to have the right to one if they feel they need it it be worth look at the context of face to face appointment in our healthcare system go back some six year to around of all gp appointment be face to face accord to nhs england for the last two month the figure be just over how do we compare to other nation in european nation with different healthcare system the average be or we have some few face to face appointment than some of our international peer be just layman not doctor but it must be common sense that an experienced highly skilled professional gp look patient in the eye to physically assess they face to face must give patient the great chance of correct diagnosis sometimes gp will spot something that the patient be not even aware of commend the hon gentleman on secure the debate gp face to face appointment be massive issue in my constituency and you madam deputy speaker be probably inundate with constituent ask about the same thing people more often than not elderly people phone the emergency number at half past in the morning and hold on till past after they have hold the phone for minute voice say by the way you too late the system be not work to be fair to the minister understand that change be come we need to know what they be and whether they will improve the system if they do not do so to the satisfaction of the hon gentleman my constituent and something be drastically wrong and that need to be address immediately the hon member make some excellent point there be clearly place for telephone appointment when research the topic in more detail be astonish to find that of the gap between the or of face to face appointment and telephone appointment represent some and zoom or teams appointment be just to would have think it would have be the opposite surely it be well if gps can see the pain that might be etch on patient face we can look at the broad context at what be happen to our population and to the number of gps and at the pressure on gps and ask be that why the percentage of face to face appointment have collapse so significantly in england there be million more people than in an increase of some interestingly the number of gp appointment increase in that period by similar percentage give or take it go from just over million appointment to over million appointment in fairness and with due credit there have be recent increase month on month in gp appointment which be to be commend but it seem strange that the number of full time fully qualified gps have barely move in those year it be true that there be more trainee doctor and trainee gps in the system but the number of fully qualified full time equivalent gps have basically stay static that mean of course that the number of patient that gp have on their book have increase significantly from over per gp to over per gp we can therefore understand the increase in pressure on they give those health need they will feel the need to see as many people as possible so we can see the temptation to hold telephone or zoom appointment my hon friend be make some excellent point do he agree that there be place for telephone appointment if gp be give guidance and support or make referral but that any diagnosis should be make face to face thank my hon friend for that excellent intervention this come back to the basic concept of common sense it must be easy for gp to make the correct diagnosis when see someone face to face we all make mistake but when our medical professional on the frontline whom we all admire be under pressure and tired and they make mistake that can have devastating life change consequence we will never know the difference it may have make if laura have the correct diagnosis in october but it must be right to give all patient the good opportunity know that the secretary of state for health and social care who have interact with in the chamber be absolutely determined to make reform across the healthcare system he have start actively abolish nhs england make change to the department and do much more that bring to what else can be do we can look at the pressure on gps be astonish to read that almost of all gps be think of retire in the next five year almost of they cite the increase pressure of bureaucracy paperwork and administration surely we want our train gps in front of patient we do not want their time be absorb by unnecessary burden and paperwork if that be drive our gps away from the noble profession of cure and help people we have to look again hope the health secretary the minister and colleague will drive change in process when be with people in my constituency of boston and skegness recently do more research be astonish by what find when speak to gp and liaise with she she give some example of bureaucracy clog up the system for example if gp refer patient to consultant in hospital and the consultant say yes the patient need this but also need to refer they to another speciality just down the corridor in the same hospital that can not be do directly the consultant have to write back to the gp that letter go through the post with hundred other letter day then the gp have to refer the patient back to different consultant with that different speciality down the corridor in the hospital that lack common sense it appear that if the consultant want to prescribe medication to the patient who have be refer they be unable to do that directly they have to refer back to the gp who have to spend more time provide the prescription that appear to lack common sense if the consultant want to request blood test on many occasion that will have to be refer back to the gp by letter or maybe by email so that the gp can request those test all that lead not only to delay for the patient and to time be consume but to more work for the gp who we all surely want to see more patient face to face there be other situation that seem to be clog up the system take our old friend gdpr it be well intentione but when go to pharmacy in boston few week back the pharmacist say we have the same software system as the gp surgery right next door to we in the same building but because we have different module and because gdpr do not let the module talk to each other it lead to increase delay and lack of productivity and for patient low quality service they go on we could do so much more we could relieve the gps of some of the work they be do so that they could see the patient face to face then week later be in care home in boston with carer and expert in the room we be talk through the issue they say there be process and procedure that we can do that we be not allow to do so gp have to do it or we have to request an ambulance from the hospital clog up ambulance waiting list or clog up corridor when we could do those procedure again the great concept of common sense can not be apply think we all know that we can do so much well than that then there be the issue of referral when gp make referral to consultant that referral often get assess by non clinician as to whether it be correct would have think that we should be able to trust highly train highly skilled professional gps and back their judgment on the frontline if they think someone need to be refer to consultant surely that do not need double or triple checking again that delay good patient care and cause more blockage for the gp more admin and more paperwork then there be our friend at the care quality commission an important supervisory process and concept hear about the process the box tick the patient panel all that be just more admin more time and more resource consume outside the core function of face to face treatment and care for patient it therefore seem that this be not party political issue but one of drive continuous improvement in our healthcare system and of the department as it move forward with the reform we all want to see say actually let look at all the process how do we reduce the blockage how do we remove any unnecessary paperwork and burden how do we improve the technology indeed artificial intelligence which be so recent be huge opportunity for healthcare and technology in healthcare and for gps to for example double check or triple check their own diagnosis these be great opportunity face we but most fundamental of all we must give our gps every support every ease of progress and the right technological assistance behind the scene in the back office so they can face all of we when we be unwell and need treatment because that be when they can use their experience wisdom and knowledge to get to the right diagnosis it would be tribute to laura it would be her legacy for patient to have the right to see gp face to face ease the process would make life easy for gps and would make they want to stay in the profession because they know that face to face they will achieve great and noble cause and good thank the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice for raise gp access which be vital matter to many of our constituent want to start by pay tribute to laura barlow family friend and love one and to her husband michael who be in the gallery it be terrible tragedy that laura cancer be not catch early and absolutely agree with the hon gentleman that the significant number of people who sign the petition show real strength of feeling on this heartbreaking case when people be ask what their top priority for the nhs be the chance be they will say fix general practice because gps be the front door to our national health service they be the first port of call for million of people and they perform vital service by deliver care in community across our country let be crystal clear from this dispatch box gps must provide face to face appointment alongside remote consultation online service must always be provide in addition to rather than as replacement for in person consultation patient have right to request face to face appointment and practice must make every effort to meet their preference unless there be good clinical reason to the contrary such as in case where the patient test positive for an infectious disease there be clear benefit to attend an appointment in person gps pick up cue from body language and foster more personal relationship with their patient and that be important if we be to bring back the family doctor last year gps deliver million appointment throughout england two third of those be in person and can tell the hon gentleman that the figure for his integrate care board in lincolnshire be in line with the national average at it be possible that in some practice default to remote appointment be temporary and necessary measure during the pandemic but in some case that may have become habit that have become difficult to shake let we be clear that this be not the fault of gps per se it be the fault of the last government which leave they underfunde understaffed and in crisis that be why we be do everything we can to remedy the downward spiral that gp service have find themselves in after year of tory neglect and failure be absolutely delighted that the general practitioner committee england vote in favour of this year gp contract last month it be the first time that the contract have be accept in four long year the reform contact agree between the government and the gpc will improve service for patient make progress towards our health mission and crucially require practice to make it possible for patient to go online to request an appointment throughout the duration of core opening hour that will free up time for patient who prefer to call or visit in person those change be back by an extra million represent cash growth of more than in overall contract investment bring total spend on the gp contract to billion this financial year that be the large uplift to gp funding in generation and it mean we be begin to reverse decade of dwindle share of nhs resource go to general practice it be not just about resource and funding however we be bulldoze bureaucracy for gps so that they spend less time push paper and more time see patient like laura we be train thousand more gps modernise the booking system end the am scramble and bring back the family doctor those measure should make it possible for gps to guarantee face to face appointment for all who want one the government be commit to shift the focus of our nhs from hospital to community we will move towards neighbourhood health service improve continuity of care for those who would benefit from see the same clinician regularly which be associate with well health outcome and few attendance and we will drive the shift from analogue to digital by ensure that all practice be employ the full functionality of gp connect let turn to cancer the government be determined to tackle the big killer my right hon friend the health secretary have announce that national cancer plan for england will be publish later this year the plan will put patient at its heart and will cover the entirety of the cancer pathway from referral and diagnosis to treatment and ongoing care it will seek to improve every aspect of cancer care and the experience and outcome for people with cancer our goal be to reduce the number of life lose to cancer over the next year the plan will spell out how we will improve outcome for cancer patient speed up diagnosis and treatment and ensure patient have access to the late treatment and technology we will bring this country survival rate back up to the good in the world our nhs belong to the people those be not just my word they be in the nhs constitution fourteen year of tory failure leave our nhs break but not beat everything this government have do since the election have be gear towards save the nhs and give it back to the people we be put power back in patient hand because it be their health service and it must work for they last week my right hon friend the prime minister announce reform that will shift power away from the centre patient choice be at the heart of this government commitment to build an nhs fit for the future and all patient should be offer face to face appointment when it be in their good interest question put and agree to house adjourn
