balance climate change with our economy it be fact that we be move fast towards renewable energy last year of our energy come from renewable for the first time we be grow they at pace because they be cheap onshore wind be the cheap form of energy we have solar be very cheap and float offshore wind bring we huge opportunity renewable will bring our cost down and make sure we be energy secure and they go hand in glove with growth as the chancellor set out in her speech yesterday the minister government have change policy to not issue any new licence for domestic oil and gas so we will become

business rate among other thing what will the government do to support our young people into job when small business be leave in that awful position the hon lady might want to check again with the business she refer to because in the most recent budget the employment allowance be raise to some which will help every small employer national insurance bill every year and should ensure that more than million firm benefit that be very practical measure more broadly on the point about national insurance contribution she will know that labour inherit very difficult financial situation because of mistake make by the conservatives and difficult decision have have to be take small local business in grangemouth such as pub restaurant cafe hairdresser and garage all rely on the custom that they

high street across the country continue to struggle what be the minister do to ensure that small independent business such as young art gallery be support one reason why the conservatives lose the confidence of the british business community be that despite repeat promise to reform business rate they take no step to do so we announce plan in the budget back in october to reform business rate and introduce permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure business the conservatives be go to end business rate relief for retail hospitality and leisure we have choose to extend it we also announce in the budget that we be look at what further step we could take on business rate reform international investment what assessment he have make of the effectiveness of the uk in attract

trade envoy to pakistan can think of no one well and know he will make big difference in that role the government take the decision to reappoint professor sir steve smith as our international education champion to ensure that the uk pakistan education partnership work continue as part of the international education strategy which be now jointly lead by the foreign commonwealth and development office the department for education and the department for business and trade lead by sir steve the uk have work closely with the pakistan higher education commission on revise pakistan

the chancellor of the exchequer say only yesterday we be drive forward planning reform boost capital investment by over billion over the next five year and create the national wealth fund we be launch the business growth service and will soon publish our modern industrial strategy which will be unreservedly pro business business leader not surprisingly have back those measure but the minister will be aware that in the last few week the cbi the institute of directors and the london chamber of commerce have all say that business confidence be plummet give the tsunami of national insurance contribution increase business rate increase and employment cost rise be it not hardly surprising that confidence be be destroy be the government rather than promote growth not actually destroy it think the right hon gentleman need to check his source for comment from business leader only yesterday the british chambers of commerce the cbi and the federation of small businesses be make very positive comment about our plan for growth and last week interestingly pwc publish its annual survey of global ceo to reveal that britain be the second most attractive country in the world in which to

more visible than in our automotive sector with uk car production slump to its low level since autocar magazine warn today that the zero emission vehicle mandate be currently the industry big headache as consumer demand be not there to meet the stringent regulation which be increase each year when policy fail it be sensible to admit it and change course will the minister accept that the zev mandate fly in the face of what consumer actually want and that radically different path be require to boost business confidence in our automotive sector no do not accept that and would gently remind the hon gentleman that the policy to which he have refer be introduce by his party recognise that there be many aspect of the conservative party record about which he and his colleague be probably embarrassed the liz truss budget which the shadow secretary of state the hon member for arundel and south downs andrew griffith help to write do huge damage to our country and to consumer confidence the measure that the chancellor announce yesterday for example will drive growth forward and that be one of the reason why business back they so strongly yesterday it normally take long than six month for government to drift that far from reality the society of motor manufacturers and traders have predict that just car will roll off production line in compare to million in today edition of the telegraph report the slump have be accelerate by slowdown in demand across europe particularly by driver shun new electric vehicle why do the minister persist in policy to undermine our automotive business by force they to make product that people just do not want to buy be it not time to get the state out of the way let our innovator innovate and boost automotive business confidence by let they deliver to actual consumer demand the hon gentleman seem to have forget the extra investment that nissan have announce and the extra investment that have be announce by number of other car manufacturer he and his colleague be very clear in oppose the measure that we take in the budget include measure that back investment in the automotive sector and they set out no plan to pay for that investment gently encourage he to reflect little far on the mistake that his party make in government which have cause some of the problem that we be have to sort out now post office closure impact on communities what assessment he have make of the potential impact of post office closure on local community the post office have the freedom to operate the branch network within the parameter set by the government we protect the network by set minimum access criterion so that in urban and rural area everyone have easy access to their near post office those criterion ensure that however the network change service remain within local reach of all citizen the community of plymstock in my constituency see its main post office close in september when morrison close more than of its newsagent across the country the post office be essentially collateral damage despite the good effort of the community my predecessor and councillor include at the time since the post office have downgrade the franchise on offer from main branch to post office local it have be impossible to secure an operator due to the financial unviability of the model yesterday the final local branch announce that it will close later in the year what be the minister do to ensure that sustainable joint post office and banking service replace closing branch in constituency like mine we have support the post office in take measure to increase sub postmaster pay to make it more attractive profession to come into in order to deal with precisely the issue that the hon member set out she will understand that do not have specific knowledge of the issue around the post office in her constituency but be always happy to challenge the post office on constituency issue so if she would like to write or speak to about this afterwards would be happy to look at the issue in more detail free trade agreement india what step he be take to negotiate free trade agreement with india as the chancellor announce yesterday the secretary of state will travel to delhi in february to relaunch trade talk with india work be under way across government to prepare for those negotiation as we seek deal that drive economic growth an

service market in india which have previously be deny to uk firm that be the key issue in our negotiation if remember rightly the hon member and be probably the two most enthusiastic member of this house for trade deal with india slightly more than he think we be determined to do everything we can to secure trade deal with india he will forgive be sure if do not give running commentary on our priority for those trade talk with india but they represent significant prize for the uk if we can reach an agreement the secretary of state and the minister for trade policy and economic security be determined to work extremely hard and do everything they can to reach an agreement although it be appreciate that new trade deal with india could support job and prosperity in the uk and thus drive growth will the minister ensure that the talk include discussion of an agreement to the immediate release of my constituent jagtar singh johal from arbitrary detention in india before any trade deal be conclude recognise that this be significant issue for my hon friend we remain committed to encourage the government of india to make fast progress on resolve this case my right hon and learn friend

affairs if he will make statement on avian influenza before call the minister give member brief reminder that laptop use in the chamber be not permit avian influenza be once again pose threat to both keep and wild bird across the country and support birdkeeper the public and conservation body to manage and prepare for avian influenza continue to be one of our main priority follow the detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza in poultry and other captive bird this winter the department for environment food and rural affairs and the animal and plant health agency have stand up their well establish outbreak structure to control and eradicate disease restore normal trade and assist local community recovery defra disease control measure seek to contain the number of animal that need to be cull either for disease control purpose or to safeguard animal welfare and our approach aim to reduce adverse impact on the rural and wide economy the public rural community and the environment include the impact on wildlife while protect public health and minimise the overall cost of any outbreak our approach to avian influenza consider the late scientific and ornithological evidence and veterinary advice current policy reflect our experience of respond to past outbreak of exotic animal disease and be in line with international standard of good practice for disease control all birdkeeper be urge to remain vigilant and take action to protect their bird from avian influenza scrupulous biosecurity by all birdkeeper at all time be essential to protect the health and welfare of flock in response to the heighten risk level and escalate number of case an avian influenza prevention zone mandate enhance biosecurity be in force across england wales and scotland in addition mandatory housing for keep bird be in force across the unitary authority of the east riding of yorkshire the unitary authority of york the city of kingston upon hull and all district in lincolnshire norfolk and suffolk north yorkshire and shropshire to mitigate the risk of further outbreak of disease occur in area where an aipz be in force it be legal requirement for all birdkeeper whether they have pet bird commercial flock or just few bird in backyard flock to follow strict biosecurity measure to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease include when mandatory housing measure be requirement of an aipz requirement to keep their bird house the need for an aipz be keep under regular review as part of the government work to monitor and manage the risk of avian influenza together with the devolved government we will closely monitor the need to extend mandatory housing to other area of the country while avian influenza be primarily consider disease of bird it can infect human although this be very rare event in the uk and the risk to the general public remain very low nevertheless protect public health remain of paramount importance and defra and the apha work closely with regional uk health security agency health protection team to monitor the situation and provide health advice to person at infect premise and those who have be in close contact with infected wildlife as precaution as further reassurance the food standards agency have confirm that avian influenza pose very low food safety risk for uk consumer properly cook poultry and poultry product include egg be safe to eat defra and the apha will continue to work with birdkeeper who be on the frontline of this terrible disease compensation be pay for any healthy keep bird cull as the house will know compensation be update to involve early assessment of the number of healthy bird and swifter calculation of compensation that allow defra to provide early certainty about entitlement to compensation well reflect the impact of outbreak on premise and lead to swifter payment to help to stem any cash flow pressure order be sure that the minister have conclude his remark call the shadow secretary of state this be very difficult time for birdkeeper and farmer particularly those whose bird have die or be cull and all those who have have to upend their flock and move they inside give the impact that do so can have on both the mental and economic resilience of individual thank everyone who be involve in tackle avian influenza and be work tirelessly to prevent the spread of this disease include in my constituency thank the minister for his response regret that the secretary of state have not make an oral statement on this important matter particularly in the light of the revelation that farm worker have be infect with avian influenza would have think that the secretary of state would have think to update the house however we have manage to secure this urgent question for which be grateful on the subject of the farm worker infect with the virus in the west midland first how be this person have they recover and have anyone else be infect what be the wide risk to human health elsewhere one of the large and most modern egg lay site in the country have be affect with more than million bird be cull give the site significant role in process the uk barn egg production what discussion be the minister have with the sector to mitigate the impact on supply will he please update we on his discussion with the devolved government about introduce similar restriction to those in england of course bird and indeed viruse do not recognise border how be he ensure that compensation be make without delay and how much be it cost be the department keep the scheme under review include the loss of profit for farmer and the conservation impact for zoos housing rare and critically endanger specie such as the bali starle at battersea zoo which visit this week we be also concern by report that the avian influenza vaccination taskforce have stall be that correct and if so why finally defra ministers order the shadow minister be try my patience we have lot of business to get through today and time limit be there for reason call the minister thank the shadow secretary of state for her important question first reassure she and the house that the individual in question be in my understanding make full recovery but obviously we want to ensure that no one be put at undue risk the advice be clear the only people at risk be those who be in very close proximity people should follow the guidance and advice on mitigate sector supply my understanding be there be sufficient supply within the system although the right hon member be absolutely right to raise the point that it be significant and large producer that be affect we be confident that supply be secure on work with the devolved administration my official be in regular contact as say in my opening statement the situation be be constantly monitor the right hon member will be familiar with the compensation arrangement because they be the same as when she and her colleague be in government they be design to control the disease but of course they be also absolutely important to secure cash flow for farmer my recollection from previous bout of avian influenza be that there be serious problem with delay and with compensation because farmer who be try to do preventive cull of their bird have to wait for an inspection to take place and if that inspection have not take place compensation would not be give therefore some bird die from avian influenza that should have be cull and some bird do not die but the compensation be not pay would be grateful if the minister update the house on exactly what the new arrangement for compensation will be my hon friend be absolutely right he will recall the terrible outbreak few year ago when exactly those question be raise and as the shadow minister ask similar question at the time the compensation arrangement be change by the previous government in beneficial way and be absolutely confident at the moment that the delay we see before be not happen but he raise an important point anyone who have suspicion of an outbreak should report it as soon as possible and they should not be concern that they will suffer detriment from so do call the liberal democrat spokesperson farmer and vet will remember the outbreak which be the big we have see in the uk and which kill million of bird worldwide so this new outbreak be of huge concern for three major reason first there be the impact on animal welfare not just the bird catch avian influenza and die or be cull but their have to be keep inside rather than be free range secondly there be the impact on farmer their business and their mental health as with any notifiable disease this be hugely stressful and it be hugely disruptive to business model what be we do to ensure that compensation and support be give to farmer quickly thirdly there be huge potential impact on public health while we fully understand that there be low public health risk at the moment this be disease of bird we have just come out of we know that if someone be infect with human flu and potentially get infect with avian influenza there be risk that it become more infectious to human what discussion be the minister have with apha and the department of health and social care to monitor the genotype let deal first with the second of those two question the hon gentleman be absolutely right of course there be concern but can assure he and the house that the advice from the uk health security agency be that avian influenza be primarily disease of bird and the risk to the health of the general public be very low however of course we be monitor it and genetic testing and sequence be available to we for that he be right about the impact on bird keeper and on farmer it be why the compensation scheme be in place and work we absolutely recognise the pressure on people and the effect on their mental health have the minister assess the conservative government underspend of the agriculture budget we have indeed assess it of course it be extraordinary that that happen in term of what we be do the system be well resource to deal with these outbreak and we work in cross party way on that this outbreak be concern for the whole of norfolk and particularly for the bird rearer in broadland and fakenham but it highlight the critical importance of the animal and plant health agency in new haw and the plan for its full redevelopment do the government agree that that redevelopment be long overdue and if so will they commit to support it thank my hon friend and he be friend for his concern of course this be of particular concern and interest to representative from the east of england and share that concern we have discuss the future of weybridge and the investment many time before gently point out that the conservative government have the opportunity over year to make that investment over million have be allocate by this government and we will continue to make sure that the agency be properly resource call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee do not think anybody would disagree with the comment by the hon member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew about the redevelopment of the facility at weybridge but suspect that once avian influenza be in the wild bird population as it be here even the good facility in the world will struggle to contain it on disease containment remember the absolutely heartbreaking experience of walk along beach in orkney and see dead body after dead body be the minister engage with the royal society for the protection of birds and other major organisation so that he can at least be aware of the impact on the wild bird population thank the chair of the select committee who be absolutely right we have hear harrowing account in this chamber of the experience in member local community the situation with wild bird be awful of course official and be constantly in dialogue with those organisation but the truth be that in the wild bird population there be not much we can do about it have one of the uk large egg producer in my constituency however the other trend be that more bird be be keep in domestic situation hen geese and duck how be the government monitor those who be not professional bird keeper and ensure that such situation be also subject to the necessary control and regulation the right hon gentleman be absolutely right the importance of biosecurity can not be overstress that be the way to tackle this he be also right to say that amateur and small bird keeper be important and that be why they be bring within the registration scheme which be beneficial and welcome scientist at the university of glasgow find last month that avian influenza can spread to horse without any symptom will the minister clarify how the government be monitor the spread of the virus among other specie the hon lady be absolutely right we need to be very careful about that can assure she that those be exactly the kind of discussion that be have with official we be track that and have the technology these day to look closely at what be go on will not go into the expert account on the floor of the house of how the serotype work but be happy to put she in contact with official if she need more information thank the minster for his update to the house about the spread of avian flu want to ask couple question first as this be happen in city as much as in rural area how be people who live in city be make aware that they should look out for dead or die bird so that we can get more accurate reflection of where it be spread secondly what discussion have he have with departments of the scottish government to ensure that we have reliable and up to date datum across these island the hon gentleman make strong point think there be general awareness of and concern about what be go on it be important to say to people that if they have concern and they see such thing they should report they on our work with the devolved administration we have very strong structure that allow all the devolve administration to be involve so that we have consistent framework again we rely on the facility at the animal and plant health agency base in new haw in my constituency and we thank it for its work few week ago ask the minister if he would visit the site with to see for himself the work that need to be do and the urgent need for massive investment in the site do we have to wait until the next urgent question or statement before he will take up on my offer be grateful to the hon gentleman for his invitation have have numerous invitation last week be in northumberland look at rural crime and this week be at the fenland soil sustainability opportunity innovation learning conference will add the hon gentleman invitation to my list for my daughter second birthday take she to the wonderful birdland in gloucestershire which have hundred of different exotic and rare bird could the minister please tell how he be go to support that type of business model and how he be go to keep staff and visitor safe thank the hon gentleman for his important question everything we do to stop the spread will help business such as the one he describe some specific rule and regulation also apply in those particular case which can make available to he if he wish do the minister accept that avian influenza represent an existential threat to business such as kelly turkeys in my constituency paul kelly have call this the covid of the poultry industry do the minister accept that it be likely as with covid that the only way forward will be vaccination the right hon gentleman raise an important point as he will be aware significant international trade issue be involve but as we look to world in which we seem to have more and more of these case that be certainly something that we keep under consideration thank the government for their strong and fast response which know will be big reassurance for lot of the farming community impact may ask the minister to provide bit more detail about the support we be give not just to those who be directly impact now but to those who be understandably very deeply concerned about what this may mean for their business over the come month thank my hon friend for his very important question can assure he that an entire apparatus be in place to ensure that all reassurance can be give to the kind of business that the right hon member for maldon sir john whittingdale describe from an animal welfare point of view we will ensure that everybody involve in the sector have the kind of advice and support that be need if my hon friend have colleague who wish to look at the advice they should look at the webpage available on government website which be significant and thorough if people need advice they should not hesitate to come to my official or to and we will point they in the right direction thank the minister very much for his response to the urgent question poultry and egg production contribute significantly to the northern ireland economy it be value at some million so it be little wonder that the agricultural community have great concern what discussion have the minister have with the devolved nation particularly the northern ireland assembly about put in place the support that be need take into account that wild bird case have be find in the last two week in northern ireland be as ever grateful to the hon gentleman for raise the issue as it impact northern ireland we have be develop uk wide response to this and my official be in constant contact with official from his administration we will ensure that this uk wide response continue to be in place because it be very important that we work together on all these issue hope in the not too distant future to continue my tour of the country and very much look forward to take up his long stand invitation not only to stormont where have be before but to his fishing sector and the very warm welcome that know will receive order the sitting be suspend sit suspend woman health strategy urgent question to ask the secretary of state for health and social care if he will make statement on the woman health strategy thank the hon lady for give the opportunity to set out our commitment to the woman health strategy and everything that this government be do to fix our break nhs clean up the mess that the conservatives leave after year and get woman treat on time again when we come into office we inherit record waiting list the gynaecology waiting list stand at just under woman let that sink woman in pain wait to be care for almost half the woman on gynaecology waiting list be wait more than week that be why the prime minister kick off with our elective reform plan set out how we will cut the long waiting list from month to week our new agreement with the independent sector will mean that where there be spare capacity in the private sector woman will be treat fast for gynaecology care pay for by the state the government be also commit to root out the appalling inequality in maternity care we be support fail trust to make rapid improvement train thousand more midwife for the first time and we will set an explicit target to close the black and asian maternal mortality gap we be pilot training programme to help avoid brain injury for baby in childbirth and if successful we will crack on with roll it out nationally this year in october we extend the baby loss certificate service to help mum and dad who have suffer the heartbreak of pregnancy loss let also address the issue of woman health hub there be target in last year planning guidance to roll out pilot woman health hub across the country by last december today there be at least hub and at least nine out of integrate care system have an open woman health hub let correct some fake news we be not close these hub we be not cut they the target to roll they out be in last year planning guidance it be achieve in of integrate care system which be why the target be not repeat in this year guidance it have be meet in out of area today we have slimme down the number of target for the nhs so that we can focus on fix the fundamental the system that the previous government break we be instruct the nhs to prioritise cut waiting time for operation and ambulance make it easy for people to see gp or dentist and improve the mental health of the nation that will mean around woman with suspect cancer be diagnose early and treat fast more than extra woman will be treat within week as we drive down long wait and few woman will be force to wait hour in that be the difference that labour government be make to woman health for too long woman experience of the health service have be one of be push from pillar to post crucially woman voice have be ignore and response to their pain suffering poor sex life and traumatic birth have be too slow overall woman have sense of be forget some million more woman be in work under our conservative government pain and suffering be affect too many woman and their ability to remain in the labour market result in early retirement or not have their true career potential fulfil we take direct action crucially by listen to woman experience we have almost response to our call for evidence on the gender health gap we appoint dame lesley regan as the woman health ambassador and helen tomlinson as the cross government menopause ambassador to find out the experience of woman employ in different sector we deliver and fund new woman health hub and create join up service in the community the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists estimate that remove the requirement of integrate care board to have woman health hub will impact woman on waiting list in england create long wait disease progression that could be prevent and result in more woman attend unable to work care or live fulfilled life labour manifesto say that it will prioritise woman health woman be now report to be lobby group relegate to be unheard once again will the minister confirm whether it be true that the target to deal with woman need will be drop if so what be her justification for that will she be deliver on the roundly welcome woman health strategy from total of family give evidence to the all party group on birth trauma what be the plan to drive up maternity safety standard across the country will there be response to that will dame lesley regan be sack will she remain the woman health ambassador or will she be replace as helen tomlinson be by someone who seem more interested in sell book than in deliver on the ground for woman what step be be be take on sex specific language in health communication and guidance order the shadow minister will know that there be time limit which she have exceed have be very generous call the minister address most of those point in my outline statement think the shadow minister write her comment when the opposition think that we be cancel thing only to find out that we be not cancel thing have make clear our commitment to the woman health strategy and how we seek to instruct the system at local level to serve the need of woman and particularly prioritise those waiting list as have outline the target have already be achieve unusually will give bit of credit to the other side because lot of this be roll out and it be good practice and the system still think that it be good practice so sometimes opposition members should take win we be committed to that it be embed in the system and we look forward to outcome be improve for woman call the chair of the women and equalities committee the committee report on woman reproductive health start under our fantastic predecessor lay out how medical misogyny have leave far too many woman suffer woman have be leave undiagnosed for debilitate condition such as endometriosis for an average of eight year not for treatment for diagnosis black woman be four to five time more likely to die during childbirth and the rate of maternal death in the uk have rise by in the last year the lead cause of that be suicide account for of death in the first year postpartum do the minister therefore agree that woman and woman of colour especially have bear the brunt too often of year of disastrous health policy how can the government reverse this trend thank the committee chair for her question think she be congratulate the previous committee and chair rather than those who be now in opposition be very pleased to witness some of that work when we be in opposition and she be absolutely right about it the work of many woman member when in opposition and to be fair of many woman in the previous government have make sure that issue around endometriosis have rise up the agenda indeed we have good debate in the chamber recently we be committed to take forward the strategy we think the health hub for example be do good job but there be lot of learn to be do on they and we will continue to do that call the liberal democrat spokesperson nearly woman be wait for treatment on gynaecology waiting list in england the long wait be lead to preventable disease progress and it be one of the bad specialty for long wait the care quality commission have investigate and report that of maternity unit be not as safe as they should be that high number could almost be consider public health crisis and it have lead to the high amount of negligent payout due to avoidable injury and even death this absolutely need to be address many woman such as my partner emma have have to fight for year to get just diagnosis for endometriosis let alone any treatment have be tell for year that the symptom be completely normal and do not need investigate in the government order know be be difficult on time limit but the liberal democrat person should have one minute in an urgent question which the hon gentleman have already far exceed perhaps he will come up with question in one sentence for the minister apology madam deputy speaker yes in one sentence the government manifesto rightly say that never again will woman health be neglect can we have assurance that we will not remove the icb requirement to have woman health hub the hon gentleman be right to highlight those long wait that be why we particularly highlight gynaecology for attention in the elective reform plan it be shocking that the last government leave woman on these list and move back to make sure people wait no long than week will predominantly be help those woman the hon gentleman be also right to highlight the appalling maternity situation the secretary of state and my noble friend baroness merron who lead in this area have meet many family to discuss their experience and we know those experience be unacceptable we know there be big issue around staffing and it be priority to work with nhs england to make sure that we grow workforce capacity as quickly as possible so that we can be sure that those situation be safe there be many debate in this place about the issue and we will continue to update the house under the last government five time more research go into erectile dysfunction which affect of man than go into premenstrual syndrome which affect of woman woman be wait more than eight year for endometriosis diagnosis gps be not require to undertake gynaecological rotation within their training woman health must be put at the head of our agenda will the minister assure woman in this country that thing will change under this government absolutely will give my hon friend that assurance the situation will change partly because there be more people like she and more woman in this place we have more woman across all party raise this issue and more woman in senior position in the national institute for health and care research crucially we have woman lead in science and research deal with the misogyny around the system and in medical system be also important for make sure that woman lead this work we want to make sure that the nihr which have strategy to address this issue rectify the situation that she outline the minister will be aware of the ockenden report back in which highlight the tragic case of more than mother and baby who be kill over period of year at the shrewsbury and telford hospital nhs trust donna ockenden recently return to the trust and say that she be surprised and disappoint to hear from those parent and family affect that the trust have not be communicate as well as it should have be and have not be update the family in timely manner do the minister agree not only that communication be key but also that review such as those undertake by donna ockenden should have the remit to go back to check and monitor the progress of maternity service that be either improve or not completely agree with the right hon member donna ockenden work be hugely valuable and lot of faith and trust have be place in it particularly by family do not know specific date but the secretary of state and my noble friend baroness merron who lead on this work have be discuss the matter with donna ockenden be happy to get back to the right hon member with the detail on the specific point about the remit do not know the answer to that question it be entirely sensible to look at progress and learn from mistake know it be challenge system and we have to learn from those area if there be specific thing to report back to the right hon member will get back to he but this issue be absolutely priority the secretary of state be meet family directly we know and understand that we have to do much well on this for everybody have listen to the shadow minister be slightly tempt to suggest to the minister that our woman health strategy include provision for the treatment of collective memory loss the shadow minister completely ignore the fact that the tories let our nhs fall into disrepute over the past year want to ask specifically about how our health strategy will deal with treatment and support for young people particularly young woman suffer from depression and anxiety that follow tragic case in my constituency and coroner report last week which find that our local hospital be not able to support that patient my hon friend be right to highlight some tragic incident and know she will be work hard on behalf of her constituent we be absolutely committed to the woman health strategy clearly that will be take forward as part of the year plan and it be an important part of that meet my noble friend baroness merron yesterday and the team support that plan to make sure that we understand how those key issue be take forward this be an opportunity if may madam deputy speaker to say that the consultation on that plan be still open for idea we be keen to hear in particular from young people to make sure that we get true representation these sort of thing be not often consult on so we encourage young people and people who be suffer from depression and mental health issue to contribute their thought about the system they face as part of our year plan consultation be sure we all welcome the move to reduce waiting list and recognise that the woman health strategy be year plan but give the enormous problem highlight by the hon member for luton north sarah owen and my hon friend the member for winchester dr chambers do the minister appreciate that to many woman who be have trouble access often fragment gynaecological service it will seem like vital facility be about to be lose and that the government promise of never again will sound hollow what will the government do to reassure all the woman who be concerned about this move be not entirely clear what the hon member be refer to have be clear that we be committed to the woman health strategy and we will take it forward as part of the year plan most of if it be about the woman health hub they be mainly there but in different form and with different level of service we want to ensure that the system reflect their local population need that be an entirely proper way to go about thing as say unusually we think that many of the hub which be roll out as pilot under the previous administration be do good job in most area although not everywhere so we want to learn from the pilot our commitment be absolutely to woman that be why gynaecology waiting list be particularly target we have woman on they woman should feel really assure about the support that the government be give they and their health to prioritise their health we be keen to learn more about woman health hub they will be different in different place because they have different population and that be entirely in keep with the direction of travel of the government also thank my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen for her work in raise the serious health inequality that woman across the uk face every single day do the minister agree that we need more expertise in woman health issue in primary care setting to ensure early diagnosis and that woman get the treatment they need at the early point my hon friend make an excellent point about both the work of the chair of the select committee my hon friend the member for luton north sarah owen and the importance of primary and community care recognise listen to and support woman through woman health as well as make sure that our knowledge and good practice be spread across the team this be an area where different system have woman health hub use different team and different technology and they have different link to secondary care colleague and specialist colleague by listen to each other and work together they be so good at spread some of that good practice welcome the minister come to the house to answer the urgent question because the argument she be put forward seem slightly confused first woman health hub seem to be work on the whole and there be lot of they so why remove the target for everybody to have they if we be already there secondly many of the hub seem to be do good work and good practice be clearly emerge so why cancel the target for the programme rather than spread that good practice throughout the system think the broad question from the opposition be why remove the target specifically relate to woman from the government agenda go forward it feel to many woman and to the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists which have be in contact with that that downgrade the status of woman in the nhs will try to be brief but this be hard to no this be to answer the right hon gentleman target in the nhs have not be meet since which be under his government watch but actually this target have be meet there be only three place in the country that do not have hub so there be no target for they because that have already be meet the issue now be to look at the outcome from those hub to see how they be perform we think and the system think that they do good job that be why they be stay why we be committed to they and why we want to learn from they bedford hospital once have gold standard home birth service but in recent month it have be run down within the wide trust due to unfilled vacancy many of my constituent be concern at the prospect of lose that service which put woman need and health choice first will the woman health strategy ensure that woman can access consistent midwifery service that provide genuine choice for safe home birth my hon friend make an excellent point about maternity service which be inconsistent and not good enough around the country it be source of great alarm for many people maternity absolutely remain high priority within the overall woman health strategy if you be black and have baby you be more than three time more likely to die than if you be white and have baby be sure that the minister and members across the house will agree that that be national disgrace be encourage to hear the minister mention target for maternal mortality disparity in her opening remark but would be grateful if she could confirm that the elimination of that disparity be the target and update the house on when the nhs plan to achieve that the hon lady make the point about use target this be something that be high priority but it be not happen that be absolutely why mention it in my opening comment to ensure that that happen forty year ago this month my wife almost die of an eclamptic seizure because general practitioner have fail to recognise the symptom of pre eclampsia accord to the most recent report on pre eclampsia four time as many woman be die of pre eclampsia today than be die in that be an absolute disgrace if man get pre eclampsia they would have solve the problem many many year ago hon member hear hear will the minister assure and everyone else that the woman health strategy will focus on pre eclampsia and try to finally find solution my hon friend make very powerful case and talk of an experience that he and his wife go through forty year ago which highlight that it can sometimes take an unacceptably long time to get what be know as good practice through the system and to have that consistency for woman and their family across the overall system we absolutely need to ensure that maternity service understand good practice and that it be roll out properly across the country in an early answer the minister rightly talk about the arrangement the government have over spare capacity in the independent sector my female constituent and woman up and down the land want to know what that actually mean in practice what do that mean for the woman wait more than week for gynaecology treatment how many treatment will the independent sector be deliver and to what timescale we need to get those woman the treatment that they need the hon gentleman can tell his woman constituent what hope everyone across the house will be able to tell their constituent this government inherit woman on those waiting list and we be commit as say in our elective reform plan which highlight gynaecology in particular to get those waiting list down from month to week in the lifetime of this parliament represent almost woman and they and the man who love they would invite the minister to state explicitly that the government will not draw down their access to woman health hub or remove their woman health target have make that commitment several time from this dispatch box we think the woman health hub be work across the country do not know exactly how the hon gentleman hub be work at the moment only three area do not have woman health hub and we expect they to get on with that and have one we will ensure we have the learning from they across the country the minister get her tone wrong in deal with this urgent question if minister turn up late for uq the least they can do be take the question from the opposition front bench seriously amanda pritchard the ceo of nhs england have say that the health service do not always have the need of woman at its heart what message do the government think scrap woman health target will send the chief executive be right that the previous government do not have woman health at the heart of their strategy and that be why we do as chair of the all party parliamentary group on hiv aids and sexual health may ask the minister about the very low take up of pre exposure prophylaxis among woman in the uk what step be be take to change that obviously there be barrier such as stigma and low level of information but do she agree that prep should not just be make available in sexual health setting particularly as we have have the roll out of opt out testing thank the right hon gentleman for the work he do in this area he do an excellent job and make an excellent point do not know the detailed answer to that question it be not directly my area but be very happy to make sure that we write to he thank the minister very much for her answer the woman health survey for northern ireland close tomorrow through it the department of health back home be hop to have great understanding of how government fail woman the result of this northern ireland wide project will ensure the department will be able to find the area that be lack in particular endometriosis support will the minister make contact with the northern ireland assembly to discuss the health strategy and to share the result and the datum so that the uk government and the northern ireland assembly back home can work well together to make woman health well across this great united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland as hope the hon gentleman know think the health need of woman in northern ireland and the waiting list there be particularly problematic so find out anything our department can to do support or share learn across the united kingdom be personal

the energy that she put into bring this house into the second quarter of the century we be lucky to have someone so persuasive in her position someone who really listen to member hon member but no but madam deputy speaker approach this session of business question in that spirit one innovation that would be very welcome would be commitment from the leader of the house to provide our date for opposition day debate which we have still not receive another extremely welcome innovation would be the secretary of state for energy security and net zero find time to reply to numerous letter send

by more than since and funding be not equitable in stoke on trent spending per young person be less than in inner london family in my constituency deserve well will the leader of the house make time to debate the need for adequate and equitable funding for youth service it be source of national shame that youth funding decrease by three quarter under the previous government one of the deep cut

tracy brabin who be real leader in this regard this week meet constituent bradley price who have recently take up degree apprenticeship with nuclear transport solutions we talk about the excellent transferable skill he be gain and the great career option open to he there be no doubt that high quality apprenticeship like that can be the right route for so many school leaver yet it seem from talk to pupil in rossendale and darwen that awareness of the range and quality of such opportunity be remarkably low welcome the announcement of backbench business debate on apprenticeship but would the leader of the house agree to debate in government time on raise awareness in school about apprenticeship wish bradley good luck with his degree apprenticeship my hon friend be absolutely right that degree apprenticeship offer real career opportunity for many of our young people and they be still not as widely know about as they should be through career advice in school he raise really important point with which this government wholeheartedly agree wrexham be thriving hub of business and the continue investment in the wrexham and flintshire investment zone be very welcome indeed company such as wrexham lager kellogg and jcb among other be export from wrexham around the globe however too many business have have to give up on export due to the huge increase in cost from red tape introduce under the previous government such thing be critical if we be to achieve the growth we want so will the leader of the house please consider provide parliamentary time to debate how we can ensure that these business get the support they need be sure my hon friend welcome in fact he have do the much deserved announcement this week of an investment zone for his constituency of wrexham he be absolutely right that business face far too much red tape especially because of the botched brexit deal by the last government and this government be commit to reduce that since last year all parent in england who have experience the heartbreak of lose pregnancy have be able to apply for certificate that formally recognise their loss an agreement be make in principle with the previous secretary of state of health to extend the scheme to wales but discussion be pause before the general election would the leader of the house consider write to the relevant ministers to ask they to meet to discuss how this scheme could be extend to wales so that baby loss certificate be make available without any further delay thank my hon friend for raise that really important topic she be absolutely right that baby loss certificate in england have provide recognition and comfort to many family who have be bereave by baby loss think her call for the scheme to be extend to wales be absolutely right and will make sure she get some contact with minister to discuss it far save the good contribution to last call sureena brackenridge in wolverhampton north east in the past five year we have lose bank

explanatory note bill en proportional representation general elections beg to move that this house have consider proportional representation for general election before speak on the matter at hand note that today be the funeral of one of my party and our country great politician john prescott send my thought to his family and friend they include some who would otherwise have be with we today equally some of we here would have wish to be there thank the backbench business committee for grant time in the chamber for this crucial debate and the many colleague from across the house and from every nation and region in the uk who co sponsor or support the application it be right that the house should provide time to consider proportional representation for general election to this place just last month the house vote in favour of pr for the first time ever by give leave to bring in the ten minute rule bill on the subject move by the hon member for richmond park sarah olney who see in her place that historic vote be an indication of the strength and breadth of feeling among member on both side of the house that our first past the post electoral system be not work it be desperately in need of an upgrade and we need seriously to consider the alternative the last time we do so be through the jenkins commission in when election produce result in which the number of seat more closely match the number of vote than they do now my hope for today and it be one know many other share be that member can explain why so many colleague and so much of the public at large have reach the conclusion that it be time to think again about our electoral system in do so want to encourage the government to be bold and to be honest about how unrepresentative british general election have become thank my hon friend for his powerful opening speech turnout at the general election in july last year drop to below which mean that two in every five people do not participate do my hon friend agree that that show we need change so that more people engage in our democratic system absolutely the turnout and engagement of voter in general election should be matter of concern for everybody in this place and in the country at large the truth be that first past the post be fail on its own term it be become less and less representative and produce more and more random result there be more outlier and more mp be elect on less than of their constituent who vote in reality some mps represent constituency in which perhaps of those they represent do not vote for they these be the low figure since the beginning of universal suffrage the number do not lie and they can no long be ignore the public know it our party know it and we in this place know it these grow failure of representative democracy the widespread feeling that ordinary people do not have fair say over who speak for they or how they be govern be feed the record low level of trust in politic and faith in democracy and that should worry all of we the government have responsibility to face up to those problem and address they before the next general election start with the launch of national commission for electoral reform the government be brave enough to undertake this work at time when confidence in the electoral and political system be much high and those system be less stressed than they be now let begin by look at last year general election most people get neither the party they vote for into government nor the candidate they vote for as their local mp labour win historic majority and like other labour mps whose seat be perceive as safe in the live memory of all party member and probably all party travel around the country to work in many marginal constituency where we need to get vote to win however this speak to the failure not to the success of our system the general election be culmination of year of fall vote share for the win party and we the labour party win on just one third of the national vote of course always work extremely hard for my party to be in government and be delighted that almost million people vote for we however million people vote for other party and we must admit that they be the vast majority of those who take part in the election they do not get to influence the kind of government the country have and it can no long be acceptable to have winner take all culture on the basis of third of the country vote that erode our democracy one of the argument of supporter of first past the post election be that people be not really vote for government but just for local mp let we take this at face value only four out of voter get the local mp they vote for at the last election and six out of do not get the mp they vote for we have system that ignore those six out of people we be now in an unprecedented situation where of we be elect by less than of the voter who turn out to vote be one of the lucky few who receive over of the vote so this debate and the change be propose be not of personal benefit to some elect with less than of the vote few colleague be not sure any be in the chamber be even elect with less than of the vote when most people representative in parliament do not reflect how they vote it feed the all too pervasive sense that westminster be some distant unresponsive institution in which voter have no real voice like all first past the post election be one in which some vote and area matter more than other system that force party to prioritise small group of vote in handful of marginal seat also force they to neglect large part of the country where to go who to speak to both directly and through the medium and the policy put forward people in non battleground seat which make up the majority of seat at every first past the post election never have the resource spend on they that be spend on marginal seat candidate and activist be direct away from those perceive safe seat to marginal mean less contact in those seat that be usually reflect in the turnout of safe seat compare with marginal seat as voter be generally well aware of the relative importance of their constituency it be hugely corrosive to our trust in politic and we end up with most people and community up and down the country say that they feel invisible to politician to use the word of the brown commission people can tell when they be be ignore they can also smell unfairness mile away first past the post mean that people vote be not equal in value sometimes fear that we in this place be use to that gross unfairness in election and have become numb to it but for million of people their stake in national politic be the vote that they get to cast in general election every few year when they see that party win million vote and get four mp or party win million vote and get five mp it be clear to they that the system be not fair it drive voter either into the margin or away from vote at all if we in westminster be content to say that just the way it be it be no wonder that hardly anyone trust politic my hon friend may be aware that an electoral commission poll from find that more people be dissatisfied with our democratic election system than be satisfied do he think that look at change our current voting system would make more people feel satisfied be come to that exact point shortly and thank my hon friend for raise it the general election be stark illustration of the problem with our voting system and it be important to understand that it be not one off these problem have be get bad for decade and that be set to continue if we keep the system as it be we have go from of people vote for labour or the conservative party in the to just do so in record low in the first past the post system that produce hugely volatile and erratic result electoral chaos theory as professor rob ford have call it back in the century party need close to of the vote to win majority of seat but that threshold have be fall to new low for decade in in and as say one third last year there be every reason to think that this trend will continue that party even an extreme one can win huge majority with less than third of the vote be not just senseless but dangerous if we do not address this now fear that election result will become even less representative government and mp will be elect with low support than ever and there will be increasingly chaotic and random result that will drive trust and engagement still low that be unsustainable and think the government know it labour official policy on first past the post be set out in the final national policy forum document that the party produce in the previous parliament which set the policy platform for our manifesto it state the flaw in the current voting system be contribute to the distrust and alienation we see in politic agree as do almost all the party on the opposition benches we know that the public agree two third want the flaw in the voting system to be address before the next general election accord to survation the long run british attitude survey find record majority support for change to pr with those who trust politic least the most likely to support change be they not the people we need to engage just this month yougov find that support for pr hit an all time high with support for first past the post at an all time low every single mp in great britain have be contact by constituent in recent day ask they to support pr in this debate have receive hundred of email even though my name be on the debate the prime minister have make it clear that restore trust in politic be key priority call the fight for trust the battle that define our age if the government be to win the battle they must address our flawed voting system one they know be drive distrust and alienation in politic which mean that million of people vote do not count and which most people do not want to continue with that be why urge the government to take this first step by establish national commission for electoral reform as recommend by the all party parliamentary group for fair election which chair the government have say that there be no consensus on new system but that be exactly why there be great opportunity to set up process that begin to build consensus national commission to examine the issue that first past the post be cause and to recommend fair and democratic alternative the hon gentleman be make good case though one that fundamentally disagree with as he will hear later he have just outline his own government position on proportional representation we have already have an answer on that so where can he go now on december when ask by the hon member for didcot and wantage olly glover the deputy prime minister say that this government would not set up national commission and would not examine proportional representation any far what do the hon gentleman propose to do to make the government change their mind have just say that the first step would be for the government to set up national commission this debate be the first step for the appg to try to persuade the government to set up that national commission we be on journey not everything the government announce at the start of the parliament be what they be still announce change be possible the commission could draw insight from the experience of devolved body and other democracy it could allow citizen as well as expert to contribute to evaluate the option and find way forward that would command public trust and confidence none of this need distract from government core mission of deliver their manifesto priority but it would demonstrate beyond doubt that they be serious about give strong voice to million of people who feel increasingly exclude from british politic when be out knock on door in my constituency in last year general election campaign lot of people reminisce with about previous general election when the liberal candidate come just tantalise vote short of the incumbent conservative they speak very fondly of that candidate which might not be surprising except the election that they be recall be in over four decade ago also remember speak to an elderly lifelong labour voter who be lend his vote for the very first time because he have to do something different when thank he for place his trust in he tell not to take too much from it because his entire life he have never vote for candidate who have win will always remember that conversation as walk away say well we see about that until last july for year the constituency of chelmsford in its various shape and size over the year have never be represent in parliament by anyone other than conservative in fact it have be year since chelmsford be last represent by liberal something be extremely proud to have correct it should not have to be this way hugely admire the tenacity of that erstwhile labour voter who lend his vote hop against all the evidence of his lifetime that this time it might make difference no wonder turnout in election be often so painfully low our antiquated first past the post system can be incredibly demoralising even for committed political campaigner like myself believe it or not do not like have to ask people on the doorstep to lend their vote so that together we can game the system to get the change that we want would it not well if people could cast their vote in way that let they set out their preference they would know that all would not be lose for they if their first preference candidate do not win as their vote could be transfer to someone else that they also would not mind see elect the turnout in last year general election as have already be allude to be in chelmsford slightly well than the national turnout which be pretty poor in manchester rusholme the turnout be just but these be dizzy height compare with the turnout in local election appreciate that the hon lady be talk about preferential voting system rather than proportional voting system do she understand that there be quite big difference between those two option and obviously today debate be about proportional representation thank the right hon gentleman for his intervention but do not think those two thing be mutually exclusive there be preferential system that can lead to proportional result in fact we see that in many place that use preferential system in the election in may for the police fire and crime commissioner in essex the turnout be barely so why be people not vote surely part of the issue be simply that they do not believe that their vote count they do not believe that they can make difference although do not completely agree with that certainly agree that the first past the post system make it hard there be also other thing in our electoral system that make it hard and do not think that we should be talk about change our voting system without also talk about they for example the introduction of voter id be supposedly design to enhance trust in our election but the evidence suggest that there have be some other consequence in the general election of people who do not vote say that the voter id requirement be the reason that they could not do so additionally of those who go to the poll be unable to cast their ballot because they do not have the correct id those may seem like small figure but if we put they into rough number rather than percentage we can see that with about million people cast their vote the number of people who show up who could not cast their vote because they do not have the correct id be approximately unless have get my math people that be an incredibly high and quite shocking number let we think about that for people could not vote because we want to stop voter fraud of course that might be good idea if there be lot of voter fraud go on but the electoral commission own website say in the past five year there be no evidence of large scale electoral fraud of the case of allege electoral fraud report to police between and lead to conviction and the police issue four caution talk about sledgehammer to crack nut voter registration be another area where improvement be need research show that as many as million people across the uk be not register correctly at their current address this affect key group such as young people private renter and recent home mover who may not realise that they be miss from the register until it be too late although the current system allow for late registration before election this put unnecessary pressure on electoral service and risk leave some people unable to vote on polling day we can see the impact that even small barrier to voting can have imagine what would happen if we break down those barrier and get rid of they we must recognise that barrier to participation include voter id voter registration and the voting system itself be dangerous to our democracy urge the government to take the opportunity to fix this and thereby to strengthen democracy and democratic engagement in our country will be very brief in so as not to repeat the argument that have already be make in such good style by hon member across the house too wish to take this opportunity to put on record my support for electoral reform to ensure that the composition of our representative well reflect the wish of voter and that voter can exercise more choice the labour party have long and proud history of support the objective of proportionality and choice in other legislature across our united kingdom and of course in other election until recently voter be able to offer nuanced view utilise the supplementary vote system in mayoral election sadly that level of choice be rescind by the last conservative government as the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman point out that be just one step take by the conservative party in its elections act alongside the introduction of the need to show identification when voting which have leave many people feel lock out of vote altogether another change put forward by the previous government in the elections act be in relation to postal vote which again have disenfranchise many people do my hon friend believe that if we be to look at electoral reform we should consider some of the consequence of the change that be make by the previous government absolutely agree with my hon friend as be about to say whether it be the inequity of allow the old person bus pass to be use as id but not the young person bus pass or leave out entirely the ability to use veteran id card or train driver licence the act be largely unnecessary and introduce many retrograde measure design to restrict access to our democracy rather than to encourage participation have lot of respect for the hon gentleman he say that the elections act restrict people ability to vote can therefore ask he what measure he would put in place to stop the restricting of genuine voter from vote when their vote be take away by fraud as have already be point out the level of voter fraud in this country be minuscule so that okay then it be not that it be okay but we have introduce legislation that have essentially restrict many many more people from vote than otherwise would have happen will the hon member give way will make some progress if may be pleased that this government have legislate to allow the use of the veteran id card and ask that they look at wide range of suitable id include train driver licence in any future review preferably though we should return to the traditional british approach of not demand id to have access to vote on the issue at hand want to recommend to colleague the outcome of the jenkins commission of which design an elegant solution to the issue that our democracy face when it come to representation jenkin one of the great social reformer of this place to whom many of we still owe great debt of gratitude propose hybrid system that keep many of the benefit of first past the post such as the strong relationship that an mp have with defined and manageable area but with additional proportionality through the additional member system constituency mp would be elect through the alternative vote system to add choice into the system version of that system be now in operation for election in the scottish parliament the welsh senedd and the london assembly so this be not theoretical and voter understand it perfectly well this be proof that labour government can and do deliver much need social reform and always have although do not support electoral reform in the sense of pure pr absolutely accept that politics be about priority this government have huge task to do three thing all at once believe which be not something that many government have face before we must stabilise our public finance get the economy grow in sustainable way and rebuild our public service that be mammoth task but it be what the public demand when they elect our party with landslide last year can well understand that these issue take priority over time for electoral reform do not think that could look my constituent in exeter in the eye if know that we be spend much time and it would be much time in this place discuss how to be elect rather than address their immediate concern as have mention there be much that we can do to make the current system more democratic and accessible so support the call of my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for commission to look into this issue and find way forward therefore although remain an electoral reformer also welcome the government current focus on support the development of strong economy grab the opportunity that be on offer for my region and deliver job and investment in place such as exeter while also work and legislate hard to fix our road end our homelessness and housing crisis clean up our waterway and rebuild our health system it be an honour to sit on the fair election all party group which be so well chair by the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel it be also an honour to take up this fight in this house with the liberal democrats for whom electoral reform have be central tenet for decade in order to be here today have to resign my commission in the royal air force where have for year defend our country and our interest overseas however come to recognise that the most crucial way to defend our democracy be to do so here while back proportional representation throughout the general election campaign resident across tewkesbury constituency frequently express their frustration with an electoral system that be certain to condemn they to another five year of the same conservative member of parliament whichever candidate they vote for tewkesbury have be represent by my predecessor for year and it be the view of many resident that tewkesbury would never experience change because our broken electoral system would see this safe conservative seat win by the conservatives at an eighth consecutive election do not the hon gentleman presence in this house demonstrate that the system do work and can deliver change in individual seat no for two reason the liberal democrats defy the odd but there be many other small party who be not adequately represent and as will come to later of voter across the country do not get the mp they vote for and that be true even in my constituency at the general election tewkesbury do see change but only through the come together of several unique circumstance and despite first past the post like my hon friend the member for chelmsford marie goldman be loan the trust of labour green and conservative supporter the general election may have be win by labour and return liberal democrats in record number but let we not delude ourselves the country vote tactically in record number for whoever would remove the catastrophic nepotistic and morally bankrupt conservative government of july election bring the brief respite before frustration rise once again this be the most disproportionate house of commons in british history with labour mp in of seat but with the low vote share some any win party since and of uk voter do not get the mp they vote for have previously describe first past the post as barely democratic and these figure vindicate public apathy towards politic be reflect in steady decline in general election turnout since the from over to less than in if we want to arrest this decline people must feel that their vote matter the only way to ensure that the next election return representative parliament be to transition to proportional representation electoral system have occasionally be challenge by those who say that proportional representation would increasingly return hung parliaments and would lead to bickering and chaos rather than function government this challenge falter when those people be present with the fact that the previous government and their seat majority be elect through first past the post never in the field of british politic be so little achieve by so many they scramble from controversy to controversy fight among themselves while undermine our institution and allow our public service to crumble today our friend in the united states be live with the inevitable result of their two party system far right populist have seize the previously conservative republican party neuter the medium and dismantle many institutional safeguard we must recognise that we face the same threat as our conservative party the most successful election win machine on earth continue its lurch to the right and bring fringe opinion into the mainstream it can happen here and we must have fair electoral system to mitigate that liberal democrats be elect in record number in on pledge to deliver proportional representation labour member want proportional representation and the public increasingly want proportional representation so say to the government let we come together and do something historic let we put aside our individual and party political interest for the many let we do the right thing let we change our country for the well and deliver proportional representation it be pleasure to take part in this debate on something that be fundamental to fix the foundation of our country it be worth repeat that public trust in our political system be in crisis few than one in three britons believe that the uk be well function democracy as have be say we should be clear that this have not happen overnight it be consequence and reflection of political system that be outdate break and in desperate need of reform which have lead to steady decline in general election voter turnout the election in be the second time in history and the second time since that turnout fall below and it have not be above since even the brexit referendum get only turnout that be not great endorsement of the system we have even more concerningly astoundingly in recent survey of people age to state preference for dictatorship in place of our current representative democracy because they believe that the current system do not deliver and that their voice be not hear my hon friend be make fantastic speech have long support reduce the voting age to change for which there be cross party support do he agree that if we give young people say by give they the vote they will not have some of those view because they will feel engaged and involve in the political process absolutely agree and will come on to that later young people believe that the system do not deliver and that their voice be not hear these statistic should be of concern to we all regardless of political persuasion and it be clear that the status quo have to go of country across europe have proportional representation of some kind include in scandinavia where voter turnout regularly exceed level we have not achieve since three of these country be find in the uk scotland northern ireland and of course wales have operate form of pr since devolution in and in wales for our next set of election next year we will move to full pr system which fully support and campaign for the welsh system show that rather than be something to be fear pr enhance our democratic system voter can head to the ballot box know that their choose party will receive fair representation in accordance with how they perform it be time for westminster to follow suit it can not take two more decade for the commons to catch up trust in politic and politician be at one of its low ebb the introduction of proportional representation be crucial step in rebuild that relationship welcome the measure that the labour government be take to rebuild trust they be make it easy than ever to register to vote embark on significant house of lords reform introduce devolution revolution and show clear intent to clean up politic for good this be fundamentally an argument about fairness everyone vote should be equal and should count surely for the government with their huge commanding majority now be the time to be bold and brave and to introduce proportional representation the first stage would be to establish national commission for electoral reform so that the government can get on the front foot and show that they be serious about address our unrepresentative voting system and stem the rise of disengagement and distrust in politic it would be an opportunity to bring the public as well as expert into conversation about how voter can well be represent and to propose fair and equal voting system fit for modern britain in which everyone vote and voice count as we have hear in this chamber trust in politic be very important for function democracy but sadly the data show that trust be collapse at the last general election we face the second low turnout in the last year with just six in people vote that tell we that far too many people do not think voting matter whereas hope we can all agree that every vote matter that be why pay tribute to the excellent lobbying group make vote matter for propose and promote this issue it be so important how can we have situation where only six in people vote we have the most unrepresentative parliament in live memory the govern party have about of the vote cast but of the seat in this great house what sort of system be that it be completely unrepresentative my good party have of vote cast yet we do not have even mere of seat in the chamber as for the other small party the green party have just under of vote cast but have about of the seat in the chamber that be so damaging to trust in democracy we have vote cast for every reform seat for the labour party it be mere vote for each seat voter still come up to and say how do this work people get confused because as hon member have say we have one system for the general election and another in the devolved nation why can we not have single simple system that we know work and that be use in so many democracy around the world variant of proportional representation not only do our system lead to misrepresentation when it come to seat in the house but its quirk mean that we have no representation on any select committee despite have million of the vote cast trust in democracy collapse when something be as patently unfair as that this issue be so important and we know we can do well it be marvellous that member from the labour party recognise that indeed at the labour conference couple of year back its member pass motion to that effect fairness be vital if we do not have it we have complete misrepresentation of the view of the people on critical issue such as immigration and net zero because we end up with uni party approach it can not be good for democracy if people feel that all their view can not be represent they think what be the point of bother will carry on with my life we all know that more engagement from many people of all age young medium and old be vital for functioning and true democracy thank the hon member who secure this important debate have be debate on this subject outside the house for unbelievably nearly year so have have some time to assemble my thought on it during that time have often hear people argue for or against proportional representation or first past the post base on the immediate advantage for their political party urge against such an approach to question of democracy and electoral system one benefit of engage in this debate for so long be that have be able to see the political cycle change over time an electoral system that might benefit party at one point may work to its disadvantage later the party that get massive boost in seat from first past the post in one election may get disproportionate kicking from the electorate under another system the volatility of the modern electorate make that particularly pertinent the core bedrock of support for both major party be far small group of voter than it ever use to be and demographic and political change be accelerate that no party mine include should think that the current coalition of voter that it have assemble be here to stay and that it should design its preferred electoral system around maximise the number of seat that that coalition of voter can win what be the hon member view on his government proposal to reduce the voting age to give that we be all elect by voter age and above think that be different subject to the one we be debate if the hon gentleman do not mind will proceed on the subject of proportional representation we do not know how voter would behave if they be confront with different voting system we can not say that because labour get of the vote in under first past the post it would therefore have get if the election have be run under proportional representation system voter change their behaviour to fit the voting system there might also be new party that would grow under different voting system with tactical voting in its current form we do not know how many labour identify voter back other party for tactical reason in particular seat the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman mention voter who have speak to she about do so we do not know how many supporter of other party vote labour for tactical reason or what the net impact of unwind those factor might be on each party thank my hon friend for his long campaign on this important issue all of we have probably knock on door and speak to voter who have say that they have never vote because their vote would not count do he believe that if we have different voting system people would be able to see that every single vote at the ballot box make big difference to who be elect on polling day do he share my concern on that do share my hon friend viewpoint and will come to that later in my remark we do not know how much turnout would increase in area where it be now depressed because the outcome under first past the post appear to be foregone conclusion my hon friend anticipate the next thing be go to say the current fracturing of the party system with five party get more than of the vote the number be high in scotland and wales be probably here to stay that mean there be more marginal seat more three or even four cornered fight for marginal seat and more member of parliament elect on relatively low vote share by historical standard ironically that improve the range of viable choice for voter in many seat and their chance of influence the result in meaningful way because there be few safe seat however it be try to pour multi party system into an electoral system design for two party so it inevitably lead to more and more disproportional result where the relationship between vote share and number of seat completely break down for instance as have be mention the liberal democrats get mp despite receive more than half million few vote than reform which get only five mp do not blame the liberal democrats or my party for seek to maximise seat rather than vote that be the game we be suppose to be play with our current system but it be difficult to go out to the public and objectively defend such surreal disproportionality it increase public cynicism about their ability to influence politic my motivation for support move to more proportional voting system be therefore not that think it will provide an immediate or long term advantage to the party that have dedicate my life to campaign for and hope that member of other party would not be motivate by assume that proportional representation will accrue immediate narrow party advantage at labour expense on the contrary as social democrat my approach to any critical question be base on the core principle of social justice democracy and equality that lead to support more proportional voting system just as it lead to egalitarian and redistributive answer to social and economic policy question we should design an electoral system base not on whether it benefit we as individual politician or our own party at specific moment but on whether it deliver just and equitable outcome that can logically be defend in particular we should apply the philosopher john rawls theory of justice and try to measure the impact of each electoral system on the most under represent party and the most under represent voter and argue for system that treat party and voter as fairly and equitably as possible and that give voter as equal influence as possible over who represent they and who govern the country the hon gentleman be be generous with his time and have make some valid point although may not agree with all of they do he believe that to ensure the electorate be fully represent we need to go to the australian model of force all constituent to go to the ballot box thank the hon gentleman for the intervention have look at compulsory voting which be advocate at one point by lord watson of wyre forest be open to the suggestion but basically that be about force people to vote when we should be try to enthuse they to vote through both how we do politic and how the system work all voter should have equal value wherever they live in the uk but first past the post condemn million of voter to live in electoral desert where just one party dominate all commons representation there be no region or nation where that system reflect the diversity of the vote cast and between different region and nation it can benefit different party we need system that send to this place mix of mps from each region and nation who represent their political diversity and balance first past the post privilege and make powerful relatively small number of swing voter in small number of marginal seat while give little political power to the majority of voter in safe seat that distort our political process policy campaign spending where politician visit where activist travel to message and advertising be all focus on swing voter in marginal seat while election in some safe seat can be quiet affair when party be in opposition first past the post make they narrower base in recent parliaments when labour be down to small parliamentary party it often appear to be sectional voice for big city and university town which be unhealthy even though we have million of vote but few mp in demographically different part of the country now the conservative parliamentary party may appear to be dominate by rural interest as its vote in urban area deliver few mp both situation be unhealthy support for proportional representation be now the consensus position at grassroots level in the labour party polling say that of grassroots member support it and the vast majority of constituency labour party member back it when our annual conference vote in favour of electoral reform in fact think it be the topic on which the large number of local labour party have ever submit motion mixed member system use in place such as germany and new zealand prove that the undoubted merit of the constituency system such as have voice and champion for specific geographical area in parliament and give voter great access to we as local representative can be combine with proportional element to produce stable and effective government and would say government who pursue the social democratic value that my party stand for hope that it will not be too long before the labour government align their stance on our voting system with our guide value of equality and democracy be liberal democrat vice chair of the all party parliamentary group for fair election and sponsor of the debate it be genuine delight to see hon member on both side of the house talk about this issue which be one of the found principle of my party believe firmly though that we will bring about the change that our country need only on cross party basis which be why work on the appg with the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel who open the debate and the hon member for north herefordshire ellie chowns be delight look forward to work with they to deliver the change that we need the case for electoral reform be urgent and undeniable first past the post be system that no long function as fair or effective mechanism for translate the will of the electorate into parliamentary representation it be collapse under its own weight the time have come to take the first step in address this failure with the establishment of national commission for electoral reform as colleague across the house have mention the general election be the most distorted in british history labour secure of the seat with just of the vote while the green party and reform uk win almost of the vote between they and receive only nine seat will disagree with both those party often and vigorously on different issue but defend their right to be represent when number of people vote for they those result do not constitute fair representation they represent systemic failure the consequence of such an electoral mess be huge the electoral reform society have show that of those who vote in end up with an mp they do not vote for and that of mp be elect with under of the vote myself include as other have mention it now take vote to elect labour mp but vote to elect reform uk mp broad trend confirm the grow inadequacy of first past the post accord to the institute for public policy research voter turnout have fall from in to below in and trust in politic be at an all time low system that continue to distort electoral outcome so significantly will only worsen this crisis we all recognise that trust be important in politic and we be responsible for build that trust one way in which we build trust be by be accountable and the current system give we accountability to our constituent within the define area of our constituency how would first past the post help build the accountability of name person single mp in that define area be grateful to the hon lady for intervene think her question be probably about how pr would deliver accountability not how first past the post would deliver accountability very much agree that accountability and the constituency link be really important be glad that the debate have not nerde out excessively on which be our favourite form of pr but there be many system operate in the different nation of the united kingdom that deliver that constituency link very much agree that that be an important part of our democracy pr provide clear alternative to what we be currently do it ensure that seat broadly match vote that every voter have meaningful say and that government represent the majority of the electorate we already have proportional representation in the uk just not here in westminster in scotland parliament of voter have at least one representative they vote for while in westminster that figure stand at just accord to the electoral reform society pr in different form be already use in scotland wales and northern ireland as well as in the vast majority of democracy worldwide so why not here evidence show that pr lead to high voter turnout more representative government and more stable policymaking for long time the question of electoral reform have be view as an abstract debate indeed with people argue over versus single transferrable vote rather than one that be integral to democratic legitimacy it be neither sustainable nor responsible to continue govern under system where party can form large majority on barely third of the vote it be reckless to maintain an electoral model that so consistently produce such wildly disproportionate group of mp and leave million of voter feel ignore if these trend be allow to continue it be not difficult to see how turnout will fall far result will become even more distorted and political instability will grow be lib dem out myself early and enjoy speak with and listen to voter be also fan of bar chart on my leaflet be they accurate be delighted to report that my bar chart have be measure and be accurate to the millimetre rise would be delighted to give way on that subject do the hon lady accept that one of the great advantage of move to proportional voting system would be that there would be no need to put any bar chart on any leaflet it would be highly misleading to do so that there would be no two horse race graphic or squeeze messaging and everyone would be able to vote for the party they really want could not have be more delighted to welcome the hon gentleman intervention wonder if he have be listen in to the hazel grove constituency liberal democrat executive meeting agree with the he though when think about how to vote would much rather as imagine would number of voter talk about value principle and policy instead of rather grim look canvasser point earnestly at bar chart worry about who might get in if the vote split pr would be well for our politic and well for our community there be widespread and grow support for change both in parliament and across the country national commission for electoral reform would provide the necessary first step towards finally address the failure of first past the post step that must be take well before the next general election to ignore the urgency of this issue would be to far undermine our democracy government be not always know for do thing that they do not see as be in their good interest however like number of colleague across the house argue that proportional representation be in our whole country interest and that be why urge the government to act the public be watch and the demand for fair representation can not be ignore forever our democracy depend on it we have to get everybody in so we be go to have speak limit of five minute call jas athwal although do not want to upset the camaraderie go back and forth across the chamber this be debate and this be democracy be sure we can all agree that no voting system be perfect we be choose between imperfect system that be fact we must decide base on what work well for our country and pr be not the panacea that everybody be talk about today in we put the question to the british people they overwhelmingly reject the alternative vote system choose to stick with first past the post on monday morning visit the year citizenship class at st peter school in bournemouth where speak with several young people include ozzie who be only just bear at the time of the last vote he ask whether agree that too many people feel their vote do not count that too many young people feel disconnected from democracy and that the continuation of first past the post will leave more people particularly young people disconnect from democracy thank the hon member the other thing would like to say be that when we be over reliant on statistic it say something will come on to statistic as well if be allow have have the privilege of live in my constituency for half century more than year be incredibly grateful for the opportunity that ilford have give to staunch conservative constituency have now become staunch labour constituency although over the year have see many mp from both party of course that be how the democratic process work like hon member across the chamber be devoted to my constituency each and every day serve my neighbour fight for investment in ilford represent their view and ensure that speak up on the issue that matter most to all of they only last week in this chamber raise the issue of democratic backsliding and human right in pakistan subject that be incredibly important to many of my neighbour who have friend and family in the region be accountable to the people of ilford south and take my role and my relationship with my constituent seriously under pr voting system the personal and local link that so value with my constituent would be lose pr system would make it hard for local concern to be represent and address it would take politician away from our community and hollow out the vital relationship between representative and constituent the british academy analysis of close pr system suggest that under pr politician be not beholden to their constituent the tie be loosen and accountability be degrade like the hon gentleman come from local government background do he agree that when vote for councillor as he be constituent be more likely to vote for individual than party and to do so base on the effectiveness of that individual rather than just the party brand think it be about be pragmatic in our response be pragmatic with our resident and make the right decision will the hon gentleman give way will make some headway because can see the clock tick another key weakness of pr system be that they almost inevitably create coalition government we know what happen there no one vote for coalition government instead they be create by agreement hammer out in dark room behind close door they be frankenstein governments which undermine the popular vote when voter can not predict the consequence of their vote coalition circumvent the will of the people and when create an effective opposition become an impossibility democracy fail colleague should be careful what they wish for they may get well vote share and well representation but they may not get well outcome which be what be important to our constituent it be our duty in this place to protect the democratic process it be also our duty to effectively govern to the good of our ability deliver the promise of our manifesto and create the change that our constituent vote for pr system create unstable government with weak foundation and constant compromise we be all too aware of the consequence of government instability and the impact that can have on people life promise break legislation delay injustice prolong look at our neighbour in europe in belgium the federal election in paralyse their political system lead to more than day of deliberation compromise and bartering before they finally form government it take almost two year of debate before seven party coalition be create coalition nobody vote for the role of government be to change people life to legislate and to act instead pr system grind government to halt contrast that with the first day of this government though hon member sit on the other side of the chamber may not like the decision make effective democratic system ensure accountability and enable delivery on those two test pr system fail associate myself with the comment of many other hon member today and thank the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for introduce the debate this debate come at crucial time we be in world characterise by democratic decline and fall trust in institution without public belief in make change through democratic debate political pluralism and representation from people who listen to they we have society vulnerable to exploitation by populist division and tyranny first past the post add to these risk those who seek to distort our national conversation from outside use money and influence to pursue their own agenda can see dangle in front of they the huge prize of what be virtually absolute power if they can achieve the slim of margin to reach first place in volatile system two party system which first past the post assume be in fact long out of date as other hon member have say the most recent uk general election be the most disproportionate on record not only do of voter not receive an elect official of their choosing but the election be one of the most disproportionate election to primary chamber anywhere in the world people be vote in historic number for party other than the conservatives and labour represent different view across the political spectrum and bring in point of view from across our island different nation yet this parliament do not come close to correctly reflect that shift we have parliament that be highly misrepresentative of the public preference and government with huge majority but only of people preference that seem unbalanced and unrepresentative to be not here to make argument that be only in my own self interest proportionality be not the goal here well politic be it be not just party but minority group and the interest of group who might be ignore face discrimination or be geographically spread out and whose interest do not often get fair look in when large majority in this house be elect by only swing voter in marginal constituency like other member from different party be for many year member of the london assembly elect under pr to scrutinise and hold to account mayor elect within modify alternative vote system come here to this building to give evidence to the relevant all party parliamentary group of the time in that capacity talk about how as london wide member work alongside constituency member my role be often to listen to group who be not necessarily get the ear of their constituency member or the mayor and who be try to highlight issue that be happen to people like they in pocket all around london will the hon member explain how constituency casework would be do as constituency mp we all represent define area of the population be the hon member suggest two tier system where she will instead just sweep up from the constituency mp be she effectively ask for two tier of mps yes exactly be describe the different kind of work that different kind of member in the additional member system can do and how that benefit equality and representation be not make party political point at all think member from other party in the london assembly can give example of way in which they have reach out and hear from people in different part of london who have bring issue to prominence in the assembly in the case of the green party we can talk about council estate resident private renter young people disabled people and old people and the way that bring their voice into the assembly have positive influence on the london mayor policy and make he positive advocate for help to reduce the number of demolition for rent control for toilet on the london tube and for youth service that be very positive will the hon lady give way will press on because have one more point to make that show contrast with the current system for general election where people believe that the national politic conversation do not necessarily involve they we find that million of people around the country be never canvass or court on the doorstep at all they be take for grant and that be really poor as the hon member for leeds central and headingley say the members for those seat be call to other part of the country when they would prefer to be knock on door in their own on solution we urgently need an independent national commission on electoral reform want that do by the government as soon as possible the commission should look at how local council and other body can be elect too we have an opportunity present by imminent local government reorganisation the creation of combined authority and potentially very large council to shift to more proportional system potentially use multi member ward and the single transferable vote that be the system use in northern ireland and in the republic of ireland it be incredibly simple for voter to cast their preference the election count be extremely exciting almost like the final stage of it deliver remarkably proportional result it deliver candidate base on consensus not division importantly it deliver for many people not only hardworke representative in the administration but people whose job it be to listen and represent they from opposition party that could help with the potential remoteness of the uber council that be be talk about that should be look at by the commission as well will end there want to start by put on record that be long stand advocate of more proportional electoral system for our general election my belief be that any system to replace first past the post need to balance two core feature to preserve the vital link between member of parliament and constituency and to consider top up mechanism whereby additional seat be allocate in direct proportion to vote cast no model be perfect as my hon friend the member for exeter steve race say there be lot of merit in the additional member system use in holyrood do not want to focus my remark today on the intricacy of alternative system or even the principled argument for reform in too much detail my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst and other have already make that case with conviction and suspect that other will do so later want to focus on how we could build consensus for electoral reform and what timeframe be both desirable and realistic one thing we must avoid be the spectacle of new westminster government win power and then legislate quickly to change to the system if they believe it to be in their self interest we see version of that in the last parliament the conservative government have minority of mps in london but legislate through the elections act of to change the london mayoral system back to first past the post system that they believe would suit they well for westminster election nothing would do more damage to trust than if something similar be to happen any suggestion that the winner get to set the rule of the next contest would be dangerous where do that lead we be afraid inevitably it lead to referendum speak as someone who vote yes to av in and remain in it be fair to say that make the case with some trepidation but believe it must be make if we be to change an electoral system that have be in place for over year it would require national conversation and clear and direct mandate from the electorate do not believe there be mandate for referendum in this parliament but there be an opportunity to build consensus across multiple party to be ready for the next parliament that could be the define work of the independent commission which have be reference the year be likely to be midway through the next parliament it would also be year since everyone in the united kingdom be last ask to endorse change in the electoral system that referendum be rush the alternative vote system propose appear to be the first choice of nobody and be afraid for those of we who support it its rejection by voter be emphatic much have change in our politic since then but all of we who support fair system need to learn from and seek to build case for change in much more consider way believe we have the time the time to build consensus on the good proportional system for westminster time to make the case within each of our party that referendum be the only way to earn mandate for meaningful electoral reform and time to propose date and make the case for it it might seem distant today but be generation on from the last referendum and that strike as fair time to ask the question again thank the hon gentleman for give way he be give typically brilliant speech we use to talk to each other in the boardroom of clarion housing group where we work together and his idea of referendum be interesting if referendum be hold and the result be to keep the current system would he expect the liberal democrats to keep ask that the question be put again and again and again that feel like more of question for our in office chat from few year ago will not comment on the potential reaction of another party but will say that would abide by all referendum result even though that would be three in three and pretty bad track record for it be time to propose date and stick to it first past the post have endure for more than year if we be to convince majority of the public that more proportional system will well serve their interest in westminster as think it will six year be not so long to wait despite my track record remain optimistic that if we have referendum third time around could finally be on the win side thank the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and for north herefordshire ellie chowns and my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart for secure debate on this important topic will endeavour not to repeat the remark that have be make so eloquently by other member but must start by also thank the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes for refer to the question that ask the deputy prime minister few week ago that be perhaps as close to fame as will get in this chamber he be right to observe that the deputy prime minister require persuasion on this point although hopefully the eloquent and articulate contribution of member on both side of the house will help to achieve that and gain her support for the appg request for national commission on electoral reform for there be three key argument in favour of proportional representation first there be currently clear gap between how people vote and the outcome namely the parliament that they get and thus the government and they do not necessarily feel invest in the result let address the point make by the hon member for north durham luke akehurst the general election be probably for the first time quite proportional one for the liberal democrats in its ratio of vote share to the number of mps we have indeed if may be perfectly candid at the risk of incur the wrath of my colleague in part of the country where we have more proportional system we do not always perform quite so well so we be certainly not campaign for this change on the basis of self interest it have in fact be very long stand liberal democrat and indeed liberal commitment and will say more about that shortly secondly the current system be not engage people as have already be mention turnout be decline in record low of vote for the two large party labour and conservative while one in three say that they have vote tactically for someone other than their preferred candidate or party member indeed when many voter be tell on the doorstep that they would be vote tactically for pledge to commit myself wholly so that would not have to ask they to do that again in the future and that be partly why be here today my hon friend speak of low turnout would be grateful for his opinion on whether switch to an electoral system of proportional representation would be to the deficit of any particular party in the house and whether that be reflect in their turnout at this debate there be certainly clear variation in the representation of party in the house for this debate however agree with other colleague who have say that while we do not necessarily know how people will vote if they be give more proportional voting system that be all the more reason for we to have one so that people can feel they can vote with their heart and not with their head or indeed on the basis of bar chart of whatever level of should emphasise that mine be always spot on thirdly proportional representation would deliver less adversarial and more inclusive and discursive politic which have the potential to improve policy governance and tone thing which many people find frustrating in our current system party would no long be able to govern alone with as little as third of the vote and would have to do so with other that be not problem but benefit of move to proportional system because government would represent majority of voter and would have to work together to represent the various platform of the party concern the united kingdom be highly anomalous in retain first past the post very few other european country do so the hon member for ilford south jas athwal make point about coalition hope he be equally condemnatory of coalition that labour have have with other party for example the coalition with the liberal democrats in the scottish parliament in the late and in wales the need to rely on minority support from either the liberal democrats or plaid cymru at various time as for those who scaremonger or be worried about the stability of country with proportional representation let we consider some example from europe the hon member for ilford south cite belgium well belgium have well gdp per capita than we do and if may defend nation that be so often mock the only real crime of the belgians be prefer mayonnaise to ketchup on their chip rather than their electoral system let we consider norway highly prosperous nation that have make wise decision such as create sovereign wealth fund from its precious oil resource something from which this country would have benefit have we do the same switzerland which also have proportional representation and regular coalition government have the most punctual railway in europe and of it be electrify compare to our derisory percentage somewhere in the poland new democracy with year of the fast economic growth in europe also have proportional representation and coalition government put it to the house that we have very little to fear and great deal to gain as say early the liberal democrats and the liberal party have call for fair vote for century and we continue to lead the campaign for fundamental reform of the electoral system will go where my hon friend the member for hazel grove do not and say that it be wrong to suggest that preferential and proportional system prevent individual accountability the single transferable vote system be highly proportional and also critically retain voter ability to vote for individual candidate or not if they choose agree with conservative members who have describe that as an important principle reform be need to address the need for fair representation in politic and to improve the engagement of member of the public not to take action would far erode trust in politic and politician and would increase the risk of people vote for more extreme option next time out of frustration with the current system thank my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for open the debate so eloquently and be grateful for the many excellent contribution that we have hear from member on both side of the house as member of both the labour campaign for electoral reform and the all party parliamentary group for fair election consider it real privilege to be speak in this debate back in be united nations volunteer in bosnia which be hold its first election after the dayton peace agreement be there to make sure that those election be free and fair it be very move to be involve in ensure that the postal ballot of people whose life have be so disrupt by ethnic cleansing be receive and be count that underline for the importance of give everyone the chance to vote and to know that their vote count it pain that here we be in britain in and those thing be not true we have hear many other member talk about the disengagement with politic today which think be reflect in turnout not everyone be vote and we have see some of that far undermine by the last conservative government who deny people vote through the introduction of voter id independent oversight be also important for free and fair election yet the electoral commission have again be weaken many aspect of our democracy have be undermine with the result that people do not feel confident that their vote and their voice count as we have hear million have find themselves unrepresented in this parliament with six out of voter end up with local mp for whom they do not vote we have hear today about the extent of tactical voting be elect in marginal seat up in shipley we have be tell that across the country one in three people vote tactically like the hon member for chelmsford marie goldman spend great deal of time on the doorstep try to persuade people who would otherwise have vote liberal democrat or indeed green that we need to join force and ask they please to lend their vote while be extremely grateful to the many voter who do indeed lend their vote and whom now stand here and represent and of course would love it if they vote for again at the next general election would prefer they to vote for their first preference as indeed would they that be true of marginal seat but we have also hear today that in safe seat many people feel disenfranchised conclude that it be not even worth vote for the party they would otherwise support because it will not make difference even those who be vote for the party that be win those safe seat feel that they be under represent because if there be very large majority many of those vote be still represent by only one person in this place for all sort of reason people do not feel that their vote count and this be breed distrust in politic just of people in this country trust political party we have to reverse that people must feel that their voice count and it do not help when political party campaign only in marginal seat turn to the benefit of pr for which be strong advocate see as young politic student in germany how pr lead to more stable government in my work in health and social care see government elect under pr in the netherlands and germany pursue long term strategic policy on key issue such as social care reform on which there be much common ground between member from across the house it be consensual and collaborative politic we know that the public do not like the heckling and bray that be common in this place on wednesday lunchtime some of our good debate be those in which we be in some agreement for example on climate and nature or on violence against woman and girl hope that with system of pr we would have well politic and that be why support the establishment of national commission for electoral reform the government could get on the front foot show that they be serious about address our unrepresentative voting system and stem the rise in disengagement and distrust in politic we could bring the public with we and rebuild trust in our democracy thank the member who secure this debate they have bring to the house very important issue that and many of my constituent care deeply about the uk history of electoral reform be one of slow gradual change there be much frustration now with our politic and be sure that soon it will lead to great demand for electoral reform british history be full of we take the right and necessary step only for people on the wrong side of history to decry they as the end of the world as we know it example of that be give catholics the vote in make the ballot private in and grant woman suffrage in when we look upon the past we laugh at how silly the country use to be who be to say that the way we view the past be not the way future generation will view we as young teenager in the february general election be and continue to be fill with frustration and sense of unfairness by our electoral system the liberal party win of the vote more than half the vote the conservatives get but it win only seat versus the tories under proportional representation the liberals would have win seat the labour party and the conservatives only this obvious unfairness in our system still drive my personal politic today we need to fundamentally change our electoral system it be undemocratic that under the uk electoral system not all vote count in the same way first past the post feed public disillusionment in politic because it leave million of people feel that their vote be irrelevant just like those in our past although the injustice may not seem as obvious as the injustice of withhold the right to vote on the basis of faith wealth or gender the system essentially withhold the right to vote base on geographic location with so many voter now so disillusioned with the first past the post system will the minister commit to be on the right side of history and deliver the change in our electoral system that the nation really need thank those who secure this debate on really important issue hope all of we here be commit to the fundamental principle that we should have function representative democracy and that election should reflect the will of the people and endow this place with the democratic legitimacy to make law and form government that govern the country in the good interest of the people principle be tough but we have to stick to they be conscious as argue in favour of proportional representation and electoral reform that have there be different system in the election last year the natural consequence would have be more member in the mould of the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice and for clacton nigel farage we have to take the rough with the smooth and accept that legitimacy be important and that the will of the people should be reflect in the number of seat that party secure in this place member have very ably make the point that the system simply do not reflect the will of the people at our most recent general election of people who vote end up with an mp they do not vote for some member of this house be elect with less than of the vote the trajectory be that turnout be decline and the legitimacy of this place will inevitably start to decline as well decade ago party use to need close to of the vote to win majority last year the government secure of the vote it be possible that there will be government in the future who secure even less of the popular vote we have know that this system be fail for many many year it have be discuss historically number of time we have the jenkins commission there be royal commission in and there be speaker conference in in fact the representation of the people act be where we get close to reform not only do it secure vote for woman but the initial draft of the bill legislate for an alternative vote in single member constituency and pr in multi member constituency of course single member constituency be relatively new for the majority of the history of this place we have multi member constituency as member can tell be look back through the history of how pr have advance or not in this place be very take with an argument make by herbert fisher liberal president of the board of education year ago he have florid way of speak but think would repeat his word see before and around prosperous and popular hero of many stricken electoral field member who have enter into every home subscribe to every fund and by thousand and one meritorious process have acquire what be know as the intimate touch with their constituency it be very natural that such hon member who have laboriously perfect themselves in the polite art of electoral intimacy should be unwilling to see any relaxation or change of system official report may vol it be natural when we have be put in this place by system to be reluctant to change it we need to be bold and make the case for electoral reform even though the system we want to replace be the one that get we here sadly century on we have make very little progress be glad that the debate be be hold today and endorse the argument make for national commission we be so behind other country in this respect it have be point out that we be in the minority of democratic country in have first past the post other democracy use pr or mixed member system hope that through this debate and the hard work of member who continually raise the issue and call for commission we can eventually put proposal to the people of this country so that they can ultimately make decision be very take by the speech of my hon friend the member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin who talk constructively about how we get to that point hope that the decision will be take to adopt pr the system that be in the word of churchill when it come to address constitutional injustice incomparably the fair the most scientific and on the whole in the public report june vol how we vote and how we select who govern this country be by nature topic of huge national significance and one that be too often push to the sideline have be member of the liberal party now the liberal democrats since be fight for fair system of electoral representation be key to my political mooring and my party fight for fairer democracy for the british people be the mother of four child have one daughter she be as clever as she be beautiful last year she produce report on voting system across the world include in russia south america africa america the european union and here her analysis show incontrovertibly that proportional system be much fair include for woman those who be disabled and those from an ethnic minority this be not just about the bar chart or the figure it be about real fairness in the most recent election we see government elect to power on the low vote share for over year with the low proportion of the electorate support since just of register voter cast their ballot for the labour party four out of five voter either vote for somebody else or do not vote at all one of the so call merit of the first past the post system be that it be design to deliver clean winner but this be illusory reach back through the annal of british electoral history we see that be the last time govern party secure over of the vote share the tower majority secure under our system be deliver not on the basis of representative vote but through the quirk and idiocy of flawed system when first past the post do not deliver tower majority it deliver exactly the sort of instability that it be design to avoid do the election produce clear winner lead to strong and stable government the former member for maidenhead could answer that one for we for too long the party of red and blue have take the british people for grant in last summer general election labour and the conservatives return their low combine vote share in the age of universal suffrage yet their combine seat still dwarf those of all other party in this place some of voter have to settle for an mp they do not vote for include my constituent that hardly seem right or fair the evidence of broken system be clear for all to see what on earth have happen to true majority rule another argument in support of the first past the post system relate to its simplicity agree that our democratic process should be simple but what be simple than people be able to vote for the party that they believe in rather than feel that they have to vote tactically the system be not fair and it be not proportional and my colleague in my party will continue to fight hard to raise awareness about its unfairness not because it be the politically expedient thing to do as have be point out we do rather well under first past the post at the last general election but because it be the right thing to do if anyone argument against fairer electoral system be that they might disagree with whom the british people vote for would ask they to consider why they make such an argument because it be not out of service to the british people thank my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and the hon member for hazel grove lisa smart and for north herefordshire ellie chowns for secure this debate as member have mention we meet thousand of voter face to face in the general election campaign and by far the most depressing conversation have be with the many people who have lose trust in our government institution our politician and our democratic process absolutely do not think the voter be to blame for that loss of trust which be partly due to the last decade in which chaotic government lurch from crisis to crisis to corruption scandal and to the decline of local service that drive lot of people to opt out of the election result in the poor turnout figure to which member have refer the low for year do not think that be because of apathy alienation from our political system be fundamental threat to our democracy agree with my hon friend the member for exeter steve race that we should not for one minute think that electoral reform alone will solve this issue the central task of this government be to deliver rise living standard rise wage and improve public service that will help restore the electorate faith in politic and faith that the government will deliver on thing that people care about how do the hon gentleman think his party be do on those criterion we have record level of investment record rise in wage and the fast grow economy in europe the upgrade from the international monetary fund and the oecd speak for themselves the issue that we be focus on today fix our democratic plumbing matter too the prime minister say that restore trust in politic be the battle that define our age and believe that we can earn that trust by ensure that people feel heard and have say in decision that affect their life will the hon gentleman give way on that point will make bit of progress we need to ensure that the voice of the people matter that be the foundation of my belief in electoral reform if do right with appropriate model for different level of government it can help to rebuild faith in our democratic system so that we do not end up be more polarised with more alienation which lead to extreme politic and populism agree with my hon friend the member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin that today be not the time to go into model but think we can retain the constituency link and expand choice as in the australian model which give local winner degree of preference from majority of the voter in their district through rank choice voting an excellent analysis from lewis baston on sam freedman website explain how the australian model could be appropriate for we it be easily understand and encourage engagement across the spectrum beyond the swing voter that otherwise become the predominant focus of election although support electoral reform for westminster election there be straightforward policy change that the government should consider immediately restore the rank choice voting system for mayoral election that system work perfectly well in london and other mayoralty because it allow voter to express preference and ensure that winner have broad support its removal be regressive and self interested step it fail in london by the previous government who actively try to reduce voter choice and participation hope the government will consider restore that system in any future election bill that be be discuss finally will briefly address another threat to our democracy that the appg for fair election be focus on the role of foreign billionaire in distort political discourse and the risk of overseas donation into our politic there be still far too many loophole in our electoral financing rule leave we vulnerable to foreign interference hope the government will consider implement reform to address these serious issue in any future election bill because if we be serious about defend democracy we need transparency and safeguard against those with deep pocket who seek to warp our democratic institution our current system be fail to command public trust that be the foundation of my belief in electoral reform if we continue down this path we risk lose something far great than individual election we risk lose people faith in democracy itself be confident that our government will deliver on their key mission which will go long way towards restore the public trust and confidence but our democratic plumbing matter too and it be time for an upgrade as the member of parliament for st austell and newquay represent constituency that exemplify the rich diversity and complexity of political identity in britain will use it as geographical case study for today debate from the fishing community of mevagissey and the suppose surfer paradise of newquay which be actually quite multifaceted town to the clay country village near st austell many of my constituent share cornish identity but be also shape by complex mix of cultural social and economic factor such diversity should be reflect in our politic but that be often not the case under first past the post the current electoral system obscure the complexity oversimplify the intricate patchwork of overlap political identity and deny many voter the choice to express they too often our electoral system function to maintain and reinforce rigid political boundary that do not always reflect the nuanced and diverse belief of our community which entrench social division rather than foster the kind of constructive consensus build politic that we need in modern britain and which we in cornwall be quite use to may put it to the hon gentleman that the opposite be the case our system require coalition to be form political party be broad coalition in order to overcome that disadvantage and get over the electoral hurdle in system that be proportional party can secure electoral representation and be much more choosy about their ideological base in the expectation that they will still get sufficient parliamentary representation as consequence party make their coalition after an election stitch up around programme that nobody vote for the right hon gentleman raise an interesting point about the nature of coalition building which take place in both system follow up on that point do the hon gentleman agree that in our current system people vote for what can actually be very loose coalition our electoral system force we to have very large coalition in order to form government but voter do not know which part of those coalition they be go to get after an election both the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne and the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young raise important point about the imperfection in all system and about be mindful that coalition building be feature of all system in st austell and newquay my constituent be as diverse in their perspective as they be in their daily life many feel deep rooted connection to cornish culture heritage and even nationhood socially and economically they navigate very different reality some be tie to the rural economy other be engage in tourism and trade and many have livelihood shape by the seasonal nature of coastal life other have strong tie to the industrial economy which be see much need resurgence in some way that mean that have labour mp in the area be long overdue although cornwall be in many way conservative part of britain we have share belief in fairness economic justice and the principle that hard work should be reward these share value must be reflect in our system the consensus building we do through this patchwork should be the by product of system rather than simply the result of the good will and share value we have in cornwall under the current system many voter feel that their vote fail to express those nuance which can lead to disengagement disillusionment and sense that the political system do not serve they moreover the political boundary foster by the first past the post system make social integration more difficult often deepen ignorance polarisation and division sadly winner take all system do not encourage dialogue or co operation but entrench an adversarial style of government in which short term victory be prioritise over long term solution by contrast more proportionate system would ensure that political view be not distort or dilute in the same way it would allow for great plurality mean that every vote carry more weight no matter where in the country it be cast move to such system would enhance our democracy and ensure that parliament well represent the broad spectrum of view hold by the electorate just because deny the primacy of first past the post it do not mean that think change should come overnight without serious discussion or without be the democratic will of the british people the electoral reform we seek be significant undertaking and must be do in way that strengthen rather than undermine our democratic institution if we truly believe that every vote matter and that politic must reflect the diversity of this country we must be willing to have that serious conversation the political identity and plurality of st austell and newquay deserve recognition in our electoral system no matter their choose industry cultural identity or economic status my constituent should have confidence that their vote be represent and include in our democracy one that acknowledge the full spectrum of view in our community call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank my hon friend the member for hazel grove lisa smart the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel and all member of the all party parliamentary group for fair election for secure this important debate it have be an exciting few month for the cause of fair vote in parliament and be pleased to see member of so many political party advocate proportional representation in today debate at the end of last year be delighted that bill have introduce to this house call for the establishment of proportional representation be vote through to second reading thank every single member who back that bill it be the first time that parliament vote in favour of pr and be determined that we will achieve that goal in this parliament but must also express my disappointment despite the bill receive the house express support on first reading it have not be give parliamentary time to allow it to progress through the legislative process will the hon lady give way people across the country be feed up with first past the post the election be the most disproportionate in history with the government win two third of the seat on one third of the vote the second big majority of seat for any government since the second world war on the low share of the vote ever record for win party think we can all agree that such distorted result be not healthy for our democracy will the hon lady give way it be no surprise that we be see record level of disillusionment with the political process with citizen become increasingly disengage this be reflect in the fact that turnout at the general election be the second low since at just under more than of register voter in the uk think so little of the political process that they do not think it worth express preference for one candidate over another trust in politic will not improve if the public keep get parliaments that do not represent the balance of vote cast this parliament be the one that least represent how the country vote of any in history will the hon lady now give way will not give way why there be no back bench speech from any member of your party and you will have your opportunity in minute very democratic of you your back benchers could have speak in this debate there be many urgent and pressing challenge face the uk today but it be essential that the vast majority of its citizen actively support the mechanism by which decision be make to address they increase level of disengagement threaten our ability to respond both to immediate challenge and to long term issue the liberal democrats believe and have always believe that fair voting system be the essential bedrock of function democracy democracy have prove to be the most effective and endure of govern system because it rely on broad base of support across the population faulty voting system that deliver majority government on minority vote undermine democracy and its ability to deliver effective government in the face of grow worldwide threat to democratic government and institution the uk urgently need to reassert the value of participative democracy as an essential component of peaceful and prosperous society be glad to know that support for electoral reform come not only from liberal democrat members but from across the house be pleased that labour members in particular agree that we need proportional representation after their conference vote overwhelmingly in favour of pr two year ago more importantly recent polling show that majority of the british public be now in favour of scrap first past the post and move to proportional representation welcome the establishment and the work of the all party parliamentary group for fair election which launch last year with the support of more than mp its report free but not fair highlight many of the structural issue that have lead to the decline of public trust in politic and engagement with election thank everybody for their contribution the hon member for vauxhall and camberwell green florence eshalomi be not in her place but she make some important intervention this issue may come under her remit as chair of the housing communities and local government committee so hope she will consider give it more attention particularly thank my hon friend the members for chelmsford marie goldman for tewkesbury cameron thomas for hazel grove for didcot and wantage olly glover and for wokingham clive jones for their excellent contribution be particularly strike when my hon friend the member for wokingham talk about how in the past we discriminate by wealth gender and religion in select who could vote whereas we now discriminate by geography that be one of the key thing we would overcome by replace our voting system the liberal democrats share the pain of the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice in we win seat with of the vote in we win seat with of the vote and in we win seat with of the vote just because by some miracle of first past the post we now have proportion of seat that represent our proportion of vote it do not dilute in any way our support for more proportional voting system be glad we have the support of the hon gentleman and his reform uk colleague we must take urgent action to protect democratic process and institution in the uk from threat both here and abroad we need to listen to the warning bell sound by the general election that the citizen we seek to serve and who must abide by the law we pass be become disenchant with the political process if we want to continue to be beacon of democracy across the world we must ensure that it serve its purpose both in give voice to the people and in deliver prosperity and stability we can not do the latter if we fail at the former first past the post be broken and unfair system last summer the labour party win landslide election victory secure of seat in the house of commons in return for just of the vote this system leave million of voice unheard and create divisive adversarial political climate where collaboration be discourage and accountability be often sidestep the liberal democrats have long champion proportional representation advocate for voting system where every vote truly count we must modernise our electoral system create fair process to engage voter listen to the need of constituent and rebuild trust in politic win vote in parliament for my bill create historic precedent for the first time mp have back proportional voting system in the division lobby it would be an outrage be this bill not give the opportunity to progress far through the house and to become law so urge the minister to schedule an opportunity for the bill to be read second time in government time and to offer labour mps free vote on the bill be grateful to member from all party for their thoughtful and interesting contribution to the debate thank the backbench business committee for allocate time for this important discussion and the hon member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for introduce the debate in the way that he do for we as nation this be an important discussion to have we may not recognise that we should be proud of the peaceful and democratic way that we govern ourselves despite our various often heated disagreement as hon member might have see early in the debate unlike the hon member for richmond park sarah olney be not afraid on that point will the shadow minister give way will give way thank the shadow minister for give way it do at least show that he have some sense and knowledge of what democracy mean thank the hon member for tiverton and minehead rachel gilmour for that wonderful intervention member should know that she and be very good friend unlike the liberal democrat spokesperson be not afraid to stand up for the courage of my conviction and for the argument that will make unlike member of the liberal democrat party be prepared to take intervention and have genuine debate may interrupt this community lovef and ask my hon friend to reflect on the experience of israel where tiny religious party be perpetually in government exercise disproportionate influence and influence policy in way that be at variance with the wish of the majority my right hon friend be correct that there be vast and quite radical system that elect the israeli government where number of extreme politician on both side of the aisle on that point will the shadow minister give way no will not will finish respond to my right hon friend will make another intervention well have not finish make my point yet and intend to do so the electoral system in israel elect people from extreme wing from both side of the aisle who have disproportionate impact on the policy and outcome of the israeli government on that point will the shadow minister give way not at the moment as will make some progress over the past several hundred year our country have undergo myriad complex and contentious reform that have revolutionise our system of governance those change have often be make in piecemeal fashion over many century from simon de montfort parliament of in which representative from town and the shire be summon together to discuss matter of national concern to the great reform act of and permit the expansion of suffrage to the representation of the people equal franchise act which extend the franchise to all person male and female over the age of those evolutionary change have allow we as country to forgo frequent domestic upheaval and civil war which be feature of other less stable system know be in minority of one this afternoon apart from the hon member for ilford south jas athwal but the conservative party have long champion first past the post as the fair and most effective way to elect where be all the conservative representative say to the hon lady who intervene from sedentary position that my colleague in the conservative parliamentary party be out in their constituency campaign and stand up for their constituent not focus on debate about an outdated system that will never last the conservative party have champion first past the post as the fair and most effective way to elect representative ensure clear accountability stable governance and direct link between elect official and their constituent indeed we continue to do that even after our historic and momentous defeat of and the party have continue to support first past the post as evidence by the submission to the jenkins commission in because we believe the way to win election be to gain the trust of the public not to gerrymander the system when thing get tough voter have already show their preference for first past the post as show by the decision make by million people who vote against the proposal set out in the voting system referendum know this be not popular among the party in opposition but believe we should respect the result of referendum on that point will the shadow minister give way let just finish this point some of people vote no in that referendum so the result should be respect for at least generation as the hon member for welwyn hatfield andrew lewin say in his thoughtful contribution in the alternative vote be support by majority of voter in mere of the local counting area the debate raise some pertinent question for other member only seven month after they win resounding and historical vote in landslide victory under the first past the post system labour mp suddenly want to do away with the system that have provide they with their victory and small party want to gerrymander the system because they do not get as many seat as they want perhaps that be because labour members be already struggle at have to work directly for the constituent that put they in their place because they be suffer from the big and most profound instance of buyer remorse since this government take office say gently to the hon member for brighton pavilion siân berry who outline the possibility of two tier system where member can pick and choose what they focus on for their constituent member of this house elect under this system take on every issue for their constituent my constituent in hamble valley have direct link to and will not pick and choose what issue take up member in this house generally do not do that we stand up for our constituent on all the issue that they think be important in this country and in their constituency in debate about our electoral system the liberal democrats have once again show that they be not worthy of have the word democrat in their name they once again outline that they have an opposition to voter id which guarantee safe and fair voting system in this country and stop people from be able to take vote from people who be genuinely entitle to vote in this country and they outline that they now want to gerrymander the system to get more vote themselves gently say to the liberal democrat spokesperson that she say that lack of turnout mean the result of the election be not as valid as they should be she be entitle to that opinion which be perfectly reasonable but her bill on proportional representation pass with the vote of mp in this house out of total electorate of mp by majority of two take her proposition do that mean her bill be less entitled to pass than other bills because of the turnout of mps vote on that outdated proposition under proportional representation direct accountability be often lose in the complexity of coalition and backroom deal advocate of pr stress the need for the party share of the legislature to mirror the share of the popular vote but that be the wrong test it be more important to look at the share of the vote and the share of executive power over time pr lead to highly disproportionate relationship between vote cast and the share of executive power which be unhealthy for democracy first past the post ensure the brutal and efficient removal of government when rule administration lose popular support and they be rightly boot out and replace with new government facilitate often by clear mandate from voter on that point will the shadow minister give way will now that be most generous of he be the hon gentleman aware that almost all other major democratic nation across the world use pr do that not prove that far from be outdate it be contemporary if the hon gentleman be seriously suggest to the house that just because other people do it we should follow suit then he need to go away and think about his policy proposition again this country interruption let finish the point this country have elect more stable government than most european nation have under proportional representation that be proud and long stand convention of this country and of this house of commons suggest to member from across the house that that be why the conservative party believe and this house should believe in keep first past the post as we go forward in other general election rise rise be spoil for choice and do not have much time leave will give way to the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young and then to the hon member for shipley wonder whether the hon gentleman remember how many prime ministers there be between the last election and the one before and whether voter know what they be get at the start of think that be relatively lazy argument about the internal machination of the conservative party and be not concerned with our electoral system give the hon lady the point that it be not good time within my party within this country and that period of office but it concern the way party elect leader and not the electoral system for the public in relation to proportional representation not allow party from different wing to be elect if we look at an example from in european election under the pr system the british national party win two european parliament seat with of the vote in the rare case in which the bnp win local government seat such as in barking and dagenham in its support represent to of the popular vote in the win ward first past the post by contrast act as safeguard against extremism in ensure that only candidate with broad support can win that help preserve the political stability and moderation that be hallmark of our parliamentary democracy when coalition government be form it become difficult for voter to hold any one party accountable for their decision blame for unpopular policy can easily be shift between coalition partner which give how thing be go for they know might be appeal for labour members however that erode trust in politic whereas first past the post provide clarity voter know exactly which party be in charge and can hold it to account at the next election it be also the case that under party list pr system which be previously the european parliament system in great britain there be no direct accountability with representative dependent on party patronage system how many voter actually know the name of their european parliament members when we be in the european union would hazard that there be only one or two well know mep and one of they be still close by think the choice for we be clear although know that be undoubtedly in the minority this afternoon first past the post ensure strong and stable governance clear accountability and an electoral system that be easily understand by the public it prevent small unrepresentative party from wield disproportionate influence and uphold the direct link between mps and their constituent the british people have speak in favour of first past the post and we should respect that decision member in other opposition party should learn and take it from we we know that you can not keep ask the same question over and over and expect different response the first past the post system have serve the uk well for generation it deliver clear outcome stable government and direct link between voter and their representative if we be to move to pr regional base system that link would be lose and mps would be scramble and fight to take on their constituent casework we can just imagine the mafioso style turf war such system would generate to scrap those sensible and time honour demarcation would be terrifically reckless and fundamentally unnecessary and would do our elector disservice we should not trade proven system for one that prioritise theoretical fairness over practical effectiveness the challenge we face as country demand strong leadership clear accountability and system that work for the people even though do not like the result the labour government win that mandate under the system we have first past the post have provide that government and we should stick to that allow the british people to have system they fundamentally understand and fundamentally believe in on point of order madam deputy speaker the hon member for hamble valley paul holmes in his wide range comment talk about the vote that be hold on december relate to the elections proportional representation ten minute rule motion he mention rightly that the aye win by two vote but in fact the number of vote cast be aye and no he mention that only vote be cast and be sure he would like to correct the record that be point of debate and not point of order call the shadow minister far to that point of order madam deputy speaker be perfectly willing to correct the record and apologise to the house however that be still minority of the that would be require under the system that the liberal democrats be advocate order now call the minister start by thank my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley alex sobel for open the debate and by congratulate the backbench business committee and the key member on secure this debate the uk democratic system and institution be strong and be rightly hold the world over as strong example of democracy know as someone who be bear in another country that the uk democratic system have provide inspiration even though as we have hear many hon member believe more work need to be do in some area in defence of our democratic system reiterate how much our system and our democracy be cherish whichever side of the argument member be on it be vital that we work tirelessly to protect our democracy which face different kind of threat in the current climate indeed hope we will all work together in that endeavour to make sure that we protect the integrity of our system our institution and our precious democracy how we select our representative in parliament be of fundamental importance and member quite rightly have strong view the choice of voting system be central to that concern as we have hear in the many speech make today and how vote be cast go to the heart of our democracy for one be incredibly proud to have be the first person of british bangladeshi heritage to get democratic mandate in our system in that democratic mandate must never be delegitimise even if we believe that there should be different system whatever member argument whichever side of the argument they be on whichever system they believe we should adopt or whether they believe we should retain the current system it be absolutely vital that we do not delegitimise the democratic mandate that this government or any other government in the past have be give to serve this country and the people who have vote for we the minister make broader important point about the mandate that individual mp feel when they be elect to this place do she agree that that individual mandate our name be on the ballot paper be strengthen under the first past the post system do she also agree that that mean that our electorate can single out mp which could not happen under party list system in order to remove they the right hon gentleman make an important point about the importance of the constituency connection hon member have make important contribution about alternative system outline their merit and limitation each of those system have its pro and con and that have be strongly and powerfully debate by many hon member today respect those strongly hold view on electoral reform know that colleague will be disappoint and be sorry to be the bearer of bad news when there have be general love in during the debate across the party bar some exception but at this time the government have no plan to change the voting system for election to the house of commons hon member hear hear be get unlikely cheer be not use to be cheer by conservative members as have be point out the first past the post system while not perfect provide for direct relationship between member of parliament and their local constituency change would require national conversation and referendum the government focus and no priority have win the general election and secure mandate be to kick start our economy create the growth that be desperately need and improve living standard our nhs and public service to serve the people of our country member have put their argument across eloquently and respect those argument as other have point out we have an opportunity to change the voting system in the referendum unfortunately for those who be proponent of such change that referendum be lose the process that underpin our election be of paramount importance and change can not be make lightly however stress that we be not averse to change to and innovation in our democracy we must continue to monitor all aspect of our electoral system and ensure that it run effectively and adapt to the modern challenge that we face as democracy as we set out in our manifesto we be seek to make change include our commitment to extend the franchise to and year old we be continue to assess the voter identification policy in order to address any inconsistency be pleased that we be able to add veteran card to the list of accept document last year our veteran community will be able to use they to vote in polling station this may we be continue to consider whether further improvement to policy can be make be conscious of the contribution of some hon member about the exclusion of legitimate voter it be crucial that we ensure that people be not disenfranchised while ensure that there be not abuse of our system as mention the liberal democrat party in coalition with the conservative party secure referendum on av in with considerable cross party support from labour members the proposal be reject by of vote while recognise the strength of feeling have make the government position clear hon member ask whether the government have any plan for national commission on electoral reform at present we do we do not laughter that be not freudian slip some hon member ask about the london mayoral election and police and crime commissioner follow the change in the elections act the government currently have no plan to change the voting system for those poll like number of policy we will keep these matter under review number of hon member suggest that the first past the post system be contribute to decrease in turnout and point to the low turnout at the last election it be on all of we to think carefully about the driver of low turnout which will be range of factor we all have responsibility as elect representative to work with our party and community to promote engagement particularly among young people we will work with colleague to promote that democratic engagement and ensure that young citizen be active citizen from an early age in order to allow my hon friend the member for leeds central and headingley enough time to wind up the debate will address just one other point my hon friend the member for kensington and bayswater joe powell speak about foreign interference in relation to funding foreign money have no place in uk politic and it be vital that we protect our democracy from those who seek to interfere in uk election through illegitimate political donation that be why we commit in our manifesto to strengthen the rule around donation to political party we will work with member across the house to ensure that we protect the integrity of our democracy invite the minister to join the appg for fair election she will see that there be very clear correspondence between first past the post and the lack of engagement over time thank the hon member for his invitation and welcome he to send we information he know that can not be member of the all party group but recognise and commend its work have be member of and chair many all party group during my year in opposition recognise the importance of their work thank hon member across the house for their important contribution to the debate express strongly and deeply hold view about really important subject the future and nature of our democracy whichever side of the argument we be on it be vital that we always maintain our commitment to work together to protect our democracy and that we work tirelessly to strengthen our democracy will be brief because we have have long and thorough debate thank everyone who take part in it particularly my hon friend the member for ilford south jas athwal who cut lonely figure in oppose change to the voting system thank he for his bravery in the face of such opposition it be shame that we could not have have more member speak against change the voting system as so many speak in favour thank the minister for commit to work with the all party parliamentary group for fair election which chair and will follow up on that let make just one substantive point because feel that there may be lack of understanding about something be well aware that we have referendum on the alternative vote system in the alternative vote system which be use to elect the australian parliament be preferential system not proportional system so we have have referendum on preferential representation but we have never have referendum on proportional representation do not see why we need to wait generation as have be suggest certainly do not think that we need to have another referendum on preferential system but we need to consider as lay out in the debate commission to look at the failure in our electoral system and whether we should move to more proportional system question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider proportional representation for general election local post offices beg to move that this house have consider the future of local post office service be grateful to everyone for attend this debate on thursday afternoon on post office and their vital role in all our community across the country post office have long be at the heart of our community they provide essential service support local business and serve as vital socioeconomic lifeline but in too many area across the country include my constituency we face uncertainty over the future of those post office and be already see the erosion of far too many post office contribute an estimate billion annually to the uk economy accord to the post office their presence generate an additional billion in spending for the business that surround they in town like wellington in my constituency post office could add around million to the local economy small business across the country rely on post office for banking cash deposit and parcel service nearly third of small and medium sized business use the post office at least once week of course the benefit of post office be not just economic they remain lifeline for many particularly old and more vulnerable people who rely on post office service to access their pension send mail and parcel pay bill and stay connected hear from many of my constituent how much they value our local post office and that those post office provide far more than just postal service congratulate the hon member on bring this important debate my constituent be serve by crown post office in brixton and on lordship lane in east dulwich both those town centre have effectively see the withdrawal of high street bank would he agree that the erosion of high street banking service place an even great emphasis on the role of post office and that the government need to intervene to stop the further round of crown post office closure if we be to see the banking hub commitment meet across the country the hon member be absolutely right and will emphasise that point later because the destiny of banking hub be wrap up with that of post office post office be the nucleus of town centre and once they be go it undermine the town centre follow on from the intervention of the hon member for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes represent tiverton and minehead very rural constituency dulverton be classic example of what we be talk about the farmer use to come down from cutcombe market after they have sell their cattle and sheep and deposit their money in bank or post office in dulverton we just about have post office there but no bank do my hon friend agree that post office and bank be two side of the same coin agree with my hon friend will comment on that aspect of banking later pay tribute to the friendly and hard work staff in my local post office on station road and in staplegrove and in other post office throughout the constituency the north curry post office with its amazing postmistress contribute every year to the christmas in the square event for the village charity and have raise these be real community institution their be in our village and community where they offer warm friendly welcome and act as community hub be important to many people and must not be undervalue the hon member make an excellent point and think the nub of his speech be that post office be not just banking facility or just post office they be real community hub think about the one in my constituency that have visit recently in ramsden bellhouse on whitmore way in basildon or the brand new one on billericay high street that be exactly what they be place where the entire community come together the right hon member be quite right know billericay and its post office and certainly support his remark post office be simply too important to be lose and we have to ensure that they be not lose in town like wellington and taunton and elsewhere across the country too often there be deep concern about the future of local post office today announcement about change to the royal mail universal service obligation add to that uncertainty create further pressure on an already fragile network it be disappointing to see that obligation weaken with potential knock on effect on the viability of post office that make it even more important that post office continue to play role all throughout the week in sell stamp and provide postal service even if delivery be be cut back thank the hon gentleman for take my intervention and for the point that he be make in response to question ask the government say that more than one in post office service be not provide in what people would recognise as post office some service be provide out the back of van for few hour week but they be still hold up as complete post office service in the figure on post office and how many people access they do he agree that we must provide complete post office service in all the community that need they agree with the right hon gentleman there be risk that the statistic be somewhat skewed by the fact that parcel drop off point or van that visit occasionally may be consider post office thank the hon gentleman for his generosity in give way to number of member during his important speech on the proposal to replace crown post office do he agree that franchised post office be no substitute in fact that be huge risk whsmith which often take on the franchise announce this week that it be close of its high street branch the move to franchise could be one step away from the complete loss of post office facility indeed think the hon member have read the next sentence of my speech which be about the post office branch house in whsmith on fore street in taunton that business be potentially up for sale which pose risk the loss of such post office would leave huge gap across the country particularly in county town like taunton in the course of his work will the minister get concrete assurance from whsmith that post office in its store will be retain follow the sale it be important that the government get assurance from whsmith on that point thank my hon friend for secure this important debate the distinction between crown post office and franchise post office can not be draw heavily enough in my constituency we lose crown post office in newton abbot and in dawlish and the one in teignmouth which believe be the last in my constituency all the rest be franchise be now under threat do he agree that the franchise system can provide useful service but be absolutely no substitute for the full crown post office service which must remain agree be sure that the government will say in due course that whatever its exact business model viable post office be what matter and there would be some truth in that but secure post office establish for the long term be what really matter the worry we hear from across the house and the country be not without foundation we have see worry closure across the country notably as have be mention there be recent consultation on the closure of post office the loss of branch mean that few community can access vital service house of commons datum show that the number of post office be rise overall but in the south west which have lose more post office than any other region in england it be fall wellington in my constituency lose its post office in and we can see the damage cause by that loss wellington be not small town it have resident and be grow fast its population have grow by third over the past two decade accord to census datum and around new home have be build there in recent year it also have proud history as the home of fox brothers co which have be manufacture the fine flannel and fabric for over year and also own its own bank the fox bank on fore street be the last bank in the country to issue its own banknote it be unacceptable for such town to have no main post office lose the post office in have be real blow one constituent tell that he find it totally baffle why wellington post office be ever close it be particularly difficult for those without access to car to visit the near alternative at rockwell green village several mile away if they do resident often find that the sub post office be oversubscribed with queue out the door as small village post office it be only intend to provide for small number and when it be open parking have become bit of nightmare be very pleased to support the hon gentleman application to the backbench business committee for this debate do he agree that crown post office be one of the last bastion of the civil service in local community as they be not centralised they provide good job in place like wellington in his constituency and they give support to community that often have an old population they have an expertise that franchise simply can not provide the hon lady make very good point and be extremely grateful to she for help we to secure this debate post office act as hub for whole range of service and they could arrange for range of other public service and often do which be why secure proper post office be so important as say the near post office to wellington be some mile away and very difficult to access as hon member can imagine there be great relief when wellington resident be tell that they would be get new hub open by an organisation call the post office staff by staff work for the post office and that there be to be logo outside the building with post office write on it but they be disappoint to find when they go inside the building that it be banking hub that do not provide any post office service frankly people feel mislead and let down will the minister instruct the post office to review the case for grant wellington post office the status of main post office be convince from discussion with franchise holder that that would be enough to secure one for wellington as we can all see in this case there be an obvious and straightforward solution we should allow banking hub to offer postal service there be no fundamental reason why they can not they already have post office till and post office system they be run by postmaster and postmistress and staff by post office staff the one in wellington even have two banking desk and space for third desk presumably await post office counter that would be very good use of the remain space in building with post office write above the door perhaps most importantly have speak to post office staff know that they would be very keen to offer such service in banking hub the issue lie simply in such arrangement not have be include in the agreement on banking hub between the bank which fund they and the post office which provide those service it be not hugely complex problem with bit of effort and ingenuity which be sure the minister and the government have this could be overcome and the system could be make hugely more efficient there be banking hub in the uk and in this way we could significantly increase the provision of post office at very little cost will the minister ask his department to develop incentive for banking hub to offer postal service especially give that they all have the post office logo outside the door even when they do not provide any postal service to conclude post office be vital hub in community throughout the country particularly for those in need and at risk of exclusion the loss of the post office in wellington such significant market town have really hit the town centre badly know hon member will have their own example of the importance of their local post office to their community look forward to hear their speech and maybe to intervene on they it be vital to ensure that substantive town and community such as wellington do not lose their post office altogether in short post office be too important to be leave to uncertainty the government must act now to safeguard these vital institution ensure that town such as wellington and so many more do not remain without essential service urge the minister to take tangible step to secure the future of post office before more community be leave without they rise order be impose an immediate six minute time limit so that everyone can get in commend the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos on secure this important debate think that most member and most people be pro post office after all post office be part of the fabric of our nation many member of my age be bring up on postman pat and his black and white cat it would not have be the same without mrs goggins at the local post office the leighton buzzard post office first open its door at its current location near all saints church back in we all recognise that lot have change in the last year and since postman pat hit our screen in the use to queue at the post office to get my car tax email have transform how we communicate tv licence sale have move online or to phone or direct debit what have not change be the way that post office foster sense of community pride half of uk consumer say that their local post office create sense of belong and community identity an association of convenience stores survey rank the post office third for have positive impact on local community post office also drive footfall to our high street because when someone go to the post office in the town centre they often spend money elsewhere more and more post office support commerce and they be important to small business half of which use they at least once month increasingly they be vital mean of access cash since my constituency have lose of its bank branch in recent month two more high street bank lloyds and halifax have leave leighton buzzard town centre in september when halifax announce its closure it be explicit that it expect the post office down the road to take up the slack whether that will be possible be question will turn to shortly be proud to stand on labour manifesto that commit we to strengthen the post office network welcome the government million investment to support post office branch along with the million boost to sub postmaster pay and the plan to publish green paper seek public view on the future of the post office this all come at critical time the plus year old leighton buzzard post office be crown post office the desire of the post office to move to fully franchise model be not new it have be on the card for some time but it be cause understandable concern for local people who deeply value the service that their post office provide for all of the reason have outline welcome the expression of interest in take on those crown branch although not all of those application will be viable it be encourage that third party operator be willing to step in potentially integrate retail element to make these branch more financially sustainable however as my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst mention the recent announcement by whsmith which host around post office counter have raise concern about whether third party takeover truly be long term solution would be grateful for the minister view on that would also be keen for he to explore with the post office whether there be merit in treat crown branch where it own the freehold of the building differently from those where it lease the premise let turn briefly to the related issue of postbox some new development simply do not have they that mean that someone who live in bidwell west would have to go on half hour hike to post letter the law state that resident should be within metre of post box but that be simply not happen perhaps the minister might raise that with the secretary of state for housing communities and local government to ensure that housing development include post box as standard after all letter be vital for thriving postal service the post office be national institution it bring essential service to countless community whether send parcel withdraw cash or top up an electricity meter it support local business high street and local identity yes it must change but it must not wither local people must enjoy first class service in september plymstock post office close it be part of the collateral damage of the closure by morrison of more than newsagent it be legitimate business decision no doubt but it highlight the issue of the post office franchise model those business just disappear from the high street what follow be public petition which start there be huge public disappointment as old population be use to use cash the postmistress of the next near post office want to retire which leave just one bank with one cash machine the next near cash machine be or minute walk away importantly this be the loss of an anchor at shopping centre that be vital for the local community work closely with the post office and local business we seek to secure new post office but it be challenge to make the franchise business model work that will be even hard now with the employer increase national insurance contribution that business face raise this matter with the minster today and he give helpful answer he mention the increase in the sub postmaster pay offer but there remain the issue that we be not replace close post office on like for like basis plymstock have three counter model which the post office have offer to replace with local franchise it be offer just to year to run that service within an exist or propose business we have to add on to that rent business rate staff and set up and run cost because at the moment there be no business on the broadway where the post office be locate able to take on that service there be also challenge with the franchise model in that it be often not possible to tag on additional service at the beginning that would make the business more profitable for example passport processing be not always offer at the start and those extra service can often be the difference between business model that will work and one that be unsustainable ironically on may the day the general election be call meet again with the post office some three year later to discuss the issue the post office raise with the statistic on what be need it think that the use of post office in the area would increase over time but it would not take into account the fact that neighbouring postmistress be seek to retire therefore the datum show that the area do not need anything more than post office local all it take be tiny bit of horizon scan to realise that there would be that need and that demand shortly we get stick in situation the post office reassure that it have further people interested in run the post office but nearly one year later nothing have come to fruition the fight continue as have be mention by other hon member there be the option of banking hub the work of the conservative government to trailblaze this modern solution for community have help remarkably and be sure that we will hear lot about that this afternoon to reinforce the point that the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos make there be real concern that community that be look to have banking hub do not have function post office in the way that we would understand it do my hon friend agree with that the arrival of banking hub be actually the opportunity to put post office back into those community as well absolutely agree with my right hon friend think that all of we in this chamber will agree that have post office within these banking hub be vital we have see hub open across the country in the last few year clearly there be an appetite and need for they but it do not make sense to the public as have be allude to that they can pitch up to these place with post office sign outside but they can not even buy stamp inside do hope that that can be rectify the other challenge be that an area can not have banking hub while bank be still present perhaps that be the silver lining to yesterday announcement that the lloyds bank in the same location on plymstock broadway be close in november that will be massive hit as it have the only cash machine for the entire community however as have be say to my constituent perhaps the silver lining be that we will see more banking available and if the government hee our call today that future post office as well perhaps we have to circumvent the system to get what we want it would mean that we can now explore banking hub and retain those banking service clearly there be long way to go be sure that there be member in the chamber today who have secure banking hub be tell that it take big fight but most of we be here because we be campaigner within an hour of the announcement of the closure of the lloyds bank we go out to the press and we will do all we can to get banking hub however want to be able to reassure my constituent that this will solve the lack of post office as well so do hope that we can see that policy change there be long way to go we have to secure venue an operator and that policy change to see our post office service return since share the idea yesterday there have be huge local interest people be really get the idea of banking hub they be on board it be what the community want have have two conversation already with potential operator one of whom know run service in neighbouring constituency and be do really good job there so we have the interest we have businessman and woman who want to do this they have not be able to deliver it on the franchise model but it seem that they can deliver it on the banking hub model we want to see this idea deliver because even the shopping centre know that in order to get the footfall for all the other local business have bank and post office for access to cash be vital even the local library need that cash access and if it be not available there be go to be problem local people need these vital service and amenity and that be why we need to secure banking hub say to my constituent particularly those in plymstock that they have my absolute commitment to fight for this would add that we have some fabulous small community post office in our village it be not all bad news story the newton ferrers shop for example have fabulous post office counter and attempt be make right across our constituency to deliver these service for our constituent however where there be problem like the one we be face today with close bank and close main branch we do need to step up and take action to close will ask few question of the minister have highlight the reality of the current post office offer and as say it be not all bad he have kindly say that can share some detail about my constituency with he which will do but think it would be good to get the answer on the record in the chamber do the minister accept that downgrade service from main branch to franchised local service hinder the replacement of post office service will he explore the fact that the current post office dataset do not allow for what will happen in the future if retirement be come down the road we should be able to business plan around that and at the moment we can not can the minister reassure the house that he remain committed to deliver banking hub and say whether will they will incorporate postal facility so that we can deliver for our constituent be grateful to the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure today debate this be an important issue for constituency across the uk as have be highlight by contribution from all part of the house but it be particular concern to constituency like south east cornwall which face the potential closure of our liskeard post office if that be to go ahead it would not just be the loss of shop it would be the loss of vital service at the heart of our community as the daughter of postman know just what hard and important job it be that they do for many people in rural area like mine the post office be more than place to send letter with the loss of high street bank leave only one provider the post office have become financial lifeline ensure that resident especially old resident or those without online banking and small business can access cash and essential service without have to travel for mile without clear alternative in place that represent real challenge for many in rural area like mine reach the next near branch be simply not practical if these closure continue we must ensure that further banking hub be establish so that rural community be not leave behind drive growth be key aim of this government and welcome the million investment in cornwall outline in the chancellor statement yesterday long term growth can not happen without the basic service that underpin our local economy and labour be elect across the uk in rural coastal and urban area alike because people want practical solution after year of decline they want to ensure that community be not cut off from essential service and look forward to work with our government to achieve that my goal be to make the life of local resident in south east cornwall easy and more prosperous that mean protect local service ensure accountability and deliver real opportunity for growth in town like liskeard urge the government to ensure that rural community be not leave strand and to guarantee access to essential banking and post office service as be sure they will congratulate my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos on take the initiative to secure time for this debate and on the way in which he open it we be all familiar with the old maxim if it ai break do fix it have lose count of the number of post office debate have take part in over the year and it seem to that as far as post office be concern the maxim that have govern the thinking of government of all colour be if it ai break keep reform it until it be the fundamental problem be that there have be an incoherence of approach within departments on the one hand we have hear suspect we may hear similar thing from the minister today minister stand at the dispatch box say that the post office be brilliant institution and it can be the front office or front desk for government service in community across the country the next day we will have another minister stand at the dispatch box tell we that access to government service will become digital by default unless we decide exactly what role we expect our post office to perform in our community we can not be surprised when they fail to thrive and then wither in the way that they be do it be more than year now since the department for work and pensions think it could save money by drive people away from get pension and other benefit from their local post office doubtless that be saving for the department for work and pensions but it have just mean that the department for business and trade or whatever we call it these day have have to put more money in through government subsidy hesitate to predict the future in politic at all these day but one day when we have finally turn the key to lock the last post office in the country some bright spark in downing street somewhere will come up with policy paper say that we should have hub in every community where people can access government service and meet their postal need their banking need and all the rest of it and in that way we will end up reinvent what we have reform to the point of destruction the post office and how it interact with the sub postmaster have not always help in that respect include the innovation that it have bring such as the pick up and drop off initiative in my constituency it be not the sub post office that be give the contract to do the pick up and drop off point if the post office at the heart be not able to support sub postmaster at the frontline we frankly can not be surprised if they start to fail in particular want to talk about the post office approach to the closure of crown branch we see that in my constituency where the last crown post office in kirkwall be list for closure the way that have be do by the post office have be nothing short of disgrace it have be totally lack in respect for its employee and the community that the post office be there to serve at time when we might have hop that the post office would want to demonstrate change of culture for reason we have debate often enough we see it still behave in this way in my community it make think that all the fine word about change culture at the top of the post office be simply meaningless weasel word have see similar situation before we lose the crown post office in lerwick in shetland few year ago it be take out and fold into local newsagent service for all the promise give about maintain service in fact the community be leave with much inferior service at the end of the day despite the good effort of the newsagent who get the contract if we be to see these change in kirkwall we need to know first of all that the same range of service will still be available as there be from crown post office that include vehicle licensing currency exchange and passport checking all those thing should still be available just as important as the range of service be the question of the physical infrastructure people want stand alone post office to offer level of service of the sort they get with crown post office especially when we be encourage banking into they that be highly personal service for many people they do not want to be do that next to somebody buy tin of bean and their weekly paper the size and availability of any post office that be to replace the one that the post office want to close in kirkwall be critical we do not want people queue around the block at christmas when the post office be at its busy stand in the rain sleet and snow to get their postage do the size the range of service and the quality of service have to be at the heart of anything that come from the post office by way of revision that be the basis on which we in my community will be judge any proposal that it come forward with be pleased to support the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos in secure the debate it be not the first time help he as in funny quirk of fate house sit for he more than year ago think it be year ago but he be welcome to correct the record if have get the date wrong thank my london bridge post office manager priya and her dedicated team include clive and the communication workers union member whom be proud to serve they in turn support and serve the london bridge and borough high street community in extremely busy circumstance with massive footfall that be why there be so much concern about the branch as demonstrate by the petition to save the london bridge post office start by london bridge and west bermondsey councillor emily hickson sam dalton and sunil chopra hundred of people have already sign that petition which be on should anyone want to add their signature go to the branch two week ago to meet the team and see for myself how busy and love it be my constituent mary lovely old lady be there pay her rent at the time but it be not just old lady use post office this post office demonstrate how diverse range of post office be affect across the country as this branch be hugely busy and serve massive and vibrant business community at borough market and around london bridge of course it also have london fourth busy train station right on its doorstep provide commuter customer on borough high street visit specifically because of the question mark over the branch status thank the post office for answer some of my question and for join on that visit but it be disappointing that the branch be in that position not least because we have new ministerial team government ministers have state that there will be million of additional funding and there remain commitment from the government to ensure that every community have access to post office branch which be incredibly welcome be proud to have stand and win last year on manifesto that say labour would look for way to strengthen the network in consultation with sub postmaster trade union and customer be glad that the government formally recognise that the uk wide post office branch network be an essential part of the uk economic infrastructure support high street and business that be incredibly refreshing after year of mismanagement and mixed message from mixed ministers from two different party since it be really useful to see the minister in his place we may disagree on one issue during the six nation but he have be massive champion of post office and have say on the record that the post office should do more when it come to provide banking service he have be doughty champion for the co operative party and champion of post office have broad banking and financial footfall whether that be through credit union or banking hope to hear more from he on those issue like postie he now have to deliver in office as minister hon member oh thank you hope that we will hear when the green paper will be publish think the aim be by the end of july hope that it will cover link and the access to cash campaign which be already part of that discussion and that there will be space to talk about the future of business rate for post office and whether there could be community interest exemption want to flag up couple of concern about how the london bridge branch have be handle by the post office it have an incredibly small team of less than full time equivalent and they be incredibly busy but they have meet every target set by the post office include currency transfer increase last year of more than be talk about million of pound there the team have take on additional service where possible but those service they have lose have be the responsibility of the post office nationally and not the local branch sadly they feel blame for national post office failure rent be also not the local branch responsibility it do not determine the rent that it pay for its prime borough high street location it be disappointing that the post office do not seek rent reduction in see how during the covid crisis rent for commercial and residential premise fall for the first time in the year have live in the borough however the post office fail to negotiate or seek reduction that be not the responsibility of the individual staff who feel they be now be hold culpable for failure that sit elsewhere it be hard to imagine an equivalent site locally that would be cheap if the branch move away from its high street location it would lose business and commuter footfall which could reduce turnover those make decision need to be mindful of that as be mention by the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael there be lack of respect show to customer and the workforce in the handling of this specifically on this site the post office website say that an alternative provider be available on blackfriars road well the post office shut that post office two year ago this month it be suppose to reopen the post office say it have bidder for it last summer but since my visit two week ago the post office have now state that it will not reopen the blackfriars road site at all which be massive disappointment for many in and the local area the failure to communicate that again not local responsibility show lack of respect the post office be suppose to follow principle of community engagement in how it handle these issue but that have not be the case in blackfriars it must not happen again for people worried about that specific site want to flag up that there be lot of interest in run it with an alternative provider however that must not come at loss of service or loss of right for the workforce that the state pick up down the line and all cost must be take into account when more be know we think that will be in april will organise public meeting with local representative of the post office the cwu and other which will advertise as soon as can for everyone worry about this great community asset congratulate the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos on secure this backbench business debate also thank nik frost and emily pidgeon from my office for do the research for this and other speech that have make in recent day we all know that post office be critically important asset to our community know that your own post office in romsey be under threat as main hub madam deputy speaker know you do not have the ability to voice that so shall do so on your behalf be lucky enough to represent seven post office in south west hertfordshire in my first term as member of parliament chorleywood port office be close have shut in not for reason decide by headquarter there be local issue and it take several year before that post office be bring back online thank the retailer lord for incorporate the post office into its retail area to ensure that my community could continue to access the excellent service offer by the post office during the global pandemic we see how critical community asset and community spirit be to the health and wellbeing of our resident they be the unsung hero of our community most post office staff will see their regular on frequent basis and will quickly identify it if they have not be see or do not look well while not professional like pharmacist optician or gps they be set of eye and ear on how their customer be do through various announcement recently and over the past few year we have see the demise of high street bank be former furniture retailer and it still make sad that our high street be not what they once be post office be one of the few beacon leave on high street up and down our country while there be an absolute draw to online retail and be free marketeer know that if we do not continue to support our post office we will live to regret it we must protect the asset that we really care about and include the post office in that know that my community care about this as well when croxley green post office be under threat get lot of correspondence ask to be proactive fortunately the post office decide to stop its plan to review that particular post office but that be just the tip of the iceberg know from colleague that their inboxe be fill up with concern from constituent about what they value it be the silent majority who will be adversely affect if we do not speak up and support our post office fully support the move towards banking hub it make sense to ensure that community be draw to critical asset such as our post office it be my understanding that the agreement for the post office to provide banking hub end at the end of this year urge the minister to reassure the house that if that be the case he will look into it and ensure that the post office quickly get into negotiation with retail bank to ensure they be viable with more and more people have less access to cash the post office remain one of the few community hub in area where our constituent can always go and get cash out it be not all easy for the post office do not want to get party political but post office will now have million additional bill because of the national insurance job tax and there have be significant increase in business rate within the estate while the drive for technology be important the government in my view need to look at how they can support place like our post office to ensure that they remain commercially viable can assure the minister that he will have my support if he be able to do so be very grateful to the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure this timely debate be glad to have the opportunity to support he in do so hon member have describe very powerfully the closure that be happen in their constituency in my constituency the last remain post office on the historic king road be threaten it be long time since the king road heyday of the swing when please mr postman be first hit unfortunately since then the number of post office branch on what be very long road have dwindle and there be now only one leave shockingly it be one of directly manage branch across the country that the post office be plan to shut of which be in greater london the post office say that it be do that to save money hope it be not do it to pay for the cost of resolve the horizon scandal we will perhaps find out over time meanwhile we have king road post office that offer buzzing full service to lot of customer there be regular queue every time go in there have to wait minute to be serve and people love the staff they tell how worried they be at the possibility of it close and how incredulous they be that it could even be consider they depend on it there simply be no other option nearby all sort of people go there as my hon friend the member for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle mention it be particularly old and disabled people who rely on post office service for bill payment and access to cash and they be the most worried around the corner from the post office there be number of sheltered accommodation and retirement housing block the people who live there will be disproportionately affect on hear what be plan immediately launch petition and be not surprised to get signature in very short space of time many other people have get in touch with to express their disappointment dismay and concern meet post office management in early december and leave they in no doubt about the anger and shock in the community they say that the king road post office be lose money they also say that they might consider franchise it to retail partner or an independent postmaster but that no decision have yet be take naturally ask to see full detailed analysis of the figure they very kindly respond that they would let have that in the new year which we be now in will be see they again next week and press they to provide that analysis expect to see not just the financial reason for any decision to close the post office on the king road but detailed impact assessment on how the change would affect the community and what step would be take to mitigate it the number of customer matter of course but so do the type of customer that the post office serve have touch on this but we can not just brush aside the need of old and disabled people people who do not feel comfortable banking online people who prefer to use cash we can not let some people feel that they be see as less important because they be not less important we can not let they feel they be leave behind they must not be leave behind we need to find solution that serve the need of everyone that be why it be so important to that the post office consult genuinely and authentically with the local community about the change will be seek clarity on that as well finally will try in the meeting to get clarification on the post office think on keep the king road post office open by franchise it have hear the concern that hon member have express about franchising but if it prove to be the only option we be long way off that intend to pitch in and do all can to make it success for my constituent when we lose major post office on north end road in the fulham part of my constituency work very closely with the local council to support new franchisee be delighted to open new post office on north end road last year it be franchise yes but it provide seven day week service from in the morning to in the evening it provide full range of service even newspaper delivery which do not happen very much be there just last week it be thrive and very popular people feel well serve that be good news for the people of fulham but can not help wonder why the post office management have to go down the franchising route why be directly manage branch so much more expensive to run than locally franchise branch perhaps the minister can shed some light on that will be ask the post office be delighted by the work that the government be do and their determination to revitalise our high street welcome the money that have go into the post office and welcome the propose increase in postmaster pay look forward to see later this year the green paper set out option for the future of the post office but it would be helpful at this stage to have clarity about the government long term aim be one of they to maintain thriving network of post office do hope so will banking service feature in the green paper some interesting idea have be raise here today can reassure my resident in chelsea that will continue to work with they with the post office and with the government to fight the closure of the king road branch and to ensure that no one be leave behind join other in thank my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure the debate and be grateful to the backbench business committee for timetable it as many member have point out post office form vital part of our local community and high street million of people depend on they but in my oxfordshire constituency which contain many village they be under threat these post office be community hub which play host to number of service that be essential to local people and small business particularly in rural area they provide vital human contact and offer information and support for people who might otherwise be isolate especially give suboptimal rural transport link just this week karen forman postmistress in blewbury tell that she have not only be contact about many postal matter but this be relevant to what be say by the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer have be contact about lost cat and lost bunch of key and have help someone to locate bank card as other member have note many post office be face rise operating cost and the service that they offer do not generate much revenue an estimate per transaction which make it hard to keep the light on we could do great deal more to support our community branch as we hear from the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael post office can provide vital local service but only if they be properly support and invest in and be staff appropriately could we for example make more use of post office hub could they help people who be digitally exclude to book medical appointment on the internet or provide service such as printing of course we also need to secure justice for the wrong postmaster and the flawed horizon system be still be use as well as give more support to the people who have be neglect as result of that scandal the post office network and the hard work postmaster and postmistress be in dire need of our support in village such as blewbury and many more in my constituency and those of other member thank the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure this very timely debate on the future of post office sadly few of we have come here today with positive experience instead alongside our constituent we be concerned about the decline presence of post office in our community in recent time the post office have be in the news for all the wrong reason with no bad example than the horizon it scandal shameful unforgivable wrong do to postmaster which undermine public faith in the service however public faith in the post office have be betray in other way too the recent speculation on the future of directly manage branch have cause genuine panic and concern to my constituent appreciate effort by the post office to reassure people that no formal decision have yet be make but fully understand why so many of my constituent believe that closure or service reduction be inevitable so many post office have already shut their door across the uk as the directly manage branch model have be replace and that shift towards franchising have leave many community fear that the post office be no long permanent fixture in their high street or shopping centre that be because what be once simple public service have increasingly have its future decide by profitability rather than the need and demand of the community and yet for my constituent the post office be more than just place to send parcel and letter it represent trusted and value institution that be why the post office have be around for nearly year when post office official email to say that directly manage branch be flawed because they have no retail offering it feel as though there be disconnect between those who use the service and those who manage it the no duty of the post office should be to provide public service whether retail offering be available in addition should be secondary consideration not something motivate the closure or outsourcing of these branch give the news that wh smith which manage around post office be look to sell all its high street store the franchising model ought to be review as matter of urgency be already concerned about the future of our post office but this news only compound my fear as with the directly manage branch my thought be with those employ in the wh smith branch who will be feel anxious about what this news mean for they post office official have confirm that they be in talk with relevant trade union regard the ongoing consultation but sincerely hope that those be genuine discussion and that the concern of the workforce be listen to carefully in an area such as springburn which already have high unemployment rate it would be unacceptable for local job to be lose the springburn crown post office be the last directly manage branch in my constituency it occupy space in springburn shopping centre which be well connected and well use by people across the north east of glasgow recently meet the community group spirit of springburn to discuss the future of the crown post office the community be rightly worried about what closure would mean and raise with their concern about the detrimental impact it would have on not just springburn but the wide north east of glasgow they remind that not long ago the springburn area have four bank branch all those branch have now close familiar story in constituency across the uk as the last government preside over bank branch closure those closure cause massive damage to our high street and shopping centre and make banking much more difficult for too many when those closure occur the post office be always designate as the place for people to continue to access their bank in fact when lloyds bank announce yesterday plan to close its own high street store it say that people should go to the post office to continue use banking service but how can people do that if there be no local post office leave the reality be that springburn crown post office really be the last bank in town and now even that be at risk it be profoundly unfair for my constituent to find themselves in this worrying situation and they deserve urgent reassurance that springburn post office will not close that be the appeal be make to the government today and it be also the case be make by the local community indeed the vice chair of spirit of springburn emma porter have write to the secretary of state for business and trade to do just that order the hon lady will recognise that she be on time limit and in order to accommodate all the other member who wish to speak be go to reduce it to five minute call matt vickers thank the member who bring this important debate forward for generation the local post office have be the beat heart of our town and village that be certainly the case in stockton and thornaby it have be more than just place to send and receive mail it have be cornerstone of community life and trust space where people access essential service stay connected with love one and support their business yet today we stand at crossroad the pressure of modern technology financial constraint and shift consumer habit have place our post office under real threat and all those challenge have be make so much bad by the government national insurance tax raid and the slashing of business rate relief there be threat to the future of the post office in stockton and thornaby in stockton our post office have change location over the decade but have be ever present and ever value it be hop that franchise in retailer could protect its future but the impact of the national insurance tax raid and the slashing of business rate relief be force retailer across the country to close store and axe job in stockton and yarm the impact be compound by the labour council introduction of short stay parking charge retail be one of the most important sector in the country it be the large private sector employer in our economy and often sit at the very heart of our community and it be the big social mobility driver around in the last few week however we have see fantastic retail giant include sainsbury and tesco ax job and kill opportunity in stockton we have hear the sad news of whsmith closure the store have host the post office but it look set to close its door as result of the government war on high street have meet representative of the post office to share my concern about the impact that the closure will have on so many of my resident particularly the elderly the current post office be not due to close until may and it have commit to work with to look at alternative franchisee and location in the town be delighted that number of potential operator have already show an interest in thornaby the situation remain concern but unclear the local postmaster have lease but the community be recently shake when planning application go forward for pizza hut to take the post office place the community speak and put forward their objection and the application be reject there be fear of an appeal have engage with the post office and the town centre as recently as this morning and hope remain that we can find way forward the post office in stockton and thornaby be essential their closure would not simply mean the loss of building it would mean the loss of convenience social interaction footfall in the town centre and economic stability for many give the recent announcement that natwest be close its stockton branch our post office be absolutely vital to our local town be determined and hopeful and will do everything can to keep our post office door open in stockton and thornaby thank the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure this debate which as be show by the number of hon member wish to participate be incredibly timely not least because later today coincidentally will present petition to the house about the potential closure of chester le street post office in my constituency of north durham chester le street be one of the crown post office at risk of closure follow post office ltd announcement that it be review the future of its directly manage branch this be worry not only for those who be employ in those branch but for the many people who use post office service and for the high street in chester le street we would say the front that rely on the footfall and pass trade that post office bring the post office in chester le street have be at the heart of the community in north durham since indeed it be one of only tiny number of post office that bear the cypher of king edward viii chester le street have lose most of its high street banking branch in recent year so it be more important than ever that this vital hub and delivery office remain open and accessible for my constituent over people have sign the petition that will present later which call on the post office to ensure that the chester le street branch remain open the post office corporate website rightly describe the corporation as an anchor of uk community for century and say that it be drive by strong social purpose to be here in person for the people who rely on we could not agree more we must ensure that in chester le street and the other place that hon member have mention this afternoon post office branch remain open in use the word on the post office corporate website on our high street and in our town centre so that they can provide the service that local people rely on wherever we grow up in the united kingdom we all remember the post office and our parent imbue we with the sense that it be one of the thing that we could rely on and trust in change world there be many reason for that one of which be the long serve and always interested staff in rural area boston and skegness have many rural area post office staff be important in help people in village small town and community particularly the elderly the disabled and the vulnerable to use certain service when we be grow up we do not have the digital device we have now in the many brilliant contribution today we have hear that post office staff know their customer they know who be healthy and who might be struggle if someone do not appear on their regular day at their usual time they might say where be mrs smith that be massively important in our community this be not just about money it be about the asset value of post office in our community we and all the post office on the frontline have be let down by decade of mismanagement in boston whsmith have post office franchise and yes it be close which have cause great consternation sadly whsmith have not be well manage as retailer people be concerned that the replacement will be much small and they can not understand why service be be withdraw if we be try to make post office more viable surely they should have more service not few the operator and owner of the post office in swineshead can not understand why service such as the sale of premium bond and fishing licence or the payment of tax and national insurance to hmrc have all be withdraw that make the post office less viable all our community town and tiny village be different so surely we need to be massively flexible whether we have stand alone post office or one in franchise library or village hall be delighted when there be pub in the village hall maybe we could have post office in pub digress but member can see my point post office be the most important part of community and it be the elderly and the vulnerable who need they most that be why hope that the government give all their challenge remember that this be not about the money it be about the asset the community hub of the post office be grateful to the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure this debate member across the house have speak eloquently about the importance of their local post office particularly at time when high street across the country be suffer shop have close and bank have leave or be leave the high street the post office be usually the remain thrive hub of activity on the high street last year resident find out from medium report that the future of westbourne post office be uncertain there be no prior consultation and no input from those who use it daily many of they write to with their concern about the loss of such an essential community asset and share their worry about the possible loss of such popular and well use service at the end of november we launch petition to save this much love post office to date more than people in the area have sign it as part of the petition ask people to share what they love so much about the post office and what it mean to they and have be inundate with message from local resident it be essential to business that use its service and to the disabled and elderly who need it for banking pay bill and access government service it always have queue come out of the door it have be describe as lifeline and the heart of the community will read out few of the response receive to give the house sense of the importance of our post office one read it be an essential service for so many in the area be disabled and can travel far to deal with the thing the post office help with it nearly always busy with queue out of the door to remove it be sheer madness another response read the post office have be open since and be an essential part of westbourne village it serve as vital resource for elderly resident like who may not know how to use the internet and no long have any bank in the area another person say as manager of local charity shop the post office be integral to our day to day run as provide banking opportunity and enable we to send stock we use it for stationery and supply it vital part of the community that be just snapshot of the response have receive from different section of the community they show that the post office be not simply business it be an essential for many people who use it have hear from the post office that no decision have be make yet about the future of the branch like my hon friend the member for chelsea and fulham ben coleman have hear that the branch be lose money but have not see any evidence of that know franchise model be be explore which may have benefit be grateful to my hon friend the member for north durham luke akehurst for raise the issue of whsmith we be concern locally about the franchise model because our branch of whsmith have just close in the town centre not far from the post office branch understandably there be scepticism locally about rely on that model when we have just see the loss of post office with no plan to replace it despite the high demand for its service welcome the government commitment to the post office the financial support that have be outline and the forthcoming green paper that show that the government understand the importance of post office to community in his closing remark hope the minister can reassure we that there will be no impact on the quality of service that community get and that he be explore all option for example the possibility of provide service include banking service through hub or offer government service in post office to make they viable and keep they in community reassure my constituent in bournemouth west that will continue to fight for the post office in westbourne and the one in the town centre congratulate my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos on secure the debate have ask for post office debate at business question only two week ago be delighted when he secure this one in rural area such as my thornbury and yate constituency post office provide vital service that enable people to live their life since over bank branch have close across the country make it hard for people to access their cash and use banking service many have be reassure that they can still access those core service through their post office but now even that be at risk agree with the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer on the importance of post office to commerce when make my recent visit to my local sort office be tell that the royal mail be now parcel delivery service with sideline in deliver mail obviously post office play an important role in commerce and in do so support local business the recent news that the post office be look to close crown post office be huge blow one of those post office be in yate resident tell that it feel like do deal not proposal open for discussion when meet the area manager although she say that no decision have be make there seem to be strong lean towards move all post office to the franchising model with all the risk that hon member have already mention raynes park have an important high street in my constituency there be no bank in raynes park so our solitary post office be vital lifeline allow resident and business alike to access banking bill payment and traditional postal service however it be one of crown branch at risk and my constituent be very concerned about the uncertainty do my hon friend agree that the government should be give assurance now to provide community with peace of mind particularly the old and digitally exclude absolutely agree with my hon friend have see the anxiety that the threat of closure be provoke in my constituent yate post office be very busy there be often significant queue of people wait to access service it be rather unusual because it share its space with the local sort office which operate from the second floor of the building the quality of service would be negatively impact if it be squeeze into another exist business yate and chipping sodbury have also lose several bank on the high street with many people be tell as say early that they could rely on the post office instead now even that be at risk with yate list by the post office as one branch it be seek to close resident be rightly angry about that with more than thousand sign my petition to keep the post office open sadly it be not just the crown post office that be threaten with closure we recently have confirmation that the post office in cromhall be set to close due to the closure of the village shop in which it be base that mean that the neighbour outreach branch in tytherington which be oversee by the same sub postmaster be also at risk the sub postmaster tell how the post office at tytherington be busy than the one in cromhall fuel by the fact that nearly all the bank in nearby thornbury have close indeed lloyds have add itself to the list today tytherington post office also have strong support from customer use royal mail service for business as it have sizeable free car park make it convenient for they to bring their parcel letter and banking to the post office counter despite that the post office refuse to allow the tytherington branch to become stand alone site and that be cause huge concern for resident the tytherington branch be well support and be an essential service for resident many of whom do not have private car there be no public transport in the village mean that the loss of the post office would leave some people utterly cut off the post office be base in the thriving community shop which be run by volunteer and also provide vital service to the local community in the wake of the news grassroots petition support the post office in tytherington have gain more than signature in just over week however the post office say to that it would not review its decision because in the area there be main post office at thornbury and local branch at alveston both be within mile of tytherington that be completely tone deaf and ignore the lack of public transport what be those without car mean to do the post office have say it be keen to explore new outreach service and the possibility of new branch but all that will take time especially as it be contingent upon find new sub postmaster to do it it even admit that it be likely the branch will close before an alternative can be find that mean that in just few week time no immediate service will be available in the village will do all can to make sure we secure post office service at tytherington and in yate in closing ask the minister do he agree that rely solely on the franchising model of post office carry risk and that there be benefit to preserve the stand alone office will he also commit to support community outreach post office base in thrive community shop be grateful to the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure this debate think my hon friend the member for bournemouth west jessica toale have already summarise lot of the excellent contribution from the government side it be clear from today debate that we all know that post office branch be essential to our local community and the local economy it sadden that this government inherit post office in such precarious position have discuss the matter with senior post office staff and the minister know that the organisation be face serious financial challenge and be grateful for the engagement of the government and the minister on the issue that form the backdrop to the announcement that the post office be consider the future of the remain directly manage branch which have be reference countless time today with franchising model be consider for they remain especially concerned about the future of the morley post office on queen street morley sit in the heart of my constituency it be town of around people and one of the key location that people come to for financial service and shop the directly manage branch be vital for my constituent and for those who rely on the service that it provide and have be look for certainty that it will remain on the high street where it belong know the strength of feeling from my constituent as more than people have sign my petition to keep the branch open it be clear that after the closure of many bank branch across morley the post office be lifeline for those who need it the number back that up it be not just my testimony while other directly manage branch have see drop in footfall since because of the pandemic the morley post office be only down we use our post office word on bank branch and banking hub have be actively pursue banking hub for morley town centre especially with the recent news that natwest be due to pull out of the town this year natwest even point to the post office on its way out and say do worry you have that service there despite the threat of closure have be in touch with link one of the organisation that determine which area get banking hub and it tell that morley do not yet meet the criterion for banking hub because we still have one branch leave while have many question about the criterion we will have to save they for another debate and another time while morley do not meet link criterion and while continue to have those discussion with link we can not have situation where my post office close thankfully the continued operation of morley post office will not prevent we from secure banking hub in future so there be no reason why we should not do everything in our power to keep the post office open and that be exactly what be do as state the branch be very much in demand it be use by local business that trade on our high street business owner such as castlepoint which own and operate morley market have contact directly about their concern about the branch closing post office research show that three in sme use post office once week whether to post parcel to customer or deposit their cash taking lose this branch which be surround by so many business in morley would make we all bad off know that the direction of travel for the post office be to move towards the franchising model that we have hear so much about today and remain hopeful that suitable postmaster will be find to take over the branch but be also clear that the branch should remain on the high street have it in an accessible place in morley town centre be very important for both resident and business and will continue to make that case as strongly as can it be why have request that those interested in take over the franchise in morley contact be keen to support their bid assume that they be in the good interest of morley and the town centre finally ask the minister whether there be any threat to the number of service that directly manage branch can offer if it transition to franchised branch reassure all my community in leeds south west and morley that will work tirelessly to ensure that this branch remain open it be crucial that the service that the post office provide in morley town centre remain there for many year to come call the liberal democrat spokesperson congratulate my hon friend the member for taunton and wellington gideon amos on secure the debate the contribution throughout have be unify in highlight that post office be focal point of our community they be vital part of our society and our high street with million of people depend on they every week they be community hub provide access to communication banking and other vital service that be particularly important for those with restricted access such as old people or those in more rural population with little email connectivity there be village that fit that exact description in my constituency of wokingham such as finchampstead swallowfield and hurst that be why be deeply concerned about the news that post office branch may be close with around job at risk of be lose it have the potential to increase social isolation for some of the most vulnerable group in the uk be especially concerned that the post office be review proposal to replace exist branch specifically it be look for alternative to its wholly own branch and consider franchise arrangement where third party could take they on instead that open up lot of risk in my constituency of wokingham the post office in hurst be unexpectedly close few week ago it be locate in shop that many consider pillar of the community through no fault of the post office the tenant run the shop have to close its door lose post office can really harm small village such as hurst and the propose solution that people should travel to wokingham or twyford to access service be simply not possible for all resident public transport link be limited and those who rely on the post office be less likely to drive if the post office estate be reliant on third party it have no control and there be the worrying potential that situation like that in hurst will become increasingly commonplace future in which lose local service once mean that it be go forever very few be replace once they be go with little chance of appeal be failure of government policy that be especially relevant consider the potential loss of whsmith shop across the uk many of which house post office branch such as the one in wokingham town centre the high street be struggle and the government need to act urgently to turn thing around what step be the government take to ensure that the post office be on sustainable footing for the long term will the minister commit to ensure that none of the post office will close until consultation with each local community have be undertake have the minister meet representative from the post office to draw up plan in case it lose hundred of its site due to whsmith financial issue the bbc report today that ofcom have propose cut the delivery of second class letter to every other weekday and scrap delivery on saturdays that would harm service for million of household and small business royal mail executive should be work night and day to turn the company around and fix the postal service the new owner agree to the exist delivery target when they take over the company and they should stick to they would appreciate it if the minister could address my point and offer reassurance that our community will receive the great service they deserve post office branch provide place to do banking for million of people across the country and that be the case in wokingham but another area of concern be the lack of resilience in our local financial service the whsmith locate post office in wokingham be too small and the staff be too busy with all their other task one constituent have to wait about minute to withdraw that be why and local campaigner like lynn forbes hope that we can get banking hub however our application have be decline if the whsmith in wokingham town centre be to close our already limit option would be reduce far link which provide the banking hub be encourage within the current legislation to consider the protection of face to face banking but it be not explicitly empower to take that into account when make final decision on whether to establish banking hub instead it just focus on cash access will the minister explain why the protection of face to face service be not consider and will he introduce further legislation to require their protection call the shadow minister this have be an excellent debate and congratulate the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos on secure it and thank the backbench business committee for award it consistent theme throughout the debate have be the important role the post office play in community across our land provide what the hon member beautifully describe as friendly access to key service that connect people that service community particularly those without bank and that help those unable to use the internet to connect to government service in west worcestershire we be fortunate enough to have post office include some mobile service and put on record my thank to all the friendly sub postmaster and mistress who provide those service over the course of the debate we hear about place across the uk dunstable and leighton buzzard south west devon south east cornwall orkney and shetland bermondsey and old southwark south west hertfordshire chelsea and fulham didcot and wantage glasgow north east stockton west north durham boston and skegness bournemouth west thornbury and yate leeds south west and morley and wokingham and in intervention we hear about newton abbot dawlish teignmouth basildon and billericay dulwich and tiverton and minehead and dare say madam deputy speaker you feel strongly about the post office in romsey we can see just how incredibly valuable that network of friendly institution be across the country be afraid to say however and break it gently to the minister that labour budget of broken promise be threaten that network through the national insurance job tax the hike in business rate and the incoming employment regulation labour be hike the cost of do business as swathe of post office be face ten of million more in tax and red tape those pressure mean that the post office have be force into assess the future of more than crown post office branch rumour abound that when the green paper be publish it may include consultation on the reduction in the number of post office to below will the minister put pay to that speculation by tell the house when the green paper will be publish as the post office and its branch network be major employer with more than full time equivalent worker another impact be that the post office could face an extra million bill as result of the national insurance hike accord to the institute for fiscal studies post office be often eligible for retail hospitality and leisure business rate relief and they face huge increase in their business rate as the relief fall from to accord to the government own impact assessment the employment rights bill will cost business across the country billion proportionately give that post office have employee the bill will cost the post office over million the house do not have to take that from will quote the chairman of the post office nigel railton it almost go without say we be business in need of fresh start and urgently and at the recent budget we see cost rise with national insurance contributions national living wage and business rate will the shadow minister give way will be sure that the hon gentleman do not like hear that news it have nothing to do with hear the news just wonder whether the shadow minister can remind we how of many crown post office be lose while she be in government be just get to that the hon gentleman be absolutely on point with where be go sadly it be under the previous labour government that the network really shrink in major way when the number of post office go into sharp decline before it then stabilise in the in fact during the entire time that we be in coalition with our liberal democrat colleague and then in government ourselves the network remain above that figure it take action as we have hear clearly this afternoon to maintain that precious network will the shadow minister give way have already give way to the hon gentleman thank you very much but you do not answer my question have give way the previous government work to enter into new partnership with post office and come up with the idea that people could confirm their identity in person that be way of use that valuable network across the land we recognise that vulnerable people sometimes struggle to verify their identity online we also begin the initiative to help community deal with bank closure by set up network of banking hub be pleased to hear the minister confirm early today that he will continue back banking hub delivery through the post office but do he consider that the framework negotiation between the post office and the bank which be in their final stage be go well one year on from itv historic programme mr bates vs the post office want to put on record my thank to my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton kevin hollinrake for all he do to address the issue raise in that programme can the minister detail the progress his government be make on the compensation for sub postmaster want to raise the issue of fujitsu which design the horizon it system that have destroy so many life and livelihood under the previous government there be discussion with fujitsu about provide share of the compensation to the victim of the horizon scandal and fujitsu confirm that it will pause bid for government contract until the public inquiry be conclude however this month it be report that the government have award new contract to fujitsu when labour be in opposition many labour members criticise award make to fujitsu so can the minister provide an update on the government current approach the hon lady mention the horizon scandal be she of the opinion that the previous government failure to address the horizon scandal over such long period of time and the billion of pound that have have to be spend sort out the mess since then have nothing to do with the financial problem that the post office now find itself in do not want to politicise this too much because think that have go on for long period of time and the inquiry take lot of evidence last year think my hon friend the member for thirsk and malton play remarkable role in exonerate so many people and in set up the public inquiry my next question to the minister be could he provide an update on what he be hear through his channel about when the inquiry may publish its report it finish take public evidence at the end of last year and anticipate it may publish that later this year but do he have an update on that for the house do he have any plan to compensate sub postmaster and sub postmistress who be victim of horizon predecessor system the capture and ecco system that predate horizon and do he have plan to quash any conviction arise from those two system in the spending review how much public money be the minister request to put in replacement for the horizon system can he tell we how many post office currently benefit from small business rate relief and what be the government plan about continue that throughout this parliament far to the question from the hon member for wokingham clive jones about today worry announcement from ofcom that second class post may be deliver only every other weekday and not on saturdays what discussion be the minister have with ofcom to prevent this further attack on the demand for our precious postal service to conclude we have hear how incredibly important this precious network of friendly people across our land be to this country with those post office and the distance requirement that be in place after hear from so many colleague will the minister reassure the house that he will sustain that network throughout the life of this parliament prevention be so much well than cure let we all focus on support our much love post office in any way we can to continue the wonderful work that they do up and down the country echo the thank to the hon member for taunton and wellington gideon amos for secure this important debate there have be some very clear and consistent message from across the house to the government in this debate and pay tribute to the passion with which hon member on all side of the house have raise key constituency concern as the hon member for west worcestershire dame harriett baldwin say we have hear from my hon friend the members for dulwich and west norwood helen hayes for north durham luke akehurst for great grimsby and cleethorpes melanie onn for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer for south east cornwall anna gelderd for bermondsey and old southwark neil coyle for chelsea and fulham ben coleman for glasgow north east maureen burke for bournemouth west jessica toale and for leeds south west and morley mark sewards know that my hon friend the member for manchester withington jeff smith have particular concern about didsbury post office we also hear from the hon member for south west devon rebecca smith the right hon member for orkney and shetland mr carmichael the hon member for south west hertfordshire mr mohindra the hon member for didcot and wantage olly glover the hon member for stockton west matt vickers the hon member for boston and skegness richard tice and the hon member for thornbury and yate claire young and know you madam deputy speaker have concern in this space too post office provide hugely important everyday service to million of people across our country community rightly expect to have access to those essential service just as they would to gp surgery primary school or neighbourhood police that be because as many member make clear post office be the very beat heart of our town and village as our economy have modernise and evolve so too have our local post office today they be so much more than place to send letter and parcel they act as high street bank as many have say as access point for some government service and as community hub for an array of different activity generate crucial social capital indeed after the unearthing of the horizon scandal the nation unanimous support for sub postmaster and their campaign for redress and exoneration show how revere the post office and its worker be by the british public by all of we we be work as fast as we can to give sub postmaster the compensation they deserve and we be indeed explore what further step we can take but since the end of june in just the six month that we have be in office more than more postmaster who be victim of the scandal have receive compensation the amount pay out in redress have increase by over million more than double the amount that have be pay out at the time of the general election as of january almost million have be pay to over sub postmaster across all four main compensation scheme also as of january the glo group litigation order scheme have receive claim of which be fully complete and the remain be be assess for their completeness or undergo request for further information that would unlock more generous offer of compensation we expect then to have pay substantial redress even if the claim be not fully settle to the majority of glo claimant by march but let be clear there be still complex case to resolve and there be still much more to do in term of compensation the hon member for west worcestershire speak for the opposition ask about capture we have identify number of gap in the compensation process we publish in particular the kroll report into what have happen in term of the post office use of the capture software prior to the installation of the horizon system we be begin to talk to sub postmaster who use the capture software about redress go forward so that we can design an effective redress scheme the hon lady and the house may be aware that there be number of case where there be conviction that appear to relate to use of the capture software by the post office that be with the criminal cases review commission at the moment the hon lady also ask about the timing of when we might hear the sir wyn williams conclusion as she will understand we as the government do not want in any way to be see to be rush sir wyn williams we have hear similar timescale as she sometime later this year and we will all wait with considerable interest for the conclusion the hon lady also ask about the ofcom consultation stress that it be still consultation ofcom will be consult for some week and as she would expect we will be fully engage in that process on the future of the post office we all know that our high street have face huge challenge in recent year in some case the presence of post office on high street have be game changer in drive footfall and attract custom to other business the public as many member have allude to it be often the elderly those who use cash and those who be digitally exclude rely on the post office for essential service it be therefore right that the government hold the post office to account to ensure that there be enough postal service provision across the country and recognise my particular responsibility in that regard we protect the post office network by set minimum access criterion with network of this size we be likely to see fluctuation in the number of branch open at any one time but crucially the access criterion ensure that regardless of how the network change service remain within local reach of people at all time the government recognise the key role that post office play in their community and how branch in rural area in particular often act as community hub we be listen carefully to stakeholder to ensure that the whole network include those branch be sustainable do the minister agree that the manner in which the post office allow the information about the closure of directly manage branch to come into the public domain be unacceptable what be he do to ensure that the post office treat community with well respect than that in the future gently say to the right hon gentleman that we be where we be and it be important that we move forward will come to the question of directly manage branch in second to ensure that we be plan properly for the future we will publish green paper before the summer to seek the public view insight and experience to help shape the future of the post office in the meantime we be take step to continue to support the network along with the annual million subsidy we have provide furth million to support the post office network next year our thinking on the future of the post office will also be influence by sir wyn williams conclusion we continue to support and encourage the chair of the post office nigel railton to shift the focus of the post office away from headquarters and towards postmaster the post office with our support be review its cost as its financial position continue to be challenge we be work with the senior leadership at the post office on future opportunity begin with banking so that the company can increase its product offer and commercial revenue go forward the post office have set up new consultative council that will work with senior management on how these new plan be take forward it be first but none the less important step to change the culture of the post office build sustainable future for the post office be imperative it have have many false new start nearly half of its branch be not profitable or make only small profit from post office business postmaster pay have not increase materially for decade mr railton be look to deliver reduction in the post office cost and as have allude to an increase in its commercial revenue he have also set out an intention to transform the service and the support that postmaster receive from the post office which we have strongly encourage he have announce ambition for new deal for postmaster and be pleased that the post office recently make million immediate one off payment to postmaster to increase their remuneration on the future of directly manage branch appreciate that it be challenge for community that lose their post office service speak from experience have have harrow directly manage branch close in and transfer to franchise service instead be always happy to challenge the post office on specific concern that member have at constituency level however the post office operate as commercial business and the company have the freedom to deliver the branch network within the parameter we set know there be concern about the future of dmb and it be important to underline that no definitive decision have be take on the future of any individual directly manage branch have make clear to the post office that there must be discussion with union and other key stakeholder be pleased to hear that the post office have see positive engagement from independent postmaster and strategic partner who have express their interest in take on dmb it be encouraging that there continue to be such interest in the chance to run post office look forward to work with the minister on the future of the franchise in my constituency be he aware that there be crown post office in but that by that number have fall to the shadow minister either do not know that figure or do not want to admit it funnily enough be aware of that statistic my hon friend make his point powerfully we be clear in our manifesto that that we would seek to strengthen the post office network in consultation with postmaster trade union and customer and that remain very much our ambition that be one of the reason why we be work closely with the post office in provide funding to support the replacement of the horizon computer system the post office future lie particularly in cash and banking with the right support from the financial service industry and engagement with group such as cash access uk there be clearly more that the post office could offer on the high street through banking hub and the post office network we be begin to work with the post office to improve its banking offer on the high street the government be strongly committed to ensure the long term sustainability of the post office it be national asset that provide an invaluable public service in all our constituency there be certainly challenge ahead but we continue to work with the post office to ensure that it be fit for the future we always welcome view on the network thank those hon member who secure the debate and all other hon member for their contribution call gideon amos to wind up have learn today from the hon member for dunstable and leighton buzzard alex mayer
