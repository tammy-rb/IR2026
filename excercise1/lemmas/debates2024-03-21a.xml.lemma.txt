unlike the hon gentleman be at the launch of the say report and have read it he will be aware that for example one reason for the complication be that the number of people work from home have increase by we have plan to tackle that with the record investment that be be make to mayors he talk about franchising but it be also the case without shadow of doubt that he do not have plan to finance it particularly for rural local authority what be the case be that when labour organisation be challenge on this they struggle to find out how they will deal with the funding the truth be that there be no plan and they be not put forward any funding individual people who attend that event be genuinely in shock at the shadow secretary of state suggestion that labour be go to do this but be unsure about how it would fund it with great respect to the hon lady she know full well that her council attempt to have an active travel scheme in jesmond and it so mess it up that it have to scrap the scheme the ltn be scrap and there be objection and considerable waste of money with due respect active travel be do great job and we support it but council have to take local community with they the chair of the pac be entirely right although in the mod context if it be groundhog day groundhog sound like vehicle that have slip to the right more recently after detailed inquiry the defence committee on which serve publish damn report on february entitle simply ready for war have serve on the committee since and this be one of the punchy report we have ever produce in answer to the question in the title the all party committee which include six former mod ministers conclude despite the united kingdom spending approximately billion year on defence plus more for ukraine the uk armed forces require sustained ongoing investment to be able to fight sustained high intensity war alongside our ally against peer adversary in plainer english and as the subsequent detail in the report starkly point out despite considerable outlay of taxpayer cash we could not fight sustained war with putin russia for more than couple of month before we run out of ammunition and fighting equipment not least as we have very few tank ship or combat aircraft in reserve the full report can be find online give that it take year to build modern warship totally ridiculous year in the case of the new type frigate and four year to build typhoon fighter if we have to fight what the strategist sometimes describe as come as you be war one with little further warning we would have to rely on whatever equipment we have to hand or could rapidly remobilise we simply do not have enough war win kit to win as it be as the public accounts committee report on the year equipment plan illustrate starkly the difference between what the mod aspire to buy and the funding it be likely to have available be billion however it be bad because the three service account for the plan on different basis without go into all the technicality an apple and apple comparison across the three service show that the gap be billion even beyond gap in capability of our kit our great weakness be now the lack of skilled personnel to operate and maintain the equipment that we do have without they and far too many of they be leave as the chair of the defence committee say even multi billion dollar aircraft system simply remain in the hangar one perfect example of how dysfunctional the mod have now become in relation to people be the saga of capita or forgive crapita as it be now affectionally know to the defence committee it have totally mess up the recruitment system for the british army few year ago its share price top today it be barely penny everyone in defence know that the outsourced contract have be disaster yet absolutely no one in the upper echelon of the department have the moral courage to sack the company the defence secretary recently describe the situation in the times as ludicrous he be absolutely right indeed no doubt he have make note of his own comment on his own famous spreadsheet but still nothing actually happen capita limp on as the army bleed out with in some part of the army three soldier now leave for every one that capita somehow painfully manage to recruit if we think we be go to deter the like of vladimir putin in this manner we be live on different planet in parallel universe in fantasy dimension give that we now spend the thick end of billion year on defence the british taxpaye public be quite entitle to ask why so little of our defence capability work properly why be some of the army fight vehicle year old why do we have hardly any battle tank that actually work why do we have hardly any submarine that be now regularly put to sea why do we have aircraft carrier that perennially break down whenever they try to leave port bluntly it be because we now have ministry of defence that have become in recent year gigantic sclerotic bureaucracy constantly hidebound by needless self generate red tape obsess with process rather than outcome in which some senior civil servant be now more interested in wokery than weaponry endlessly rip off by some of their own major contractor such as boeing to name but one and in which key element of our fighting equipment be so old and the procurement system for replace they so broken that we now can not fight major war with russia for more than few week as it well know moreover as the red book clearly show in table and we be cut the core uk defence budget next year by billion and play smoke and mirror with the donation to ukraine and with address an overspend on the nuclear enterprise from the treasury reserve in order to pretend otherwise this act of what the russians call maskirovka or strategic deception be wholly unworthy of conservative government if member happen to believe as do that the role of our armed force be determinedly to save life by convince any potential aggressor that be they to attack we we would defeat they then we be palpably fail this be not an intellectual parlour game ultimately this be about whether our grandchild be go to grow up in someone else re education camp but we might not know that if we walk into the current mod we can try to blame the military for instance for so frequently over specify new military equipment such as ajax that it enter service many year late but in the end the responsibility lie with the politician who theoretically at least be suppose to be in charge the romans have famous saying about military matter si vis pacem para who desire peace save prepare for war give that the secretary of state the man who run the department have tell we that we be in pre war world surely we have well start prepare for it if we be to have any chance whatsoever of prevent it and we should now do that in earnest before it be too late agree with every word my right hon friend the former eminent chairman of the defence committee just say my one caveat be that the mod excuse for these capability gap be that we can rely on ally to fight with we but they will be rely on we and if we be unable to support they or they be on wartime task elsewhere thing might go horribly wrong say all of this not just as someone who serve proudly as territorial army infantry officer in my local royal anglian regiment during the cold war not just as someone who be still very proud to carry the late queen commission not just as former veteran and then armed forces minister in the ministry of defence albeit almost decade ago but most of all as say at prime minister question last week as the devoted son of day veteran stoker class reginal francois die when be year of age he tell one night of the carnage his word that he witness that day albeit from offshore on minesweeper name hms bressay in the afternoon they be opposite omaha beach let quote shakespeare famous phrase this story shall the good man teach his son my father be good man the story that he tell be of country that eventually reluctantly have to go to war against the evil of nazi tyranny because for year its politician have be so parsimonious he actually say so naive that when nazism emerge we completely fail to deter it that be the lesson of the but it be also his lesson to my father make take solemn vow that as his son would never take live in free country for grant because as he say too many good man have die to achieve it two year after we have that conversation he be dead that be why be here this afternoon that be why come into politic in the first place as wartime serviceman my father be great admirer of winston churchill our great ever prime minister who lead this country through war of national survival and then lose general election for his trouble when walk into the chamber early this afternoon could still see the damage cause when the chamber be bomb in churchill insist that it not be repair lest we forget and he be right in summary may not be my father contemporary that famously courageous mp leo amery so can not claim to speak for england on this matter but be elect to speak for the people of rayleigh and wickford and so on their behalf issue this stark warning today the sky be darken brutal dictator with powerful weapon at their disposal be on the rise the democracy be on the backfoot rather than the front history tell we time and again and indeed ad nauseam that the appeasement of dictator be they call adolf hitler or vladimir putin do not work we should be increase the defence budget to at least of gdp what my right hon friend the member for new forest east sir julian lewis use to call at least three to keep we cut it as we now be and pretend that we be not the first duty of government above all other be the defence of the realm and we forget that at our peril si vis pacem para bellum
