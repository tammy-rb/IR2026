government be do now ai work think the hon gentleman will be aware that we be not responsible for russia invasion of ukraine which have have significant impact on global energy price the good news be that those global energy price be come back to level and that be start to feed back into our food supply chain that be why we be help and support farmer invest in new technology and investing in their business to make they more sustainable and more profitable go forwards so that they can continue to deliver great quality british food at reasonable price the war in ukraine have not cause the labour shortage that be cause scottish crop to be plough back into the field the war in ukraine have not cause custom barrier and tariff that mean that scottish seafood be be leave in the sea brexit have cause those thing that be why food inflation be high in the uk than elsewhere when will the government accept that unfortunately the hon gentleman be misinformed food price be high in germany and france if brexit be the issue clearly that would not be the case that be why we be invest in those farmer we be support they by increase the number of visa that be available in the seasonal agricultural worker scheme we be support those farmer to continue to produce great quality food business as the hon member for glasgow north patrick grady have say be suffer because of the absence of labour in fishing and indeed in farming in east lothian give that this have be bring about by brexit and that the previous route of labour have be sell off be it not time that the scottish government have control over some migration visa even of limited timescale as apply in south australia and quebec we have issue possible visa on the seasonal agriculture worker scheme and we be currently nowhere near that level there be an extra visa available should the industry require they we have not see the necessity to trigger those extra at this moment in time which be because there be adequate visa available to support farmer and fisherman call the chair of the environment food and rural affairs committee the price of wheat peak at tonne it have subsequently fall to below tonne not much more than it be before the invasion of ukraine why have the price of bread in our supermarket not fall too declare my interest in these matter recognise the fact that global wheat price have now come back

and will work with the sector to make sure that food be reasonably price for our constituent the farming minister will know that in north northamptonshire we have some of the good farmer in the country who be face these challenge like every other farm up and down the land would he be kind enough to visit kettering to meet large group of local farmer perhaps in early september in between harvesting and drilling that be very kind invitation it be always pleasure to visit northamptonshire and if my diary allow will of course meet my hon friend and his farmer call the snp spokesperson the minister have talk lot about support for farmer but in reality there be severe lack of profitability for those produce chicken that be cause sharp reduction in the number of bird rear in england while in scotland production have change significantly as retailer resist demand to pay fair price for chicken will the minister commit to extend the examination of food supply chain to poultry meat as request by the national farmers union scotland as the threat of empty shelf loom will he also engage with retailer to ensure that poultry farmer be fairly compensate be on poultry farm yesterday talk to poultry producer the snp can not have it both way it can not ask one question about suppress price for consumer and another about increase the price for farmer those thing be diametrically opposed what we be do as department be support those farmer through the billion worth of subsidy help they to invest in new technology and talk to retailer and producer to make sure we get fairness in the supply chain so everybody get fair return for their hard work animal welfare what step she be take to bring forward legislative proposal to improve animal welfare the government be commit to continue to deliver on our manifesto commitment and the work we have undertake through the action plan for animal welfare from so far we have deliver six measure through primary legislation and four through secondary legislation we have also support three private member bills one of which the shark fins act ban the import of detach shark fin receive royal assent last week as the minister update the house on may we will be support the delivery of the measure from our manifesto during the remainder of the parliament and we have already start with consultation on ban primate as pet through secondary legislation we have have three secretaries of state and day have pass since the animal welfare kept animals bill be first introduce in this house and we be no far forward today on ban animal fur import or on tackle illegal puppy and kitten smuggling or on ban foie gra the former defra secretary the right hon member for camborne and redruth george eustice say the bill do not go ahead due to lack of resolve to take it through how long must animal suffer the consequence of this tory psychodrama and when will animal welfare finally be prioritise in this place the hon gentleman must be live in parallel universe there be no doubt that many measure have be undertake to improve animal welfare one thing would say be that there have not be any live export of animal since and we still have legislation ready to go we have already set out our approach of course he will be aware that it be already illegal to smuggle pet and some of the legislation we be work on be to try to make it more challenging for criminal who abuse pet as well the secretary of state be right that progress on animal welfare can be make by specific and target measure would add to the one she mention the adoption by the government of my own private member hare coursing bill however we do need clear programme of further progress can she tell the progress on two specific change the ban on the import of dog with cropped ear and the ban on keep primate as pet as my hon friend point out he have already undertake significant work regard hare coursing it be one of the top priority for rural police and crime commissioner and they continue to do good work on that recognise that much of it be connect to organise crime on the two measure he refer to because we be introduce secondary legislation to stop people keep primate as pet we have to consult formally and then the legislation will be prepare alongside that in term of the mutilation element when my right hon friend the minister for food farming and fisheries speak to the house on may he say that we would be take forward measure on individual issue intend that to happen in the next session of parliament call the shadow minister last friday lord goldsmith resign from the government and his letter to the prime minister be absolutely devastating if may paraphrase it it say that before take office the prime minister assure party member via lord goldsmith that he the prime minister would continue to implement the action plan include the animal welfare kept animals bill and measure such as end the live export of animal for slaughter ban keep primate as pet and prevent the import of shark fin and hunt trophy from vulnerable specie lord goldsmith have be horrify as bit by bit the government have abandon those commitment domestically and on the world stage the animal welfare kept animals bill have be ditch despite the prime minister promise effort on wide range of domestic environmental issue have simply grind to standstill and more worryingly the united kingdom have visibly step off the world stage lord goldsmith and the secretary of state serve as defra ministers in the last parliament do she agree with his devastating critique of the prime minister and her department of course not be very sad that the noble lord choose to leave government pay tribute to he for lot of what he have do in term of international nature the minister for food farming and fisheries my right hon friend the member for sherwood mark spencer set out to the house on may the approach that we be take and why we be get on with the legislation

understand that because he have never be in be respond to the chuntering from the hon gentleman the point be that when we introduce secondary legislation the formality be that we have to consult that

they quote for main water connection that be obviously unacceptable will my hon friend agree to meet urgently so that we can discuss how to help my constituent be sorry to hear about this issue which my right hon friend have already bring to my attention our legislation do allow for those on private supply to request connection to the main supply but it be right that the legislation allow water company to charge for the cost of make new connection because otherwise it would impact on all customer bill the local authority can give advice and urge he to keep contact it but if there be anything more we can discuss usefully would be happy to do so like yourself mr speaker be of generation that can well remember when water come from the well and it be pure and clean time have move on and we have realise that such water be not available to everyone as the right hon member for middlesbrough south and east cleveland sir simon clarke say ask the minister this question ever mindful of the

introduce delinked payment from the government plan to bring forward regulation to delink payment later this year as the parliamentary timetable allow those regulation will introduce delinked payment in as plan information about delinked payment can be find on delinke the legacy basic payment scheme payment from the need to have land area entitlement could be really powerful catalyst for change it would free the rural payments agency and farmer from the bureaucracy of the legacy scheme remove very difficult distortion from the land market and crucially free farmer up to make decision about what to do with their land in future since farmer be make decision about next year land use now will my right hon friend take this opportunity to confirm from the dispatch box that the delinked payment will happen next year and that there will be no reversal of that plan be happy to confirm that and pay tribute to my right hon friend for all the work he do to get we to this point of course we will

minister and in particular how surplus food and food near its use by date can be use by organisation such as fareshare there be still huge problem right across the country whereby constituent can not afford to buy food in supermarket and be therefore rely on food pantry and food bank for their main shop to have food security people must be able to afford food what more can the minister do to resolve those issue and ensure that people be not literally starve or in position where they can not afford to buy basic foodstuff the hon gentleman will be aware of the huge package of support the chancellor of the exchequer have introduce to help family with the cost of living challenge they face on average every household receive over of support with their energy and food bill but be sure we can do more to help and support primary food producer processer and retailer to make sure that we drive as much efficiency as possible into the system in order to maintain low food price and help family up and down the country call the shadow minister last week past failure catch up with the defra ministerial team first the climate change committee castigate they for lack of progress on agriculture and land use and then the report they have commission from john shropshire and his team detail the crop loss and lose productivity and production cause by their failure to address labour supply issue this week could the minister tell the house if he know whether the uk be more or less food secure than this time last year and will he explain how he have reach that conclusion we have extensive conversation with the food supply market we be bless in the uk with very robust food supply chain which be some of the most secure anywhere in the world of course acknowledge that the shropshire review have indicate some area in which we can improve and assist but we have deliver the visa that be available through the seasonal agricultural worker scheme not all of those visa have be take up and an extra be available if require but nobody have ask for that to be trigger topical questions if she will make statement on her departmental responsibility it have be particularly busy week for defra in number of different way with not only the launch of the designate highly protect marine area but the house of commons vote to support the legislation to introduce the ban on plastic which be another way to improve the environment of course there have also be significant speculation about the water industry think it be important to put it on record that the government have confidence in the financial resilience of the water sector industry we will continue to have discussion which be important and think it be critical to be aware that people who do not know lot about the water industry frankly be out of their depth in make some comment and speculation we need to make sure that we treat this situation very carefully because it be critical to make sure that we have ongoing investment in the water industry which everybody here rely on thankfully my dog sidney pickles come from great home although one could complain to trading standard that his former home fail to describe he as naughty cocker spaniel or fox poo roll little tinker seriously however there have be much misinformation about the government action on puppy farming from the opposition do my right hon

focus be about reduce the gearing and that have not happen with thames water ofwat be still responsible and be still hold it to account on how that go forward however it be very important that we do not have speculation and misinformed comment it be critical that we get water company through certain stage and be confident the government will do that like the industry itself that response do not hold water people know that thames water be not an isolated case five company be rat as be of concern by the government own financial regulator last weekend write to the environment secretary set out six key test to safeguard bill payer worker and taxpayer from pay the price of fail water industry will she finally act to protect the national interest and commit to those six test and will she rule out customer have to pay twice for boardroom failure yes or no have not yet see the hon gentleman letter but will of course respond to it before the recess over billion have be invest into our water industry since privatisation through long stand combination of equity and debt investment by water company speculation around such an important utility do not help the situation and measured approach be critical to get through this difficulty he mention other water company and that be why ofwat have act and why new equity have come into many water company it be critical that we continue to have

that be not minister in the ministry of justice be happy to pass on her point to those ministers the attorney general office stay completely separate and independent of the ministry of justice and it be important that we maintain that call the chair of the justice committee be sure the attorney general will agree that the investigation and prosecution of rape and serious sexual offence require particular skill in both investigation and handling in court will she therefore welcome the increase in prosecution counsel fee to an equal level with those for the defence so that we get the most competent people do these case will she also accept that more investment must continue to go in so that the crown prosecution service as the director of public prosecutions point out to our committee on tuesday can continue to recruit sufficient experienced rape prosecutor and have the digital technology to deal with thing such as mobile phone evidence in these case my hon friend know well that do not hold the budget that he be seek to influence but he be one of the good campaigner in the house and as ever he make his point extremely clearly watch with interest his committee proceeding early

the forefront of international effort we have refer russia to the international criminal court we will intervene on behalf of ukraine before the international court of justice later this year and we be part of the core group of state work to establish special tribunal for the crime of aggression the attorney general will appreciate that the international criminal court do not have jurisdiction over crime of aggression in effect the deliberate violent and unprovoked military incursion into the sovereign territory of another recognise state karim khan prosecutor at the icc have point out that none of the other war crime commit by russia in ukraine could have happen have it not be for that initial crime of aggression will the attorney general assure we that step be be take to set up special

aggression rape and serious sexual offences what step the crown prosecution service be take to increase support for victim of rape and serious sexual offence what step the crown prosecution service be

that victim be willing to continue their case to trial serious violent crime west midland what assessment she have make of the adequacy of the level of prosecution rate of serious violent crime in the

friend would expect the cps prosecute violent crime robustly as the attorney general will know from intimate knowledge serious violent crime be thankfully not something that lichfield suffer very much

serious violent crime the sale and use of drug be drive serious and violent crime last year for drug offence the cps in the west midland have conviction rate of over agree with my hon friend zero tolerance approach unduly lenient sentence scheme what recent assessment she have make of the effectiveness of the unduly lenient sentence scheme the unduly lenient sentence scheme remain an important tool ensure appropriate sentence for the most serious crime last year we refer case to the court of appeal and the sentence be increase in just under of those case thank the solicitor general for his response he will recall that contact he on behalf of number of my constituent about child sex offender in my constituency our local newspaper the stoke sentinel report the sentencing of that offender beneath the headline pervert walks free from court my constituent be rightly concerned that such serious offender can receive non custodial sentence give that my right hon and learn friend have be unable to intervene will he review the way in which such offending be evaluate so that such case can be consider be very grateful to my hon friend for his question and for raise this case he be great champion for stoke on trent he will understand that can not comment on individual case but it be right to say that the threshold or test for undue leniency be high one in the vast majority of case the

help at every level include prosecutorial and evidence gather help we be keen part of the atrocity crime advisory group we have be train judge we be keen to help with the wide accountability question on the international stage as well at all level we be absolutely determined to help our friend in ukraine could the attorney general keep go for another second could keep go on ukraine almost forever mr speaker what else shall talk about what delight could talk about ukraine all day there be another large piece of work on compensation that we be undertake with our international partner well do rail ticket offices urgent question to ask the secretary of state if he will make statement on plan to close rail ticket office be answer the urgent question on behalf of the secretary of state who be currently involve in this process so it be appropriate for to respond there have be huge shift in the way in which passenger purchase ticket at railway station with about one in every transaction take place in ticket office in that be down from one in three decade early and equate to of rail revenue despite this our station have hardly change in the past year which mean that staff be constrain to work in ticket office although they could serve passenger well on station platform and concourse be pleased that the rail industry have launch consultation on the future of ticket office under the ticketing and settlement agreement process which will give the public an opportunity to scrutinise the train operate company proposal to ensure that they work in the good possible way for passenger these change be about modernise the passenger experience by move staff out of ticket office to be more visible and accessible around the station crucially no currently staff station will be unstaffe as result of this reform staff will still be there to provide assistance and additional support for those who need and want it and the new approach will take into consideration the potential impact on individual with protect characteristic it be of course vital that our railway be accessible to all and have engage directly with accessibility group and will continue to do so this be an industry process so encourage member and their constituent to engage with their local train operator to find out more about the proposal for their local station if passenger want to raise any view they can contact the relevant passenger body believe that the industry propose reform could enable staff to provide more flexible agile and personal service create the modern experience that people expect yesterday the rail delivery group confirm plan to close hundred of rail ticket office across the country but this morning as be usual when difficult decision be make the secretary of state be nowhere to be see this announcement drive every inch of the way by his department not the industry as the minister claim have cause huge anxiety to vulnerable and disabled passenger and rail staff up and down the country and how long have people be give to respond to these hugely consequential plan just day this be massive change to the network affect more than million rail journey year and hit elderly and disabled passenger the hard and they have be give only three week to have their say why do the minister not just admit that this consultation have nothing to do with take on board their concern it be rubber stamp for decision that he have already make with the most vulnerable cut out altogether can the minister give any reassurance to vulnerable passenger who rely on staff in railway station to help they to purchase ticket and board train why have he not publish equality impact assessment alongside these consultation give that he claim the solution be modernisation and digital ticketing do he know how many station do not currently have tap in or barcode capability what assessment have he make of the impact on revenue for our rail industry will he admit that this process be merely prelude to job loss that will mean far few staff to serve the travel public and the continue manage decline of our railway we know what this be really about it be not about reform our railway the government have already ditch plan for great british railways it be not about modernisation the department have already confirm that the contactless ticket roll out be limit to london and the south east this be about one thing and one thing only the conservatives crash the economy and now they be ask for more self defeat cut on our decline railway on the minister watch our rail service be already be run into the ground with cancellation at record high basic service such as wi fi be take away and legislation to reform the network on the scrapheap will he simply acknowledge that the conservatives can not fix the railway because they break they in the first place let give little more detail on the secretary of state role in the ticketing and settlement agreement which have be in place not just under conservative administrations but under the last labour administration the secretary of state be require to make determination where the train operator and the passenger group can not reach an agreement that make it entirely right for he not to be here to respond to the urgent question the hon lady mention job loss first and foremost this be all about take expert ticketing staff into the part of the station where currently they be not see if only of ticket be sell across the ticket counter crudely that mean that of passenger be not access that member of staff the idea be to take the member of staff on to the platform to help passenger to purchase ticket via ticketing machine or online ninety nine per cent of ticket can be purchase in that manner so there be no reason why this will not be an improvement in the event that there be some staff who do not wish to make the transition of course the train operator will need to look at that the sad reality be that there be an offer on the table that would guarantee no compulsory redundancy up to december but the union leader refuse to put that offer to their member if there be any concern about the impact on job the national union of rail maritime and transport workers and those it back financially might wish to take some responsibility for that the hon lady talk about pay as you go be roll out only to the south east the devolution deal that have be announce will enable the roll out of pilot by the mayors of the west midlands and manchester by the end of this year she also talk about wi fi be take away but that be not the case either we be look for each train operator to do research to show how much the wi fi be use how helpful it be and what more can be do call the chair of the select committee the transport committee be conduct an inquiry into accessible transport we have receive alarming evidence that the quality and range of assistance to vulnerable passenger have decline markedly since the pandemic if the redeployment of staff be to be meaningful it be essential that the new role and training be design with the support of campaign group for vulnerable people will my hon friend assure that that will happen my hon friend make an excellent point the very first discussion have with any group about these change be with those group that represent passenger with accessibility and mobility issue on the railway tell they that be keen to work with they to help to ensure that these proposal be design such that they work for each group with different characteristic will be look to meet they again to ensure that that occur at am the office of rail and road issue its rail passenger assistance booking update for the late year which show that passenger assist increase by compare with the previous year that demonstrate that more help be need at station for people with accessibility need again by free people who be currently under utilise in the ticket office and put they on to the platform to give help and guidance we will help those who need it the most that be at the forefront of everything that the train operator be look to do with these proposal in may there be partial collapse at northwich station it be the ticket office it be be rebuild as we speak and there be an investigation into the collapse be now tell by the minister and the secretary of state that it be incredibly likely it seem foregone conclusion that the ticket office will never reopen disabled and elderly people already struggle access the station but they will struggle even more without staff this be folly the minister need to think again it be not the ticket office but the expert people in it who assist passenger with these proposal the train operator be look to free up people from behind the glass often in part of the station that passenger do not access to help they to use their skill to get ticket sell at ticket machine and to advise people on how to purchase online so they can do that in future and thereafter to help they with the entire passenger journey experience give they information and make they feel more reassured these roll out have occur across other part of the network london underground do this some year ago and do not believe the current labour mayor of london have any plan to turn it round because it actually work it give well passenger experience people can either live in the past or look towards the future the way in which passenger transact across whole range of service be exactly the same and we be keen to see the railway modernise and thrive many of my constituent write to about overcrowding on an almost daily basis particularly on chiltern railways no one have ever write to about ticket office provision sympathetic as be to the argument for ensure staff come out from behind the counter to assist people directly on platform and around the station how will this solve the demand of passenger which we be probably all see in our inboxe on day to day basis in relation to rush hour capacity and weekend capacity chiltern railways for example be look to expand coverage at high wycombe by redeploy staff it can get more staff on to the platform this be an example of where my hon friend passenger will benefit because train operator can flex staff to provide more coverage which make people feel more reassured again as hon and right hon member look at the detail and engage with the consultation they may find their constituent be get wide range of service over wide range of hour than they currently receive as booking and ticket clerk on the underground back in the trust know ticketing be now easy still use the bus and the underground every day so be familiar with the scene at station in the morning and evening however more screen and more opportunity for thing to go wrong be not the answer to every problem do the minister know how many ticket machine fail every day these machine will make it hard not easy to buy ticket it will be hard not easy to secure refund it will be hard not easy to apply for rail card who use book office clerk disabled people the elderly and people with language problem or difficulty understand how to use the ticket machine will he give the green light for the rdg to change track and scrap this train wreck of proposal there be regulated operate station but of all station currently do not have any ticket office facility at all and people be still able to use those station to access train ninety nine per cent of transaction can be complete either online or via machine in the event that machine be not work and there be no staff lot of station like my own be staff for only half the day ticket to ride can be acquire and then ticket can be purchase at the end of journey again these process be already in place for those station with no ticket office we have those block to build on do not think the minister should plug the beatles in that way many people use station such as stoke on trent station be infrequent traveller and many be vulnerable or elderly and need support to buy ticket can the minister assure that there will always be someone at stoke on trent station to provide paper ticket to those without digital skill there be no plan to replace paper ticket through the train operator process again the aim be to ensure that ticket office staff be free up and on the platform to sell the ticket and help passenger to purchase they at the machine or online the hope be that thereafter those passenger will be able to book for themselves with confidence without need to use that service those staff will also be available at stoke on trent to provide other service and information more customer service this be the exact way in which our rail passenger transact across the retail and financial space which be why it be the right approach for the railway my constituent who use cross gates station and people across the country will be worried about this proposal because close ticket office be yet another example of private profit be put before the public good in our railway this move be really about gutte railway of station staff who have big impact on passenger accessibility and safety especially for old and disabled people do the minister really believe that this will make the railway more welcoming for people or do that not matter if we like see station staff when we access our journey and like the fact that we will be see more of they because they will be free up then absolutely agree with the hon gentleman rather than gutte the railway this government and indeed the taxpayer have provide billion of support since the pandemic that do not sound like gutte the railway to truly believe that we will end up with well station experience one that well reflect modern usage which be why we be happy to support the train operator with these proposal as say of transaction be purchase across the ticket office year ago it be one in three the railway be adapt to the manner in which consumer have change their habit disabled elderly and other vulnerable passenger have be trouble by today announcement but do the minister share my weary exasperation at the fact that people do not understand that the good way to help disabled and elderly passenger be for staff to come out from behind their screen to assist they in use ticket machine to help they on and off train and to help they to move around the station do he agree that for more than decade minister have seek to improve service for passenger on the station but have be block at every turn do he not see an opportunity to improve accessibility on our rail network here it should be welcome not reject my hon friend speak with experience have do this role himself and he be absolutely right in what he say find it patronise to be tell constantly that those who have disability or those who be elderly can not access thing online and can not do this that be not the case at all at the moment we do not have enough product online and as part of this process have be push to ensure that we have more online it will mean that people do not have to go to the station beforehand to pick up travelcard because they need photo that they have to take the idea be that this move should make thing well for those who have accessibility and mobility challenge not just in put more ticket online and into place where they can buy they from the comfort of their own home and phone but in make sure they have more help at the station so thank he for the point he make he speak with expertise the government have oversee the large increase in rail fee my constituent must deal with frequent delay and cancellation and now people in bath and across somerset face lose their ticket office bath be world heritage site that have large number of visitor foreign visitor in particular find get through app and ticket machine bewilder they depend on the ticket office it more important than ever now to attract people on to public transport so will the minister explain why my constituent and the many visitor to bath who would otherwise come by coach should feel confident that train journey will be more reliable cheap and more attractive than drive it be because we want to give that well customer experience so that more passenger be see more staff at the station to help they with information make they feel more secure and welcome help they purchase ticket and do so in manner where those passenger be use to transact across the space very much hope the hon lady will see well staff experience as result and therefore even more people will be attract on to rail my hon friend be good minister and good friend but think even he know he have tough gig this morning to use his beatles analogy can he not just let it be queue up at my ticket office every monday morning there be always queue of people want route advice people with disability who can not use the machine and people want refund have to queue because have an open flexible ticket as many member do that can not get from the machine will rove member of staff be subject to statutory regulation at the moment ticket office staff be the only staff subject to statutory regulation so might not even be able to find roving member of staff to take to the machine to request ticket that the machine will not give it be not go to work be it the beatles analogy rather fly past be afraid let repeat the statistic to my hon friend of all ticket can be purchase from ticket machine or online in term of the we need to work on have ask the industry and official to speed up the process so that more ticket can be purchase in that manner and ticket machine can be change so that that can occur seek to work with my hon friend to convince he that that be the right approach as the former chair of the transport committee and have spend all my time on transport since become member would not be make this statement if do not believe this be the right thing for the railway and for passenger that matter to hugely be not stooge do this because think this be the right thing to do it will create well passenger experience and it guarantee our future in rail the minister speak of modernise passenger experience of railway have visit he will know that luton station be not fit for purpose and that the ticket office be integral to the upper level walk through from the town centre to high town any closure of the ticket office will pose risk to the security and safety of staff and passenger crucially can the minister assure that the propose closure of ticket office will not be use as reason to delay decrease or halt refurbishment of station that be in need of renovation in the future such as luton station have stand at the dispatch box and assure the hon lady that the maintenance improvement for luton station will start in august and will be deliver by the beginning of next year can give she that assurance this programme be completely separate and do not have any knock on effect regard the access for all programme through which station will have be give step free access by next year as part of the process for the programme passenger will have three week period during which they can provide their view on individual station so they can give their view on luton station there will then be day period during which passenger group will assess what they have see and they can work with train operator on issue with which they be uncomfortable perhaps for reason of meeting accessibility need finally the secretary of state will determine matter if the two party can not agree so there be process in place to ensure that every station meet its requirement which they must do from an accessibility perspective none of that change through this mechanism ten per cent of ticket sale be still an awful lot of ticket sale in this process hope that people who choose or need to buy their ticket from ticket office will not suffer from the tyranny of the majority who choose not to and that their interest will be properly protect throughout will the minister assure that those people who want to pay for their ticket use cash will still be able to do so to ban people from use cash to buy ticket would be completely unacceptable think see the beatles analogy because there be ticket to ride okay that be it that process be available to anybody who wish to pay cash for example if my hon friend look at the northern train website he will see that there be whole feature explain how cash can still be use the machine should take cash in the event that they do not there be process for passenger to purchase ticket on the train without fear of penalty so yes cash can still be use in the machine the minister be clearly on southeastern time that be why he be late get the analogy he say that just of ticket be sell over the counter but that do not explain who be use the ticket office and what alternative arrangement he be go to make for they southeastern have announce ticket office closure of which be in south east london that be in south east london that be an outrage one in my constituency have close but all the one around my constituency be close as well what will he do to ensure that these people not only keep their job once they be move out from behind the glass but be not move from be redeploy to redundancy and what will he do about the who rely on ticket office say respectfully to the hon member that southeastern have have its good performance in six year he stand in this place in january rightly say that change in the december timetable have lead to high cancellation rate those rate have go down from to southeastern be one of the good operator in term of performance that be all down to the staff but never have he stand up to thank the staff for turn thing around and work so hard he should not think they be his friend when they have to listen to he go on and give misinformation about the situation he have also get southeastern consultation wrong southeastern be do its part in stage the first part be on the metro so it be london travelwatch that will deal with the response it will then roll out the change to the rest of the network he know that because it be on an email send to he pay tribute to and thank people such as vinnie at chislehurst station who be actually very busy when come through this morning to get my rather late run southeastern train but we will leave that on one side do the minister accept that day be very short period for such an important consultation secondly one of the station name sundridge park do not have step free access to both platform it be staff currently in the ticket office who help people get on the train they put up the ramp and help passenger to negotiate the step will he give an undertaking that no staff will be remove until cast iron arrangement be in place for somebody to be in attendance on those station to assist people throughout all the hour that station be operate the change mean that some staff may be well deploy on the platform because that be where they be see most of the passenger and some of they need their help there may be other situation where it make more sense for that member of staff to be near where they be currently position because of the design of the station the idea be that each station be look at so that when member of the public decide to fill in the consultation they will get dropdown which will locate the station in which they be interested and then they can provide their comment the passenger group will then look to see whether what be propose will work if it do not that be different matter can give my hon friend the assurance that the train operator and the passenger group will make their determination on case by case basis where thing do not make sense those change will not just be put through to make for bad experience the announce closure of railway ticket office across greater manchester include at levenshulme and gorton station will be to the detriment of my constituent who depend on they just when we should be encourage travel by rail to reduce our carbon footprint this measure will push people away from our great british railway we should be try to make train travel easy cheap and more accessible so why be the government act against the interest of the public re emphasise that the aim of these measure be to redeploy staff who be currently underutilise and who be not see the passenger that they use to because passenger habit have change those staff will be free up to work in other area where they can not only sell the ticket to the passenger but also help they with information and cater for any particular accessibility need on the platform this be all about make for well passenger experience all can say to the hon member be that he have the consultation and he should complete it he will find that thing such as this happen in all walk of life and in train station as well manchester have look at use ticketless travel tyne wear metro have just do this and london underground have do it for year it actually work and it give well passenger experience and that be what be determined to see the train operator deliver through this change have huge concern about these plan as the minister know my hard press constituent try to get to work college or university from marsden or slaithwaite station and transit through huddersfield still face huge disruption on the transpennine route when the computer say no do he not agree that the good way for they to get advice on ticketing refund alternative route and when the next train be come be by speak to fully train staff in ticket office if give my station as an example we have one member of staff who be in ticket office most people already have their ticket for the reason have give only one in buy they from the ticket office they access the platform through gate and do not see any member of staff if there be delay and problem it be well for passenger to be alongside the member of staff on the platform to get that information rather than try to find they behind glass there be problem with the minister point about look to the future back in transport for the north of which be board member at the time be force to abandon its integrate smart ticketing programme after the government pull the funding be sure the minister will remember that from his time on the select committee that work would have help to digitise transport and create multi modal multi operator pay as you go travel on rail light rail and bus we think it be deeply flawed decision at the time and recent event have show that to be the case will he work with tfn and other to see whether any of that work can be reinstate have the great respect for the hon member and will certainly look at what more can be do we be keen to roll out more pay as you go there will be station by the end of the year that will have pay as you go in place where people can tap in and out that tend to be the future as we see with london underground those pilot be in place for the end of the year in the west midland and manchester recognise that do not cover the area he mention and be happy to work with he to see what more can be do come back to london underground this system have be in place for some year london underground do not have staff behind ticket office counter and believe it work well it have free those staff to come out into the station area as whole where they can give much well advice and understanding to passenger it work really well and that be why believe no labour mayor have ask for it to be reinstate resident in swindon have taste of thing to come yesterday when the ticket office be close and people be queue out of the door to use the wholly inadequate machine at the station the wi fi be unreliable as well if we be to proceed with this significant change the technology available to customer must be significantly well and we need to avoid situation where elderly customer who come to pick up an advance ticket have nobody to help they will the minister do everything he can work with the rail authority to ensure that resident do not face to quote the beatles again magical mystery tour when they come to swindon station will certainly do so with my right hon and learn friend and will share bit of experience that lead to want more in this direction need to get weekly travel card but could not get it online because it be not available go to the station but do not have photo with ask why be it the case that we still need photo when that weekly travel card be less than an avanti single be tell that the way it have be on the railway for year that why we do it that be not good enough have mobility so can walk up to charing cross to make that transaction or not make it and then leave but for other who do not it do not work for they at all can give he the assurance that alongside this programme be strong exercise to make all product accessible from machine and online be already accessible but we need to get the full suite of product so that people do not have to queue in the manner he have just describe although these station office closure be in england they have implication for scottish passenger many in my constituency myself include never mind those in the borders and elsewhere in southern scotland access service through station in northern england in berwick and elsewhere that be not just matter of choice but often matter of necessity it be require because of the pan uk service timetable from lner tpe or crosscountry all of which be sign off by the dft what discussion be take place with the scottish government or with scottish passenger representative to ensure that the right of those north of the border who be impact by this change will be protect will be look to speak to the scottish executive in scotland similar proposal have as understand it be roll out to number of ticket station by scotrail want to assess whether that be mandate from the executive will certainly be have chat with they to see what lesson can be learn give that scotland appear to have go before england in that regard may take this opportunity to welcome the extension of contactless payment to berkhamsted and tring in south west hertfordshire declare an interest as local commuter from one of those station although this initiative on rail ticket office will in my eye help more traveller can my hon friend reassure the house that additional support will remain for those who require help such as the elderly and the disabled yes can thank my hon friend for his point know that he have busy station and will want to ensure that his constituent be look after the very first meeting that have when we be look at the train operator proposal be with disability and access group and age concern group want to work with they still do to find out what individual characteristic of the design may work for some but not for other can give he the assurance that we will continue to support those who have the great vulnerability firmly believe that take people out from behind glass and put they into area where they can be well access will mean that they will be able to give passenger the great help make for well rail experience the minister say that he have engage with relevant disabled people organisation but there have be widespread opposition to ticket office closure from such organisation include disability rights uk the national federation of the blind transport for all royal national institute of blind people royal national institute for deaf people guide dogs and scope the minister think that take expert staff out of station ticket office and put they on the platform will help people but how will people know which member of staff to go to for the help they need ticket office mean that people know where to go to get that help if those staff be to be redeploy there will not be single redundancy will there minister have funny feeling that these proposal will go down not like yellow submarine but like lead balloon have state the position with regard to redundancy deal be on the table but the rmt will not give it to its member to make determination it include commitment to no compulsory redundancy until december it be for the rmt to decide whether it wish to get that protection in place will say the same thing to the hon member that have say previously have work with those group they be the first meet and be at the forefront of my mind in ensure that this work from passenger perspective if they want to reach out to member of staff for any reason they will do so and member of staff will because they be great member of staff signpost they to somebody else all member of staff must have the requisite training and they do have great faith in our railway workforce to continue look after passenger believe that these change will bring more benefit in that regard thank the minister for meet yesterday to discuss the propose closure of darlington book office also meet david horne yesterday afternoon to discuss that issue remain deeply concerned that our mainline station which be currently receive million of expansion investment will be leave without booking office the elderly disabled and vulnerable rely on help from our ticket office and if station have barrier that help need to be in front of those barrier not behind they ticket machine and app have cut off time make purchase impossible in the minute run up to train leaving will my hon friend look into that problem will he assure the house that there be proper consultation and that some ticket office can be save will he make it clear that representation can be make by letter and not just by email yes the way in which the ticketing and settlement agreement process work mean that anyone can access it online but they can also write detail will be available at station and indeed online explain how people can write through to make their point about their station be grateful to my hon friend for meet and for do so in constructive manner whereby he be able to give example of his concern include ticket not be available within minute of travel have take that point away because it form part of the catalogue of change that want to see the remain of ticket that can not be purchase for that reason should be reduce towards invite all right hon and hon member who can give other example to get in contact with as well because will take those problem away and look at get they fix the hon member for east worthing and shoreham tim loughton be right sometimes it be just too complicated to purchase ticket without use ticket office recently have that experience and buy my ticket from the ticket office be cheap than if have purchase it from the machine be afraid that the beatles analogy he start be right he get ticket to ride and he do care be not even aware that have start beatles analogy actually this be more important than joke about music this be about reassure passenger that we can deliver well experience but also an experience that they be very familiar with in term of the other transaction they make across the retail space more and more people be do that online and they start do it online by be teach how to do it the idea be that ticket staff who be currently behind glass not see those passenger will help to deliver that and ensure that those passenger have well experience and do not need to queue up next time because they can do it in seamless manner where that operation do not exist because of the machine we be look to upgrade will take any example he have to ensure that passenger get the good price but can do it online or via machine staff at kettering railway station be superb they be friendly polite efficient and dedicate to simply outstanding customer service give that kettering be one of the station potentially affect will the rail minister encourage rail passenger in kettering to take part in the public consultation promote by east midlands railway can he confirm that if the change go through passenger who turn up at kettering railway station with cash to buy ticket will be able to do so yes can give my hon friend the assurance that cash purchase would remain across the network if there be machine that be not work for cash passenger can enter the train safe in the knowledge that they can then purchase their ticket on the train or at the end of their journey there be number of station that be not part of the current consultation and they will tend to be the end point where passenger will find busy station can absolutely give he that assurance my hon friend mention the staff we be look at the ticket office as place that people be not access any more but the ticketing staff be brilliant all we want to do be utilise they more so that they can see more people and use their expertise passenger want their ticket office staff to be more accessible so that they can gain that expertise and that be exactly why we want to put they in the place where the passenger be be bit worried the minister keep say that staff be not utilise and that people be not access ticket office can tell he that in hull last year nearly ticket be sell from the ticket office that be one ticket every minute we have go through year of bad management with transpennine at hull paragon station this look like another downgrading of facility for passenger we have hear about the effect it will have on the elderly the disabled and the vulnerable can the minister just for once put the travel public first be put the travel public first when make these point what the right hon lady and other can not deny despite say it can not be believe be that year ago one in three ticket be sell across the ticket office counter because people be not purchase as much online or through machine now it be that demonstrate that ticket office staff be not be utilise fully we want to utilise they in well manner redeploying staff where they be not as busy as they be and could be well utilise and have more rewarding job be what happen across the retail sector the railway should be no different anyone who have experience the long queue from the machine and the ticket office at my local train station of leigh on sea sometimes it go out of the office and around the block on monday morning and sometimes on saturday will know why have be campaign for contactless ticketing to be extend to leigh on sea and chalkwell station ever since arrive in this place as such be personally delighted however innovation must never be use as an excuse to exclude any of my constituent or deliver bad service the blind and partially sighted such as the wonderful jill allen king obe can not access the touchscreen ticket machine and need person to help they buy that ticket but that person do not need to be behind glass can the minister assure that there will always be somebody available at leigh on sea and chalkwell ticket station to help the blind and partially sight the elderly and anyone else who need help yes any currently staff station will not become unstaffed as result of these change as have say of station do not have ticket office staff but if the station that my hon friend have mention be currently staff they will not become unstaffed my hon friend reference guide dog be very grateful for the meeting have with the guide dogs team because we know that when it come to mobility and accessibility issue what may work for some do not work for everyone sight loss be particular example of that so be very keen to continue to work with guide dogs to reassure my hon friend constituent that they will always get the help they need at her local station have several rail ticket office in my constituency stockport heaton chapel and brinnington the minister will know because have raise it with he frequently that heaton chapel and brinnington do not have disabled access so be not convince by the notion that this government be look to deliver more for passenger and do not think my constituent be convince either the ticket office at all three of those station stockport brinnington and heaton chapel seem to be earmark for closure and the people who work in those ticket office will be worry some people work on the railway they will be worry that the government be run the industry into the ground so urge the minister to rethink this proposal twenty one day be an absolutely outrageous period of time for consultation again point to the accessibility stat there be increase in the number of passenger who need assistance at station so it surely make sense to free up people who be work behind glass and be unable to provide that assistance people who may not be as utilise because few passenger be purchase ticket in that manner those people can then go and assist the passenger who need that help the most which be at the forefront of these change very much welcome the announcement that gillingham and rainham ticket office will be keep open and pay tribute to the fantastic staff in gillingham and rainham across the board constituent have raise with the need of an age population and the elderly accept the need for innovation and adaption but whether it be bank or seek repeat prescription service be go online and the elderly be find it difficult to access face to face service regard transport and get advice and support at public train station can the minister please ensure that face to face provision be always available for our elderly resident yes thank my hon friend for his question hope that these change will lead to more face to face interaction because those who work on the railway and provide such brilliant help information and reassurance for passenger will be more likely to be in the place where those passenger be locate southeastern be do its consultation in stage the current part be for the metro side of southeastern after which it will be roll out far but can give my hon friend that assurance my constituent and be get bit feed up of everything be push online because as we have hear today it do not work for everyone however want to ask the minister what he be go to do to help operator deal with this change merseyrail for example do not accept ticket on phone and there have be plenty of example of people who buy through ticket online be fin because they have not be able to produce physical ticket be the minister go to do an assessment of operator capacity to deal with this issue and give they some financial support to make that change we will certainly be work with the train operator to ensure that passenger be not inconvenience as mention of station do not have ticket office right now and people still purchase their ticket and get on board however if member of the public be not able to purchase ticket for whatever reason include in station that do not have ticket office perhaps because the machine be not operate there will be means to ensure that they be not inconvenience obviously the change could be roll out far so will make sure that train operator be fully gear towards that end and that passenger be not inconvenience in the manner that the hon gentleman have describe give he that assurance of course it be always healthy to carry out review to make positive change but have to say that be deeply concerned to hear that northern be consider close the ticket office in keighley and ilkley be yet to be convince that these change will have positive impact on disabled passenger elderly passenger those with accessibility issue and of course those who want to carry out more complex transaction one in six people carry out such transaction at those two station high than the national average will the minister meet so that can express my concern but will he also reiterate to the house that this be consultation and that there be no do deal and urge people to comment and give their view to the consultation can give my hon friend that assurance would certainly be delighted to meet he and any other hon and right hon member who wish to meet to discuss this issue again let set out the process which have be trigger by the train operator set out their plan there be period of time day for member of the public to respond there be then day period for the transport group london travelwatch and transport focus to assess what be be say at each station if they be not convinced they will work with the train operator and if that mechanism can not reach an agreement on these matter it will go to its ultimate stage which be with the secretary of state many member have mention the impact on those with accessibility problem and would urge the minister to take that into account for my constituent in edinburgh west the closure announce by lner crosscountry avanti west coast and transpennine all affect station on the main line route can the minister tell we how he be go to address the perception which be grow that people be not be encourage on to public transport and that accessibility to the south of the united kingdom from scotland particularly from edinburgh be be undermine as part of this process number of station will not be include they tend to be big hub station as we call they so edinburgh be not include in that regard may be in danger of repeat myself but the reason sit down on the very first day this come up with those who represent disability and accessibility group be that be concerned they would feel that such change may not be positive for they want to work with they to understand how we can make this change positive and how we can deploy more staff into the space where they will be able to access they more than they can right now continue to work with those group and give the hon member the assurance that that process will remain of course after the consultation and at the end point all the current accessibility requirement will have to be meet under these proposal as they be under the exist set up first absolutely understand and respect what my hon friend and next door neighbour be look to achieve through these innovation but he will not be surprised that have already have deluge of concerned constituent get in touch who be feel that they be be design out and be set to be disenfranchise this follow hard on the change to car parking at the station which now require specific app have already have assurance from southern that there will be assistance for passenger at eastbourne from the first train to the last train under the propose change there be long ticket assistance hour than ticket office hour so at face value this may represent an improvement and an extension of support however can only imagine the complex and quite convoluted conversation at ticket machine that will have to take place about journey planning and the long line of other passenger wait to access service with which they be super fluent the consultation be for day which be very short period of time intend to make significant contribution to that on behalf of the very many people who will not know how or will not feel empower to do so will the minister encourage operator to accept that order can just say that it might be worth put in for an adjournment debate the question must be short can give my hon friend and neighbour that assurance again would encourage hon member to look at the train operator in their area to see what the plan would mean number of train operator have decide to take number of people from behind the glass counter who be all work the same hour and flex their hour they have the ability to do so which mean there will be wide coverage over the day one plan be particularly interested to see be with late night coverage where there be no such coverage at the moment these change will actually provide that coverage it be coverage not just to sell ticket on the platform and provide help and guidance but to provide safety reassurance an information point and the greeting that people want if they be to be able to use their railway that be why be passionate advocate of these change and believe they will make for well experience for the passenger over long period of the day the minister may remember our meeting on december with southeastern in that meeting ask whether there be any plan to close any ticket office the response from southeastern be no be the minister privy to any conversation or plan regard ticket office closure before our meeting will look back on our note from that meeting and work out what be say the train operator have put forward these proposal because they be require to look at their coverage and at how they need to adapt and modernise to give well passenger experience have of course have discussion with they and one of the example that have give over the course of the past three quarter of an hour be that of ensure that more ticket option be put online and on to machine also make sure that my first discussion be with accessibility group because want they to be able to give their view yes have be involve in the process and will look back at the minute from our meeting in december assess what be say and write back to she let we go to the centre of the railway strangford strangford be the centre of the world mr speaker be the minister aware that not everyone be completely computer literate or have access to printer for example my year old mother have the capacity to go to the train station for day trip but she absolutely can not go online because she be cash person where in this decision be the consideration of people such as my mother and other of that generation surely customer care and satisfaction have to be key to any decision the hon gentleman be absolutely right customer care be at the forefront of this change at the moment customer can go to station and purchase ticket from an office behind the glass but only of ticket be purchase in that manner that mean that other member of the public often do not receive any help or journey assistance in other part of the station and do not get the full benefit of that member of staff these change be all about give passenger service this be not just about buy ticket with member of staff with they at the machine show passenger what to do but about help in all other regard have great passion for the railway love this job and love the railway all the staff who work on they do an amazing job that be why be spend three week of my summer visit all part of the system to learn more assess more and reassure more recognise members concern and hope have answer as many question as can for those who want to meet because they want to understand more be happy to do that because want every hon member to have everything they need to ensure that this change be positive for our passenger hong kong pro democracy activist urgent question to ask the foreign secretary if he will make statement on the warrant and bounty issue against pro democracy activist by hong kong national security police as the foreign secretary set out on monday in response to this late egregious action in hong kong we will not tolerate any attempt by the chinese authority to intimidate individual in the uk the uk will always defend the universal right to freedom of expression and stand up for those who be target simply for exercise that right we strongly object to the national security law that china impose on hong kong include its extraterritorial reach and declare it breach of the legally binding sino british joint declaration when beijing impose it on hong kong in let be clear that law have no jurisdiction here in response to its imposition the government act quickly and decisively to suspend our extradition agreement with hong kong indefinitely we introduce bespoke immigration route for holder of british national overseas status and their immediate family member give nearly million people path to british citizenship we welcome the contribution that this grow diaspora make to life in the uk as we welcome the contribution of the diaspora with link to mainland china they be all safe to live here and exercise the same right and freedom that all uk resident enjoy three year on from the law imposition we have see how this opaque and sweeping law have undermine the liberty enshrine in the sino british joint declaration and in hong kong basic law it have see opposition stifle and dissent criminalise alternative voice across hong kong society have be all but extinguish and change to electoral rule have far erode the ability of hong kong people to be legitimately represent at all level of government hong kong governance right and social system be now close to mainland norm the foreign secretary make plain our view on hong kong with chinese vice president han zheng on may and at the un human rights council on february the hong kong authority be busy try to attract the world back to hong kong follow year of political disruption and covid it be hard to see how that will be successful while they continue to pursue citizen who come out on the street to do nothing more than to protest peacefully to protect their right we call on beijing to remove the national security law and for china and the hong kong authority to end the targeting of those who stand up for freedom and democracy we will continue to act as convening power bring together our international partner to stand up for the people of hong kong to call out violation of their right and freedom and to hold china to its international obligation finn lau christopher mung and nathan law be three incredibly brave individual who stand up for democratic value while the chinese communist party ride roughshod over they in hong kong they seek refuge in the uk because they think they would be safe chillingly beijing be try to do all it can to interfere in what should be their safe haven the government have rightly say that they will not tolerate this intimidation but be afraid their word ring rather hollow the danger to those individual on these shore feel all too present we see it in southampton in may we see it in manchester at the consulate last october and we see it in the report secret police station we need more than just condemnation we need action most urgently that mean ensure that these individual be safe tragically finn and christopher have say that they do not feel safe they have ask for meeting with the foreign secretary can we have confirmation that that will happen can the minister clarify that it be illegal to bounty hunt in the uk and that the government will actively prosecute those who do do she agree with lord patten that it be now time for those uk judge who still remain on the hong kong court of final appeal to resign over this will the government reconsider the foreign secretary plan visit to beijing in the light of this blatant escalation by china of transnational repression finally will the government at last take meaningful action against those involve in these warrant as well as those intent on snuff out the flame of democracy in hong kong it be staggering that after everything that have happen we be yet to sanction single individual our ally act year ago we have exist obligation under the joint declaration yet too often this conservative government choose constructive ambiguity rather than firm line what be clear on all side of this house be that it be time for that to change know the house will understand that as matter of long stand policy we do not comment on the detail of operational matter hope colleague will understand the risk of compromise the integrity of security arrangement for those who be here in the uk as say we will continue to afford they the opportunity for freedom of speech and expression discussion be ongoing but be not able at the moment to give more detail hope the hon lady will understand that be in regular contact as be official with the minister for security and the home office on this matter in relation to the question on judge they be private citizen we therefore must allow they to reach their own decision in that particular situation however as say will repeat this as many time as anyone wish to think that all of we in the house and everyone in the uk be clear that the uk will not tolerate any attempt to intimidate or silence individual here on uk soil and that we will do all we can to ensure their safety call the chair of the foreign affairs committee the bounty place on the head of those flee chinese communist party repression and autocracy be not just outrageous but blatant violation of international law they also expose the lie of xi jinping when he say that he be respect freedom within hong kong we must take stand against transnational repression to protect british national and those seek refuge in the uk only last week write to hsbc to argue against how it be appallingly deny hongkongers access to their own pension give that three people seek refuge in the uk have now have bounty put on their head have the foreign secretary or my right hon friend the minister call in the chinese ambassador this week in response if not why not wholeheartedly agree with my hon friend the chairman of the foreign affairs committee that these bounty be extraterritorial and therefore have no right or legitimacy here as have state we must always protect and allow the voice of those here with we to maintain that freedom of expression we speak regularly with chinese colleague in fact just few week ago have meeting with the visit economic secretary and raise these issue that be obviously before this bounty be raise we will continue to work closely include with the embassy on number of matter include this one call the shadow minister congratulate the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran on bring forward this important question the issuing of these arrest warrant be far repressive step by the hong kong government the national security law under which the warrant have be issue be itself serious breach of the legally binding sino british agreement that set the term for govern hong kong until beijing attempt to bully and intimidate those who have already flee grow repression in hong kong be symbol of the chinese government attempt to stifle any further dissent and undermine basic freedom in the territory they deserve clear and unified condemnation and it be pleasing to see so many hon member in the house show that give that three of the eight name individual be base here in the uk the move by the authority in hong kong will far compound the fear hold by the british base hong kong community that they be still not free of the long arm of chinese state repression we should be proud of the uk role in welcome people here from hong kong to all our community we can not tolerate effort to harass or intimidate those who have come to the uk flee political persecution the minister will know that protection for hongkongers have be raise repeatedly by labour the foreign secretary dismissive response at the last foreign commonwealth and development office oral question be simply not good enough will repeat the question ask by the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns have the minister meet today or do she intend to meet today representative of the chinese government here in the uk to underline the feeling in this parliament secondly will she reassess whether it be in order for sanction to be place on lead member of the hong kong government thirdly will the government grow backbone and live up to our moral and legal obligation to hongkongers both here in the uk and in hong kong the whole house clearly agree that any attempt by any foreign power to intimidate harass or indeed harm individual or our community in the uk will not be tolerate this be an insidious threat to our democracy and to those fundamental human right that the uk always stand up for across the world as say home office official work closely with the fcdo and other departments to ensure that the uk be and continue to be safe and welcome place for those who choose to settle here as say in my statement the bno route be now available to up to million and so far about those number might not be entirely correct have take up the opportunity the door be very much open will also highlight that the security minister direct the defend democracy taskforce to review the uk approach to transnational repression to ensure that we have the most robust and join up response both across government and with law enforcement should sadly we need to make use of that extend bounty and arrest warrant to people live in this country who have escape hong kong be particularly chilling extension of the chinese communist party tentacle across sovereign border frankly tough word need to be follow by tough action just say that we will not tolerate this or we will not tolerate this again be no deterrent will my right hon friend now admit that she sit down with liu jianchao the head of the chinese government international liaison department the chief dissident snatcher who have role in issue the warrant and be photograph sit next to he smile along with five other hon member of this house be bad idea it send out entirely the wrong message to the chinese government which be why they think they can get away with it when will see real sanction the calling back of judge and some real implication for what china be do rather than tough word that mean nothing as the foreign secretary set out in his recent speech on china we consider it important to engage with our chinese counterpart where appropriate to protect uk interest and to build those relationship therefore be comfortable sit down with liu jianchao for political dialogue when he visit at the invitation of the great britain china centre because believe it be important to have such conversation in every diplomatic relationship be frank be possible only if the party be in the room together colleague will be aware that be extremely frank with the gentleman in question he be able to hear directly from an fcdo minister our many concern about sanction mp and about hong kong the issue we be discuss today and other be raise we consider that an important way to maintain the conversation on this late very worrying situation on bounty most importantly we want to ensure the safety security and freedom of expression of those who choose to be here so that they be able to express their view clearly on these matter as colleague know when the national security law be bring in we declare that it be breach of the sino british joint declaration we continue to raise those issue to see whether they can be resolve but we do not feel confident at the moment call the scottish national party spokesperson use the chinese national security law authority be seek to prosecute critic of hong kong anywhere in the world extraterritorial warrant with outrageous bounty have now be issue for eight pro democracy activist former lawmaker and legal scholar who have be attack for speak out against chinese action and campaign for sanction at least three be know to live in the uk if catch they could face life sentence in china welcome the government suspension of the extradition treaty with hong kong but after the incident in manchester and southampton how can those pro democracy activist be protect what action be the government take to break up the secret police unit across the uk with china have break every single commitment and guarantee to hong kong what action will the government actually take against china have say it but be happy to reiterate colleague rightly have concern for the safety of those on british soil and we provide they that freedom of expression will not discuss ongoing operational matter but the fcdo and the home office be work closely together on these matter and will continue to do so be extremely disturbed to hear that his majesty revenue and customs be pass on detail of new bank account open by chinese people and hongkongers in the uk to the chinese government as part of anti money laundering effort will my right hon friend please work with the treasury to make sure that that loophole be not exploit by the chinese government put expose chinese people and hongkongers here in the uk in danger would be pleased to catch up with my hon friend after this urgent question to discuss that matter more fully absolutely will take it up with urgency there be clear and present danger from the chinese government not just to the citizen of hong kong but to citizen here in the united kingdom be it not about time that we realise the pernicious influence of china on this country and europe with china have so many investment and so much influence in this country be it not about time that we take sanction against it really rugged one because that be the only thing they will listen to when will the government act as colleague know we do not discuss potential future sanction as that could reduce their ability to have the impact we wish they to the minister say that the united kingdom will not tolerate these late egregious act and that they be real threat to human right note that she say she will not discuss future possible sanction but have be foreign office sanction minister may ask she this specific question look at the will of parliament will she ask the sanction team to consider whether give the real threat to human right the criterion pass by parliament have be meet and update the house within the next day it be always nice to have the chance to discuss sanction with former sanction minister it be one of the most extraordinarily complex but impactful tool that the fcdo have to make clear the uk view and direction will happily take my hon friend comment away the work be constant and ongoing we have more than double the team in the sanction directorate in the last year but we will not discuss any new sanction that might be bring forward will the minister tell the house what discussion she have have with the us and australia about co ordinate an interpol early warning system to protect pro democracy activist overseas official have regular conversation with ally and partner around the world they work with interpol to ensure that rule that need to be maintain be and to ensure that we can use international power to protect those here from extra territorial reach this recent development be yet another example of china outrageous disregard of fundamental human right and freedom one can hardly imagine how the decent honourable and brave young man nathan law be feel now young man have the privilege of meeting in this place he and other affect need to know that we be do everything we can to defend their freedom be sure our like minded international partner feel the same what be the uk do to show leadership follow this announcement and to work with our international partner to stand up for the people of hong kong call out this particular violation of their right and freedom and hold china to its international obligation my hon friend be always champion and strong voice thank she for the support she give to those who be feel under great strain some challenge remain we suspend our extradition agreement with hong kong in july but country have still not do so despite the national security law be bring in they include two european country czech republic and portugal and other include singapore malaysia the philippines south korea and india we continue to work closely with they to ask that they reconsider their position so that those who need to be able to maintain their freedom of expression in their country can do so safely my constituent carlos auyeung have write to about significant distress and fear in the hongkonger community cause by the exerting of extraterritorial enforcement on british soil say that it require immediate attention and action listen carefully to the minister response to my hon friend the member for hornsey and wood green catherine west and the chair of the select committee the hon member for rutland and melton alicia kearns both of whom ask she to call representative of the chinese embassy in london into the foreign office to dress they down about the matter she just do not answer their question will she answer it now so that the house can be well inform the foreign secretary have many meeting during the week will take away that question and be sure that foreign office ministers will have hear of the importance of these matter we will continue our ongoing discussion but we will also ensure that these concern which rightly be so clearly hear be include in our annual human right report which will be publish want to say next week but think the correct term be imminently just in case the printer do not produce it on time and in which china will sadly feature last thursday have the privilege of meet member of hong kong watch include representative of the bno who have recently come to settle in warrington what be very plain be the fear that they feel for the family member many of they elderly whom they have leave behind in hong kong they be now unable to return to see those family member they request that ask the minister to assure the house that she will continue to push for progress on human right in china and particularly in hong kong include the right to freedom of expression can she send that message to member of the bno community in warrington it be hearten to know that member on both side of the house be so closely involve with the bno who be come to the uk to make their new home here and thank my hon friend for his commitment to that can assure he that the government will continue to make clear our disagreement with in fact our shocked objection to the national security law and the impact it be have on freedom this clearly constitute dangerous escalation of beijing global war on dissent can the minister confirm that it be illegal to issue and pursue bounty in the uk and that the uk government will be actively seek the prosecution of anyone who aim to take they up and can she tell we what the uk government thinking be in relation to financial sanction target those in government in hong kong about which she have be less than clear during this session find it concern that she have also be less than clear about her intention in respect of meeting official and convey the deep unhappiness of members about this matter and our significant concern for hongkongers in the uk can of course confirm that extranational bounty have no validity here we have no extradition treaty with hong kong because we have suspend it indefinitely so there be no reach to those people here any attempt by foreign power to intimidate harass or harm individual in the uk will not be tolerate as have say the security minister be work through the defend democracy taskforce to review our approach and to ensure that we have all the robust tool that we need to protect those who be here last week meet constituent who be deeply concerned about the erosion of democracy in hong kong will the minister assure and the house that the uk will always defend the universal right to freedom of expression and stand up for those who be target in hong kong and around the world by china my hon friend be entirely right and give he that absolute assurance hope that when the human right report be publish shortly all those who wish to read it will see clearly just how seriously the uk take its obligation bounty for people be the stuff of film not the stuff of real life in this united kingdom however the despicable behaviour of the chinese communist party towards those who dare to dissent from its thinking and to request freedom and liberty have become the norm the world be unite alongside those from hong kong who espouse and wish to enjoy freedom of expression what further step can the house our government and our secretary of state take to support those hongkonger who live in the united kingdom we have moral obligation to speak up for they and not to be silent we continue to call on beijing to remove the national security law and indeed on the hong kong authority to end their targeting of those who stand up for freedom and democracy in the country the terrible step this week will simply ensure that we continue to make it clear categorically through our engagement in the uk and across our international partnership that we all stand for freedom of speech and expression for all citizen across hong kong business of the house will the leader of the house give we the forthcoming

report publish this morning on the right hon member for tamworth christopher pincher be shock and sadden at its finding and my thought and hope the thought of the whole house be with the victim as well as address the impact on they of the member behaviour the committee find that the action of the member significantly affect the public perception of this house be afraid to say that shamefully it appear that the conservative party protect and even promote he despite previous investigation into his conduct be concerned that the leader of the house do not announce motion to approve the committee report do hope that the government be not attempt to delay any possible by election will the leader of the house confirm that she will bring forward the motion as soon as possible that the government will recommend approve the report and its sanction and that the prime minister will show some backbone this time and actually condemn the action of the member if the member do not do the decent thing and resign will the leader of the house ensure that she allocate time with the speed and urgency that the activity require do she want to remind her week after week that sexual harassment be not acceptable to continue wish the england cricket team the good of luck as they start the third test against australia today on that note the remain legislation announce by the leader of the house up to the summer be more like series of dot ball where be the drive the government have huge majority and they be not do anything with it instead the prime minister be waste precious time on the floor of the house try to pass red meat for small group of right wing back benchers rather than new law that will actually help work people why do not the leader of the house announce the transport bill or the mental health bill which have be leave in limbo or the much need school bill which the government have now completely abandon where be the leasehold reform bill million of people around the country will be furious that the government have again fail to introduce long promise and much need leasehold reform that be conservative manifesto commitment and it have be promise by almost every housing secretary since so where be the bill labour force the government into commit to end the sale of new private leasehold and to replace exist one with commonhold our motion pass with majority of without

dispatch box to explain to leaseholder why he be drag his foot instead of scoring run the prime minister be run scared of scrutiny too weak to turn up to prime minister question he would not even try to bat away question on his fail record yesterday so call leader who can not even defend his own wicket any credible prime minister would accept the need for scrutiny and answer the question from colleague on behalf of the people we represent it be not just pmq though be it the prime minister barely make an appearance these day he do not show up or even give an opinion on his predecessor lie last month do notice that he manage to find time to watch the cricket so hope this speech might catch his attention can the leader of the house tell we whether the prime minister will stand up to the senior member of his own party who attempt to undermine and attack the democratic institution of this house and vote for the privileges committee motion on monday the public deserve to know what he think and they want prime minister who stand up for standard just like at lord on sunday the ball be dead it be the end of the over and we be head towards the end of the innings the tories have send

australian batsman but that be the england cricket team job in all seriousness we have see some awful scene this week particularly at the tennis it be particularly callous to interrupt sporting event which can turn the course of match and risk injury to player appreciate the connection between this selfish and productive group of people and the labour party coffer which might also explain why labour energy policy undermine our energy security and prosperity and the fact that labour have vote against every measure we have bring forward to end dangerous and disruptive protest hope we will see no more scene such as we have see at those sporting event and wish all those take part in this sport pack weekend good luck on our proposal for renter and for leasehold reform we remain committed to those and will update the house in the usual way turn to the very serious matter that the hon lady focus on standard let first make broad point the house know my view on these matter the only way we will improve the situation here be by recognise that we be not just one organisation but community of many process and the volume of standard body with separate entity and counting do not improve behaviour only cultural change will do that the key to that be deepen our understanding of the duty of care we have towards each other we be custodian of the trust and authority of this place have set out my intention to conclude my own assessment with external advice of where we need to focus in this place will make those finding available to the commission the hon lady and the committee on standards hold private session with the committee this week to tell it of my concern and suggest solution have also tell the committee and the speaker that think the independent complaints and

day ago on june before the debate on the hybrid holocaust memorial bill but after have come into the chamber write statement from minister be put in the library say that the estimate cost in one year have go up by more than twice the million that the government have already spend without achieve anything do the department think that be an appropriate way of put important information into the public domain when neither minister speak in the debate mention that increase of nearly million and no mp in the chamber know about it will the leader of the house ask the permanent secretary in that department to report this to the national audit office and ask it to update the report it make year ago thank my hon friend for his question he should know because think the letter would have be copy to his office that have write to the department on that matter and shall certainly again make sure it have hear his comment today call the scottish national party spokesperson thank the leader for

present and future have make and will make to our collective health and wellbee as nation last week ask the leader of the house to make time for debate on why six police force in england continue to remain in special measure and on why nhs staff sickness in england have hit record high there be alas no sign of any debate forthcoming on those issue can add to that list request for debate on why

they should explore option for alternative model of governance include explore their nordic connection there have be some suggestion that they might wish to rejoin norway and exploit those historical link it be easy for member on the snp benches to see the attraction of be part of small prosperous energy rich independent country of million people so the only question be the constitutional mean by

service again thank everyone who take part in that the hon gentleman quite often criticise for be well prepared for our exchange be former girl guide and believe in that sort of thing but it be very easy to prepare to answer his question because they be usually focus on one thing which be not an issue that be of any relevance to the people he represent if he be less focused on the cause of independence and more focused on their need we might have more clarity on the confusion and concern about the new policy on fishing free zone this week announce by the snp coalition partner which will increase those area to give his brief he might like to look into that if be well prepared be the qualification for person do my job surely it be self delusion and lack of self awareness that be the necessary condition to do the job of opposition members on the snp benches because only an snp spokesman would come to this session to ask question about police investigation and police performance perhaps that self delusion be hard to sustain in the wake of ten of police investigation there be more news this week of miss account frustrate the snp auditor from be able to complete their task and of exactly how much scottish taxpayer money have be spend by the snp on just one of their foreign jolly for they blow nearly not content with stay in sharm el sheikh and fly back to scotland they also

last week the home office tell that application be not receive but clearly this be press matter as there will be festival over the summer so will ask the home secretary to convene meeting before the rise of the house so that the policy on this can be clear suggest that any festival that want to run the service be give the information it need so that such licence can be give in timely way it would be well to get inflation down by expand supply rather than hit mortgage holder again to get they to spend less can we have an urgent statement before the summer recess from the government on measure to expand our domestic output of food oil and gas and industrial product with suitable incentive and facilitation thank my right hon friend for that very helpful suggestion he will know that as

for debate on my vat burn campaign which have cross party support both in this place and in the scottish parliament to reform the vat charge on sunscreen and to raise awareness on melanoma and non

duty may bring in around billion but the cost that alcohol have on our health service and society can be anything from billion to billion which be sure the leader of the house will agree make no sense

and life be be lose thank the hon gentleman for raise this important matter which he may also wish to raise with the health secretary on july he will know that there have be huge push in part of the

representative around official report july vol then read in yesterday financial times that the government be consult on increase in legal aid fee for lawyer work on deportation case to attract solicitor to take on such case and tackle the backlog of asylum claim would it not be helpful if we ask ministers not to weaponise asylum case lawyer and so on but to focus on measure that will reduce the backlog as the hon gentleman will know we be focus on measure that will reduce the backlog we be also focus on measure that will target the finite resource this country have to help genuine asylum seeker those in need and refugee many of whom be languish in camp across the world that be why we have bring forward legislation which have recently be debate in the house of lords we will bring it

palm oil production can my right hon friend outline what the government be do to reduce our reliance on palm oil and will she find time for we to have debate on how we can help to save orangutan and their habitat my hon friend will know that we have number of incredible forestry programme around the world there be off the top of my head one forest habitat in indonesia that be large than this country that be particularly support habitat with large colony of orangutan whose existence would otherwise be threaten some of the forestry programme that we have have in place in this country and around the world be decade old that be testament to the impact that this nation have have on those matter the government have make absolutely sure that we will continue to have that impact globally billion of pound be waste on useless personal protective equipment and there be no plan in place to build stockpile for future pandemic in addition there be no proper record of billion of nhs test and trace purchase and no have simply write off billion of covid supply in the past two year democracy be about accountability so will the leader of the house make statement set out who she think should be hold accountable for that colossal appalling and eye water waste of taxpayer money first the covid inquiry be under way at the moment it will determine what particular thing it will look into we in this house have scrutiny through select committees most notably the public accounts committee of all those matter secondly product that be buy in those circumstance have shelf life as member of parliament who spend pretty much most of the first year of the pandemic on the phone to all colleague every day can tell the hon lady that the sentiment of this house and the members in it be that we move heaven and earth to get as much ppe as we could to the frontline for nhs and care staff would rather answer question from she about value for money than apologise to she because we do not take those action at the time recent freedom of information request have reveal that in the past seven year labour run rotherham metropolitan borough council have spend just on dinnington town with population of about that equate to about per person per year by contrast in the march budget the conservative government award dinnington million to rejuvenate its high street do the leader of the house agree that only the conservatives can reverse the decade of labour lead decline in dinnington and that anyone who care about dinnington should vote for julz hall the conservative candidate in the upcoming dinnington ward by election my hon friend be right that the government be put our money where our mouth be we need to give community the capital they need to regenerate and to attract further investment wish julz who understand initiate the plan to save the high street and be great force for good in secure that bid all the good in the forthcoming election other candidate be available who be sure will be list on the bbc website will assume that the hon gentleman ask for debate or statement do good as the long serve member on the labour benches have see some real change in my year here one thing that be disturb at the moment be the government propensity to put quite junior ministers forward to answer very important question do not know whether member of the cabinet be on holiday but could we see more of they this year mark the anniversary not just of the nhs but of the world health organisation many of the challenge we face in health will be worldwide pandemic can we have debate to consider intently how we can improve the performance of the who perhaps it need more resource but let we not take it for grant the hon gentleman will know that take great deal of interest in ensure that those in departments be they parliamentary clerk minister or permanent secretary understand what this house need and the respect that need to be afford to it from personal experience know that even the most senior ministers those in the great office of state be frequently here the home secretary be prime example shall ensure that on our regular training we convey the hon gentleman sentiment the backbench business committee be just one mean by which the hon gentleman may secure the debate he seek shall certainly ensure that the secretary of state hear his remark labour lead cheshire east council have propose to close all library for at least one and half weekday every week in my constituency that will affect library in alsager sandbach holmes chapel middlewich and congleton do the leader of the house agree that member of congleton town council and other be absolutely right to oppose that inexplicable proposal bear in mind its negative and indeed potentially damaging impact not only on young people learning but on many of my least well off constituent who depend on library for welfare check bus application computer use for job application to read the local paper and many other everyday essential order it be quite important to ask the leader of the house in such way that it be relevant to the business rather than just ask whether she agree with the comment that have be make remind my hon friend that dluhc question be on monday it will be jam pack agree with she that be crazy solution to problem of constrain resource why have an asset with all those overhead just to shut it for part of the week encourage her council to be bit more entrepreneurial by generate income work with partner ask for business support and do the many other thing that council up and down the country have do to secure such vital service include in some case community asset transfer hope that in addition to secure debate and ask question on monday she can also get her council to buck up wholesale energy price for supplier may have return to normal but bonar yarns in my dundee constituency which have produce specialist textile and supply some of the world large sporting venue for more than year be face closure because of what look like price gouging the company change ownership early this year but understand that the exist energy supplier brook green supply have quote increase without adequate explanation and despite no increase in usage many business be be hold to ransom with high energy cost can we have an urgent statement from the uk government on what reform they be consider to end the corporate daylight robbery by energy company which be put business and community at risk the hon gentleman will know that we take that type of matter seriously he will know that because of the finding of the competition and markets authority we be introduce pump watch scheme to use fairfueluk terminology for it and ensure that supplier be price fairly so that where the wholesale price drop the change be pass on to in that case motorist he will know that we take those matter seriously give that the relevant department be not come to the

taxpayer think that be something we could all agree on the motherhood pay penalty mean that mother with two child take home less income than woman without child report by the fawcett society show that the pay penalty hit black and minoritise woman the hard with the intersection of sexism and racism compounding disadvantage there be more than enough evidence of the need to take serious action to

employee can we have debate in government time on the implication for woman of the uk government refusal to do those thing thank the hon lady for her question but do have to correct she because the government equalities office and other area of government be do those thing we have have pioneer work on highlight the gender pay gap and huge amount of work go on in the race disparity audit so those

no encouragement to be there he will be there he will also know that early this year the foreign secretary launch the international woman and girl strategy give that ongoing work an update we will

social housing pm beg to move that this house have consider build safety and social housing six year on from the night of june we remember all those affect by the fire at grenfell tower six year on month on life lose and thousand more bereaved family and resident in the north kensington community whose grief endure know that speak for not just but right hon and hon member across this house when say that those most affected by the fire be never far from our thought and prayer it be particular honour to welcome survivor and bereaved family member to the gallery for today debate include representative from grenfell united and grenfell next of kin it take determination and courage to come and be count and to remain so resolute like so many in this house have be humble to meet grenfell community member and know the power of their testimony each have their own compelling and move story to tell and their own harrowing and unforgettable perspective on event that night they have be unite in their fight to uncover the truth and bring about change and hope that we in government and across this house have be able to listen and to learn from they want to take this opportunity as do at every opportunity to apologise again for the role of the government and other in failing that allow the horrify event of june to unfold as you will hear today madam deputy speaker share their determination to see the truth uncover make change happen and have all those responsible hold to account so that justice be deliver the need for all of we in government to learn from and never repeat the scandalous mistake of grenfell could not be more profound be clear hope when first become secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities that discharge my responsibility to those most affected by this tragedy by honour their love one with worthy legacy be my absolute priority that mean put right some of the many wrong that the bereaved survivor and immediate community have have to face and endure be pleased to be join in that mission by my ministerial colleague the minister of state for housing and planning my hon friend the member for redditch rachel maclean and my noble friend baroness scott of bybrook who be first appoint by my predecessor to the independent grenfell recovery taskforce in the immediate aftermath of the fire her long experience of represent the need of all resident as former council leader have be invaluable and be deeply grateful to jane for her work be also pleased that today the house have the opportunity to both honour the grenfell community and continue to hold the government to account as say last year want this debate to take place annually so that there be no let up in the opportunity for scrutiny of this government action and those of future government it be vital that everyone across this house can satisfy themselves that the government be meet their commitment and lasting change be be make like all government we should be judge on our action not just our word and all actor include this government must take on board some quite tough lesson to ensure that such tragedy never happen again it be clear that the past action of many fall well short of the standard that the grenfell community the bereaved survivor and local resident deserve that be why with my department remain wholly committed to support the independent grenfell tower inquiry through which we may understand the truth about the circumstance lead to the tragedy and see justice deliver for the grenfell community that community be unforgivably and inexcusably let down evidence give before the inquiry and reporting by distinguished journalist such as peter apps point out that in the month and year before the fire people concern go unheard and ignore and in the day and week after the fire the institution that be suppose to help victim be find want hope that uncover the circumstance that lead to the fire will bring at least some relief and comfort with the inquiry have conclude its oral hearing last year sir martin moore bick and his inquiry team be now prepare their final report and recommendation also importantly the independent metropolitan police investigation into potential criminality continue in parallel it be of the utmost importance to community member that that investigation be able to operate as they seek the justice that they deserve the government have accept in principle all the recommendation in the grenfell tower inquiry phase report so far we have implement of the recommendation focus on central government significant amount have be do but there be more to do the remain five recommendation be in progress and continue to work closely with the home secretary to make sure that we deliver on all of they particularly the recommendation to mandate personal emergency evacuation plan peep for disabled resident one feature of the grenfell tragedy be the way in which those live with disability be particularly vulnerable as the secretary of state have say it be now six year since the grenfell fire but new datum gather by inside housing show that only fraction of high rise social housing block few than one in five have be retrofit with sprinkler or fire alarm lack of funding be key reason for that so can the government really claim that they be do everything possible to prevent another grenfell when people be still live in high rise without those protection be very grateful to the hon gentleman for raise that know he have lifelong interest in social housing and care very deeply about the fate of tenant in those condition would never say that we have do everything that we should do believe that significant progress have be make not least in remediate high rise building and make sure that everyone who should play their part will say little bit more about it in moment but he be right to focus on how when it come to fire safety it be not just the external cladding which be of course the principal cause of the fire at grenfell but internal safety measure that we need to look at have progress be fast enough no do resource need to be allocate yes so do agree with he that more require to be do be reflect just before that very helpful intervention on the particular fate that disabled resident face at grenfell and the vital importance of make sure that we have personal emergency evacuation plan in place hope to be able to update the house with the home secretary in due course as the hon gentleman have point out broad range of issue affect build safety overall of course one finding of the grenfell tower inquiry will inevitably be recognition of systemic failure in the way in which we deal with building safety because the public resident and indeed the government put their faith in the building and approving of high rise block and in the construction product be supply for those high rise block we believe that the law be be follow and that the right thing be be do but this trust be misplace and abuse industry profit as we now know be prioritise over safety and the safeguard that should have be observe be flout we be now with the help of all party in this house fix the break building safety system and we be seek redress have be clear that those responsible those at the apex of the building industry must take responsibility as of today total of developer include the large house builder have sign our developer remediation contract and be grateful to they for show such leadership all developer that have sign the contract now have legal duty to get on with remediation as be sure the secretary of state know one key recommendation of the hackitt review be to set up the building safety regulator so he will understand the concern when amendment have be table to the levelling up and regeneration bill give the secretary of state power to scrap the building safety regime via statutory instrument if the no thing that the state need to do be to keep its citizen safe can he explain why those amendment have be table and under what circumstance he would use that power to get rid of that regulator without proper scrutiny in this house absolutely would never do anything to undermine the position of the building safety regulator indeed have be work with colleague in the department for work and pensions and the health and safety executive to make sure that we have the right team in place the right person as regulator and the right power for the regulator all the legislation that we be bring forward not just the previous building safety legislation but the levelling up and regeneration bill be design to strengthen the hand of the regulator would be delighted to talk to the hon lady in great detail outside this house to provide reassurance the secretary of state talk about the remediation of building he know the interest of company in glasgow south west that do great work in remove cladding and so on but it have come across stumble block with insurance company and insurance premium could he say bit about the discussion he have have with the insurance industry to make sure that this work be do yes the hon gentleman make very important point in talk about the share responsibility that so many have have stress that the government have responsibility as do the construction sector and insurance company certainly do it be the case that insurance company unfortunately be charge premium that believe be way above what they should be that be impede the capacity of individual to get on with their life and it be impose cost that be unnecessary the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend the member for north east derbyshire lee rowley who be the minister responsible for the implementation of the building safety regime have be talk to the association of british insurers individual insurance company and insurance broker to try to make progress there have not be as much as would like but again will update the house in due course as know my hon friend will as well mention developer and it be the case that developer be take responsibility for all the necessary work to address life critical fire safety defect in building of over metre high that they either develop or refurbish in england during the year to april there be more than building in scope that be unsafe and the cost will be billion again be grateful to developer for shoulder that responsibility developer must also keep resident inform about the progress of these work as know from my own constituency it be absolutely vital that resident be involve in that process recognise that the government have start to do some work particularly on acm clad on building over metre high but it have be very slow some of the work on to high metre building be some distance away that be really worry for homeowner who be trap in those property can the minister look at how that could be speed up have work be do to look at different type of cladding because different type of clad other than acm be also unsafe the hon lady raise two important point yes absolutely we be now move to accelerate support for those live in building between and metre high the cladding scheme we be bring forward have all the energy that homes england the under secretary of state for levelling up housing and communities my hon friend member for north east derbyshire lee rowley and the department can deploy behind it on her second point of course it be the case that while acm be responsible for this particularly horrific tragedy and also previously responsible for fire in the gulf and elsewhere there be other form of cladding that be also risk and that we need to remove and have be remove also pay tribute to the family and the survivor who have come here today while the secretary of state be rightly focus on the systemic failure that lead to this disaster and on the responsibility of the big player the agency and indeed the government themselves in the lead up to the disaster and in the immediate aftermath will he pay tribute to the community group that step forward so impressively on the ground include some council worker be think of councillor such as david lindsay and other do he recognise that they be not give proper voice in the period precede the fire and that we should do more to engage community group yes and be so grateful to my hon friend for make that point one of the thing that strike about the north kensington community and all those affect be the way in which community group have play such an important part there be faith group include the local roman catholic the local anglican and the local methodist church and the al manaar mosque pre exist charity such as the rugby portobello trust have be very energetic in provide support but there be wealth of other group such as the lancaster west resident association of course those form in the shadow of the tragedy such as grenfell united and grenfell next of kin all testify to rich social fabric and to community activism of the good kind know he have champion that he know even though he now represent seat in the west of england that the work he do with the west london zone which be commit to improve social mobility in that area be an exemplar on building safety must make it clear that the developer will be hold to account for their action those who have make these commitment again be grateful to they be now eligible to join our new responsible actor scheme subject to the will of parliament the scheme will come into be this summer we be use other lever to hold the bad actor to account over build safety because it be not just developer who share in the responsibility for put thing right we be pursue the most egregious case of people who have responsibility freeholder and other through our new recovery strategy unit and other mean have yield or be begin to yield result to date the rsu have start legal activity against three significant freeholder that have responsibility for building to protect resident and to ensure safety these include wallis partnership group ltd and grey gr ltd partnership company ultimately own by railpen it be vital that all of we recognise that when it come to the responsibility of pension fund trustee which be the freehold owner in this case they have responsibility not just to the beneficiary of the pension fund but to those who be live in the home whose freehold they own critically we be also bring pressure to bear on those involve in the manufacture of the construction product that be there and be use and abuse in the run up to the grenfell tragedy three construction project giant kingspan arconic and saint gobain the parent company of celotex be all come under pressure in the last few month have write to these company and invite they to meet to explain their plan to contribute financially to remediation work on unsafe building have also write to their investor and assure they that the sight of my department be train on these manufacturer and that there will be legal and commercial consequence should they fail to make satisfactory arrangement believe that responsible investor can join all of we in this house in bring pressure to bear because their wide obligation to society and their commercial interest be one and the same as the hon member for erith and thamesmead abena oppong asare mention we need to work together to ensure not just that the most serious safety problem be deal with but that all safety problem be deal with however it be the case that people live in high rise building with the most dangerous cladding acm cladding like that on grenfell tower have receive the support and the change need some of the building with acm cladding have now be make safe or have work under way and all building in the social housing sector with acm cladding have be address the building safety act as the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran speak for the liberal democrats point out have give we additional regulatory power which we shall not hesitate to use the new building safety regulator will be responsible for oversee building safety in residential building above metre and it will take enforcement action where necessary build safety of course be at the heart of the grenfell tragedy but want to make two other brief point before yield the floor to other one be the vital importance of make sure that all of we recall how important it be to listen to the voice of those in social housing for too long the voice of too many social housing tenant be ignore people live in substandard home tell we what be wrong they describe appal condition they enumerate with distress accuracy the dangerous oversight that lead they to feel unsafe in the place that they should have feel most secure we must never let those voice go unheeded again we all of we must be guide by they as we improve the living condition and right of social housing tenant across the united kingdom at last year debate have just announce that the social housing regulation bill in the queen speech be due to be debate in both our houses be pleased that we be now on the verge of royal assent the bill codify our commitment to transform the experience of social housing resident ensure that landlord deliver the safe and decent home that all resident should expect the legislation be bring forward of course as direct response to concern raise by member of the grenfell community but as that legislation pass through both houses we have be forcibly remind about the need to strengthen it far the tragic death of awaab ishak in age just two as result of respiratory condition generate by the grotesque circumstance in which he be be bring up by the housing association that should have attack damp and mould far early have also lead to change to that legislation awaab law now require social landlord to deal with damp and mould complaint to strict timetable and will ensure that all tenant have the protection that they deserve thank to the work of grenfell united and other that bill include provision to ensure the professionalisation of the housing sector consistent demand of the bereaved resident and survivor and demand consistent with make sure that those who work in housing get the recognition and indeed the respect they deserve as they acquire that additional qualification lot of us mps get lot of housing case and still get case in which constituent be be blame for the type of accommodation that they live in have case right now where constituent be be blame for their lifestyle this be not filter through minister this be real problem and it be important that while you be talk about all the thing that you be achieve there be still lot of work to be do order it be important to address the minister not directly but through the hon lady be absolutely right issue of damp and mould be not consequence of lifestyle in fact when that allegation be make there be sometimes behind it an unhappy and prejudiced attitude towards some community and some individual we need to call that out and the housing ombudsman have be clear should also say that do not believe that should take credit for these step it be about this house and everyone here who have work together with people outside this house include grenfell united awaab ishak family campaign journalist such as daniel hewitt and vicky spratt and above all the campaigner kwajo tweneboa think he have do far more than any minister have to ensure that we get the message on social housing the final thing that want to cover be the particular need of the community itself the grenfell tragedy encapsulate what have go wrong with our building safety system and what have go wrong with the way we treat people in social housing but there be real need that the community continue to feel want to reaffirm the commitment make by my right hon friend the member for maidenhead mrs may the former prime minister in the terrible aftermath of the fire she say that the government would be there in that community long after the camera stop roll she have take close personal interest in ensure that we continue to support the community baroness scott and will continue to work with other arm of government the royal borough of kensington and chelsea the nhs and the independent grenfell tower memorial commission to ensure that the community have the ongoing support that it need through the conclusion of the inquiry and beyond the tragedy at grenfell tower be one of the bad civilian tragedy in our history and the bereaved survivor and immediate community will never forget nor should they and nor should we we seek in this debate and in the work of government and parliament not only to honour the memory of those who die but to build legacy in their name safe and greener home well social housing and lasting commitment to those affect by these terrible event this government this house and indeed our whole country have responsibility and stake in the future of grenfell and the community across this house we have pledge to remember the life lose and to seek truth in their name and we will honour they by the legacy they inspire call the shadow minister matthew pennycook the fire that engulf grenfell tower on june kill be child and many as the secretary of state say be disabled the inferno wipe out entire family rip other apart and traumatise community the fear that grenfell resident must have feel on that night be truly unimaginable and those who survive will be forever scar by what they experience in the day after the fire as picture of the smoulder and charred building be broadcast across the country and the world there be collective feeling across britain that not only do we now have no choice but to confront issue that have be disregard for far too long but that the sheer horror of what happen would not allow we to forget but the truth be that even event as traumatic as grenfell will fade from our collective consciousness unless we work to ensure they be remember for that reason alone this debate be essential while we lament the fact that the government do not ensure that it take place on or around the anniversary date we nevertheless welcome the fact that we have the opportunity today to commemorate the fire and its victim to consider again the circumstance lead up to and surround it and to debate its wide ramification on june this year take part in the grenfell silent walk as do several other hon member present as it always be it be profoundly move experience at the end of the walk the magnitude of the human loss be bring painfully home as the name of each and every one of the man woman and child who perish in the fire be slowly and methodically call out to those assemble in stillness but this year walk feel different because alongside the usual grief and loss one could sense palpable anger among the crowd of an intensity that have not witness before listen to those who speak at the rally near the base of the tower at the end of the walk it be clear that that anger be bear not only from the ever present knowledge that what happen could have be avoid if shortcut be not take reckless and unforgivable decision be not make and repeat warning be not ignore but from the fact that six year on the prospect of justice appear so distant on these benches we recognise as we always have the need to await the final report of the grenfell tower inquiry but we understand the frustration and outrage that the community evidently feel as the year pass by without justice have be secure for their love one the pursuit of justice will go on as it must yet the survivor the bereaved and the wide grenfell community to whom the opposition again pay tribute today have always be clear that secure wide change and last legacy be equally important to they amid all the setback and frustration that they have experience it be important that we recognise that they have already help to change thing for the well but when it come to decisively and markedly improve standard in social housing and make sure that all building across the country be safe there be still so much more to be do when it come to improve the quality of social housing tangible progress have be make over the course of the past month we press for it to be strengthen far but we have work with the government to ensure the rapid passage of the social housing regulation bill through this place improve as it be by number of government concession we very much look forward to it receive royal assent in the near future as the secretary of state will know operationalise that bill will require number of further measure include determine the specific requirement that will flow from awaab law review exist guidance on the health impact of damp and mould in home and put in place the new consumer regulation regime and update regulatory standard we would be grateful if the government update the house during the debate on progress on all those front while overhaul the regulation of social housing be necessary step to improve its quality across england legislation alone be unlikely to be enough we recognise that many social landlord provide good quality safe and secure home in which individual and family can and do thrive we also appreciate fully the challenging context in which social landlord have have to operate over recent year include the significant cost of build safety remediation work but we be convince that many social landlord need to ask themselves difficult but essential question about the quality of some of the home they provide and the service their tenant receive as well as examine afresh their culture and process the recently publish better social housing review oversee by the national housing federation and the chartered institute of housing be welcome development in that regard and we look forward to see how individual provider implement its recommendation over the come month and year we also recognise that progress have be make over the past year when it come to address the building safety crisis particularly welcome the secretary of state comment on product manufacturer we encourage he to explore and exhaust all possible option that the government have to hold they to account in the course of the past year some leaseholder have be give legal protection some developer have enter into legal agreement to remediate unsafe building that they have either construct or refurbish and some lender have agree to offer mortgage on block of flat with safety issue but if we ask the hundred of thousand of people still live in unsafe building across the country whether they expect the building safety crisis as it affect they to be resolve fully by this time next year or even this time two year hence the answer we will receive from the vast majority be resound no the secretary of state be right that all acm issue on social housing block have be resolve but we still do not know the full extent of the crisis as it affect social home because provider be ineligible to apply for support unless their financial viability be threaten the overall pace of remediation across the country remain glacial shamefully grenfell style acm cladding which should not be on any building in this country or any other country be still present on high rise building in england six year on and just non acm building have be fully remediate out of the that make application to the building safety fund all the evidence suggest that only small proportion of leaseholder in unsafe building have see remediation work begin and far large proportion have no identify date for the commencement of work and no estimate timescale for completion include many in building cover by the developer remediation contract as result despite some lender be willing in principle to offer mortgage six year on from grenfell the majority of leaseholder in privately own building be still trap within their captivity many be be bleed dry by service charge that more often than not have escalate sharply as result of soar building insurance premium that be scandal that the government have singularly fail to step in and decisively resolve over multiple year despite continuous pleading from member from across the house apologise for not be here for the first word of the debate can confirm that the hon gentleman be say that what leaseholder need be what social tenant have get the problem need to be identify and it need to be fix and then the funding should happen to wait for the funding be the wrong way round hope the father of the house will accept that we have argue consistently since the start of this crisis that the government should step in and fund and then use their power to recover as we go forward because too many leaseholder be trap that be not just in the context of this problem but due to the wide inequity of the leasehold system and we need to tackle that problem in due course thank the shadow minister for his thoughtful and detailed remark take he back to point he make about acm cladding survivor of the grenfell fire and the bereaved be keen to see acm cladding ban globally as he mention it be on block in the uk as it stand would he like to see it effectively ban globally and remove from those block in this country acm should not be on any building in england six year after the fire and it be shameful that it be but my hon friend be right the government should use their authority and the experience they have glean over the past six year to make the case worldwide because this material should not be on any building it be dangerous and it should never have be put up in the first place while all trap leaseholder be feel the strain in relative term some be well off than other because the government make the political choice to provide some with legal protection from the cost of historic non clad defect while leave other expose to bill that will not only lead to financial ruin in many instance but will have material impact on the progress of remediation in building where such non qualify leaseholder be large in number even at this late stage urge the secretary of state to reconsider the arbitrary division of blameless leaseholder into those who qualify for protection under the law and those who do not as well as beseech he to ensure that the government finally grip and drive from the centre an accelerated programme of remediation across the country to conclude six year on from the horror of grenfell thing have change but they have not change anywhere near enough if we be to ensure that everyone have secure decent affordable and safe home in which to live far more still need to be do and do quickly if it be not we will be back here again next year mark the seventh anniversary of the fire still bemoan the fact that too many social tenant be be let down and too many building be not be make safe with the life of too many blameless leaseholder destroy we owe it to the survivor the bereaved the wide grenfell community and the legacy they want to see establish to ensure that that be not the case call the snp spokesperson like other our thought and prayer go to the grenfell community as we remember they in this debate it be worth remember that the grenfell fire kill people due to flammable cladding and this house remember the life that be lose it be also worth remember that during the platinum jubilee celebration seat be leave unfilled at street party to remind the community of the life lose each place at the table be set with name card napkin plate cup and flag yvette williams campaigner say five year on toothless public inquiry and million still trap in their home by flammable cladding and still no justice there have be no lesson learn and little action take as people up and down the country enjoy street party as they quite rightly should we want to let the power that be know that our community will always remember the who die needlessly here that night total of people be refer to the dedicated nhs grenfell health and wellbeing service of those be child dr sara northey who run therapy for child and young people at the dedicated nhs grenfell health and wellbeing service have describe the scale of the trauma as unprecedented she say this be an unusual trauma as it affect whole community and be definitely ongoing grief do just go away but what be strike be also the strength people have in the relationship here and the connection people have at the heart of the trauma be shattering of safety we have see lot of avoidance of thing that remind child of fire bonfire or candle on birthday cake can be quite trigger some be worried about electronic in the home and need to check thing be switch off child be be kind of hyperaware of safety in way that most child do have to be hope that ministers will tell the house that while it be important that we concentrate on build safety they be commit to ensure that these health and wellbeing service will still be there and maintain to help the people of grenfell as the secretary of state rightly say there should be an annual debate not just to discuss build health and safety but it should also ensure that the health and wellbeing of that community be maintain indicate assent see that the secretary of state agree thank he for that the scottish government be spend every penny of consequential funding they receive on this programme of work with committed spend of million the scottish cladding remediation programme be design to ensure that there be no cost to property owner and resident for the procurement and production of single building assessment for each building the scottish government first have to carry out comprehensive and technical assessment to understand the extent of the problem the vast majority of building in the initial phase of the scottish government programme have secure fire engineer and new streamlined process for commission the assessment will help to identify at risk building more quickly the safety of resident and homeowner in scotland be of the utmost priority as the scottish government work to tackle clad safety issue through our single building assessment which have be expand to more than building we will create register of building that will provide assurance to the public follow the completion of any necessary remediation work if expert identify an issue that need immediate action to safeguard resident the scottish government will take action and expect developer to do likewise on their building this can be complex and time consume programme number of assessment be either at final or pre final reporting stage with discussion on remediation under way hope that at the conclusion of the debate the minister will update the house about the discussion that minister be have with the devolved administration it be about funding and the barnett consequential that kick in when the uk government spend money the scottish government have strengthen and will continue to strengthen the building standard system in scotland with the building standard future board establish to undertake programme of work to strengthen the system the scottish government have legislate to improve fire safety by ban developer from use combustible cladding on residential and other high risk building above metre scotland be the first part of the uk to ban the high risk metal composite cladding material from any new building of any height since new cladding system on high rise block of flat have have either to use non combustible material or pass large scale fire test the building standard legislation remove the option of fire test completely prohibit such material from use on domestic and other high risk building such as care home and hospital above metre in october the scottish government strengthen guidance in relation to combustible cladding mean of escape and measure to assist the fire service the regulation be pass unanimously by the scottish parliament to protect life and property follow the tragic grenfell tower fire have outline some of the work be do in scotland on behalf of the scottish national party want to emphasise that our thought prayer and love go out to the grenfell community agree with the secretary of state that we should have an annual grenfell debate it would be well to have it on or as near as possible to the anniversary date it be somewhat disrespectful that we have wait nearly month to have it this year be sure that the silent walk will continue have try to attend they at least on the anniversary and have notice how over the six year the mood have change from grief to frustration about the lack of progress from all side whether the government or the inquiry and now to real anger the shadow minister my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook be also there and be sure that he agree on that point therefore do not recognise much of what the secretary of state say about what be happen what seem to be happen be that every year there be more complex issue and while there have be some degree of resolution more question be raise and there be more problem to resolve about the cause and spread of fire that to large extent be to do with cladding and not just acm cladding there be many other reason why fire spread through high rise building in particular the family want to see complete ban on acm clad on all building not only in this country but internationally hope that the government will campaign for that to happen because it be not only in the uk that tragic fire such as grenfell have happen there be huge issue with the design of new building that be evolve all the time as we see in the two staircase issue as well as in remediation it be to some extent easy to set new building standard for new building well it can be do but we be lag behind substantially in do remedial work on exist building much of this come down to finance that be not just for individual leaseholder who in certain circumstance will still have to pay out large sum of money or where money be not forthcoming up front it be also for social tenant because social landlord be not get the same degree of financial support as leaseholder and social landlord have compete priority as to what they spend their money on although would like to will not take the time to deal with all those issue will deal with just three issue in detail first there be the cause of fire the cause of the grenfell fire be what be hold in my hand crimp which be small piece of wiring that cost few penny as be sure people will guess be not an expert in these matter so be grateful to richard farthing chairman of the hammersmith society who have background in electrical and electronic manufacturing he send the expert report on the cause of the grenfell fire will not go through all the technical detail but its short conclusion be probable cause of the fire be poor crimp connection an overheated wire connector within the compressor relay compartment for the fridge freezer hotpoint model from flat it be as simple as that little component cost matter of penny which be either not fit properly or not manufacture properly cause fire that lead to the death of people of course there be many other issue of causation in grenfell and elsewhere but that draw attention to the lack of quality control in manufacturing process the second issue on cause which encounter every month not month go by when do not hear about this usually in social housing block of flat in my constituency be fire cause by lithium battery say fire but they be usually explosion this be an extraordinary problem that the london fire brigade and be sure fire brigade across the country be very much aware of couple of week ago three people be take to hospital after fire break out in flat in west kensington due to converted bike catch fire what happen be that people buy bike and want to convert it into an bike so they buy kit and battery many of these thing be buy second hand and be cheap with fault in manufacture so they overheat and literally explode anyone who do not believe should look at the london fire brigade twitter feed where they will see explosion that completely engulf room of flat sometimes the whole flat within second if compartmentalisation work the fire be keep in that flat because of the construction of the door and wall and the occupant of the flat escape there may be no serious injury but if that do not happen and the fire spread as it quite easily can it be almost impossible to contain that be about lack of regulation why be we allow such kit to be sell why be we allow people to use they in high rise building in that way as say probably once month go and view the site of fire cause by exactly that somewhere in my constituency and it be only matter of time before there be more fatality there have be fatality through lithium battery in that way the third issue on cause again come from personal experience the year before grenfell in high rise block of flat shepherd court on shepherd bush green faulty tumble dryer catch fire and destroy the flat hundred of thousand of they be manufacture mainly by large company call whirlpool under name such as hotpoint and indesit they be cheaply make cheap to buy and often sell second hand and they be cause hundred if not thousand of fire across the country there be lack of design prowess whether it be the crimp quality control the battery lack of regulation or lack of design there be crisis across the manufacturing and design sector commend to the secretary of state newly publish book by professor shane ewen of leeds beckett university before grenfell fire safety and deregulation in twentieth century britain it say the grenfell tower fire be disaster foretold the culmination of successive decade of deregulation corporate greed and institutional failure to learn from the lesson of past multiple fatality fire it be very good read and recommend it to the secretary of state it indicate that the crisis do not begin and certainly do not end with grenfell but have be go on long time the result of either deliberate government policy or government neglect to take care of the issue the second issue be design as be often the case be grateful to the royal institute of british architects which have be push the issue of design and remedial work to high rise building its particular ask be the trigger point for second staircase think that people be familiar with the issue of have at least two staircase extraordinarily hitherto whereas non residential building over metre have to have second staircase residential building can be as tall as you like know that because just overlook my constituency in north acton be plus storey newly construct block that have one staircase in it be pleased to say that due to the action of the major of london those seek planning permission for block of flat over metre be require to go back and put in second staircase submission from riba expert in this field state that that should apply to any residential building over metre would like the government to adopt that when refurbish it may be difficult to put in second staircase there the ask be that evacuation lift sprinkler and centrally addressable fire alarm system be put in those do not have to be fire alarm that any resident can activate in the wake of the grenfell tragedy the stay put policy increasingly do not work understand why it be maintain and it work in many case but it do not work if resident completely understandably fear for their life and evacuate the building if decision be make to evacuate building there have to be way of tell people in that building alarm system that be controllable at least by the fire service be an important part of that equation can not for the life of think why we be not retrofit sprinkler into high rise building they will stop of fire many many tragedy could be avoid if that happen my final point be the consequence this debate be partly about social housing more generally but be not sure we have time to go into all aspect of that would like to address the crossover between fire safety and social housing provider and the pressure on their resource be prompt to do so after read an extraordinary interview that the housing minister the hon member for redditch rachel maclean give to inside housing couple of day ago it state when ask what housing association should prioritise without additional funding from government and face pressure to build retrofit stock and meet building safety and historic disrepair cost ms maclean reply it up to they that show an absolute tin ear to the current pressure on social landlord they want to develop new stock again completely contrary to what the housing minister say in that interview the number of social rent home that this government have create be appal low stand at last year she say in the same interview we ve deliver more social rent home in this government than under the last labour government these fact be easily discoverable the current government have build less than half the number build by the previous labour government that be only one aspect of the crisis in social housing we have hear about damp mould and disrepair which need to be deal with retrofitting need to be deal with at cost of about billion as well as build safety which be what we be talk about today why be social housing landlord in such plight the answer be that they lose of the social housing grant under the austerity government due to rent control and other matter they be unable to come up with the resource they need it be so bad that the small association be go under or be have to merge into much large association the whole sector be be distort by the financial pressure the big landlord group say that out of the billion it will need to pay for remedial work due to fire safety measure it will have to find billion itself that mean that its tenant and leaseholder will have to find that money because there be no other readily available source shepherd bush housing group formerly well respect local medium sized housing association have just have to be take over by guinness much large association because it simply can not financially survive with all the pressure on it there be an existential threat to the social housing market previous conservative governments decide to move from council housing to housing association in big way the government will have to rethink where they be on those issue because it be no long sustainable for housing association to go forward with the financial support that they have when the housing minister wind up the debate perhaps she will correct some of the error that she make in that interview and perhaps she will address more listening ear to social landlord they perform an extremely important function hear everything the secretary of state say about that the rhetoric be all well and good but the actuality be that tenant be live in poor condition and people be in temporary accommodation we have the high level ever because no decent social housing be be build and maintain in this country that be what tenant and leaseholder be look for not warm word and empty rhetoric welcome this debate six year on from the grenfell tragedy no amount of word and speech can remove the grief and pain inflict on the family and friend of the life lose to the fire we will never forget the scar will be with the community and with our nation for generation to come pay tribute to the family survivor the community and grenfell united for their voice and for campaign so consistently despite their own grief for change transparency and justice lesson have not be learn countless people still live in building with hazardous cladding although welcome the building safety act and its good intention progress have just be too painfully slow during covid we see how fast the government can move when they need to in stark contrast to their slowness in set up the building safety fund which do not even account for the number of people or block affect registration take so long and then have to be extend still without provide huge amount of money to developer they be then so slow to bring developer to the table it be their fault their mistake and their error but it be people who be pay the price for more than three year since be elect have be support thousand of constituent in putney roehampton and southfields in block with unsafe cladding only one only one have have its cladding fully removed the scaffolding go up and be up for quite long time it have now be remove and the resident be now in safe building but in all the other block either the cladding be untouched and they do not know when it will be remove or for couple of block the scaffolding be up and the cladding be be remove but why six year on have there be so little work speak to constituent constantly who be furious that their cladding have still not be remove and that reflect the situation up and down the country just this week have meeting with resident developer and manage agent of one of those development the resident be ask be our building safe all the developer could say be well it not not safe that be not good enough if you be live in that building worry about what will happen at night so much money have be spend on wake watch many resident call it sleep watch which really have not work be it necessary in the meeting this week hear from one person who say she could not renegotiate her mortgage because of lender build safety concern so her mortgage cost be go up by month another have have to borrow from friend and family he too be unable to renegotiate his mortgage because of those concern they could not be give comfort letter by the developer which be one of those that have sign the developer pledge because it could not guarantee the work would be do to high enough extent for mortgage lender people still have the mental distress of live in what could be unsafe home unable to let they they can not move on with their life have normal life despite spend so much money on home the big question they have for the developer be when will they even start the work for my development and when will it finish when will this be over that be what they be ask want to come on to talk about the action the government have take but the trouble be that every action they take and every question they eventually answer leaf about two more unanswered it be not acceptable that after all these year must still with many other member such as my hon friend the member for hammersmith andy slaughter who have do so much to campaign on this issue come back to the chamber what will happen to the vast majority of people live in social housing who have still not have sprinkler retrofit in their block as inside housing report few than of high rise social housing block have be fit with sprinkler and only with fire alarm instead there need to be work block by block with the resident of those block on what need to happen to keep they safe what will happen to the leaseholder in england who be live in mid rise building with life safety fire risk there have be no update on the medium rise remediation fund since the pilot scheme be launch for only block what will happen to the unknown number of people who live in building under metre with lethal cladding still on they which likely house disabled resident not to mention the unresolved issue that leaseholder have have with form what will happen to leaseholder who have non clad defect but can not afford the spending cap in london or the spending cap outside london what will happen to people live in the almost building with non acm flammable cladding why do the government water down the personal emergency evacuation plan for disabled people and go against the recommendation of the inquiry be glad that the personal emergency evacuation plan be mention by the secretary of state but there be so many more question about when it will be action will the minister enact the financial conduct authority recommendation on spiral insurance cost which be also mention in the debate that be huge issue for many of my constituent many leaseholder be suffer and even go bankrupt they face increase of over on their insurance cost what will happen to those people will they be forget or do the government have plan without robust and swift enforcement the building safety act be toothless will the secretary of state say why deadline be not put in place for when developer have to remove their cladding rather than the vague ask of as soon as reasonably practicable be there any plan to have deadline will the developer who sign the pledge which be welcome be give final deadline will resident know when they be likely to be out of the nightmare they be face developer just seem to be drag their foot while cost be rise the secretary of state mention legal duty on developer who sign the pledge to get on with remediation it would be far well if that get on with it be give an actual date which would focus their mind help release so much of the concern and worry bring down insurance cost and provide the comfort that mortgage lender say they need the department have only share detail on threaten to take one developer to court if it do not agree to remediation work think the secretary of state say there may be two more in process but whether it be one or three that be such small number what serious consequence be there currently for the countless other developer who have refuse to sign the remediation contract or have delay work can the minister state how often the building safety regulator will call in the accountable person and what the enforcement will be as the secretary of state say kingspan arconic and saint gobain be the manufacturer whose cladding be instal in grenfell tower it be still go on many other building be glad action be be take but they still have not pay single penny towards remediation cost as their profit soar taxpayer be foot the bill of their negligence to the tune of billion enforcement need to be more than just letter ask they to pay where be the accountability what be the hold up where be the justice be glad that the voice of social housing tenant have be mention because that be at the heart of the issue that include temporary accommodation tenant who often have very little voice they do not know how long they will be place for they do not know where to go to have their say often additional work be not do by council to enable they to have voice yet they may be raise the very issue the equivalent of which be be raise by grenfell resident before the tragedy their voice need to be hear government support should be build into the system to reward council that give their social housing tenant include temporary accommodation tenant voice that lead to actual change additional work and support be need to ensure those tenant know their voice can be hear but they need to be listen to if that lesson of grenfell be not learn we may see more tragedy that could have be stop grenfell be not an isolated incident but the result of decade of unfettered deregulation of our safety our hospital be crumble our home be riddle with toxic mould and lethal cladding one fifth of all firefighter have be ax year before grenfell the conservatives vote against make home fit for human habitation the truth be that it take the tragedy of grenfell and baby awaab death from mould for the government to even think about improve safety standard previously have call for minister for mould because of so many case know of where family health have be put at risk from the mould they suffer in their home the pace and scope of action have be woefully inadequate and consequently there be very little to prevent another tragedy happen again that terrify my constituent be exhausted campaigner on cladding be exhausted be exhausted grenfell united be continue on bravely but their justice need to be see the legacy of grenfell the tragic death of wonderful life must be justice and certainty that this will never happen again how have this not be sort out six year on it will go down in history as one of the great failing of this government all my constituent want be to live in home that be safe to buy home that they know be safe to be able to sell that home if they need to and not to have to pay for the mistake of other my final question to the minister be this be that too much to ask order we be about to come to the wind up speech follow the conclusion of this debate there will be statement on iran from the foreign secretary any members wish to question the foreign secretary on his statement should make their way to the chamber now may first associate myself with the comment of the secretary of state in welcome the family and friend of those involve in the grenfell tragedy and the survivor who be in the public gallery today it be privilege to respond to this debate on behalf of his majesty opposition as have already be say opposition members be disappoint that no time be afford for debate near to the time of the anniversary of the grenfell tragedy back in june but thank all member who have contribute to the important debate that we have have this afternoon we have hear several excellent speech deal with both the circumstance lead up to and surround the grenfell fire and its wide ramification those ramification be the trauma that survivor live with each and every day and also the trauma experience by the family and friend of the victim and those who reside in the wide community in one of the rich borough of our capital what the grenfell fire shine light on be rampant and unchecked inequality and alongside that housing crisis which to this day remain unaddressed with too many of our people in home that be uninhabitable and dangerous and lest we forget with people still on social housing waiting list wait for place to call their own in the aftermath of tragedy and the loss of human life we can only begin to remedy the sense of loss and human suffering with accountability truth and justice and most important by vow never to bear witness to repetition of the event that unfold on june and vow never again to lose two year old boy like awaab ishak who die because the social housing provider would not act on the complaint from his family to the scourge of damp and mould the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens be right to say that the scale of the trauma from grenfell be unprecedented he be also right to speak of the need for health and wellbeing service to be maintain my hon friend the member for hammersmith andy slaughter speak movingly about the important issue of social landlord not receive the same amount of support as leaseholder in his usual knowledgeable fashion he also speak about the crisis across the design sector and the lack of regulation the financial pressure on social landlord and the existential threat pose by those factor welcome the contribution from my hon friend the member for putney fleur anderson especially when she compare the speed with which the government have move during the covid crisis with the slowness of progress in this area and refer to the many unanswered question she speak of the need to reduce insurance cost and the assurance require by mortgage lender and it be poignant moment when she also speak of the need for those in temporary accommodation to have voice all those member make earnest contribution to the debate and thank they for that because after all these matter be too important too central to human dignity not to be afford time in this place or indeed the corridor of power in whitehall the community of grenfell need answer and they deserve answer unlike my hon friend the member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook be unable to join in the recent grenfell walk but echo his observation that there be real sense of anger and frustration this year as we know at the end of the grenfell walk the scale of human loss be painfully bring home as the name of each one of the man woman and child who perish be call out to those who be present of course we await the outcome of the grenfell inquiry as we must but hear those cry of vexation those call for justice opposition members eagerly anticipate the content of the inquiry final report and look forward to our institution act on its recommendation and deliver the three key tenet that the community expect accountability truth and justice when it come to decisively and markedly improve standard in social housing and ensure that all building be safe there be still much to be do although as have be say progress have be make over the past month in improve the quality of social housing opposition members want the social housing regulation bill to be strengthen far but we work with the government to ensure its rapid passage through this place what happen next will be pivotal to cement the difference that the legislation should make the government have that responsibility and the social housing sector bear its responsibility too the national housing federation and the chartered institute of housing shine spotlight on this issue in their report entitle the better social housing review the sector must act swiftly on the report seven recommendation not least the first which state every housing association and the sector should refocus on their core purpose and deliver against it the opposition recognise that progress have be make in other area particularly build safety but it remain too slow for far too many as have be point out today some leaseholder have be give legal protection some developer have enter into legal agreement to remediate unsafe building that they either construct or refurbish and small number of lender have agree to offer mortgage on block with safety issue but ultimately that be entirely inadequate remediation work have be painstaking and laborious and have not even begin in too many instance those who have walk around any of our major city contain high rise block over the last few year will have see shell of apartment block which remain to this day the cladding be quickly remove but what now for the people and family at the heart of this story evidence suggest that only small proportion of leaseholder in unsafe building have see remediation work begin while far large proportion have no identify date for the commencement of work and no estimate timescale for their completion our people deserve well the government have not finish the job and we urge they to deliver the change that many be still cry out for they must step up and look at this entire agenda in the round the fire brigades union be right to condemn they for the fact that in england there be currently few fire safety inspector who be competent to carry out audits and serve enforcement notice than there be in the year after the grenfell tower fire why be that also ask the government to heed the call of the local government association which be say very clearly that council and fire and rescue service need clarity on what be expect of they as regulator alongside the building safety regulator significant amount of secondary legislation still need to be approve by parliament to implement the new building safety regime and of course effective delivery of that new regime depend on adequate resource for both council and fire and rescue service would welcome update on that from the government good quality safe home be the bedrock of human dignity housing must never take life rather it should preserve the sanctity of life our people should be allow to grow flourish and experience life well live but for too long the opposite have be the case it be pleasure to conclude the debate on behalf of the government six year on as the powerful and move contribution to the debate have illustrate the still unimaginable event of june continue to demand search answer from we as country about who we be and who we aspire to be they reaffirm the unshakeable commitment across this house to those most affected the commitment to provide long term support for recovery and the rebuilding of shattered life and to provide legacy worthy of the man woman and child who lose their life we honour their memory and the courage and dignity of the bereaved and the survivor in the grenfell community be pleased to see they represent here today it be humble and privilege to have conversation with few of they before come to the chamber their quest for truth and justice and their campaigning in the interest of other to reform system that so grievously fail they be humble and inspire in equal measure as we have hear the issue raise by those in the grenfell tower community have be present for many year their call for change go unanswered and their concern be ignore they be fail by the institution and mechanism develop to support and protect they as the secretary of state have say we be determined to learn from the past so that no community ever again suffer as they have more than anything that must mean people be safe in their home as the minister responsible for housing be aware of the heavy debt we owe the grenfell community over the past year that have involve make home with the most dangerous cladding safe protect leaseholder from unfair and punitive remediation cost get those responsible to face up to their financial and moral responsibility and fundamentally overhaul and strengthen the entire building safety system the grenfell community have also rightly keep up the pressure on my department to ensure that we never again ignore the voice of people live in social housing and that it provide the safe decent home and respectful good quality service that they expect and deserve awaab ishak tragic death underline the urgency of that work which we be take forward through the social housing regulation bill amend to include awaab law new requirement for social landlord to address hazard such as damp and mould within fix timeframe there be of course much more to do and do not underestimate the toll that six long year of wait for the truth and for justice to be do have take on the people of north kensington like they we keenly await the publication of the grenfell tower inquiry final report we have already begin implement recommendation in the phase report and the outcome of the ongoing met police investigation we also look forward to see fitting and lasting memorial deliver at the grenfell tower site through the grenfell tower memorial commission work in partnership with the community join the secretary of state in pay tribute to the commission work however beyond truth and justice the great legacy we can deliver be continued commitment to listen learn and act to secure well future for all profound commitment that know be share across the house let turn to some of the point raise by hon member in the debate we hear from the hon member for hammersmith andy slaughter from the snp person the hon member for glasgow south west chris stephens and from the hon member for putney fleur anderson as well as from the two labour spokespeople the hon member for greenwich and woolwich matthew pennycook and for liverpool wavertree paula barker thank they all for their contribution we recognise that sprinkler could play great role so we lower the threshold for the provision of sprinkler system in new block of flat from metre to metre in follow consultation on sprinkler and fire safety measure through change to approve document sprinklers be only one of range of measure that can be provide in building and building owner be already bind by clear obligation to ensure that exist building have suitable and sufficient fire risk assessment in place retrofitting sprinkler be not always the right option other fire safety measure such as measure recommend by phase of the grenfell tower inquiry may be more appropriate for an individual building be ask how people live in building under metre can be help when they face expensive bill for remediation it be the ultimate responsibility of building owner to ensure that residential building of all height be safe and the consensus be that the level of risk tally with the height of the building the risk to life be usually low in building under metre in height which be very unlikely to need costly remediation to make they safe indeed fire risk appraisal of external wall conduct in accordance with the pas principle will often find that low cost mitigation be more appropriate in low rise building nevertheless my department have commit to look at building under metre where remediation cost be involve on case by case basis we think that be the right approach we have ban acm cladding on all new build at the end of may of all identify high rise residential and publicly own building in england have either complete or start work to remove and replace unsafe cladding and long have unsafe acm with have complete acm remediation work we continue to keep up the pressure to ensure that that job be finish be there date by which the minister would like to reach removal of acm cladding of course we would all like to see that happen much more quickly that be why we be continue with the legislative measure that we have set out include the building safety act and all the other work that go behind that as the secretary of state say be ask about social housing regulation the direction of travel be clear resident have speak and reform be come to the social housing sector we be committed to implement the new regulatory regime enable by the social housing regulation bill thank opposition members for assist we with pass the bill the new regime will be implement in the secretary of state will consult on any direction to the regulator and the regulator will then need to consult on its propose consumer standard that be just part of wide programme of work to drive up the quality of social housing and reduce the number of non decent rent home by by that include tough regulation and strengthen housing ombudsman service review of the decent home standard and provide resident with more performance information mr deputy speaker month since the grenfell community lose family member friend and neighbour the enormity of what happen that night in june remain inescapable those who never make it out of the tower pay with their life in the home where they should have be most safe for collective failing include on the part of the government for which we have apologise six year on those leave behind continue to wait for answer and for those responsible to be hold to account not just today but every day as they count the cost of precious life cut short six year of miss see love one grow up or grow old miss life milestone meal unshared ordinary everyday memory unmade no apology no word be enough to right those wrong as the secretary of state say we will be judge not on our word but on our action action to make home safe and greener to improve social housing and amplify the voice of resident to make sure that those responsible step up or face the consequence to provide long term support for the grenfell community for as long as it take to learn from the past get to the truth and see justice do and to ensure that everyone in our society have safe secure place to live that they be truly proud to call home let that be grenfell abide legacy question put and agree to resolve that this house have consider build safety and social housing iran with permission mr deputy speaker will make statement on the threat that iran pose to the united kingdom and the action that his majesty government be take to counter it since protest begin in iran in september last year the iranian regime have dramatically increase its attempt to silence dissent which have never be confine to iranian territory while our police intelligence and security agency have be confront these threat for many year their seriousness and intensity have increase in recent month in the last month there have be at least credible threat to kill or kidnap british national and other live in the uk by the iranian regime we have evidence that farsi language medium outlet operate out of the united kingdom and the individual who work for they have also be target one such company be iran international as the minister for security my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat tell the house on february iran international employee have be threaten with kidnap and murder they have also be subject to debilitate campaign of aggressive online harassment such threat be direct attack on press and medium freedom and they be direct attack on public safety this government will never tolerate such threat on british soil or on the territory of our friend and ally we know from work closely with our international partner that these iranian menace extend beyond the uk to the rest of europe and the wide world in march an iranian orchestrate plot be stop in athens we have see similar attempt in the united states of america türkiye france and denmark such brazen activity be unacceptable these action demonstrate the iranian regime increase desperation in the face of its unpopularity at home and isolation abroad the first duty of his majesty government be to protect the british people and those who have make their home here in the united kingdom whenever necessary the government will not hesitate to defend the freedom of the press my right hon and learn friend the home secretary lead our work on counter iranian state threat our police security and intelligence agency be work together around the clock to identify deter and prevent iranian threat to our national security my right hon friend the security minister lead work to protect the integrity of our democracy from foreign interference through the government defend democracy taskforce the foreign commonwealth and development office lead our work on sanction we have already designate more than individual and organisation link to the iranian regime cover its military security and judiciary we have sanction the islamic revolutionary guard corps in its entirety our diplomatic network be co ordinating with our friend and ally around the world include the united states of america australia new zealand canada and the european union to reinforce our response the cowardly attack plan by the iranian regime on british soil violate the most elementary rule of diplomatic relation between state have twice summon iran most senior diplomat in london to explain his government activity most recently follow iran international decision temporarily to relocate its broadcasting service it be intolerable that any medium outlet should be force to leave the united kingdom because the iranian regime be threaten to kidnap or murder its journalist have no doubt that the whole house will share my outrage there be clear evidence that the iranian regime continue to prepare operation against individual in europe and beyond we have make representation to the iranian foreign ministry we emphasise in no uncertain term our determination to pursue any iranian agent who would harm the uk or our ally we will also continue to work with our international partner to identify expose and counter the threat make against we the uk be clear that we need to go far so today be announce further measure that constitute toolkit would prefer not to use but the decision on whether do so be firmly in the hand of the iranian regime first we will establish new iran sanction regime this will be the first wholly geographic autonomous sanction regime that the uk have create since leave the european union it will give we new and enhanced power to counter iran hostile and destabilising activity in the uk and around the world allow we to impose asset freeze and travel ban on more of iran decision maker and on those do its bidding in particular we will have broad power to target those involve in the regime effort to undermine peace stability and security in the region and internationally to proliferate arm or weapon technology from iran to undermine democracy respect for the rule of law and good governance and to carry out other hostile activity towards the uk and our partner include threat to our people property or national security we expect to introduce the necessary legislation in parliament later this year secondly today we have designate further individual and entity responsible for serious human right violation inside iran this package of sanction include five senior official from iran notorious prison system which be rife with torture and abuse of prisoner further measure target the supreme council of the cultural revolution as the organisation that enforce social and cultural norm that oppress iranian citizen and six key actor responsible for suppress freedom of expression online include the islamic revolutionary guard corps cyber defence command and the supreme council for cyberspace our action be direct response to the escalation of iran reprehensible behaviour in the uk we be not seek to escalate our aim be to prevent and deter hostile iranian activity on british soil and on the territory of our partner and ally let we remind ourselves that iran be sell drone to russia attack its neighbour and even attack its own people when they stand up for human right and the most basic freedom it be my fervent hope that there will be bright day ahead for the relationship between our two country but we can not take any step in that direction until the regime cease its deplorable activity until that day come we will remain steadfast in our effort to stop iranian aggression and to protect the united kingdom commend this statement to the house be grateful to the foreign secretary for give advance sight and notice of his statement in the last year the charge sheet against the government of iran have grow and grow they have fund violent militia across the middle east they have supply drone to russia that menace ukraine city kill civilian and destroy infrastructure they have continue to pursue their nuclear programme in breach of international commitment they have brutally suppress the protest of young iranians who dare to demand well future in the last month they have execute more people than almost any other country in the world they continue to detain uk iranian dual national include morad tahbaz and mehran raoof and they continue to harass and threaten dissident even those who have make their home here in the united kingdom that the security service have foil plot against british base individual show the scale of this hostile activity this worsen extraterritorial threat must be meet with strong and clear action we can not tolerate effort to harass silence or threaten the welfare of regime critic here in the united kingdom and we must ensure that iranian and british journalist can operate without fear or intimidation at the end of last year call for the united nations human rights council to urgently investigate iran crackdown on protestor and for the government to bring forward strong sanction against the iranian regime labour have also call for new joint fcdo and home office state threat cell to co ordinate this action in government so we welcome the measure that the foreign secretary have announce today the government will be aware of the long stand strength of feeling in many part of the house and from member of the iranian diaspora on the question of proscription of the irgc labour propose new mechanism for proscription for state link actor in the national security bill but the government unfortunately do not support it understand of course that there be diplomatic dimension to this question but be sure the house would welcome an update from the foreign secretary on this issue also want to ask the foreign secretary about the fate of iranian dual national labour have for long time call for new legal right for consular assistance to help protect british national but the government have reject that in april the select committee on foreign affairs put forward proposal to overhaul the way the foreign office try to secure the release of british national overseas today the government have largely reject those idea too be the foreign office complacent on this issue what step will it take to bring british national detain in iran and elsewhere home finally want to ask about the future of the joint comprehensive plan of action we support the nuclear agreement as the good approach to prevent iran from acquire nuclear weapon we remain determined and commit to that vital non proliferation goal however there be clear and ongoing pattern of iran breach the jcpoa term prevent monitoring and verification and enrich uranium past the point of any civilian justification it have also continue to violate un security council resolution include in its ballistic missile activity the uk have responsibility as one of the signatory of the jcpoa to take leading role in contain iran nuclear ambition and its related activity so may ask the foreign secretary about the prospect of negotiation on what some be call less for less deal iran be country with an extraordinary and ancient history its courageous people who have risk their life over the past year in pursuit of freedom deserve government who respect their right until that day labour will continue to support action to hold the iranian regime to account echo the right hon gentleman comment about the iranian people have say it before but will say it again our quarrel be not with they as he say iran be country with huge and fabulous history and sophisticated people but sadly they be be let down badly by those in position of leadership the right hon gentleman ask we to update our position on proscription have discuss it at the dispatch box before we will always keep under review the response to iranian state threat and other threat some of which have set out in my statement the irgc be sanction in its entirety and certain individual within it be individually sanction as well as say we do not regularly comment on future proscription or designation but we always keep our option under review the right hon gentleman make point about the nature of our consular support the government position be that we do not need law for we to do right by british people overseas and we extend consular assistance to british national without the need for legislation instruct we to do so we do so even when the house attention be not focus on those individual there be many case where we have have very successful consular outcome for individual who have never come into the consciousness of this house we seek to do that work always with the good interest of those british national at our heart the right hon gentleman will know that in certain circumstance it be particularly difficult for we to discharge our duty and responsibility for consular service in respect of iran particularly for british dual national as iran do not recognise dual national status nevertheless we will always seek to do right by those people who be incarcerate around the world include those who be still in custody and incarcerate in iran the right hon gentleman speak of the jcpoa and be absolutely right to say that the uk be focus on ensure that iran do not acquire nuclear weapon technology or capability we work in close co ordination with our friend in the and the united states of america on that it be regular subject of conversation that have with foreign minister colleague from across the quad and can reassure he and the house that prevent iran acquisition of nuclear weapon technology will remain the priority in our iran strategy we will continue to explore way of deter iran pursuit of nuclear weapon and prevent this from happen call the chair of the foreign affairs committee welcome this new geographically autonomous sanction regime which be an important step in demonstrate that defence be not an escalation and we will be strong at home also welcome the referral yesterday of iran to the international court of justice as result of the shooting down of the ukrainian aircraft in which the uk be do with our ally again that be good step as the right hon gentleman say this morning we do release the response to our report on hostage taking urge the foreign secretary to update we on morad tahbaz because it matter that his name be hear time and again particularly give how ill he be finally give that we have now create an autonomous regime may urge my right hon friend to consider regime in respect of the chinese communist party it have sanction those in this house it continually perpetrate transnational oppression and this week alone it have put bounty on the head of three individual who have seek refuge in this country may also ask he to haul in the chinese ambassador to state how unacceptable that be and how obscene and in breach of international law it be my hon friend raise important point and welcome her comment on the structure we have put in place today and will be put forward with legislation to the house in due course we recognise that no one element of our response on its own will resolve all these issue but the effect be cumulative assure she that we continue to work in close co ordination with our international ally to maximise the impact of our sanction response and to ensure that iran recognise as she say that this be response to its action if it do not like this response it should change its action as for sanction on other nation my hon friend will know that we do not routinely speculate on sanction that we may bring forward but the house and the department have hear the point she have make assure she that whenever have interaction with representative of the chinese government raise the issue of hong kong the sanctioning of british parliamentarian and our fundamental disagreement with the action of that government in relation to the uyghur muslims at every opportunity thank the foreign secretary for prior sight of his statement let begin by put on the record the scottish national party broad support for this wide range package of measure to be take against the regime in tehran he be absolutely right when he say that the exporting of international terrorism by iran can not and will not be tolerate much of what be in the statement be what we on these benches and indeed this entire house have be call for for some time may helpfully suggest that the legislation that will come before the end of the year need to come as quickly as possible if he could put even rough date on when that might happen it would be helpful be pleased that action be be take against those who be complicit in do this brutal regime bidding be they military security or judiciary welcome the news that five of the most senior official from that barbaric prison system have be sanction particularly those in the notorious evin prison where nazanin ratcliffe be hold such prison have be use as brutal tool of repression against those many brave young woman who recently stand up against the regime they have be hold torture and murder within that system will the foreign secretary explain why the islamic revolutionary guard corps have be sanction and not proscribe we be tell six month ago by the minister for security the right hon member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat that the irgc be to be proscribe as terrorist organisation many of we on see the statement be herald would have think that would have be part of it will the foreign secretary explain the difference between sanction organisation and proscribe organisation finally in the light of iran continue support for russia illegal war in ukraine why have his department not tighten up far the iran specific export control and sanction on dual use company to stop the export of material to iran from the uk that can subsequently be make into weapon thank the hon gentleman for welcome the measure that we have take he ask once again about proscription he will have hear my early response that we always keep option available within his question he outline one of the key issue when he say that his party be call on the uk government to proscribe the irgc and go on to ask for an explanation of the difference between proscription and sanction recognise that people see proscription as the most desire outcome without necessarily understand that much of what they suspect they want to see from what they believe will be the outcome of proscription be actually already in place such as asset freeze and travel ban as say the suite of response be keep constantly under review but can assure he that as we have set out in the statement today we will always take action that we believe be in the good interest of protect british national both here and overseas and those iranians who have make their home in the uk he ask about the timetabling for legislation the house will understand that will need to discuss that with the leader of the house and the business manager but assure he that we regard our response to iran as priority and will seek to bring that legislation forward with as much expediency as we be able constituent of mine have repeatedly raise serious concern about connection between the islamic centre of england the irgc and the office of the supreme leader he also believe there could be such connection between the supreme leader and an islamic centre in manchester what be the government do to ensure that uk base charity such as those two centre can never be threat in any way to the security of iranian dissident in the united kingdom my right hon friend raise an important point my department have discuss that with the home office indeed have discuss it with the minister for security my right hon friend the member for tonbridge and malling tom tugendhat reassure she and the house that he take the action of the organisation that she have mention very seriously indeed we wish to ensure that the charity commission also full discharge its duty to ensure that any organisation under its remit be not use to harass or persecute foreign national or indeed british people here in the uk issue face by iranian citizen especially woman be raise with frequently by constituent in putney southfields and roehampton have be stop in the street many time to talk about this issue british iranian dual national morad tahbaz have already be mention in the statement he remain arbitrarily detain in terrible condition in iran almost four year after he be sentence in could the foreign secretary say more to the house about the last time he raise morad case with his iranian counterpart what strategy be in place to secure his release difficult though that be the last time have face to face contact with representative of minister of the iranian regime be in but my official regularly raise consular issue include detainee with our iranian counterpart can assure she and the house that this remain priority have meet morad tahbaz family on number of occasion and the minister for the region lord ahmad meet they very recently think within the last few week this remain priority for we and can assure the hon lady that we will continue to work with the united states of america as he be trinational to bring about his permanent release and ability to come home and rejoin his family in welcome these sanction may ask the foreign secretary to look at iran activity elsewhere he have already mention the provision of russian drone hear rumour that iran have also provide drone to the polisario in southern algeria which could destabilise very fragile peace with the moroccans in western sahara space that be govern by the un indeed it be perfectly credible that the iranians be also involve in place such as tigray and south sudan destabilise whole continent as lever of political power my hon friend who know the continent of africa and its politic incredibly well be absolutely right to highlight the fact that iranian malign activity be not restrict to its own near neighbourhood or indeed the united kingdom we look very carefully at the credible reporting of the support through military equipment not just to russia in its attack against ukraine but to militia group and other military group in the region and across africa can reassure he that we will take that into consideration when it come to any future sanction response that we have towards the iranian regime welcome the statement and look forward to support the legislation so that it can pass as quickly as possible we be all anxious to do whatever we can to support the people of iran mahsa amini be an inspiration to woman not just in her own country but across the world the fact that the people who do this to she the irgc have not be hold to account be itself tragedy will the foreign secretary back the campaign to rename the street of the iranian embassy after she so that every business card every email every piece of post that they have to receive and send have her name on it it work for south africa and nelson mandela think the time be right to do it for she now the hon lady make an important point about the courage of iranian woman courage that be genuinely beyond measure have see open source footage of iranian woman and actually iranian man stand up against the so call morality police and other she will know that the naming of thoroughfare be decision not for central government but for local government none the less she make an incredibly important point perhaps the plan committee of the local council might take her suggestion on board early this year the british group of the inter parliamentary union host an event for bbc persian where we hear incredibly powerful testimony from the journalist who be report on the very instant to which the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran refer those woman protest the freedom of those journalist to report be under great threat from the iranian regime so welcome very much what my right hon friend have announce today but can he confirm the government support both for the continuation of the bbc persian service and that iran international will be able to return to the uk my right hon friend echo the government strength of feeling about media freedom can reassure she and the house that in my conversation with the very senior leadership of the bbc make specific point about the importance of bbc persian as part of the wide positive influence on the world that the bbc world service have have we come to funding arrangement with the bbc world service to ensure that certainly for the life of this parliament no language service will be close recognise that in time of disinformation and oppression the voice of truth and freedom as personify by the hard work colleague in the bbc persian service be more important than ever be slightly puzzle that the foreign secretary just tell the liberal democrat spokesperson that foreign policy decision can be pass to local authority do not know what the levelling up secretary would say about that be concern very much by what the foreign secretary say few moment ago in relation to my constituent alireza akbari who as he know be execute early this year the foreign secretary say he have not have any contact with the iranian regime for two year and know that the family want he to do that people such as morad tahbaz remain in custody in tehran do he not think that he should be do more to try to get they release and that talk to the regime may be necessary know the hon gentleman have long career in local government before come to this house so perhaps he will understand that street naming be not foreign policy issue it be in this case it really be not can assure the hon gentleman that we do have regular and senior contact with representative of the iranian government the iranian regime through their own action have make it hard for to engage with they however that be not blanket ban on engagement can assure he that the plight of detainee and our desire to have they release and return home be very high priority in all the conversation that we have at all level with representative of the iranian government welcome the action that my right hon friend have announce to the house this afternoon think it be important that the house should remain united and clear sighted about the need to confront iran behaviour he mention russia use of iranian drone technology in ukraine and we understand that putin be seek to acquire iranian ballistic weapon technology as well it be my understanding that sunset clause in the joint comprehensive plan of action if activate by the uk and the eu would allow that to happen from october can the foreign secretary give strong assurance to the house that he will work in lockstep with our colleague in the eu to make sure that that do not happen my right hon friend make very important point with regard to our policy towards russia invasion of ukraine work to ensure that russia be not support through military equipment export be one of our priority function and that be particularly true with regard to iranian technology whether drone technology or other take the point that he make about the sunset clause in the jcpoa we be very alive to that and it be conversation regularly have with my and united states counterpart can reassure he that prevent that brutal technology from fall into the hand of russia or indeed anyone else remain priority for the government iran have make no secret of its effort to arm fund and train palestinian terror group in the west bank the leader of palestinian islamic jihad have even say that its terrorist depend on iranian supply weaponry that be the very same group that have turn jenin into city of terror be sure my right hon friend will agree that we should condemn this destabilising activity do he also agree that such horrendous example doubly underline the need for the very welcome toolkit of measure he have announce this afternoon the need not just to have they in our arsenal but to use they commend my hon friend on the passion and consistency with which he champion this issue completely agree that that support for violence and terrorism not just in the west bank but more broadly across the middle east be completely wrong and we will always stand up against it the sad truth be that the palestinian people suffer because of the export of iranian violence into the region we continue to work as cornerstone of our foreign policy to bring about peace between the israeli people and the palestinian people that be not help by the violent interference of iran and we will continue to take action to deter and prevent it very much welcome this package of strengthen sanction last week attend the free iran global summit which be attend by range of former prime ministers former vice presidents former foreign ministers representative from parliaments and around member and former member from across this place which of course roundly condemn the gross violation of human right in iran particularly the us of the death penalty and the oppression of woman but also the killing of innocent child through shooting and poisoning the conference discuss the islamic revolutionary guard corps hear what my right hon friend say about proscription of the irgc in its entirety but will he assure that he will keep that step under very close review can assure my hon friend that we take thoughtful but firm and decisive approach to our posture with regard to iran will always keep all option under review we will always act in what we believe be the good interest not just of our own security but of the safety and security of our friend in the region and indeed of the iranian people who find themselves brutalise by their own government as she say when say that we keep these thing under review genuinely mean it in term of our response nothing will be put permanently off the table or beyond use the announcement that make today add to the pre exist sanction package give we powerful tool of deterrence for iranian behaviour that we intend to utilise fully if iran behaviour do not change will finish on this point the power be in iran hand be it to change its behaviour stop fund terrorism and militia group in the area stop pursue nuclear weapon and stop brutalise its people we would be able to change our posture towards it the power be in its hand backbench business commonwealth parliamentary association pm beg to move that this house support the work of the commonwealth parliamentary association ask for parliamentary time at the early opportunity to change the status of the commonwealth parliamentary association from uk charity to an international inter parliamentary organisation and call on the government to effect that change may start by thank the backbench business committee for grant this timely and important debate in the debate speak on behalf of cpa uk executive member members of parliament who value the work of the cpa and indeed parliamentarian from across the british islands and mediterranean region the region of which we be part in the cpa know that many right hon and hon member here include the labour front bencher the hon member for hornsey and wood green catherine west the hon member for oxford west and abingdon layla moran who will respond for the liberal democrats and many other have enjoy benefit from and participate in many different cpa activity that organisation be hold dear in the heart of parliamentarian both in the uk and abroad however the cpa be at turning point and need the uk government to act now to help secure its future in the uk only the government can change the status of the cpa from local uk charity to bespoke international inter parliamentary organisation because the government need to allocate parliamentary time to allow short piece of primary legislation to be pass it have for many year be acknowledge that the cpa status as uk charity be not appropriate for an association of equal the cpa membership include parliamentarian from south africa to singapore ghana to guyana and canada to cyprus and all be equal member of the organisation which be one of the old commonwealth organisation its status as uk charity be completely out of kilter with the reality of the organisation work the cpa be found back in to promote the advancement of parliamentary democracy but continue to be uk charity today simply reinforce an outdated vision of the commonwealth and the uk place in it long stand demand for recognition of its modern status as bespoke international interparliamentary organisation reach boiling point at the general assembly meeting in halifax canada last year where it be decide that unless substantial progress have be make to change the status of the organisation within month member would resolve to move the headquarters from the uk change in status will allow the cpa to more effectively serve its member remove damaging friction cause by an inappropriate status make clear that all member be on an equal footing to reflect the modern view of the commonwealth and represent the cpa own principle of equality and diversity in the uk that require primary legislation to assist the government have retable short bill the commonwealth parliamentary association status no bill which be first introduce by my hon friend the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger around year ago to make those change quickly and at no cost reiterate at no cost it be point that have already be agree with foreign commonwealth and development office official leave no policy difference between the cpa and the fcdo in take this issue forward the bill have widespread cross party support both here and in the other place but require parliamentary time to be pass the minister of state foreign commonwealth and development office my right hon friend the member for berwick upon tweed anne marie trevelyan be on the front bench have pick up the rein on this at relatively short notice very much appreciate that and know the whole house will hope she will be able to confirm today that parliamentary time be be make available because our time be run out over the many year of discussion between the cpa and the foreign and commonwealth office before it become the fcdo policy difference by and large have be resolve in particular the change in status be not see as come under the international organisations act because the cpa do not fit those criterion and that issue be deal with when other be chair the organisation my bill which the minister will have see would therefore require bespoke status not status under that act which would have cause problem the new bill have no extra cost for the uk taxpayer over and above the tax advantage already available to uk charity which the cpa be if we do not make significant progress on this legislation before the summer recess the uk hosting of the cpa secretariat will be lose that will create real risk for the whole organisation give the very different view on its possible future an apparent lack of prioritisation in the uk place in question our commitment to the commonwealth institution themselves and indeed our reputation could be unnecessarily diminish all for not make this very small change that require legislation as the minister will be aware the cpa have give good notice of its concern and the need for change to put it simply parliamentarian from many country take issue with have to make cpa subscription payment from their taxpayer money to uk charity congratulate the right hon lady on secure the debate and want to put on record my and the liberal democrats support for her bill which should be very simple to pass from my dealing with other parliamentarian across the world know that the fact that the cpa be hold here in the mother of parliaments matter lot to they they feel that it be important to see how it be do by the old institution and we also gain huge amount from it do she agree that the loss of that would be unconscionable to this place yes many member here today will have know the value of meet incoming delegation and be part of outward delegation it give we as parliamentarian an understanding of the world in which we be operate in the same way that other organisation do include the inter parliamentary union we be pleased to have the chair of the british group of the ipu my right hon friend the member for staffordshire moorlands karen bradley with we today these organisation be value by parliamentarian and we need to ensure that the government be aware of that and take appropriate action want to reiterate the reason why this change in status be so important country that be member of the cpa make payment ultimately from their taxpayer money to uk charity those concern be hold most strongly by parliamentary colleague in the africa region of the cpa that be understandable it be incongruous at well for they to be make payment for membership of an international organisation when it look on their book as if they be make payment to uk charity we have to understand that and sympathise and empathise with it other organisation have already ensure that they be structure in an appropriate way french legislation underpin the cpa francophone counterpart in paris the assemblée parlementaire de la francophonie and the inter parliamentary union have geneva headquarters agreement with switzerland the need to follow those international example be particularly true for an international institution such as the cpa which be all about the importance of parliamentary democracy and the commonwealth charter to which we and our fellow member state be sign up commit we to that this parliament action regard the cpa status may appear peripheral to some but in fact they spill over into our relation with very near family member other member of the british family that be involve in the cpa include the devolved legislature in the uk the crown dependency and the overseas territory they be all active member and they too support the need to resolve this situation the government need to take that much more into account not least because those organisation be concerned that they could be damage by association should westminster not be able to resolve this amicably all also look to his majesty the king as head of state as do the other realm at the coronation in may we see the huge importance attach to the commonwealth with his majesty now head of the commonwealth in succession to her late majesty queen elizabeth at its april meeting in gibraltar the cpa executive agree to continue to support effort to persuade the uk government to make the necessary change but to be very clear that be contingent on achieve new legislation by the time that the cpa commonwealth parliamentary conference take place in ghana at the end of september just few short week away the house should know that the cpa executive be already work on relocation package for the secretariat include timeline and procedure for assess future host country this be not hollow threat it be something that be already happen to restate should the uk not pass new legislation by the end of september the organisation will proceed with relocation outside of the uk from october there appear to be absolutely no reason why the bill should take much parliamentary time give the clear support for it in both houses my right hon friend the minister will have hear that already from opposition members it involve no additional cost for the uk taxpayer it have be suggest that any change in status would create an unhelpful or unwelcome precedent but with respect that argument do not bear any scrutiny at all the cpa case be unique it be an international inter parliamentary organisation headquarter in the uk there be no other when we press for example of comparator not single one on the list could make similar case some be international organisation undoubtedly worthy but headquarter elsewhere and with no particular link to the uk there be territory or group of state and government again completely different and not parliamentary in category and obviously not headquarter in the uk legislation to recognise the status of the cpa and the secretariat location here in the uk do not create precedent so that can not credibly be cite as reason for inaction parliamentarian from around the globe tell we that they would like the cpa secretariat to remain in london london work well as location for the secretariat here on the parliamentary estate the secretariat can attract talented staff from diverse pool host the cpa be small but important example of the uk soft power and hope my right hon friend the minister can use her good office to ensure that time be give to pass the modest bill require to change the status of the cpa in the time remain before the annual assembly meeting in september that would demonstrate not only our commitment to the commonwealth but the importance of strong democracy around the world will call the front bench spokespeople at the end of the debate be sorry to tell you mr deputy speaker that have be an abject failure but it be okay because it be not who be go to be blame sadly it be go to be the minister and the secretary of state and it be go to be on their watch that cpa international have to leave london even back in when visit india remember these issue be raise in the four year that have the privilege of be in the foreign and commonwealth office and the foreign commonwealth and development office work with the minister of state think have the large number of commonwealth country in my portfolio but never take the lead although do advocate for make this change when be the chair of the cpa prior to my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller for around two or three year try to move these thing forward but it be never the issue of the day let we face it it be not the big issue of the day today with iran and what be go on in russia but it have to be an issue at some point in april when stand in for my right hon friend in westminster hall debate say that if we do not do something in april when everyone meet in gibraltar the cpa would hardcode in process that involve have to leave the united kingdom that process be now hardcode in people be come forward whether it be the malaysians south africa perhaps with the support of other african country or canada and there be very credible proposition to take the commonwealth parliamentary association international branch away from the uk this be not just matter of pride with the king be the head of the commonwealth it bring something closely locate to the monarchy to the british tradition and to this parliament safe secure place through which people travel on regular basis it can conduct cpa business while do other thing internationally which might not be the case if it be locate in country little far away while fail to move this forward successfully it will be the foreign secretary and the ministerial team who will get the blame there be an opportunity to grasp this nettle the incremental change we have see over the last decade just be not go to cut it few week ago ask the prime minister about this and he be optimistic in his reply believe the foreign secretary want to find way forward but we need to see strong indication from the minister today that we have commitment to try to sort this out in the king speech if not early we need an absolute commitment that legislation be go to be take forward to solve this problem this really should not be what we be talk about in this house please please make this my last speech on this subject and please turn my failure into success congratulate my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller on secure his debate want to make three specific point regard the commonwealth parliamentary association first the governance arrangement secondly the role of inter parliamentary organisation and finally the work that the cpa lead on in the very important world of modern slavery on which it be great leader start with the governance arrangement absolutely support my right hon friend in everything she have say attend the commonwealth parliamentary conference in halifax last year where this be the no topic this be not bluff be call or suggestion we will all get over this be matter of central importance to member of the cpa globally they really do find this an incredibly sensitive issue and we need to show sympathy and respect for that position and help they thank my right hon friend for raise the issue of our conference last year and she have remind of some of the conversation be have with member of parliament particularly from place such as canada where we be negotiate trade agreement it be these member of parliament who want to see consistency from the uk around our relationship with they as nation but also as member of the commonwealth absolutely agree with my right hon friend think there be statement that the uk government could make here which be about take leadership and about demonstrate that we want to be active and sympathetic player in global event on not be able to take this step this very simple step think my hon friend the member for rochford and southend east sir james duddridge be former whip as be and recall oppose private business evening when after the day business have finish on wednesday three hour be set aside for opposed private business doubt this would be oppose think we could get this through incredibly quickly and we would not be ask the house to take much of its time to approve this measure but it be such an important step and urge my right hon friend the minister and the whip on duty the vice chamberlain of his majesty household my hon friend the member for bury st edmunds jo churchill to really press this point home with the business manager piece of legislation be ready to go and it have universal support in this house and in the other place it would be such great thing if those of we go to ghana this year for the cpc could stand up hold our head high and say we listen and as the uk we take the step you ask we to take that would make an enormous difference my second point be around the importance and value of multilateral organisation particularly those for parliamentarian as the chair of the british group inter parliamentary union and an active member of the commonwealth parliamentary association uk want the house to know that those organisation present such important opportunity look around do not think that anyone here have not be on delegation for at least one of they we also have the british irish parliamentary assembly which be very honoured to co chair the british american parliamentary group and we now have our new eu friendship group these thing be very important if we do not understand what we be do here as parliamentarian and understand what be happen in other parliaments we simply be not go to develop and learn or be able to tackle important global issue we all have common goal here the inter parliamentary union recently host an important inter faith dialogue in marrakesh that mark the first time that it have bring together civil society faith group and parliamentarian it be the first time that we see together in one room representative from all the major faith on this planet they be all there talk about our common goal such as climate change and global migration which affect we all parliamentarian have real role to play not only in help government to get the necessary legislation through in these area but in influence our constituent organisation and those around we the cpa be the only organisation that include all the devolved legislature the provincial legislature the state legislature the overseas territory and the crown dependency parliamentarian from all those organisation take part in cpa event and that be such powerful and important thing for help we to understand that we have share problem that require share solution that take on to the shared problem that we have regard modern slavery and human trafficking cpa uk have be world leader on this issue when be the minister for modern slavery in the home office in cpa uk be lead the work that could be do by parliamentarian around the world the commonwealth have an important role to play in tackle this issue full stop because it contain source country transit country and destination country for victim of trafficking the leadership that the commonwealth can show help to change legislation globally and the cpa help to ensure that legislation change at parliamentary level in every one of our parliaments have take part in many event that cpa uk have host here have speak about issue at global delegation and can not praise cpa uk and its team enough for the global lead that they play this be such an important organisation the government have an opportunity here to do very small thing with bit of government time to get this legislation through it would make an amazing difference and it would absolutely solidify cpa uk and the cpa place in this parliament rise as former chair of the cpa and the ipu do not know whether should be declare an interest but just have no pressure minister before begin my speech want to put on the record my thank to jon davies who be our retire chief executive of the cpa cpa uk have benefit enormously from jon diplomatic skill and diligence over the year like you mr deputy speaker should perhaps declare an interest as member of the executive committee of cpa uk have only just speak so be grateful to my right hon friend for give way he remind that we hear about jon davies incredible diplomatic skill at yesterday agm we also hear from our hon friend the member for blackpool north and cleveleys paul maynard that jon davies be able to remove bird poo from member of parliament in the most discreet way imaginable think we should put on the record that that be great skill and one that cpa uk have value laughter do not think there be anything that can be say in response to that particular point but know jon to be multiskille from my own experience of he begin by slightly disagree with my hon friend the member for rochford and southend east sir james duddridge which have of course never do previously in that this issue do impact on major global issue particularly russia my experience have twice lead delegation to south africa be that russia very much want to extend its influence into south africa and into africa it be exactly the inertia of the uk and its colonialist view that be use to take that forward the delegation lead be denounce in the south african parliament by the economic freedom fighters which to be fair be an extreme group its member stand up and decry our delegation as neo colonialist and condemn the commonwealth and the commonwealth parliamentary association not act on this issue give succour to people make that argument and it give succour to russia which fan the flame of that argument last year meet the deputy speaker of the south african parliament as part of the delegation and that be the first issue he raise with year later meet he again and what have we do my hon friend the member for bridgwater and west somerset mr liddell grainger have have debate and effectively have brush off but we have do nothing to move this issue forward we be not able to convince commonwealth colleague that we be take this issue seriously if we simply do nothing we can have this debate today where we be placate at the end and nothing happen but action be require intervene not to compliment my right hon friend on his tie but to make more serious point on the meeting yesterday which be attend by mr speaker who like you mr deputy speaker have passion for these thing be not sure how these thing operate but be there an opportunity to have some type of speaker conference or an informal meeting where mr speaker bring together the leader of the house and the foreign secretary give they tea and maybe chocolate biscuit lock the door and do not let they out until we have resolve this issue engagement with speaker from across the commonwealth be important because at the session attend in south africa the speaker of the south african parliament have just return from conference in russia from which overture be be make honestly if have to go back to south africa it would be great pleasure to do so again third time would have to say to south african parliamentarian who want to be supportive of the commonwealth and the commonwealth parliamentary association that yet again we have do nothing as my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller have set out it be so straightforward to take action it do not require government fund it require small amount of time it have cross party agreement and it could be do essentially we be in the position of run out of excuse for why we be not do it there will be real implication as have be set out the cpa will leave london it will leave this parliament and we will be diminish because of it secondly along with my right hon and hon friend meet the speaker of the ghanaian parliament where we discuss our concern about prospective lgbt legislation and in effect ask for that legislation to be reflect on and ask he and his fellow parliamentarian to take the issue seriously but how can we do that credibly when he say that he want we to take step to amend the status of the commonwealth parliamentary association suggest that be much easy for we than the change we want he to use his influence to make in the ghanaian parliament and we do nothing that undermine our credibility surely we can not allow that to happen hope that the result of the debate will be different from those of previous debate and question raise on the matter and that the minister will take forward the bill promote by my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller before the commonwealth conference in ghana to maintain our credibility as nation and as parliament and maintain the presence of the cpa in the uk thank my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller for secure this important debate on the status of the commonwealth parliamentary association echo many comment make by colleague we must address the status of the cpa before the upcoming parliamentary meeting in accra in september be here as member of the cpa executive committee to lend my support and to try to persuade the government that we must change the cpa status from uk charity to an international inter parliamentary organisation welcome my right hon friend bill to address the issue and ensure that the cpa do not relocate to another commonwealth country the uk branch of the cpa be well known and one of the most active in the commonwealth we have be talk about this issue for several year in the cpa present the uk government with the business case for the status change which state in all respect the cpa operate in practice as an international inter parliamentary organisation but the cpa have the legal status of an english charity it would not usually be expect that an organisation such as the cpa would be charity give the nature of the cpa and the work it carry out let give some example of issue that arise owe to the cpa have be charity since the cpa as charity be limit in its ability to carry out certain activity that promote democracy human right and democratic value and protect the right and privilege of parliamentarian that be because as we know restriction on charity prevent they from pursue political purpose the cpa have also be unable to sign up to certain international statement and communiqué because of its charitable status we have be unable to join other international organisation in speak out against event in commonwealth country recent example include the unlawful imprisonment of parliamentarian not be able to speak out about the treatment of parliamentarian and the situation over the rohingya those example show exactly why we must change the cpa status recently meet the cpa secretary general and he be fully supportive of the status change there will be some serious consequence if we do not change the cpa status to an international inter parliamentary organisation first believe as several right hon and hon member have allude to that if the uk do not make that change the cpa headquarters will relocate to another commonwealth country we can think of our proud tradition with the cpa found in the uk parliament back in and it have always be here we do not want to lose the opportunity of have more than commonwealth parliaments turn to the uk parliament for advice guidance and good practice and to uphold parliamentary democracy the cpa relocate from the uk would damage the uk parliament relationship with other commonwealth parliaments secondly we must listen and respect the voice of other commonwealth parliamentarian who have express strong dissatisfaction other colleague have mention the concern raise by other parliaments for example just last year the southern african region of the cpa africa group express its displeasure at the uk hesitancy to legislate to change the status of the cpa and say that it believe it be disadvantageous to africa the south african national assembly deputy speaker mr tsenoli have also express concern that the cpa africa region contribute close to of the cpa budget and that money be only to be use in the cpa in the uk change the status would allow more cpa parliaments in africa and other region around the world to have great confidence in our work it be important that today we be see as equal partner that be what the commonwealth be all about thirdly as uk charity the cpa can not achieve observer status at the united nations we currently do not have diplomatic status or international recognition it be important that we change that as soon as possible which can be achieve by turn we into an international inter parliamentary organisation have be member of the cpa executive as new member of parliament can truly say that it be remarkable and impactful organisation just last month chair its woman and trade workshop here in parliament look at promote human right through international trade there be discussion on bilateral and regional trade look at how we can advance human right standard globally which remind of the importance of the cpa bring together parliamentarian from across the commonwealth and ensure that we be learn good practice be one of the area that the cpa promote and support be also delighted back in to attend the world trade organisation public forum in geneva my trip be support by the cpa through its trip budget at that meeting have the privilege of meet dr ngozi okongo iweala the wto director general and of speak at the eastern african trade for resilience forum that be an example of where cpa do vital work for we as uk parliamentarian strongly support the need for we to change the status of the cpa from uk charity to an international inter parliamentary organisation we do fantastic work it would make the uk more respected at the cpa which be brilliant fantastic organisation fellow parliamentarian around the world have say to that they be look for we to sort this out hope the minister will provide the commitment we need at the dispatch box today to ensure that we can go to that meeting in accra in september hope that the government will find parliamentary time to approve the bill commonwealth day mark new chapter in the age of decolonisation new monarch with new perspective towards the commonwealth the annual theme be forge sustainable and common future and intend to highlight the promotion of peace and sustainability and the commonwealth work on change the day also mark the anniversary of the signing of the commonwealth charter which set out commonwealth principle on human right democracy and development the head of the commonwealth use his commonwealth day message to discuss harmony with nature and secure the planet for generation to come as well as the diversity of the commonwealth nation that significant and historic milestone be the perfect opportunity to reflect on the impact of the commonwealth acknowledge the damage of british colonial history and begin to pave the way to more conscious respectful and thoughtful relationship with commonwealth country we be already begin to see the tide change in recent month people across the world be reassess what the commonwealth mean and how it can be adapt for the benefit of all to well match century world we in the scottish national party be particularly mindful of the role of the commonwealth as an advocate for the need of small and more vulnerable state and for the inclusion of marginalised people and community wish to reaffirm the snp policy of join the commonwealth post independence because we want to join the world not be apart from it on independence scotland will continue to play role in the commonwealth and the wide anglosphere that will help to far unlock the potential of powerful international scottish brand and worldwide diaspora the scottish government be already work on effort to acknowledge and act on the legacy of colonialism their global affair framework focus on the need to decolonise development and reinforce the fact that project must be partner lead rather than donor lead as be too often the case they pledge to appoint decolonisation officer within an independent scotland department of international development the scottish government explicitly reference their colonial past when announce their million contribution subsequently increase to million to fund loss and damage cause by climate change key recipient of the fund will be the commonwealth country of malawi former first minister nicola sturgeon frame the contribution not as an act of charity but as reparation for the damage drive by country in the global north through its promotion of parliamentary democracy and good governance specifically target at parliamentarian the cpa provide vehicle for we to collaborate with our parliamentary colleague across the commonwealth and advance these cause however we must recognise as other think everybody have state that the cpa status as uk charity be not appropriate for an association of equal from across the commonwealth and that it reinforce an out of date vision of the commonwealth and the uk place in it we must listen to our partner in particular those from the african region of the cpa who hold this view most strongly on their real concern about the appropriateness of charitable status and the fact that their parliaments make subscription payment from their taxpayer money to uk charity it be therefore important that the status of the cpa be change from uk charity to an international interparliamentary organisation and that it be do so immediately that would take little parliamentary time and would involve no additional cost to the uk or to uk taxpayer with resolution agree to retain the right to withdraw from the organisation should change in status not be conclude by the cpa annual conference this october there be real danger that the organisation may fragment which would be serious blow to the uk soft power at time when other country be push very different version of governance in many part of the world this be not time to reduce the uk commitment and role in the world for while the commonwealth adopt charter full of laudable aspiration about justice democracy and human right the organisation have an unimpressive record in enforce adherence to those value as parliamentarian we must stand up for those value through the cpa to take just one example the commonwealth take no action when in january ugandan president yoweri museveni clung to power after deeply flawed election in may the ugandan president sign into law one of the harsh anti lgbtq law in the world it stipulate capital punishment for serial offender against the law and the transmission of terminal illness such as hiv aids through gay sex it decree an abhorrent year sentence for promote homosexuality the legislation also require friend family and neighbour to denounce people in same sex relationship to the authority one ugandan mp sarah opendi suggest that gay man should be castrate while uganda be the most egregious recent example such anti gay rhetoric and politicking be replicate across the commonwealth homosexuality remain criminal offence in two third of the commonwealth brunei another commonwealth country make gay sex punishable by stone to death with public flogging for lesbian sex in malaysia commonwealth member be one of only few country to criminalise gender non conformity while also penalise oral and anal sex with up to year in prison and mandatory whipping human rights watch report last year the commonwealth must stand for the right of minority and persecute community in member state and organisation such as the cpa must play key role in that the uk be the commonwealth chair in office between and june think that we can all now recognise that this be miss opportunity to drive meaningful social change in march my hon friend the member for glasgow north east anne mclaughlin speak in this house about the fact there be little time remain to make positive impact she stress that the uk should be make haste after two year of painstakingly slow progress we can all appreciate that there be global pandemic and no one will be in any doubt about how difficult that be and how it hamper these effort however the lack of urgent effort by the uk government to regain ground follow the pandemic have be particularly concern the uk government should have use the extended four year period in chair to ensure that the commonwealth nation many of which be develop country get the covid vaccine they desperately need alongside the rest of the global south instead the uk government hoard vaccine and disgracefully block wto trip trade relate aspects of intellectual property rights waiver indeed in july commonwealth leader from all member state issue joint statement include commitment to ensure equitable access to quality health service and safe effective and affordable medicine and vaccine for all as one who be involve in that process while accept criticism do not think it be entirely found give the background to the vaccine we be get will the hon gentleman at least commend the united kingdom government for the covax facility and for actually get the vaccine in place perhaps there be slightly more balanced scorecard and would be even more positive about our involvement than the hon gentleman but will he note those success fully take on board the hon member explanation of how deal with covid be success in the early day but as we see as time go on it begin increasingly to fail there be lesson to be learn last autumn for example be in cape town look at company call afrigen and its hub to reverse engineer mrna to supply vaccine to country that be suffer through the bad stage of the pandemic and in many case have no access to vaccine from the global north would like to see the uk government support that work because there be vital opportunity for home grow small hub to make vaccine for their own community most egregiously of all during the uk four year as chair the uk government pull significant aid spend out of key commonwealth nation in another sign that the uk do not or seem not to care about the commonwealth nation that send the wrong message to all our commonwealth partner let we take pakistan for example for the fiscal year the uk government have decide to cut bilateral aid by more than compare with the previous year analysis by the commonwealth innovation fund project that the number of people in extreme poverty in the commonwealth would rise from million in to million in that be disgraceful and some blame must be lay at the foot of the uk government the uk can not claim to have compassionate co operative and international outlook while simultaneously slash its contribution to low income country include many in the commonwealth the moral and economic leadership on this from this uk government have be want as have say repeatedly in the house if the commonwealth as an organisation be to continue it must adapt and become an organisation fit for the century bring the cpa into line with other parliamentary organisation around the world by urgently change its status before its annual meeting later this year would be vital step if we be to have the modern and inclusive commonwealth that we all desire action must be take and we need to see that action urgently call the shadow minister thank you mr deputy speaker and may say how exciting it be to see you in the chair give that you be great champion of the cpa and indeed host visit from another speaker just this week that of course be the speaker of the cyprus parliament who be also great supporter of the commonwealth the visit give we an opportunity to renew our effort to establish peace deal in cyprus and also give we tiny taste of the importance of this network to we all many of we have benefit from the cpa work either take part in outbound delegation or host visit delegation here in westminster it be crucial that we support the government in order to effect this important legislative change be also aware of those who work tirelessly behind the scene support the operation of parliaments throughout the commonwealth our clerks for example spread good practice and discuss the key value that we all share good governance democracy and human right the hon member for dundee west chris law give very good example today of the lgbtq challenge and thank he very much for that want to put on record that labour be keen to see the cpa headquarter here in westminster we think that be right and proper we also agree that be the mother of all parliaments give we wonderful track record when it come to promote that our way of do thing with fused legislature and executive system be commonly know as the westminster system grow up with it myself down under and we should be proud of the cpa ongoing role in bring together and liaise between the parliaments of the commonwealth family from the very building that inspire the way in which most of the commonwealth be govern today this debate have give we great opportunity to praise the commonwealth more widely as the modern institution it now be one of which we can all be proud as well as be visit by the speaker from the cypriot house of representatives early in the week just last night we hear the climate minister from vanuatu ralph regenvanu speak about the challenge surround climate change vanuatu be of course very important member of the commonwealth the commonwealth have continue to evolve from post colonial grouping as it be at its inception to voluntary organisation with grow membership and global network it be particularly involve in the empowerment of our young people give that so many commonwealth country be predominantly young we think of pakistan for example as very young nation organisation in my constituency of hornsey and wood green jump at the chance to participate in the queen green canopy project for her late majesty diamond jubilee inspire by the fact that organisation throughout the commonwealth be similarly committed to that project to increase tree cover vital step in tackle climate change in far off place such as pakistan and bangladesh which be so regularly subject to intense change in climate the current head of the commonwealth his majesty the king have dedicate his life to the issue of climate change and be sure he will continue to champion that today debate be vital in support that good work and ensure that the cpa be not force to uproot itself concern have be raise about whether the cpa as uk register charity be in an appropriate form to continue to support the commonwealth give its disparate nature and the compete need and engagement of the parliaments it champion that have be raise at the high level baroness scotland the secretary general of the commonwealth have be press for change in status she have be vocal about the need for the upcoming cpa conference in ghana to be point of resolution for an issue that have hang over the organisation for year just this year the foreign office have commit to work with the cpa to find solution and member have suggest practical way forward last month the prime minister go far confirm the government view that they do not wish the cpa to relocate away from westminster as have be note during the debate our french partner have address similar issue with the francophone version of the cpa will the minister outline any further update on what the prime minister tell the house last month and at prime minister question just the week before last and signal how the government intend to sort the issue out before conclude let put on the record the importance of the work in this area by woman it be terrific that both the ipu and the cpa be chair by woman here in our parliament know how encouraging that be when we have delegation and how much can be share in woman only forum we be commit to keep all that go from position of strength once we have sort out this minor detail to be clear if no action be take in the very near future we will run the real risk of the cpa have to leave westminster we clearly have the political will we can see that today and the support of the commonwealth family our depart chief executive have do fantastic job as have our current secretary general the former member for enfield southgate and for liverpool west derby we have some fantastic people behind the scene support the cpa important work if we fail to get this right it will deal real blow to the role of this house and of the government on the world stage it will be see as symbol of our lack of commitment our inertia as someone say during the debate and damage the potential of this grow and unique global organisation just at the time we should be redouble our effort to engage with our commonwealth partner and seek to expand the commonwealth be grateful to my right hon friend the member for basingstoke dame maria miller for secure the debate and for her dedication to the commonwealth include as chair of the executive committee of the commonwealth parliamentary association uk thank all member who make passionate and very clear speech about the urgency of this issue as

necessary since then fcdo official have be in discussion with cpa international to understand the need to vary its present charitable status and to consider how good to address these concern although this work be ongoing important progress have already be make my right hon friend come to this issue quite fresh which be possibly an advantage there have be numerous mention of the work between the

midday today but will happily take it away my official in the box will support in provide that information my right hon friend be right that find the right way through to secure workable change to the

manage the business of the house which be the government they could find time even though there be no sit fridays surely she could undertake to go away and consider that perhaps with the help of the leader of the house who look after such thing my right hon friend pre empt it be interesting to hear the expertise of my right hon friend the member for staffordshire moorlands karen bradley who in

enable access to the climate finance need to help they deliver that fully accept what my right hon friend be say about our commitment to the commonwealth she have set out number of positive thing that be be do but do she not accept that other force want to destabilise the commonwealth and do not want to see it continue in its current form do she accept that do nothing on this issue be the sort of thing that feed into that narrative my right hon friend be absolutely right to say that there be those who wish to destabilise the international order and rule base system and that the positive co operative nature of the commonwealth demonstrate what friendship and long relationship can bring together it do not suit those who wish to disrupt the success of those relationship we have to continue

be banana skin that we need to remove my right hon friend the member for staffordshire moorlands karen bradley bring up number of pertinent issue about restrict the work of the organisation it be wholly within our power to be able to change the status of the organisation so that it can do the good that it can above all the debate have focus on the need to respect our fellow parliamentarian around the commonwealth who have ask we to find way to change the status of the organisation we owe they the respect to demonstrate that we be able to do that and not be characterise as matron know good which be very poor look for we hope the debate have uncover way that can be find to secure the legislative change require we must not continue to argue about whether that be need or not because it have be request or continue to look for barrier in term of parliamentary time but opportunity my hon friend the member for rochford and southend east sir james duddridge be right that where there be will there be way there be creative mind in this place to enable the westminster delegation to go to the commonwealth parliamentary conference in september and october to acclaim the government action and to show that we be sensitive to the opinion of commonwealth parliamentarian so that we be not dictate through inertia but facilitate the change they be ask for we must not leave this valuable organisation open to what could be very difficult decision to leave the uk and find home elsewhere that would be tragic and do not think that be what my right hon friend the minister want to see question put and agree to resolve that this house support the work of the commonwealth parliamentary association ask for parliamentary time at the early opportunity to change the status of the commonwealth parliamentary association from uk charity to an international inter parliamentary organisation and call on the government to effect that change petition petition laughton common footpath

the propanolol tablet definitely would have help emily condition staff have to give she an antidote to the drug the circumstance that lead to emily chesterton death be investigate by coroner with hearing at st pancras coroner court on march the coroner hear from representative of the vale practice emily mother emily partner and the physician associate who have see emily message from emily to her partner and family at the time of her appointment be also share with the inquest these message evidence emily belief that she be see doctor they also evidence that the appointment with the physician associate be short and that emily be not examine fully the conclusion of the coroner be emily chesterton die from pulmonary embolism natural cause of death she attend her general practitioner surgery on the morning of october and november with calf pain and shortness of breath and be see by the same physician associate on both occasion she should have be immediately refer to hospital emergency unit if she have be on either occasion the likelihood be that she would have be treat for pulmonary embolism and would have survive that be heartbreaking statement make clear the failing in the health system which should have support emily with appropriate care further failing be evidence in the incident report from the vale practice which be provide by the practice to the coroner failing of the physician associate identify by the gp practice include not introduce herself to emily during the appointment not allow emily partner to accompany she into the consultation room despite this request be make and despite emily be vulnerable because of her illness not explore the potential cause of emily breathlessness not document the severity of that emily have suffer from month early not explore why emily feel clammy not document whether oxygen saturation reading after exertion or respiratory rate reading be take in line with clinical guideline and not refer emily for an electrocardiogram blood test or other clinical investigation also in line with clinical guideline crucially the physician associate do not seek medical advice after see patient who have present twice in one week with significant risk factor for pulmonary embolism such as polycystic ovary syndrome recent contraction of covid calf pain and breathlessness and she send emily home without consult doctor the practice later raise concern about the physician associate knowledge and understanding of what appropriate investigation she should perform in patient presenting with symptom post covid about her ability to recognise an unwell patient and escalate such concern to doctor and about her over confidence and lack of insight into the limitation of her own clinical knowledge and practice two week after conduct the serious incident review the practice make collective decision to terminate the contract of the particular physician associate as she appear to be unable to co operate with the practice supervision requirement then decision be make not to employ physician associate go forward despite that mrs chesterton tell that the particular physician associate be still practise medicine in the nhs in london as locum she ask how be this possible this case raise serious question about the wide use of physician associate in the nhs and particularly about allow the provision of unsupervised one to one consultation in general practice nhs information say that physician associate be graduate who have undertake relevant postgraduate training and that they work under the supervision of doctor they will have be educate on medical model with basic medical skill but they lack formal professional regulation and they do not have prescribing right most physician associate work in general practice acute medicine and emergency medicine the physician associate role be introduce into the uk year ago have to say that before look into this case have never hear of the physician associate role but it appear it have be around that long in an attempt to address workforce shortage in underserved primary care practice the role be base on the physician assistant role in the united states which date back to the physician associate be expect to be under the supervision of designate medical practitioner but that do not appear to have be the case with the lack of supervision that occur in the case of emily chesterton when qualified medical professional such as gps be already stretch it be easy to see how task such as check the note and work of physician associate could be miss there be also the problem of the title of the role which marion chesterton tell sound extremely grand even grand than general practitioner she suggest that the name should change to doctor apprentice learner doctor or probationary doctor to avoid confusion and it should be make very clear who patient be see marion chesterton also tell we only discover that the medic treat emily be not doctor the week before the inquest this cause we extreme distress she ask could something be put into place to keep family fully aware early on in the process crucially it be very concern that there be no statutory registration system for physician associate there be only voluntary register in july the department of health and social care announce plan for the general medical council to regulate physician associate pende the passing of new legislation after consultation in the timetable for regulation have be beset with delay the royal college of physicians and the faculty of physician associates have call these delay frustrating and disappointing it be not until february this year that the draft legislation be publish and put out to public consultation when will the government respond to the consultation and when do the minister expect the legislation to regulate physician associate to be debate and approve it have be as say year since the role be introduce in as the minister may know the hon member for newton abbot anne marie morris promote the physician associates regulation bill private member bill in the government commit to regulate physician associate that be four year ago now the royal college of physicians and the faculty of physician associates have lead the regulatepasnow campaign since may last year the faculty for physician associates say we believe that regulation be fundamental to ensure that physician associate remain safe and effective workforce in the future we also know that regulate physician associate have public support petition call for the statutory regulation of physician associate be sign by nearly member of the public it be clear that the legislation underpin the regulation of medical practitioner be now in urgent need of reform the medical act be now year old and the general medical council have describe it as complex overly prescriptive and slow to adapt to change it have take the government too long to recognise that and progress be happen at snail pace what will the minister do from today to ensure the safety of patient be treat by physician associate what measure will he introduce to ensure that patient know the role and qualification of the person they be see when attend appointment in general practice setting those question be become increasingly press as more people enter the physician associate role there be currently more than qualified physician associate work in the uk although the number look relatively small at the moment the general medical council expect they to grow steadily in the next few year with one study estimate project growth of per year growth in the number of physician associate will be turbocharge by proposal in the government recently publish nhs long term workforce plan the plan aim to more than triple the number of physician associate in the nhs workforce in the next year by they will total with around train annually from this year and train each year in year time in response to the government long term workforce plan latifa patel of the british medical association say that the propose wide use of physician associate must come with clear boundary around expectation and not impact on the training of medical student and doctor the coroner conclude that the poor quality of care give to emily chesterton by the physician associate at vale practice contribute to her death that concern deeply and it should concern the minister too the government must now move quickly to regulate physician associate and learn from the event that lead to the sad and tragic death of emily chesterton want to finish with the word of emily mother marion we feel extremely let down by the care provide by the gp practice we have lose our precious beautiful kind loving talented and irreplaceable daughter and this must not be allow to happen to any other family let start by thank the hon member for worsley and eccles south barbara keeley for secure this important debate and for her very powerful speech it be very difficult to hear her recite marion word first on behalf of the house may pass on my sincere condolence and sympathy to the hon lady constituent marion and brendan chesterton in relation to their daughter emily no family should have to suffer the loss of child and my heart go out to they and of course to emily friend and wide family have personal experience know that no word from could ever take away the pain or the suffering of lose child but certainly understand the need to understand why and how this happen and the need for an assurance that any lesson that can be learn will be learn that necessary change be make and that all step be explore so that any future family will not go through similar tragic loss have have sight of the hon lady recent letter to the secretary of state for health and social care although will not be able to answer all the specific question she raise today not least because have not yet have chance to read the coroner report or have specific information from nhs england will ensure that she receive full response to the letter and the point and question contain therein improved patient safety and care lie at the heart of the nhs long term workforce plan which back by significant government investment show our determination to support and grow the healthcare force as set out in the plan role such as physician associate play an important role in nhs provision but critically healthcare team remain supervised and lead by clinical expert it be right that we include range of role and skill in our multidisciplinary team that can offer personalised responsive care to patient give staff access to continue development supportive supervision and importantly protect time for training be core responsibility for all employer in ensure patient safety as set out in national institute for health and care excellence guideline we be clear that the onus be on the individual professional to properly explain their role to patient especially if there be likelihood of this not be automatically understand know that nhs england have produce patient face material that have be share widely with gp practice to support patient awareness and the understanding of role physician associate be healthcare professional but with generalist medical education who work alongside doctor provide medical care as an integral part of multidisciplinary team physician associate can work autonomously but importantly always under the supervision of fully train and experienced doctor they add new talent to the skill mix within team provide stable generalist section of the workforce that can help ease the workforce pressure that the nhs currently face as the hon lady rightly say across the uk there be currently approximately pa work in hospital and further pa work in primary care setting physician associate be qualified and train health professional and people will usually need bioscience relate undergraduate degree to get on to one of the training programme available which typically last for two year the training involve at least hour of clinical training include hour in general hospital medicine and minimum of hour in other setting include mental health surgery and paediatric some become physician associate after work in another healthcare role such as nurse ally health professional or midwife as the hon lady will be aware physician associate be not currently subject to statutory regulation and hear her call in that regard it be important to note that as an unregulated role physician associate be not able to prescribe in order to prescribe as she rightly point out role need to be add to the human medicines regulations any prescribing decision must be make by regulate professional such as doctor work be ongoing to bring this role into regulation under the general medical council in an appropriate way the faculty of physician associates at the royal college of physicians provide professional support to pa across the united kingdom in term of standard the faculty review and set standard for the education training and national certification of physician associate the faculty also oversee and administer the running of manage voluntary register which be register of fully qualified pa who have be declare fit to practise in the united kingdom understand that the majority of qualified physician associate be on this register when complaint be receive and uphold in line with the faculty code of conduct process it can suspend physician associate from the voluntary register we would strongly recommend that employer only consider recruit pa who be on the voluntary register it enable supervisor and employer to check whether physician associate be qualified and safe to work in the united kingdom take what the minister have say about the training and voluntary registration aspect which do speak to but could he comment on the situation we seem to have be in the gp practice have concern about the physician associate knowledge and understanding of what investigation she should perform her ability to recognise an unwell patient and her overconfidence and lack of insight into the limitation of her own knowledge those be the issue that the gp practice itself report do the minister share my concern that it be very serious thing to have have system like that and surround that to have the fact that the reception function in that practice do not realise that it should not refer an unwell patient to physician associate twice within short period of time if these be mean to be safety measure they be not work be they hear what the hon lady say in response to her question we very much need to look into the exact detail and hope will be able to respond to she with full answer when have receive both the coroner report and further information from nhs england regard the practice itself on the face of what she have just say the situation be concern and it certainly add weight to her call for the register to be non voluntary and for regulation and legislation in this space will come on to that issue in moment because it be case well make the physician associate role be in no way replacement for any other member of the general practice team that be an important point to make they work in conjunction with the exist team and be complementary to it physician associate can help broaden the capacity and skill mix within the practice team to help address the need of patient in response to the grow and age population face by constituency up and down the country include the hon lady constituency and indeed mine however let be clear the employment of physician associate do not in any way mitigate the need to address the shortage of gps nor do it reduce the need for other practice staff will talk not about the specific case that the hon lady describe do not have those detail but about the generality of the responsibility of supervising doctor which may be relevant in this case physician associate be dependent practitioner they be work with dedicated consultant or gp supervisor they be able to work autonomously but vitally with appropriate support and the general medical council have publish guidance for doctor who supervise physician associate the supervision of qualified physician associate be similar to that of doctor in training or trust grade doctor in that the physician associate be responsible for their action and decision however the medical consultant or gp supervisor ultimately retain responsibility for the patient the hon lady have call for regulation as she allude to the general medical council be well advanced in develop regulatory process for physician associate once the necessary legislation be in place and regulation will give the gmc responsibility for and oversight of physician associate and anaesthesia associate in addition to doctor that will enable more coherent and co ordinate approach to regulation and make it easy for employer patient and of course the public to understand the relationship between the role the hon lady ask specifically when that legislation will come forward we intend to lay legislation before the house at the end of this year which will allow the gmc to commence the regulation of physician associate by the end of legislation by the end of this year and then year for it to be put in place the general medical council have publish future professional standard for physician associate among other thing that include work within the bound of professional competence and know when to refer or indeed to escalate to colleague within the practice those standard also cover communication with patient include the importance of physician associate explain what they do and how their role fit in with other member of the medical team once regulation commence the gmc will be able to investigate concern raise about physician associate and in serious case will be able to prevent physician associate from practise either on temporary or permanent basis want to go back to the point make to the minister about the title of physician associate which have use lot and so have he the point be that it do sound rather grandiose as the name of role in clinical practice for person who have train for only two year and it be confusing have be steep in health and social care matter in this place have be member of the health committee and have front bench responsibility for it and have never hear of physician associate so it do seem confusing the title itself be confusing thank the hon lady for her intervention and give careful thought to the point she raise in her speech although the term she use be doctor in training or trainee doctor physician associate be not doctor in training and they be not doctor they be very different but they be part of multidisciplinary team will take away what she say she be right that they have be in place for well in excess of year but nevertheless there be still relatively small number of they however there be plan to significantly grow their number so will take that away personally as part of my own experience of the nhs have never see physician associate but when have be in general practice have often see paramedic physiotherapist or pharmacist and they have make their position very clear at the outset of the appointment think we need to ensure that regardless of the title will take that away and look in some detail at whether it need to be change they be properly introduce themselves and their role make it very clear to patient that they be not doctor but be work under the close supervision of one and make it very clear that they be not able to prescribe but doctor can think that be the most important point but the hon lady raise very good point about the title and will consider that very carefully think this be actually relate to the confidence one have or do not have the minister say he take advice from pharmacist as do most of we but we tend to know in that circumstance that it be pharmacist we be talk to there be receptionist physio and all these type of people work in gp practice but this be person who to all intent and purpose look like doctor that knowledge of the short period of their training and of what they can actually do and not do really ought to be more visible hear what the hon lady say and will certainly take that away and give it considerable thought if she have any particular idea in this regard give her experience on this matter would of course be very happy to meet she to discuss this far it be really important certainly ahead of legislation that we get this right before close would again like to reiterate my deep condolence to the family of emily and thank the hon lady once again for bring this debate to the house as we develop and progress with change to the nhs workforce it be absolutely vital that robust governance and supervision sit at the heart of the multidisciplinary model because at the heart of everything we do must be patient safety question put and agree to house adjourn
