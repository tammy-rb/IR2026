confidence be slump family business be close millionaire be flee the country and that be before tariff hit what representation be the minister make to the chancellor about reverse some of the measure that hit business in her budget have think that one of the first contribution from the opposition front benchers today would be to celebrate the billion investment by ikea in the uk it be open its flagship store on oxford street today and commit to range of investment in other town and city across the uk when the hon lady be on the treasury committee do not know whether she look at the cut the

israel the republic of korea switzerland and türkiye we have also begin talk with the united states on an economic prosperity deal and we support the cabinet office with trade aspect of the eu reset give the utter unreliability and frankly economic illiteracy of president trump and give that the eu be by far our large trading partner it be clear that the good interest of the uk be serve by our have deal that allow the close possible co ordination with the eu do the minister agree with that that should cover youth mobility and improve energy and climate co operation specifically will he work with his colleague to ensure that we ease burden for british business by link the uk and eu emission trading scheme and by align on chemical regulation to boost british productivity and prosperity think that be few question but we seem to have time for they today so welcome all of they first of all recognise exactly what the hon lady say when it come to the importance of the eu as principal trading partner for this country the figure speak for themselves disagree with she about we have to choose between the us and the eu or any other market believe that the uk can be well position for all market there will be strong political view in this place about political leader in range of country but would just say to she that when it come to the united states there be potentially thousand of job at stake that be why we be pursue trade and economic prosperity deal with the us and think we can not get away from that on the question relate to the eu successful negotiation take two party want to see great co operation would not talk about the specific of any part of the negotiation but would not want the kind of barrier that she identify to be in place want the uk to have the good and most frictionless trade possible with the eu in way that be consistent with our aspiration and obligation with the rest of the world but she have make her point very well and recognise it declare an interest as the trade envoy to new zealand what conversation have the secretary of state have recently with his new zealand counterpart on the implementation of the uk new zealand free trade agreement first let thank my hon friend for all her work as our trade envoy to new zealand she know because she be present that on his visit to the uk new zealand prime minister luxon spend the day with the prime minister and be able to spend considerable time with he in the afternoon we discuss the implementation of the uk new zealand fta as well as the comprehensive and progressive agreement for trans pacific partnership and the importance of work together to support free trade and to protect rule base trading system we be work to ensure that business be use the fta to support the government growth agenda and the plan for change later this month we will host the uk new zealand fta joint committee which will discuss continue to grow uk and new zealand trade call the shadow minister it be good to hear that the trade negotiation with india which begin when we be in government be progress well there must surely now be an opportunity to reopen talk with canada so it can buy more wonderful cheese from the uk with the tariff clock tick be sure the secretary of state recognise that the us deal be the most urgent many uk job be at risk however we hear recently from the chancellor when she be in the states that her big priority be discussion with the eu where we already have zero tariff and zero quota do the secretary of state share the chancellor priority or do he think the us be more urgent thank the hon lady for the early part of her comment she be right that we want the previous government to secure the india fta and we be willing to support they fully in do that but they be unable to get it across the line with canada there be issue particularly around agriculture that be similar to those involve the us so that may be more of challenging negotiation the entirety of this government however have be clear that we be not seek to pick between one market and another both be absolutely fundamental the chancellor comment specifically relate to the simple truth that there be much great quantum of uk eu trade than uk us trade equally though in all these negotiation we have to focus on not just what can be do quickly but what can be do right and in the national interest there be no point secure an agreement that do not deliver on our objective no matter whom that agreement be with we will welcome any support from the conservatives for the work we be try to do do believe it be easy politically for this government to do some trade agreement that be available to the uk some may not have be politically available to the conservative government we will continue to do that work and we welcome all support for it from across the house call the liberal democrat spokesperson yesterday ask the prime minister whether parliament will get final vote on any trade deal negotiate with the united states and the prime minister state that it would go through the know process that process do not include vote for mps on the ratification of any trade deal will the secretary of state therefore make it explicitly clear with yes or no whether mps will get final vote on the deal with the united states the pm answer yesterday imply that we would not the answer as the hon gentleman know be no we be not in this government seek to change the ratification process for any treaty he know the process and how it work the constitutional reform and governance act set out that process it allow mp to scrutinise any treaty agree with country and present to the house the implementation of any aspect of any treaty still have to come to parliament of course it be not the case that any agreement on any kind of international treaty can supersede what we agree in this place in that process all member of parliament get the same right and privilege quite rightly but no we be not propose change to the process by which we agree treaty with other country uk europe trade what step his department be take to help support trade with european country as we have just be discuss increase trade with european country be and have be focus of discussion between ministers in the department for business and trade and their eu counterpart recently meet ministers from spain france denmark poland and germany and work be under way on the first uk eu summit schedule to take place on may trade and the economy will form one element of broad agenda about our strategic partnership across wide europe we be negotiate an enhance free trade agreement with switzerland which we hope will strengthen our trading relationship there the uk economic relationship with sweden be among the most important of our economic relationship with our european partner particularly with sweden have recently join nato as the minister will know babcock be pursue partnership with saab to build four luleå class corvette for sweden that would involve significant work at rosyth dockyard and secure thousand of job in my constituency this would be joint export product bring considerable further value to the uk give the significance of this deal to my constituency and shipbuilding in the uk will the minister confirm its importance to our relationship with sweden and do all that he can to support and champion this vital defence industrial partnership have work so closely with former prime minister gordon brown over number of year be probably the last person in this chamber who need to be convince of the economic significance of the rosyth dockyard as my hon friend know have recently have meeting with babcock executive team both in london and abroad due to commercial sensitivity can not discuss detail of the deal to which he have refer be grateful for his recent letter to the secretary of state on this matter response be issue yesterday he can be fully assure that the government value the defence relationship with sweden and fully recognise the importance of defence industrial partnership between the united kingdom and swedish company they contribute greatly to our defence and growth objective food and drink be one of scotland most successful industry and it be worth billion to the economy over the come month the uk government face choice in their trade talk with the eu and us do we align our food and farming standard with those in the eu or reduce our quality standard at the behest of the united states will the secretary of state guarantee that scotland food and drink industry will not be jeopardise through desperation to satisfy the demand of and secure deal with donald trump at exactly this point tomorrow morning will be visit farm in east lothian so can assure the hon gentleman that be fully aware of the importance of food and agriculture to the scottish economy and more broadly to the uk economy also respectfully refer he to the labour manifesto at the last general election which make very clear our commitment to maintain important standard call the shadow minister the product regulation and metrology bill which be about to start its committee stage in the house may sound little dry but it would give the secretary of state unfettered power to sign up to dynamic alignment with the european union at the summit give that voter be go to the poll today will the minister take the opportunity at the dispatch box to rule out the uk become an eu rule taker be slightly worried that the question add two and two and get about the bill recognise that we have to find way forward on standard with the european union but to try to overlay what be as the shadow minister say necessary and somewhat dry technical piece of legislation with the policy agenda that she allude to be simply wrong industrial strategy chemical sector what step he be take to include the chemical sector within the industrial strategy the industrial strategy have identify eight key growth drive sector that will be the arrowhead of our economic success but of course they can not succeed without the critical supply chain and foundational industry that underpin they we be look at all those foundational industry include the chemical industry to see what the barrier to growth be what challenge they face and how can we overcome they through our strategy very much welcome the minister recognition of the chemical sector contribution as foundational sector and an anchor employer in constituency such as mine we have the dow site there what can we do to support the deeply integrate supply chain across the uk and europe that the chemical sector and dow in particular rely on do not want to underestimate the challenge that the chemical sector face between and uk chemical manufacturing fall in real term by about third we be work to improve the uk trade and investment relationship with the eu we want to build export and investment opportunity and reduce barrier to trade conversation be at an early stage so will not go into specific but we be certainly work to help the chemical industry what assessment have the minister make of the benefit that inclusion of the chemical sector among the eight sector could bring for our national security and our pharmaceutical sector how can all region of the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland benefit from this sector when we look at the eight sector that we be try to turbocharge through the industrial strategy we see that the chemical sector underpin so many other sector we need to make sure that we protect it as have just say chemical manufacturing have fall by nearly third over the past three year we need to turn that around we be look at what we can do to break down barrier and make improvement for example on the cost of energy that be part of the mix when it come to make sure that we be secure in the future hospitality industry what step he be take to support the hospitality industry what step he be take to support the hospitality industry hospitality business be vital to our community and to economic growth in the uk which be why we plan to introduce permanently low tax rate for retail hospitality and leisure property with rateable value of less than in addition we recently hold our first licensing taskforce meeting which aim to reduce red tape for the sector next thursday on ve day pub and bar across the country will be able to stay open until late to enable everyone to celebrate all those who serve during the second world war pub and the hospitality industry be by their very nature seasonal business and rely heavily on flexible work pattern see this at first hand when be serve by many young staff on my recent pub tour of the constituency why be the minister through the power in the employment rights bill seek to end the flexible contract that benefit these young people which will end up cause pub to have to close gently remind the hon gentleman of the dismal record of the conservatives when it come to support for the hospitality sector pub close between and the employment rights bill will not have the effect that he describe the bill will help to put money into people pocket which be exactly what we need to do to help the hospitality industry go forward in my constituency pub and five brewery contribute million to the local economy and support job as highlight by the british beer and pub association the sector face disproportionate business rate burden with pub pay high share relative to their turnover so will the government commit to increase the upper threshold of small business rate relief in order that these iconic british institution continue to thrive certainly take the hon member broad point about the significance of business rate to the hospitality sector particularly pub have hear strong representation from the industry about the need for business rate reform the hon member will be delighted that this government have instigate significant business rate reform which previous government over the last year do not do include permanently low rate for retail hospitality and leisure resident in buchlyvie in my constituency be lose their only pub which be be turn into holiday let this come despite the objection of local resident and stirling council planning panel refuse the change of use application the scottish government planning reporter have step in and make what many local people think be short sighted decision do the minister agree that local village pub like library and community centre be vital to local wellbeing and cohesion and that we should do all we can to help they thrive as key part of our local economy and social infrastructure completely agree with my hon friend about the significance of pub across the uk particularly in rural community such as those he represent it be one reason why we be in the final throe of agree extra funding for the great organisation pub be the hub which support pub in rural area to adapt to change need and enable they to continue to be the vital social hub that they be in community hope that the scottish government will have hear my hon friend comment and will recognise the need to follow the uk government line and instigate significant business rate reform certainly they need to look at provision on business rate relief which be not as generous in scotland thank to their decision as here in the uk thank to the generosity of our chancellor call the shadow secretary of state in grave and exceptionally rare step five major business group include the confederation of british industry make uk the institute of directors and the federation of small businesses have all write to condemn the employment rights bill and their view be share by ukhospitality and many other they say that the bill will damage growth and employment know that and the minister know that this bill will hurt business every business tell this and they be tell he exactly the same do the secretary of state think that be why so many of his ministers be unable to name single business that support the bill and his government job tax wonder whether the shadow secretary of state might finally use this set of question to take the opportunity to apologise for help to write the liz truss budget which drive interest rate up fourteen time and do more damage to business than any other single measure in recent time we have to take difficult decision to sort out the fiscal inheritance we get and we recognise that to tackle the cost of living crisis that the conservatives bequeath we we need to ensure that there be more money in people pocket the employment rights bill will help to do just that us trade negotiations farm what recent discussion he have have with the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs on the potential impact of his trade negotiation with the us on the farming sector regularly engage with my cabinet colleague on wide range of issue and in particular the uk ongoing trade discussion with partner country give the cross cut nature of those matter the secretary of state for environment food and rural affairs be key partner in that process include with the us as colleague know we have have constructive discussion with the us on an economic deal and we remain committed to those talk but we have make it clear that we will only ever sign trade agreement that align with the uk national interest our manifesto be also clear that we will always uphold our high food standard the secretary of state in defra recently appoint baroness batters to lead profitability review in farming and have set up farm profitability unit in the department those be welcome and necessary step but it be not entirely unknown for the effort of one government department to undermine those of another so before the secretary of state sign any trade deal with america will he check in with defra and run the rule over what it be do on farm income so that he do not undermine its effort we will all struggle to believe that at time different departments could be well co ordinated can not recognise that at all absolutely agree with the right hon gentleman the move to look at the business model around farming and profitability be welcome and think colleague on both side of the house would support that on matter of trade defra and its secretary of state be closely involve with those conversation perhaps in the past the community have not always feel this but in some of the ongoing trade negotiation that we be progress there be real export opportunity for uk agriculture its quality and the premium and brand associate with that be market that be grow around the world part of our discussion in range of different trade negotiation be about ensure that there be more opportunity in future but promise the right hon gentleman that the overall effort of government in the sector be co ordinated and that be ongoing export to the eu what step his department be take to help increase export to the eu three of our five large trading partner be in the european union indeed of uk trade be with our friend neighbour and partner in the eu the department for business and trade along with other departments across government hope in co ordinate way have be contribute to the resetting of our relationship with the eu and be fully engage ahead of the first uk eu summit schedule to take place on may among the broad spectrum of policy area we aim to make progress on tackle barrier to trade and secure outcome that will help more business across the uk export to our european neighbour this be moment for britain to show that it be serious about forge renewed and reinvigorated relationship with the eu which be still our large trading partner if the forthcoming summit end up as another in long line of miss opportunity there be real danger that brussels will just move on to other priority what concrete measure can business expect to come out of the summit to cut red tape and the barrier hold back british growth and prosperity would be incline to wait for the summit before declaim it as disaster think in the trade that be call prebuttal however the hon gentleman point about the seriousness of the summit be fair one and recognise it when see those image of the prime minister sit with president trump in the oval office or indeed with president macron or president von der leyen of the european commission feel genuine sense of relief that we have serious prime minister for these serious time that serious prime minister be intent on first rebuild personal relationship across europe and secondly look to identify the area that be transparently win win between ourselves and our friend neighbour and partner in the european union assure the hon gentleman that there be an ambitious agenda for the summit on the call the liberal democrat spokesperson the government need to deliver measure that will cut red tape for business in wokingham and across the country who want to sell their good to our large trading partner the european union since brexit over billion piece of paperwork have be add to uk exporter enough paper to wrap around the world nearly time do the minister recognise the scale of that figure how will he ensure that conservative impose red tape for business with europe be cut down we be consciously pursue trade agenda base on datum not on post imperial delusion regrettably the data be pretty devastating on the damage do by how brexit be implement by our predecessor if one want to look at academic research the late publication from aston university indicate that number of small and medium sized business about which we have hear lot today from opposition members be bury under red tape it be not only those business that have be bury under red tape we have see an increase in the number of civil servant across the united kingdom by more than in recent year that be partly why the chancellor of the duchy of lancaster in the cabinet office be lead our work on rethink the size and shape of the british state the hon gentleman be absolutely right in recognise that we have responsibility to try and clean up the mess that be what we be do high street businesses what step he be take to help support high street business we be reform business rate roll out banking hub stamp out late payment empower community to bring vacant property on the high street back into use and begin to tackle the antisocial behaviour and crime that have bedevil the high street over the last decade last month we also announce licensing taskforce that will recommend way to improve our licensing regime to foster vibrant hospitality the night time economy and cultural industry on the high street british retail consortium survey this week of major retailer employ half million people find that say that the billion year employment rights bill will have negative impact on their business and half say that it would lead to job cut how do the minister expect our high street to cope with that extra cost come on top of high business rate and high national insurance when will the government actually listen to business and to the people create job in this country the conservative party have rather dismal record on support to worker gently say to the hon gentleman that most business that do the right thing by their employee support the employment rights bill one reason the bill be so important be that it will help put more money into people pocket and that will have knock on benefit for high street business rural businesses what step his department be take to support business in rural area rural area offer significant potential for growth and be central to our economy so we be work closely with other government departments include the department for environment food and rural affairs to improve the quality of life for people live and work in rural area later this year we will launch the business growth service which in partnership with the growth hub network in england will make it easy for business include those in rural area to get the information and support that they need to thrive thank the minister for his answer be encourage that his department be work with other departments there be brilliant vineyard in mid sussex such as bolney wine estate which produce high quality english wine they form vital part of the rural economy and they also entice domestic and international tourism with the end of the wine duty easement on february cause significant concern across the sector what step be the minister take to ensure that the english wine industry be not damage by that and instead can continue to grow and go from strength to strength we recognise that the english wine industry which have go from strength to strength in recent year be crucial part of the rural economy and of the food and drink offer that the uk can rightly be proud of it be one reason that we be seek to increase export of food and drink include help english vineyard to export english wine to range of market overseas and we will certainly continue to do that trade us tariff what recent discussion he have have with his us counterpart on tariff as we have hear the us be our large single country trading partner with total trade worth billion in represent of total uk trade more than million americans work for uk own business and vice versa we have regular and ongoing constructive negotiation with our us counterpart include some this week on secure wide economic deal to benefit uk business and our economy in those talk we continually push the case for free and open trade nobody want to see trade war so our focus be on keep calm and continue to negotiate in the interest of uk business and consumer as the uk top export country the us be vital partner to many uk business but with trump now report to have make the uk second order priority to asia and with the uk possibly on the verge of give up its brexit freedom in favour of eu alignment how confident be the secretary of state of achieve comprehensive free trade deal with the us in both good and service first let assuage the hon gentleman concern that be misreading of how the us be approach these negotiation the us have perhaps more complex issue with some country that will take more bandwidth on its side as have always say the exist relationship between the uk and the us be incredibly strong reciprocal and mutually beneficial see far few issue to negotiate to get to that outcome again would push back on anyone attempt to put the case that the decision we make must be base on either the eu the us or any other partner be our principal partner the role for the uk be to position ourselves in this challenging world with genuine strategic advantage because we do thing that improve our trading relationship with the eu we secure this us deal and we secure the deal with india the gulf and other key market be pragmatic about where the uk national interest lie and be absolutely confident that it be possible and desirable call the chair of the select committee today the select committee write to the secretary of state to supply our response to his consultation on how we should respond to american tariff we have hear widespread consensus that there should not be retaliatory tariff and that the approach the government be pursue be right but we have also hear real concern especially in the automotive industry among those big exporter to america and crucially their supply chain can the secretary of state reassure the house that he be ready support package across government to ensure that our automotive sector do not run into serious trouble if we can not get deal with america soon as my right hon friend know always welcome communication from the select committee and the constructive and helpful role it play in all these important matter he be right to say that the business community in the uk strongly back the government calm and level head approach to these difficult issue the automotive sector be one of our major priority it be the sector that have the most export because of the brilliant success we have with automotive export to the us it remain an absolute priority for we in any negotiation to secure what we need which be the continuation of access to us market in way that be complementary to the us and that meet the ambition of us consumer frankly do not see any argument for make that relationship more difficult through the long term imposition of tariff we be closely engage in number of important meeting this week with senior automotive leader and we will continue to prepare that work to keep the select committee involve topical questions if he will make statement on his departmental responsibility when we take office year of conservative neglect have leave our steel industry on the brink but while other be willing to let the heart of british industry go cold we be not welcome the recent conversion of opposition colleague to an active industrial policy but make no mistake while other may talk tough only labour can be trust to act in the interest of british worker when the future of british steel be on the line we take immediate action can report to the house that thank to our intervention we have secure the raw material to keep scunthorpe blast furnace light and british steel have cancel the redundancy consultation which put job at risk it be an honour to visit scunthorpe and immingham port recently to meet british steel worker and be enormously grateful to they for their resilience determination and hard work during turbulent time there be still much to be do to protect and rebuild our steel industry as whole after decade of failure and that be why we be commit to billion clean steel fund and to work with industry on our steel strategy we have always say that steel have bright future in this country and our action over the past month have show that we mean it to bring the secretary of state to hampshire and surrey there be major regeneration scheme under way in my constituency at farnham in brightwells and the new town centre in bordon both will ultimately depend on attract physical business be it retail hospitality or otherwise for their long term success do the secretary of state agree that the government should actively support prospective business in those area and do he not recognise that new taxis such as the national insurance contribution increase that his government have impose on business will cause business in my constituency to falter before they have even take off welcome the progress be make in the hon gentleman constituency think he be about to invite there which be often the case at topical question but sadly do not manage to secure an invitation have be absolutely clear genuinely wish the inheritance of this government be well one in economic term than the one we receive genuinely wish the conservative government have not leave that black hole and that we have not have to make difficult decision but life be sometimes about difficult decision and government and business certainly be as well without investment in infrastructure without serious approach to the fiscal rule which be absent for much of the last government and without investment in the health service we would struggle welcome the success he be talk about be always keen to work with he on that pub and restaurant be part of thriving hospitality sector in my constituency what initiative be the department planning to support such small business and boost economic growth in colne valley of course invite the minister to visit my constituency and experience our fantastic hospitality sector the hon member for farnham and bordon gregory stafford might not invite ministers to his constituency but be grateful for my hon friend invitation diary permit would be delighted to come along last year my right hon friend the secretary of state announce our plan for business growth service which should make it easy for uk business to get government advice and support in order to grow hope that will make real difference in addition we be consider what else we can do to unlock well access to finance for small business such as those in my hon friend constituency call the shadow secretary of state the secretary of state say that all the funding require for the nationalisation of british steel will come out of exist budget we have see his department budget we have an estimate day debate in the house not long ago and there be no unallocated pot could he be little more specific about exactly which budget the money be come from the shadow secretary of state point to the statement in which say that in the previous budget there be billion allocation for the green steel fund of course that come in addition to the million for the port talbot transformation which be agree under the previous government but be not in the departmental account as he know it be in heavily oversubscribed treasury reserve yes the green steel fund will be there to support what we have have to do at scunthorpe again as say when parliament be recall the question there be whether we would pay significant amount of money for the total loss of the business give large amount of money to jingye but without the certainty that it would be able to deliver on that plan or step in and take the action that we do which be confident be the right option for value for money and for scunthorpe thank the secretary of state for his answer think it be widely agree that the cost of nationalise british steel could run into the billion be he really say that he plan to raid the previously allocate billion green steel fund from the national wealth fund and how be he do that give that the national wealth fund be operationally independent be not the truth that soon or later this will have to come from his department budget at the expense of financial support for the automotive sector exporter and hard work trade negotiator recognise the shadow secretary of state concern but let reassure he on that point the option available to the government be first the total collapse of british steel which would have have an incredible cost to the exchequer of well over billion secondly the request from jingye for billion which the leader of the opposition say she do or do not agree to in some way with it go to teesside at very significant cost or thirdly as we have do so far the provision of work capital to british steel in order to pay wage and continue the purchase of raw material and the operation of the business of course those cost will be incur by the company because they will enable it to produce and sell steel will write to he with the detail if he be not confident in the decision that we have make but it be the right decision not just for the steel industry but for the taxpayer wherever possible think we should buy british and that obviously start with buy british make ceramic may encourage the department of business and trade to support my ceramics country of origin marking bill which would crack down on cheap import and faker who pass off their product as british ware it be important for the consumer to know that when they buy british the good be make here in the uk be always keen to support my hon friend and will certainly consider that legislation we be not protectionist government we welcome open and free trade but we believe british good can compete on quality and his area be fine example of that where british good be be undercut not by price and fair competition but by misrepresentation and fraudulent practice we take that seriously and have take more power to deal with it be sure that he will raise this shortly during the urgent question we will ensure that we give he the support he need to pursue it enersys absl be space battery manufacturer base at the culham campus in my oxfordshire constituency the minister will be aware that culham have be designate as an ai growth zone by the government it apply for an export licence last august but get an outcome only last week which mean the contract be nearly lose to french competitor what step be the minister take to improve the process for grant export licence so that company be not subject to this kind of last minute jeopardy be unfamiliar with the particular case but concerned by that description we inherit the export licensing system and we be review it as part of our ongoing work look at all aspect of the government work if the hon member write to will certainly take personal interest in the matter and write back to he folkestone and hythe have long history as thriving tourist destination but in recent year with brexit and rise cost thing be get hard for business in our coastal community what step be the department take to support the growth of the tourism and hospitality industry in kent know from personal experience that there be some great hospitality and tourism business in kent and we want to see they do even well in the come month and year that be why we be seek to support the sector through initiative such as business rate reform and the licensing taskforce which have just start work it be also why the government will launch national visitor economy strategy this autumn as we seek to welcome million international visitor annually by and many of they suspect will visit kent if the secretary of state be not go to visit farnham can tempt he to visit fountain beauty therapy in hurtmore much love business in my constituency the owner clare porter talk about the extreme pressure cause by the employment rights bill the hike in employer national insurance and the withdrawal of business rate relief lead to crisis in the hair and beauty sector what measure be the secretary of state planning to alleviate pressure on this very important sector be grateful to finally get an invitation to somewhere we understand that there be significant pressure for many business and the global situation certainly will not provide reassurance in the short term the measure in the employment rights bill be not in effect yet and will take some time to come in since the election nearly job have be create so the labour market be hold up particularly strongly there be particular issue such as make sure we get probationary period right and that zero hour contract be monitor in the right way and we be work with business on that this month meet berkshire growth hub which work with business in bracknell and beyond on everything from start up to opportunity in ai how can we ensure that growth hub work with skills england to continue to deliver local growth in community such as mine commend my hon friend for meet with berkshire growth hub growth hub play crucial role in local economy we want to supplement their work with our business growth service which be set to launch later this year and we be work with skills england to identify the skill shortage in particular area be happy to ensure that skills england talk to berkshire growth hub through my hon friend so that the particular skill challenge in berkshire be understand by skills england arrangement at the border be disadvantage company on both side of the channel so there be mutual advantage to be have in negotiation without feel the need to make any major concession be there be not entirely convinced that the previous government be compass by which to navigate the next set of negotiation with the european union the right hon gentleman be entirely right that there be whole series of unnecessary barrier to trade between ourselves and the european union that be put in place as direct consequence of the failure of the negotiation lead by the previous government he be right to recognise that that be affect directly whole number of business on both side of the channel as the secretary of state say there be politic on both side of the channel but we be work very hard for british business in that context can the minister assure the steel community of south wales that they will receive substantial share of the billion steel fund my hon friend and several other welsh colleague have be talk to about this we renegotiate the deal with port talbot and the million that go alongside that have good meeting this week with blastr which be look to build an iron pellet plant at the port talbot site if possible and we be try to support that of course our focus in recent week have be on scunthorpe and british steel but the steel fund remain the steel plan be still be work on which be very broad and hop to lift the entire uk steel industry sheen uncovered be clothing business in my constituency that the secretary of state be welcome to visit any time it have be significantly affect by the need to pay import duty up front thank to the conservatives terrible brexit deal and that duty range between and and greatly impact its cash flow what be the government do to support business such as sheen uncover to reduce the challenge of import cost assure the hon lady that we be look at how we can improve that relationship and she be right to recognise that whole number of barrier be create as consequence of choice make previously which be cause significant challenge to business small medium and large as the secretary of state make clear we can not give running commentary on discussion that be under way but assure she that the need and concern of british business be uppermost in our mind in those discussion on the day of the government necessary action to save british steel send the secretary of state letter request meeting to discuss what far we need to do for grangemouth where hundred of job have be lose this week when petroineos decide to cease refining operation and where thousand of further job be at risk will he commit to meet to discuss the urgent action that we need to take to secure accelerated investment in grangemouth industrial future can absolutely give that assurance have have meeting about this issue just this week we be ambitious for the just transition for grangemouth and recognise the issue not just with the refinery but with the polyethylene cracker we will get to work and set that meeting up many rural business rely on farm for their trade since the government announce the family farm tax in the budget cbi economics have speak to over business and farm across the say that they have either cancel or defer investment and say that they have reduce or pause it altogether how can the government say that they be support local business and what will the department do to support farm and rural business that be suffer because of the government policy feel that be question for either the treasury or the department for environment food and rural affairs but the hon lady make it well agriculture feature prominently in trade and business and will ensure that she get the right opportunity to put question about taxation to the chancellor across my constituency in recent week we have experience severe delay to post in those area serve by the huntingdon delivery office that follow recent restructuring of the workforce and change to delivery route rural community and business in particular have be impact with miss hospital appointment and several business tell that it be affect their ability to receive and therefore pay invoice will the minister urgently investigate those ongoing and worsen delay in huntingdon and write to with the outcome of his finding have to wait minute for question mr speaker but this be an important one and share the hon member concern we regularly meet ofcom to discuss the performance of royal mail and will certainly write to he about the discussion we have in respect of his constituency what discussion have the minister have with his counterpart in northern ireland about encourage young people into casual hospitality employment to teach they about the benefit of work and the importance of manage money be always grateful to the hon gentleman for his question we always seek to keep colleague in northern ireland well brief on range of issue particularly some of the complexity around trade that have come out of the windsor agreement and need to be manage carefully do not think have have specific conversation about the matter he raise but this be good opportunity to say that think should and will be grateful to he for get that on the record will the secretary of state be straightforward with the house today about how much taxpayer money have be spend so far on british steel the amount of work capital provide to british steel to date stand at million which be considerably less than if we have give large amount of money to jingye or if we have have to deal with the complete loss of the entire british steel site and business modelling by the scottish government have show that brexit make barrier be likely to have reduce scottish export by billion compare with continue eu membership greater co operation and close relationship with the eu will always be encourage by snp members but do the secretary of state recognise that anything short of full single market and custom union membership continue to damage scotland economy in substantive term the hon gentleman point be important we should be look to reduce unnecessary barrier to trade between the united kingdom and our friend neighbour and partner in the european union however on political level it be worth recognise that have scotland vote in to leave the united kingdom it would also have leave the european union there be certain irony in be tell that politic of flag border and manufactured grievance be wrong in one context when his party continue to argue for they in another accord to report in the guardian government source have say that issue around visa have be resolve as part of the government free trade agreement negotiation with india will the secretary of state rule out visa liberalisation as part of those negotiation we should always be careful about what we read in some newspaper laughter the hon gentleman know that we can not give running commentary on trade negotiation but the uk india talk have be fruitful this week be optimistic and excited for the future of what be key relationship bilaterally and for the signal it can send to the rest of the world energy price energy intensive industries urgent question to ask the secretary of state for energy security and net zero if he will make statement on the government approach to reduce energy price for energy intensive industry relay my thought to the worker in my hon friend constituency for whom know this be worrying time thank my hon friend for raise the issue he be tireless champion for worker and business in his constituency we have speak and will continue to speak regularly about these issue and the importance of the ceramics industry in his area in particular this government recognise the challenge high energy price pose to uk business we know that the ceramics sector be particularly affect my hon friend have raise the issue in parliament on other occasion the government be work closely with ceramics uk and local stoke mps to work out how we can support the sector for energy intensive industry overall our clean power target be the key to long term sustainable price reduction clean home grow energy be the good way to protect bill payer and boost britain energy independence we be already bring energy cost for uk industry close into line with other major economy through the british industry supercharger that will fully exempt eligible firm include some but by no means all of those in the ceramics sector from certain cost link to renewable energy policy particularly those expose to the high cost of electricity use more electricity and less fossil fuel be the future for uk business the late advice from the climate change committee expect electricity to meet of industrial energy demand by so we be develop option to enable business to do that we be already take action when my hon friend raise this important issue in westminster hall debate in march note we be work on how to remove undeveloped speculative programme from the grid connection queue and prioritise other official report march vol just last month we announce pro growth reform to help unlock million of mainly private investment year in clean energy and infrastructure so that so call zombie project will no long hold up the queue for connection to the electricity grid we recognise that we need to support range of energy intensive industry include industry such as ceramic that be essential to our uk economy and our mission for example to build the million home and the clean energy infrastructure product in which this government be already invest follow year of economic chaos and instability under the previous administration this government be implement modern industrial strategy that will drive growth and the creation of good high quality job in community across the uk look forward to continue to work with my hon friend and other hon member from across the house we be meet next wednesday and hope to be able to progress thing far at that stage thank the minister for her engagement on this issue because she have genuinely and authentically try to look for way forward when my hon friend the members for stoke on trent north david williams and for stoke on trent south dr gardner and have meeting with the minister six week ago we warn she that other factory be go to fail and we stand here follow the closure of moorcroft yesterday she will be aware that other factory in stoke on trent be work on short time as way of reduce cost so that they can put more money into meet their ever increase energy bill thank the minister for the outline she have give but she will know that we have previously talk about most of the thing she have raise today and they do not apply to the ceramics sector or to great swathe of the energy industrial sector as whole the supercharger scheme do not work for the ceramics sector indeed ceramics company end up have to subsidise other energy intensive industry because they be not part of the supercharger scheme we have be tell that we can not see an exception to that we have ask about the emission trading scheme and free trade allowance and have be tell that some be available for ceramic but that do not go far enough to meet the demand we have today we have be constantly promise jam tomorrow by the last government as well as this one well jam be no good if you be dead and the ceramics sector in stoke on trent be on life support we be at point where good manufacturing job do by proud people be fall away every month this be not new it start in with the closure of dudson and continue with the closure of wade in johnson tiles in and royal stafford and now moorcroft in the energy intensive industry in this country be pivotal to manufacturing if we see they fall away manufacture in this country will fall away ask the minister three very simple question will she look at wholesale change to the way in which we do subsidy and energy price for energy intensive industry in the short term before gb energy come online as well meaning as gb energy be it be too far away to help will she rule out specifically move any policy cost on to gas cost gas be the big cost for the ceramics sector electricity be small proportion of what we do will she take the opportunity to make clear commitment at the dispatch box as the secretary of state for business and trade just do when he talk about sector fall on its knee ceramic be there we do not need the same level of investment that steel do we need tiny fraction of it can we have it and can we have it soon if we have to come back here in six week there will be no sector leave to defend agree with my hon friend and recognise the challenge we lose job in the ceramics sector between and it have be very sad decline and we want to turn that around the whole point of an industrial strategy be to have government who be proactive in support our industry we will not put extra cost on the ceramics industry we be look to see how we can help and support my hon friend have my word on that we be work on every single one of the suggest policy reform in the package that ceramics uk have put forward and we will meet he next week to talk about these thing can not make promise at the dispatch box on area that be not my responsibility and rule out whole swathe of policy but assure my hon friend that we will not put extra cost on the ceramics industry we be look to do more and to support and we will come back completely understand his point about the timing and the need to act quickly call the shadow secretary of state grangemouth the luton vauxhall plant and now the moorcroft pottery in stoke on trent every single week we hear of more job loss in energy intensive industry and more british company shut up shop and lay off worker because of the toxic combination of high energy cost and this chancellor devastate job tax we have the high industrial electricity price in the developed world just this week ineos tell we in no uncertain term that carbon taxis and high energy cost be kill off manufacturing in the uk this government have be warn by opposition members by the gmb this week and by unite this week they be warn by none other than tony blair what be their response adviser in no downing street pick up the phone and beg he to row back on what he say they ask he to row back on what we all know to be true what the minister morgan mcsweeney apparently and an increase number of the government own back benchers know to be true the current approach to energy and net zero be doom to fail and voter be be ask to make financial sacrifice when they know that the impact on global emission be minimal that be at the heart of this madness this government be wilfully destroy british industry in oil and gas ceramics chemical and metal when they know that it will not make difference to global emission we will not use any less oil and gas neither will we use any less steel cement brick or chemical we will just import those thing from abroad at great cost to our economy and the climate and with british job loss add to the bargain as the government be lead by an ideological zealot the secretary of state for energy security and net zero and by prime minister too weak to rein he in we will continue down this path and british worker will pay the price in aberdeen in grangemouth in luton and today in stoke energy be not silo energy cost underpin growth prosperity competitiveness and living standard without cheap energy our industry will not survive british manufacturer can not remain competitive so what will the minister do to prevent more british job be lose in energy intensive industry in this country will she listen to the head of unite who say that working class people be lose their job and that this government have no plan to replace they will the government end their mad ideological plan to shut down north sea operation what will it take for labour back benchers to wake up and realise that this ideological approach be cripple this country the conservative party be hide behind this new find scepticism of net zero to conceal its complete failure to support and grow our foundational and manufacturing industry on its watch on its watch we lose job in the north sea and job in the ceramics sector chemical manufacturing fall by and we produce only of the steel that we use in this country the conservative party record on this issue be shameful this government have completely different approach we be develop the industrial strategy which will support those foundational industry we be look to make sure we can reach net zero by in order to provide the economic and energy security we need the last cost of living crisis be cause by our reliance on global gas price as the hon member for west aberdeenshire and kincardine andrew bowie know and as he occasionally say in some meeting when he flip and flop on his position on net zero we will support manufacturing we be develop our industrial strategy which will be publish in few week time and we be already provide more support to the energy intensive industry through the energy supercharger than the previous government do we will act where the previous government fail to act call the chair of the business and trade committee my hon friend the member for stoke on trent central gareth snell be an enormous champion of the ceramics industry and he be right to bring this question to the house today but this issue be wide than simply the ceramics sector tata steel have tell our committee that energy price be the single big factor in its lack of competitiveness and nissan have tell we that electricity price at its plant in sunderland be the high of any nissan plant in the world we have recommend that the government bring energy price in line with our european competitor can the minister tell we today that she share that ambition thank my right hon friend the committee chair for his question of course this be huge issue under the previous government industrial energy price double and as my right hon friend say we have high price than many other country the people who respond to our consultation on the industrial strategy say that energy skill and access to finance be their top three issue so we be absolutely aware of the issue we be look at what support we can provide and how we can make our country more competitive both for the people who be look to invest in the uk and for our exist manufacturing base call the liberal democrat spokesperson the liberal democrats believe that the future of british industry and our national security depend on serious and sustained commitment to renewable energy we want to see far great emphasis on clean energy source particularly solar in order to reduce our dangerous reliance on fossil fuel strengthen our energy security and tackle fuel poverty by bring down energy bill for household and business alike in the face of putin barbaric war in europe and with donald trump reckless tariff threaten fresh economic turmoil we can not afford to be complacent the future of energy intensive industry not least our steel industry hang in the balance steelmaking be not just an economic asset it be of vital strategic importance to the uk we need steel in order to build the infrastructure require for sustainable secure future from wind turbine and railway to hospital and home without it our ambition for net zero and national resilience will collapse as such will the government give clear unequivocal commitment to their net zero plan and will they ensure that no option be off the table when it come to safeguard our steel industry and the future of british manufacturing can give the hon gentleman reassurance that we be look at all option to support the steel industry which be foundational to our country he make the correct point about how important steel be to build our future whether it be runway home or other structure we be look at all option and we have the steel plan which will be come out soon and the billion earmark to support the steel industry my constituency have many brilliant metal manufacturing company that supply critical uk industry in defence automotive and construction however many of they be struggle because the last government leave we with sky high electricity price and dependence on foreign gas import last month launch make uk new electrify industry initiative in parliament which seek to address this broad challenge can the minister set out how the clean power action plan will make industrial energy cost cheap and help we drive growth in the west midland manufacturing industry thank my hon friend for her championing of her constituency be still to visit and must do that because know she have many exciting place for to see electrify industry be crucial the climate change committee have say that that be the route and that of industry will need to be electrify we need to make sure we do that we be look through the spending review process as be sure she would expect at how we can support industry to make that change to electric and how we can help with some of the capital cost which will lead to low cost in the long term make that leap can be difficult and that be what we be look at through the spending review why be it well accord to the government to import gas from norway instead of develop our own north sea gas field the north sea field be decline basin we lose job under the previous government something like only one in of the licence that have be approve over recent year have actually amount to anything because of the difficulty of decline basin the impact on price of very small amount of the global mix come from the north sea would be zero it would not change penny in the cost we would pay when the previous government look at support energy intensive industry they include within the definition brewer cider maker and wine maker but not distiller despite the fact that distiller use kw per hour to make litre of alcohol compare with brewer which use just kw per hour as the government consider what they will have to do to support energy intensive industry such as distilling will the minister consider that the scotch whisky industry in particular be critical to the maintenance of economic activity and quality job in some of the most remote and economically fragile community in this country we be obviously keen to do what we can to support the scottish whisky industry have be to see it and understand how important it be the definition of energy intensive industry be develop under the previous government and we have no immediate plan to change those but will take away the right hon gentleman point and look into it on net zero think there be national consensus on make the environment well create green job and improve energy security but will the minister recognise that for many people consumer and company out there particularly small business by the way it be not all about large one there be too much happen too soon and too fast rather than have regressive and punitive taxis on industry and small business there should be more education and more incentive to change consumer and company behaviour the right hon gentleman make perfectly reasonable point we have national consensus that we need to act and think the population be with we on that they understand that we need to make sure we have planet for our child and our grandchild and that we need to do everything we can as be say this week we want to tread lightly on people life and of course we do not want to inflict regressive and punitive taxation we want to make sure we be support industry and business and we be look at how we can help to incentivise the change that we need to see despite scotland grow abundance of potentially cheap renewable energy business in scotland energy sector be deal double blow whereby energy intensive business in the renewable supply chain be hammer by high energy cost in production and extortionate transmission charge when the minister look at this problem as her colleague tell he would the other day will she bear in mind that this be entirely link to the high cost of produce energy and all the other way in which the current energy market model serve scotland poorly think it be probably the minister for energy my hon friend the member for rutherglen michael shanks who give that assurance to the hon gentleman and he be look at all these issue we have very complex energy system we be try to make it as cost effective as we can and sustainable in the long term to give we the energy security that we all need be sure my hon friend will continue to look at these issue vital ingredient of any net zero policy be an understanding of the word net ultimately we be go to have to grapple with technology that we have have for over century to remove carbon directly from the air be we we be happy to look at range of option the whole point of the clean energy plan be that we be use very diverse range of intervention some of which be more high tech and for the future and some of which be well establish we need that mix give the huge economic and environmental effect of burn fossil fuel it be clear that the future of energy have to be clean green cheap renewable plus energy efficiency all of we who care about fact base truth base politic should call out the outrageous misinformation from those who suggest that net zero be the reason for high energy price when it clearly be not gas price have go through the roof in recent year and we all know why because of putin outrageous invasion of ukraine that be why company and business be struggle there be two specific thing that the government can and should do to help precisely those business first decouple the price of electricity from gas so that the true cost of generate electricity be reflect in the price that consumer pay and secondly implement carbon tax in order to be able to use those revenue to assist industry to make the just transition from fossil fuel to the clean green cheap energy of the future the hon lady be right to point out that there be lot of misinformation in this space and it be often use by the conservatives to hide their own failing in government of course the energy price hike that we have be partly because the previous government have not deliver the security that we need in our home grow energy supply and storage we be look at all option to make sure that we have the right system in place go forward we already have the emission trading scheme and we be look at where that go in future year she be right to point out that we need to look at all these thing the pretence be that britain be somehow catch in toss sea of international gas price which drive up energy cost but when ineos report that it be pay million year in carbon taxis rise to billion by be it not the case that we be see the cascade of job loss because labour have make decarbonisation deindustrialisation think the hon gentleman know that his own party be the expert on deindustrialisation which we see significantly across all part of our manufacturing sector include at ineos regularly meet ineo as do the secretary of state and other colleague and we be look at what we can do to support the sector it face lot of challenge and we be look to try to resolve they my constituent in edinburgh west like many other across scotland and the uk depend on energy intensive industry for their livelihood defence whisky and grangemouth how can the minister reassure people who be already suffer because of high domestic energy price that the situation will not be make bad by lose job in those industry the hon lady be right to raise these challenge which we be try to grapple with we be look at how we can provide support on energy price and other aspect for energy intensive industry of course the energy intensive industry that qualify for the supercharger be get significantly increase support from april which will be helpful but we recognise that that do not go far enough and we need to do more talk of expert in deindustrialisation over job at luton stellantis plant have be lose impact my constituent because this government do not respond to concern about energy policy if the minister do not agree with we on net zero do she agree with the general secretary of the gmb who say that the government energy policy amount to export job and import virtue have meet and talk with those from stellantis many time and while the closure of the site at luton be of course very difficult know that the reason be global and complex it be simply not the case that it be because of energy policy stellantis face whole range of issue globally and it have to respond in the way it do we regret that and we offer support but we could not get to point where we could persuade it to stay we be work with the mps and the local council to ensure that what come afterwards provide good decent job but the hon member be just wrong to say that that be the only reason the minister have tell the house that the government would not impose any new cost on the ceramics industry but we know that they be go to increase carbon taxis which will kill off energy intensive industry do she not see that this be totally incoherent policy position there be no coherence under the previous government and there will be coherence under this government we be develop our plan of support for our foundational industry in the industrial strategy know that the opposition be very keen to see what the industrial strategy will contain they will have to wait few week for its publication but all will be reveal in due course thank the minister very much for her answer manufacturing currently represent less than of the uk economy but in northern ireland it represent of the economy and about one in four family in northern ireland be dependent on manufacturing it be clear that as energy price rise so do the concern for such industry how can the government and the minister offer support to those industry to retain their viability while the government be find an energy solution the hon member be right to raise this issue and the figure for manufacturing in northern ireland of or be high yesterday be with trade unionist from shorts brothers spirit aerosystems to talk about the importance of manufacturing there and the importance of retain those job they make the point that these good job have help not just with people life but with the sectarian divide bring people out of poverty and give they good well pay job be an incredibly important part of the history of northern ireland and of what we need to preserve there will continue to work with he to make sure we protect that manufacturing base we of course have huge support in the budget with the billion for the automotive sector and the billion for the aerospace sector to support exactly that manufacturing industry business of the house call the stand in shadow leader of the house one paul holmes may please ask the leader of the house to outline the forthcoming business shall and that be beautifully deliver the business of the house for the week commence may will include tuesday may general debate on the anniversary of victory in europe and victory over japan wednesday may remain stage of the data use and access bill lords thursday may general debate on st george day and english affair follow by debate on motion on the

win for each and every one of we we will never forget they if may want to pay tribute to the parliamentary security and policing team on monday evening friend and while on the terrace see man enter the water outside from westminster bridge we run to report it to police officer who take we very seriously and immediately report it in five minute later emergency service locate the person and evacuate they thank the emergency service and that police officer whose name do not get for act in timely way we wish the affected person well as he be take to hospital be grateful to the leader of the house for outline the forthcoming business she will know be look forward to the fa cup final on may and will be cheer manchester city on to victory against crystal palace almost as loudly as she heckle opposition politician here look forward to my team southampton meet her team later on that month although from our record be not sure it will go too well on the subject of own goal be sure member on both side of the house will be look on with some confusion at the chaos in the government rank follow the former prime minister tony blair suggestion that the government plan to phase out fossil fuel in the short term be doom to fail that election win machine at whose name many on the labour benches now groan at the simple mention of have speak sense of course it can be frustrating when former leader weigh in on debate with contrary view to the party they once lead believe know how the leader of the house and the secretary of state for energy security and net zero feel we have have more than our fair share but the government know that the former prime minister have point we know that the government be dread the local election today the first real test of their performance in the nine month since they take power what will we see an ideological kamikaze dive towards net zero carbon emission that tonight will deliver gain of net zero seat pay tribute to candidate of all party who have take the step to put their head above the parapet and who be willing to charge into the political fray without they our democracy would wither of course would like to wish those stand as conservative candidate all the good and hope the house will understand why have do that as voter go to the poll they will be ask themselves what sort of council they want to represent they and provide vital public service for they and their family do they want the high tax highly bureaucratic debt laden local authority of labour or do they want efficient effective and accountable local guardian which they have under the conservatives let we not forget that conservative council deliver well service with low council taxis we do not have to look any far than labour control birmingham where bin bag have pile up on the street to get an idea of the monumental failure of this labour government so far that be to say nothing of the rat which not only represent terrible health and safety threat to resident but terrorise the neighbourhood they infest they will not be jump from any sink ship but the government past voter certainly be why be the government ship sink we need only look over at the labour benches to see who be to blame after nine month of labour government the promise of change have end up in the over fill bin of the council they control will not argue that there have be some change the prime minister have change his donor fund armani suit many time while the pensioner that they have make poorer buy their clothe from the charity shop that this government be tax to the hilt talk of donor labour donor be now become the independent football regulator what bargain for half million pound most important be not the change the government have make but the fact that the public have change their mind about labour and how can we blame they the office for budget responsibility have halve its estimate for growth this year with the government continue campaign against the elderly farmer the self employ and small business owner it be no wonder that the government be so unpopular they have run out of people to target there be saying that action have consequence can the leader of the house find time to schedule debate to discuss the consequence of her government economic failure and the woeful action of their chancellor growth be at all time low taxis and debt be at an all time high business and charity be alarmed at how they will keep go can we have debate on that mission for growth and how it be go suspect the answer will be no want to raise one final topic with the leader of the house which and other colleague have touch on previously the long timeframe and poor quality response to write correspondence and write question from member as be sure all member and the leader of the house will agree it be vital that we as parliamentarian be able to make representation to the government and receive response to our query in timely manner with reply that take full account of the question make too many time now member have have to raise in this chamber the response time or lack of response to their constituency inquiry the number of write question be answer by this government be down and have to say that the quality of response be deteriorate do hope she will take this up with her cabinet colleague as we go away for our bank holiday wish the leader of the house and all member restful weekend with chance to spend time with love one and perhaps put call in to their chief whip we will return on tuesday when we will continue to hold this government to account for the people of this great country join the shadow minister in thank the police and security service of the house for the work they do day in day out and particularly in the case he have raise take this opportunity to thank the king for all the work he be do for those live with cancer his openness about his own condition really do bring huge comfort to those live with theirs also take this opportunity to welcome progress on the mineral agreement between the us and ukraine that be achieve overnight and the wide partnership the support of the government and of the whole house remain unwaveringly with those in ukraine and that will continue join the shadow minister in thank all candidate stand in the local election today and thank he for wish man city all the success hope it will get in the forthcoming fa cup final and against southampton it be really good to see the shadow minister in his elevated place today reach the heady height of business question this morning be sure he will agree that this be the pinnacle of his career so far as you can see mr speaker he have really draw in the crowd be only joke the attendance be no reflection on he his journey to this point have be how shall put of dogged and determined pursuit he be councillor believe when he be very young at just and have be special adviser before come here he stand in number of seat in fact in his relatively short parliamentary career he have already be the mp for two different constituency in all seriousness have great deal of time for the hon gentleman who be formidable and notable representative of his party it might be bit of low bar right now but he be well above it he really be rise star of the party wan he be very popular member of this house hon member hear hear there we be the shadow minister raise matter that be very important to timely and full response to write parliamentary question and correspondence take this matter incredibly seriously and will continue as always to raise it with cabinet ministers collectively and individually when they fall short the shadow minister also raise the issue of net zero be sorry give his glitter career that he feel the need to read out from the late whip crib sheet on net zero the blinker vision that the conservatives have show on the opportunity of net zero and the transition that we

have fall by third over the past year there be global race for the new technology of the future and we be now in that race something the conservatives fail to do for many year we be make sure that the north sea have the opportunity of the future and there be some great opportunity that be why we be set up great british energy in aberdeen and why we have announce billion for carbon capture which will be critical to the future of the north sea basin it be also why we be look to reindustrialise the future with thing like hydrogen nuclear and other energy the shadow minister mention the former leader of the labour party but he might want to look at what some of his own party former leader have say in recent year think theresa may speak very wisely last autumn just as the conservatives be perform complete volte face over net zero when she say when the sceptic say that the green transition will cripple business we say they could not be more wrong when the critic say transition to

about every position possible even on monday they vote against their own football governance bill they actually write it and their poor mortified shadow secretary of state who have previously call it an excellent bill have to put up the good act that have see in long time of speak against it from the dispatch box the leadership of the leader of the opposition be be backseat drive by the shadow justice secretary who be on constant manoeuvre he be no doubt spend the day on the phone not to the elector but to his future backer he have promise this electoral pact with reform but the truth be that the two party be indistinguishable at the moment can not tell the difference between the once great conservative party and the reform party because we all know that vote tory today mean vote

parkinson uk and cure parkinson to share their experience and story they do so in the hope that their voice combine will be great than the sum of their part and that together they can improve the journey for those follow in their footstep the reality of live with parkinson can be harsh although it be categorise as movement disorder it can affect movement speech swallowing and cognition it can cause hallucination depression and pain for many their condition fluctuate unpredictably throughout the day so what might seem like good morning can spiral very deeply into challenging afternoon and too many people still wait too long for diagnosis draw the attention of the house to the movers and shakers group of people with parkinson whose outstanding contribution and production have be beacon of support for those with parkinson some of they be in the gallery and will be familiar to many in this house include gillian lacey solymar rory cellan jones mark mardell and sir nicholas mostyn thank they for be here today my hon friend be make powerful speech about this very complex condition he mention rory cellan jones who be well know as bbc technology correspondent and as the person who house sophie from romania famous dog lover he be my constituent in ealing totally agree with my hon friend the movers and shakers podcast which win the broadcasting press guild good podcast of the year award have show with such humanity and warmth the up and down lot of down of this very sad condition which be grow assure the sufferer in this country and the million worldwide that today attendance be reflection not of the importance of this debate but of electoral event outside this house do my hon friend agree that the parky charter to encourage more research into this terrible condition that afflict so many which rory lobby quite often about deserve government funding hope that my hon friend the minister on the treasury bench be also listen if rory have already tell my hon friend little bit about the parky charter she be about to get repeat on world parkinson day the movers and shakers group bring hundred of people with parkinson together in old palace yard those people sing with one voice in rework version of will survive their demand to have the parky charter adopt will spare the house my singing voice but that charter be bold five point plan back by the three major parkinson charity in the uk it be not wish list it be road map to dignity and will take some time to outline those five demand the first demand be for speedy specialist people refer for possible parkinson diagnosis should see consultant within week and have annual review thereafter the second be instant information parkinson diagnosis should be accompany by immediate clear and accessible information the third be the parkinson passport tool to communicate patient need across all healthcare touchpoint the fourth be comprehensive care every person with parkinson should have full access to multidisciplinary team of specialist nurse physiotherapist and occupational and speech therapist the fifth be the quest for cure determined and fund national commitment to support parkinson research these be not unattainable dream they be basic standard of decency fairness and evidence base healthcare will start with the first two demand which be diagnosis and information currently neurology service in england be see only about half of patient within the week target and the waiting list for neurology service now exceed the situation in scotland and wales follow similar pattern of long waiting list in my constituency nhs fife have median wait for first neurology appointment of week and nine out of people be see within week in contrast next door in forth valley which be also part of my constituency nine out of people be see within just nine week there be currently people wait to see neurologist in fife and in forth valley it can never be acceptable for person postcode to dictate the quality of care they receive as part of my preparation for today debate hear from someone who have be diagnose with young onset parkinson disease at the age of just just few year old than he tell that when his gp identify symptom he be refer to his neurology service urgently underline the word urgently and that the expectation from his gp be that urgent mean that he would be see within day when he have not hear from the hospital five day later he call to check that it have receive his referral and be tell that the person at the top of the waiting list have be wait for week so week so far for an urgent appointment do my hon friend agree that await diagnosis and that shatter diagnosis when it eventually come have massive impact on not just the individual concern but their wide family and that any action on this issue should be holistic and family base that be exactly my response when hear that story imagine what it must be like for someone and their love one to sit with suggest diagnosis of something so serious and significant have to wait nine month before even see specialist for the first time to it feel like clash between bureaucracy and humanity we can and we must push for well the uk currently rank out of european nation when it come to the number of neurologist per capita that be not workforce issue or bureaucratic issue it be sign of systematic failure and life alter injustice parkinson be condition that can progress rapidly and delay mean lose time lose function and lose hope however the crisis do not end with diagnosis in fact for many that be when the sense of abandonment begin nearly quarter of people diagnose with parkinson report that they be not give adequate information about their condition similar number as refer to by the right hon member for gainsborough sir edward leigh be not tell about the support available through parkinson uk the helpline the care adviser the group that offer peer support and the crucial service that can help people adapt cope and find community can you imagine madam deputy speaker receive life alter diagnosis and be send home with no clear path no specialist nurse no appointment no physiotherapist and no speech therapist just prescription and sense that your life have fundamentally change that be not care that be neglect again there be hope the parky charter call for parkinson passport and it be possible that the foundation for that already exist in the pioneer parkinson connect programme that programme allow clinician to refer patient directly to the full network of support that parkinson uk offer from specialist nurse to peer support group helpline and tailor advice it be low cost high impact and crucially scalable when the minister respond later in the debate will she agree to meet parkinson uk to explore how parkinson connect can be scale across the country it be the type of innovation that our health system need solution that empower people and relieve pressure on the nhs simultaneously the fourth strand of the parky charter be comprehensive care people with parkinson should not be lose in bureaucratic labyrinth while their condition worsen government across the uk could deliver diagnostic pathway that guarantee access to parkinson specialist within week of referral not occasionally not when it be convenient but every single time that manageable goal align with exist national institute for health and care excellence guideline urge the minister to consider that the nhs long term workforce plan must deliver the neurological professional and parkinson specialist nurse that this country urgently need we must remember that delay in diagnosis and care lead to irreversible deterioration and the cost be not just human but financial parkinson cost the uk an estimate billion year much of which be avoidable through well care and early intervention recently speak with clinician who be emphatic in his view that people with parkinson need to be able to access specialist service easily in turn those specialist service need to be able to recognise when advanced therapy such as apomorphine infusion produodopa and deep brain stimulation may be helpful critically patient must be able to access they easily and equally compare to our european counterpart this clinician view be that we do not use those advanced therapy as much as we should despite there be no lack of ambition in scotland we be lag behind on intervention such as deep brain stimulation which can be hugely impactful on people quality of life there be scope and there be hope to grow the provision for deep brain stimulation in scotland but we need to see urgent action attention and focus to make that reality we can not talk about comprehensive care without acknowledge the dedicated but wildly overstretched workforce our health professional do heroic work but they be overstretch today we be full time equivalent parkinson nurse short of what be need only of people with parkinson have access to occupational therapist only have access to therapist and just have access to speech and language therapist despite the fact that parkinson affect speech and swallow so acutely we must do well the nhs across the uk must invest in this disciplinary workforce that enable people with parkinson to live well invest in the parkinson workforce be not just the humane thing to do but the economically smart thing to do we also need to make sure we be spend smarter in scotland it have be year since the christie commission talk about the urgency of reform for public service to make progress on preventive spend to improve outcome for patient that commission be start by different political party from my own but it be absolutely the right thing to do and its finding be welcome across the political spectrum however despite that work consensus here we be year later still make the same argument for change hope that during her speech the minister will confirm that the forthcoming nhs year plan will make similar commitment on preventive spending but with more of an outline about how we will deliver that change of funding priority unlike the promise that we have see in scotland will move on to talk about personal independence payment and the cost of live with parkinson beyond the nhs our support system be fail people with parkinson the average person with parkinson incur extra cost of year and when lost income be factor in that rise to more than annually pip be intend to offset those cost yet parkinson claimant be more likely to be incorrectly assess than those with other condition we know that the status quo of assessment and award for pip be unfit for purpose and that reform be necessary campaigner have welcome some of the move in the recent green paper publish by the government however the government proposal to tighten pip eligibility for example by require minimum four point score in one daily living category would miss the big picture for people with parkinson and could deny support to many who be profoundly affect by their condition and who rely on this working age benefit to underpin the quality of their life as part of that necessary reform urge the minister to work with colleague in the department for work and pensions to consider submission from organisation include parkinson uk in pursue reform of this break system labour model of welfare support should start from position of consider the individual and be system that embrace the principle of dignity fairness and respect let draw my speech to close on note of hope from the charter fifth demand the quest for cure we stand on the brink of transformative discovery we have scientist and there be momentum but what we need now be fund the uk be already lead the way in innovative research the edmond safra foundation accelerate clinical trial in parkinson disease platform trial be host by university college london and support by the national institute for health and care research and parkinson uk it be global first multi arm multi stage trial that fast track promise treatment the government have invest million which have leverage an additional million in overseas funding and catalyse million programme but urge they to go far national registry model on successful scheme in the us could connect patient to clinical trial more effectively well datum would mean well fast and more inclusive research we will not find cure without involve people live with parkinson in trial and they be willing as one participant helen put it to you not do it for you you do it for future generation the government billion pledge be welcome but condition that cost the economy billion year and affect more than people can not remain under prioritised will the minister commit to meet cure parkinson and parkinson uk to discuss how targeted investment can turn hope into reality let return to the voice that bring we here the parky charter be not wish list it be manifesto for dignity its reasonable and fair demand offer we clear and achievable path forward speedy diagnosis inform and empower patient co ordinate care comprehensive support and determination that we will find cure these be not luxury they be necessity for dignity and survival we owe it to those live with parkinson now and to those who will be diagnose tomorrow to act decisively this be the moment when we can turn awareness into action and pledge into progress particularly thank my office staff member vonnie sandlan who not only bring this issue to my attention but conduct much of the research for my speech she have educate and hope other about the importance of tackle parkinson effectively and in co ordinate manner and allow to hear some of the incredible story to which have refer today look forward to hear the various contribution from member on both side of the house and the minister response thank the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for secure this debate and the backbench business committee for allow it and also thank he for the eloquent way he address the issue do not think disagree with he on single thing at the risk of repeat some of what he say will try to explain why be stand here today to be honest because have see the story of michael fox and muhammad ali be previously of the opinion that huge amount of progress have be make in deal with parkinson disease be recently invite to meet people at the parkinson café in balsall common in my constituency where have moment of clarity as member of this house we all go through such moment and understand that there be huge gap there be about carer and people suffer from parkinson who speak about their condition eloquently and bravely this be really timely debate on day when many of we will have demand on our time give the local election and it be great privilege to speak as the hon member say parkinson be hugely debilitate disease although disproportionate number of people get diagnose in their later year there be no minimum age threshold as we see in the case of michael fox in fact think he be diagnose at the age of parkinson can lead to sensory issue voice change facial masking and of course movement issue it really be significant life altering condition which obviously affect not just the individual but the people around they have be astonish to see the lack of care and support for people with parkinson for which there number of reason the parky charter have some reasonable and legitimate request to which certainly lend my support will work with the government and support their endeavour in this area because there be about people in the uk who suffer from parkinson we have significant number across the borough of solihull have the pleasure of meet jane lindsay who be diagnose with parkinson in and lot of the thing that she tell relate directly to the request in the parky charter after receive diagnosis and leave hospital with her husband jane do not know anything about the disease she say to just be sure where this will all lead there be significant lack of support and information so jane who have be in the teaching profession for almost year and spend year as headteacher decide that she be go to do something about it with the help of local gp sally frank she set up the balsall common parkinson café in the date will not be lose on people as it be at the height of covid she find that be in touch with other sufferer of parkinson be lifeline because as the hon member for dunfermline and dollar say when he recite poem she know people who walk in the same shoe and who share the same experience and concern initially there be only six member of the group but it have now expand to at least they be very lucky because they meet regularly in the church hall where they get the facility for free commend the church for offer that support jane her husband and gp sally frank along with friend and family have do an immense amount of work to raise awareness and fund they have do charity walk golf day sponsor half marathon afternoon tea ball comedy night quiz and croquet game they have raise over which be really valuable however only four of the people at the balsall common meeting that attend have the support of parkinson nurse which show the sheer need for the specialist care that be require the chair of the solihull branch of parkinson uk martin sewell say this be great opportunity for we to reach more people affect by the condition in the solihull area with information and support he specifically thank the people of that solihull village who be able to meet in such marvellous location at the heart of the community turn to the parky charter the hon member for dunfermline and dollar mention the workforce which be clearly really acute issue that be demonstrate by the fact that only four of the people at the meeting have access to relevant nurse would really welcome the minister reflection on how the nhs long term workforce plan which the conservatives instigate when we be in government will help to give more support to sufferer of parkinson as the hon member mention there be significant lack of datum on parkinson try to get the figure for how many people in my constituency suffer from parkinson from the house of commons library we be give the waiting list for neurology department but the number of parkinson sufferer be not report or publish anywhere that be fundamental issue that would encourage the government to look at and it should certainly be address at the very first instance some of those wait for neurological referral wait more than week so significant number of people have to wait for very long time those who like jane have very little information be in effect leave to their own device to figure out the next step greatly support the parkinson passport which the parky charter call for not least because it would provide instant access to blue badge and to free prescription this seem to to be logistical or operational need so if doctor be able to assess someone and say that they have parkinson that should set the individual down neurological pathway that allow this stuff to happen almost instantly it be something that people with parkinson should not have to worry about we know how debilitate the disease be how people will deteriorate and that there be no cure such individual be set down that path so we should look to alleviate some of their concern the hon member for dunfermline and dollar mention pip and one of the thing raise with at the café be the issue of reassessment and of have to go through all that again if the reassessment be to see how the individual have deteriorate and what further support need to be give that be different from have to go through the rigorous pip reassessment to see if they be still entitle to it which be really stressful for people who be already in very stressful situation would greatly support anything that can be do about that because pip certainly in this instance be basic lifeline to maintain level of wellness would be interested to hear the government thinking because while there have be lot of talk about pip encourage people into work we know that these people be only go to deteriorate so what support can be give the real question here be about research and development know that the government have commit billion to funding but would be interested to know what their thinking be about support the treatment of parkinson the hon member mention this and join his call for more funding in this field do not realise that lot of the treatment be develop or year ago and that there have be very little progress since so would very much support any increase in funding my remark have be limit because the hon member go through the issue comprehensively and thank he for do so to steal one of his line the parky charter be really manifesto for dignity probably all of we across the house would agree that we do this job to help the most vulnerable so if we can make change to give these individual dignity will certainly support they thank my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for secure this important debate parkinson uk tell that there be about people live with the condition in my constituency of stirling and strathallan across scotland almost one in six people with parkinson be under and one in three be over which be reminder that this condition affect people of all age one of those people be my constituent john lange who be diagnose in at the age of just in john co found the forth valley young parkinson group as space for people of work age to share experience and support one another in john and his wife anne open small fundraising shop in st ninians over the last decade that shop have grow into well know charity business in stirling city centre raise thousand for parkinson uk and parkinson research it call something old something new and would encourage anyone visit stirling to drop by murray place and see the brilliant work john and anne be do parkinson be condition that affect not just the body but person independence confidence and ability to stay connected so while treatment be crucial have the right support network in place matter just as much parkinson uk support over local group across scotland and work with more than volunteer these group provide everything from exercise and dance class to singing and art session help people to stay active and feel part of community that understand what they be go through in stirling and strathallan we have see that community spirit in action mxp fitness local gym run box session design specifically for people with parkinson with support from parkinson uk physical activity grant programme these session lead by former stirling albion player craig comrie be all about building strength and mobility in safe and support way as craig put it to the stirling observer recently no one be get knock out no one be tyson fury however the benefit be real and the feedback have be overwhelmingly positive for those who prefer football to boxing the stirling albion foundation have just launch new walk football session for people live with parkinson hold on tuesday morning the session promote movement co ordination and connection from what hear there be lot of laughter too want to thank the team at stirling albion not just for this new initiative but for their wide work across the community also wish they very happy birthday in these activity the boxing the football the local fundraising be all example of how community be step up to support those live with parkinson it be uplift to see such creativity and compassion at local level and know that be replicate in community right across the united kingdom want to mention remarkable local figure my constituent kay mair this year mark the anniversary of parkinson nurse whose specialist knowledge and experience make huge difference to patient and family kay be one of the long serve parkinson nurse specialist in scotland have work in the field since she be nhs forth valley lead nurse for parkinson and found member of the alliance of scottish parkinson nurse specialists last month she be invite to st james palace for tea with the duchess of gloucester in recognition of the incredible work she have do for nearly three decade kay be exactly the kind of specialist nurse we need more of which be why investment matter for the treatment of parkinson and for the nhs in general in england the labour government commit almost billion to the nhs in the recent budget and that be already start to make difference since the election there have be an additional million appointment with waiting list fall by nearly in deprive area which be help people get back to work back to their life and back to health in contrast in scotland despite record budget settlement one in six scot be wait for care and over have wait for more than year these be not just number they be our neighbour friend and constituent who be leave in limbo by system that need urgent attention nhs staff across scotland be do their good but they be be let down by lack of strategic leadership and long term planning by poorly perform snp scottish government while the challenge be real so too be the determination of community across the country to meet they pay tribute to parkinson uk for the incredible work it do not just in support people and raise awareness but in campaign for well service and lead research into cure also thank all those work behind the scene such as the researcher strive for breakthrough the nurse deliver expert care and the many volunteer bring energy kindness and hope to their community every day also want to recognise the thousand of individual who raise money by undertake personal challenge all around the country and internationally my constituency kim somerville from auchterarder have recently return from an eight day trek across costa rica which have raise more than for parkinson uk parkinson may be tough diagnosis but thank to people like john anne kay craig and kim and the team at parkinson uk and all the staff in our nhs no one have to face it alone together we can build future in which everyone affect by parkinson feel support empower and hear first thank the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for secure this important debate agree with everything he say in his excellent speech except for one small thing give the importance of the topic be shocked to find that the last time parkinson be debate be in my researcher may be wrong on that point but that be what be lead to believe hope this discussion be of such calibre that it will make up for the long time since we have that debate all my remark today be entirely in the spirit of cross party co operation have no intention whatever to make any cheap party political point either in relation to the uk or to scotland have career in health and social care of more than year of those as commissioner and regional director have to say to my eternal shame that parkinson rarely get look in when we look at physical disability and sensory impairment of course it do but not to the extent that it should have pay tribute to those who be live with parkinson and to their family as have be say the condition affect around people in the uk include at least people in my constituency also pay tribute to the volunteer who do tireless work to support people live with parkinson parkinson uk do incredible work to support those across the uk and in my constituency where it run support group in both peterhead and fraserburgh tasha burgess from parkinson uk have do amazing work particularly for today and know that she might consider extend the work of those support group to banff macduff and buckie in the western part of my constituency the group be vital to deliver support in the community just know that there be support network nearby of people go through the same thing staff by knowledgeable volunteer make such an incredible difference to people go through what can be the hard time of their life research have be mention it be right that research funding go to area such as cancer diabete and motor neurone disease but sadly parkinson be the poor cousin in that regard the hon member for dunfermline and dollar point out that it be the fast grow neurodegenerative condition in the world yet parkinson uk tell that there be no treatment to stop or slow down the condition only to deal with the symptom that be something that this parliament must address want to focus mind in the chamber today on how the benefit system treat people live with parkinson many member have already raise concern about change to pip eligibility announce by the uk government in march it go without say that the change may have severe and negative impact on those live with parkinson that can be contrast against the adult disability payment introduce by the scottish government which replace pip people with parkinson and those involve in the application process have report that the adp assessment be much more accurate and compassionate than that for pip importantly the adp application use paper base evidence as oppose to an in person assessment which be report to poorly serve those live with parkinson the issue of face to face assessment stem from neither assessor nor the criterion be able to capture the reality of condition that fluctuate as heavily as parkinson be sure the minister be pay attention to but be aware that when the work capability assessment be drop from universal credit assessment the westminster government do not communicate that to the scottish government be hopeful that go forward there will be well level of communication between the government in that regard in march the work and pensions committee report on health assessment for benefit state that when the scottish government publish its plan evaluation on adp dwp should learn from the result and consider what change if any it should make to its benefit assessment would be keen to hear the minister thought on that in her closing remark the principle embed within our welfare system should be matter of principle for all mp we need to prioritise system that treat people with the dignity and respect they deserve there be an opportunity to learn from the scottish government approach to disability benefit strongly encourage the uk government to consider replicate our approach in scotland to deliver well outcome for those live with parkinson thank my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for secure this important debate and for his eloquent speech there be not word that would disagree with as he describe parkinson be the fast grow neurological condition in the world and around people live with the condition in the uk in april we mark world parkinson day and parkinson awareness month as part of parkinson uk event here in parliament have the opportunity to hear directly from people affect be especially grateful to angie from parkinson uk for take the time to share her experience with and discuss how we can improve care and support for people live with parkinson disease it be for people like angie in hertford and stortford that want to contribute to today debate for as know will be the case for other hon member it be personal through the experience of friend and love one have see at first hand the impact of parkinson diagnosis would like to briefly share their story today first the mum of one of my close friend be diagnose with parkinson in person whom it would be no exaggeration to describe as one of the warm kind and most generous people you could meet the kind of mum who make you feel like part of the family and always insist you stay for dinner she too have benefit hugely from the movers and shakers group with the support of parkinson uk she and group of friend all working age people diagnose with parkinson set up the herts parkinson wellbee directory work with the nhs and other local organisation their work ensure that hertfordshire resident diagnose with parkinson can quickly and easily find information and access local support to help they manage their condition resident can access their directory by visit thank they for their inspirational work support other with their diagnosis also want to talk about andy when first meet andy he be introduce to as the husband of my local labour party long stand or perhaps long suffer election agent brenda be about at the time stand in local council election in what use to be true blue hertfordshire that be destine to lose little do know just how important andy and brenda would be to by the time be elect to this place in july last year in so many way would not be stand here today as the member of parliament for hertford and stortford be it not for andy and brenda when be prepare for this debate reflect on the fact that could not pin down when or how andy have tell about his parkinson diagnosis that be testament to andy innate ability to turn topic that other might find difficult to discuss into everyday conversation indeed learn much about myself through simple conversation while travel from visit to visit with he during the general election but it be also testament to his willingness to speak openly about his parkinson break down the stigma for other with diagnosis and know that it do not define he and that it can make it easy for other to talk about their condition today andy pellant be not just mentor to but friend it be my privilege to put his name on the record in this debate would like to take this opportunity to pay tribute to julie walker who have be write she regular parkinality column in our local newspaper the bishop stortford independent for the past seven year to help people to well understand life with parkinson diagnose aged every year julie do something to mark parkinson awareness month in the hope that cure will be find and that there will be no need for another this year julie have compile all the poem she have write about live with the condition into book with the proceed go to parkinson uk and cure parkinson encourage everyone in hertford and stortford and in this chamber to support her work would like to take this opportunity to highlight some of the positive work be do in our community to support those live with parkinson be really pleased to read this week that everyone active be partner

exercise class at hartham leisure centre in hertford and grange paddocks leisure centre in bishop stortford alongside up to three of their carer encourage any resident in hertford and stortford live with parkinson to take advantage of that support welcome the work that this labour government be undertake to deliver the year health plan for england which will radically reform how people in hertford and stortford with long term condition like parkinson be treat on the nhs with hundred of thousand of patient in england still on the waiting list for neurology service and almost half wait for more than week to start their treatment similarly welcome how the elective reform plan will help to deliver more neurology appointment every year no one should lay awake at night worry that their condition be get bad while they wait to see specialist by provide extra appointment scan and operation in the evening and at weekend know this labour government will clear the backlog for neurology appointment however we can go far and do have few policy question would like to raise would be grateful if the minister could reflect on they in her response first as other hon member have say today number of resident have write to call on the government to implement the five step set out in the parky charter which my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar set out eloquently the point around speedy specialist instant information parkinson passport comprehensive care and quest for cure be incredibly important will touch on the parkinson passport because number of constituent have write to raise the matter of free prescription to which people with parkinson be entitle in scotland wales and northern ireland but not in england support by major parkinson charity delivery of the charter would help to deliver timely diagnosis comprehensive care and dignity for all those live with parkinson disease know the minister take these matter incredibly seriously and will have read the charter in detail so would be grateful if she could share what consideration she have give to it in her response when speak to andy ahead of today debate he highlight how almost everyone he have meet with parkinson diagnosis recognise that with the benefit of hindsight the sign of their condition be present year before they be diagnose have the minister therefore consider the potential benefit of national education programme to help people to identify the early sign of parkinson disease know that hon member across the house will have their own experience or will have know someone with parkinson disease we have hear many move speech today and be sure we will hear more the unity show across the house today in support of those live with parkinson and in support of find cure be to be commend and be grateful for the opportunity to have contribute to the debate thank the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for lead the debate with such an emphatic and detailed speech also thank his staff for ensure that all my office staff have access to the most up to date information on our constituency there be something the hon gentleman know about my constituency that do not know until his staff send that helpful information it help we all to consider the issue parkinson be devastating condition that impact thousand across the united kingdom be pleased to be here to support this debate and to speak on this subject which be big issue in my constituency more people be move to live in my constituency who by and large be of certain generation and because of that be more susceptible to parkinson with other complex need want to speak specifically about pip which be big issue for and my staff have one staff member who do nothing else most of the time it be always important to to represent my constituent and as dup health spokesperson these issue be very close to my heart we all know someone who have parkinson whether it be family member friend or someone else and represent that be half the battle to achieve change we have hear figure outline the scope of this issue across our country to give my local perspective some people have be diagnose with parkinson across northern ireland and the majority be age to in my constituency we have people suffer with parkinson the most recognise impact of parkinson include tremor bradykinesia instability and stiffness people with parkinson can feel freeze cold nearly all the time even when the rest of we feel warm there be also many non motor symptom that people with parkinson will face include fatigue and cognitive change be pleased to attend parkinson uk parliamentary drop in early this month where it be great to discuss the personal independence payment and how the change will relate to people with parkinson have also submit numerous parliamentary question on the matter light the real scope of the issue have be contact by many constituent express their concern for family member who have the disease parkinson uk have reveal that people suffer from the disease incur extra cost of some per annum on average when loss of earning be factor in that figure can rise to personal independence payment be therefore crucial to help with the additional cost that come with this sickness pip be not an incentive not to work get really quite annoyed when hear people say that people want to work but sometimes their disability restrict they from do so pip be not mean test and be unrelated to person employment status the suppose change that have be discuss be that people will be eligible only if they score four or more point in one category which will directly impact so many people who suffer wide range of issue stem from their illness have real concern about the proposal that government be look to bring forward as the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan have refer to previously people with parkinson be on average more likely to be inaccurately assess for pip at the mandatory reconsideration stage than claimant with other condition that be shocking when someone with parkinson make pip application the person who look at it need to understand the condition my office win almost of all our mandatory reconsideration and appeal that be not criticism of people by the way it be an observation which tell there be something wrong with how the application be look at clearly there be call for social security provision especially for people with parkinson which be be overlook urge the minister to look at this matter together with the secretary of state for work and pensions as always that be mean as constructive comment be strong supporter of invest in research base at queen university belfast be collaborative hub that connect researcher healthcare professional and the local community such hub be crucial in help to improve the quality of life for people with parkinson more funding will enable research in digital modernisation and make pivotal mark on brain health research there be so much work to be do if we can all work together we can do more to find cure for disease such as parkinson for parkinson

for ilford south jas athwal for share that incredibly powerful and emotional story of jagdeep journey be sure that be something that will remain with many of we today also thank my constituent who write to to share their personal story it be often not easy to reach out to someone whom we do not know and whom we have never meet before and share the most painful aspect of our life like my hon friend be shocked and surprised to hear that parkinson have never be fully debate in this chamber in there be an adjournment debate on young onset parkinson but we be right that record today across the uk people be live with parkinson more than of whom be in scotland the condition often come with range of complex condition as we have hear affect speech mobility and sleep some of those live with parkinson also have dementia which greatly impact their care need yet far too many go without any information on the support service that be available after their diagnosis both those with parkinson and their caregiver experience long and complex care journey which all too often isolate they from society we have already hear today about the significant and harrowing impact that that can have on mental health the experience of parkinson disease be heartbreaking for we to hear about today but it be even more difficult for those who have to deal with it and live with it day in and day out when think of parkinson recall someone whom once know many year ago his road to diagnosis be long he be young man bowler and be at the heart of his club both on the green and in the clubhouse but it become clear that something be very wrong as he start to stumble and struggle to walk that often lead to hush whisper of concern as to what could possibly be wrong in someone so young he be unaware of what be cause the change to his body impact his mobility and co ordination and as result participation in the sport and the sporting community that he love these be in fact the early sign of young onset parkinson the symptom of which can easily be misattribute to other illness young onset parkinson impact one in of those live with the condition see at first hand how lack of awareness of parkinson symptom and young onset parkinson can cause anxiety confusion and distress and can result in delay in seek help this just highlight how important it be to have well fund and comprehensive medical and community support for those live with parkinson but unfortunately these story be not unique from constituent email we with their worry and personal story from friend and family we each know how devastating this disease can be across scotland the situation be dire the wait time for diagnosis be deeply distressing and over half of parkinson patient in the borders ayrshire and arran experience wait of over week in my constituency cover by forth valley nhs board and nhs lothian wait time can be as long as week for more than quarter of patient these waiting list lead to delay diagnosis leave many people struggle alone and without help the symptom can be frightening and demand dedicated support it be imperative that the scottish government get shift on they need to use the record break settlement from this government to start to tackle those wait time bring clarity to people at time of great uncertainty and deliver the support that they need because the condition go beyond the physical welcome this government investment to bring down neurology waiting list to speed up diagnosis time but we can not rest on our laurel because there be too much work to be do by invest in research improve healthcare access and foster supportive community we can offer hope and improve the quality of life for many as mp msp and local representative it be our duty to ensure that those live with parkinson disease and their family have access to the good possible care and support we must recognise that key milestone have be achieve by campaigner and research scientist to alleviate the pain and isolation cause by the condition we must continue to raise awareness about parkinson disease reduce the stigma and ensure that those affected feel hear understand and support the public awareness raise in recent year be so important to those face year ahead with this disease they must know that they be not alone and where they can access help would like to share my gratitude for and commend the work of parkinson uk which have be invaluable we have hear much today about its fantastic work across the country would also like to recognise the advocacy of billy connolly and his bravery and honesty in talk about his diagnosis and his life with parkinson he have show his characteristic ability to broach even the dark of subject with humour and he have that cut through that can often be very difficult for some of we politician to achieve he have spark much need conversation thank to the event recently organise by my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar have the pleasure and privilege of meet dave clark former tv sport presenter and fierce advocate and successful fundraiser for parkinson uk he take the time to speak to about the unpredictability of his condition and how it can change on daily basis we need to take these personal testimony into account when consider any change to the welfare system dave experience reinforce the point we have hear today finally be glad that this debate could take place in the chamber as the centre of our democracy in this house be where support for those live with parkinson must be the loud congratulate my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie on secure this important debate at the end of parkinson awareness month would like to begin by pay tribute to my old friend and former colleague margo macdonald snp member of this house briefly in the and member of the scottish parliament for the snp and as an independent from until her death in anyone who know margo will remember that she be force of nature and that anything she do be do with her typical determination wit and good humour credit margo with my limited understanding of parkinson and its variability because for all the time she be in the scottish parliament she have parkinson but it do not stop she be one of the most effective communicator and advocate for her constituency in my constituency some people be believe to be live with parkinson as we speak want to thank those who care for they professional family member and volunteer alike for their hard work and commitment as we have hear there be no cure for parkinson and current treatment can manage only some of the symptom it can be frightening disease and one that can lead to depression and despair in scotland alone there be approximately new diagnosis every week in parkinson uk in scotland produce an excellent report call scotland can wait in the report parkison uk in scotland highlight the many challenge that people with parkinson currently face and the problem that will arise if the challenge of the increase number of people be diagnose be not address the report draw on experience and robust datum and make some very important point it highlight that invest in professional staff who can offer the kind of specialist treatment that people with parkinson need would be an important step forward exist staff be already stretch and if action be not take soon they will be push to breaking point ensure that people get the appropriate medication when it be need whether they be in hospital or at home be also vital crucially the mental health impact of parkinson need to be address include parkinson dementia which can be frightening for patient and their family recent freedom of information request reveal that since the year less than half million pound be spend by the scottish government on research into parkinson disease by my calculation that be something like per person suffer from the disease in scotland that seem to to be woeful amount of money recognise that the effort to find cure for parkinson will inevitably have to be global exercise and one that this government be sure will want to play large part in but everyone have to get their act together and up their game include the scottish government at the end of the day we want to find preventive approach to parkinson but cure along the way would be helpful too parkinson uk in scotland call its report scotland can wait and rightly so the people diagnose every week can not wait and the people in glasgow west certainly can not either it be time for government on both side of the border to act and work with parkinson uk and parkinson uk in scotland to ensure that we do well for people with parkinson for their family and the staff who support they parkinson uk have show we the way it be now time that we follow it we now come to the front benchers call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for bring forward this important debate and thank all member who have contribute everyone have make excellent contribution that be thoughtful and move right now in the uk around people be live with parkinson and that number be set to increase to by richard from burgess hill in my constituency be one of those many thousand count richard as friend he be someone greatly admire for his courage and tenacity be lucky enough to speak to he recently and get brief insight into his life with parkinson he tell that something he have notice since his diagnosis be increase anxiety he say that he now get anxious about everyday thing in way that he never use to he also say that the part of experience he have find most depressing be know that it be in his word one way street where his condition can only be manage by use ever increase level of medication from even short conversation with richard it be clear just how complex people experience can be it be also clear to that we need to do well as many hon member have say and that we have solution already but we just need to get on with it parkinson be the fast grow neurological condition in the world it be progressive it fluctuate and it affect everything from movement swallow sleep and speech through to mental health there be over symptom and each person experience be unique half of those live with the condition like richard experience anxiety or depression and up to can develop psychosis they be also six time more likely to develop dementia parkinson uk have identify some of the major failing in care today they include long wait for specialist lack of access to expert multidisciplinary team people not get their medication on time in hospital and limit mental health and dementia support there be also postcode lottery when it come to advanced treatment such as produodopa and deep brain stimulation those failing have consequence unplanned hospital stay severe complication and worsen mental health parkinson cost the uk an incredible billion year in england alone unplanned hospital admission cost million so this be not only health crisis but one with significant economic impact and my liberal democrat colleague believe that the system must change urgently and that the government have to act first we have get to fix the basic to do that we need to review the medicine supply chain people with parkinson must get their med on time we also need to expand the mhra capacity reverse the workforce cut and reduce the time for treatment to reach patient secondly we need to put care and support front and centre we can do that by give people with parkinson access to name gp someone who know their story and their condition and by make mental health priority not an afterthought that mean regular mental health check up easy access to service through walk in hub and restore the mental health and dementia care target that the government have abandon thirdly the government must step up and support carer behind every person with parkinson there be often someone else who care for they someone who be quietly exhausted we must provide respite break and ensure that carer have access to pay leave we need to fix the broken social care system once and for all it be time for those cross party talk no more delay as have say in this place before we will clear our diary to get those talk happen this issue be simply too important for diary clash wonder whether the minister can give we any clarity and date on those vital talk finally we have get to help people live and work with dignity and my liberal democrat colleague be campaign for new right to flexible work well accessibility standard for public space strong blue badge framework the incorporation of the un convention on the right of person with disability into uk law and the closing of the disability employment gap we can do that if we implement dedicated strategy for disabled worker simplify the application process and introduce adjustment passport so that workplace support follow the person even if their job change this be health issue an economic issue and social justice issue as other have say it be about human dignity we owe it to people live with parkinson that we must do well not some day but now let we build future where those with parkinson like richard get the proper help and support they deserve call the shadow minister it be pleasure to speak on behalf of his majesty opposition in this most important debate commend the hon member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for secure it and for his heartfelt and impassioned speech be particularly move by the recitation of bobbie poem and the highlighting of the amazing movers and shakers podcast thank all hon member for their heartfelt contribution on behalf of their constituent and those across the country live with parkinson we hear inspire story such as that of jagdeep as raise by the hon member for ilford south jas athwal and john and anne of something old something new as raise by the hon member for stirling and strathallan chris kane note that as result of other event in the country our debate have have relatively scottish flavour but parkinson awareness month be uk wide and time to focus national attention on the condition that affect over people here in the uk that number that continue to rise the disease impact not just individual but family carer and community it challenge both body and spirit demand comprehensive response from all sector of society we often learn about parkinson from friend family and colleague as be highlight so powerfully by the hon member for glasgow west patricia ferguson for it be deeply personal issue close family member be initially diagnose and treat for parkinson disease more recently that diagnosis be revise to progressive supranuclear palsy or psp which be rare and unfortunately more aggressive condition that journey from uncertainty to diagnosis and then live with progressive neurological condition have profoundly impact my family have witness at first hand the critical importance of early diagnosis specialist care emotional support and above all hope since become member of parliament have speak to many constituent across farnham bordon haslemere liphook and the surround village affect by parkinson have be inspire by their bravery and strength in respond to the cruel difficulty that life have throw at they parkinson have no cure as hon member have say and that be one of the many challenge that people and their loved one face on diagnosis but thank to advance in research and medicine there be ever improve treatment to help manage and relieve symptom as result many people with parkinson can have normal or near normal life expectancy physiotherapy occupational therapy and medication can help relieve symptom and enable people to stay live independently at home for long in my constituency people with parkinson have benefit from free membership of local leisure centre in whitehill and bordon and in haslemere help they to keep active and manage their symptom but there be so much more to do whether on research diagnosis treatment or hopefully cure last month ahead of world parkinson day like the hon member for hertford and stortford josh dean and for strangford jim shannon meet parkinson uk and individual affect by the condition hear powerful account from volunteer about the daily challenge they face from mobility issue and speech difficulty and the emotional toll on themselves and their family commend parkinson uk for its tireless work in provide advice support and advocacy at every stage of the parkinson journey help be available via its website and helpline encourage anyone who need support to reach out however as the hon member for bathgate and linlithgow kirsteen sullivan mention there be still many who do not know what support be out there that must change praise the local charity and volunteer across my constituency and across the country as raise by my right hon friend the member for gainsborough sir edward leigh and the work they do like the hon member for aberdeenshire north and moray east seamus logan have experience work in healthcare and during my tenure with the nhs get it right first time programme be involve in the publication of the neurology national speciality report the analysis in that report highlight significant variation in neurology service across england particularly in manage condition such as parkinson disease key conclusion include the urgent need for timely access to specialist neurology service the development of standardised care pathway for chronic neurological condition the expansion of the neurological workforce include advanced practitioner and much well datum as my hon friend the member for meriden and solihull east saqib bhatti mention those recommendation be essential to reduce disparity and improve outcome will the minister commit to address those three priority in more detail beyond general reference to cut waiting list and update the workforce plan medical research in the uk be fund by both public and private sector as well as charity and non governmental organisation in nearly million be spend on neurological research include parkinson and other neurodegenerative condition across individual project parkinson uk and cure parkinson alone contribute million under the previous conservative government we invest more than million in research into parkinson disease between and in the national institute for health and care research enable study relate to parkinson through its infrastructure we also roll out new treatment for advanced parkinson disease through the nhs start in february offer an additional option for patient whose symptom be no long respond to oral medication would be grateful if the minister would confirm the government plan to continue with that momentum what research funding will be maintain or increase what new treatment option be be support or explore we also make progress in workforce planning recruit record number of doctor and nurse and publish the first ever nhs long term workforce plan that plan recognise the need for more specialist nurse and clinician in area such as neurology the new government have commit to update that plan will they therefore retain that level of detail and maintain the focus on specialist role need for parkinson care want to raise constituent concern regard recent shortage of medication such as amantadine and apomorphine that have real distress consequence for people try to manage their condition the government have rightly acknowledge those supply constraint but what action be be take to restore and secure access to those medication we have also hear concern about the potential impact of president trump propose pharmaceutical tariff what assessment have be make of the risk that could pose to access and affordability of parkinson treatment turn to the labour government record to date believe that parkinson have yet to be identify as strategic priority will the minister confirm what level of funding be be allocate to parkinson research this year and how that compare with recent year there be also wide concern about the implication of tax and benefit change in the budget as the hon member for strangford raise include the national insurance rise many people with parkinson rely on social care service which be not exempt from the national insurance rise have any assessment be make of those extra cost for local authority charity and self funder charity such as parkinson uk do extraordinary work but they too be affect by those rise cost how be minister engage with the charity sector to understand how high taxis and squeeze funding may threaten support service or reduce research investment we know that neurology waiting time be already among the long in the nhs will the minister outline target plan to specifically address that will the government also publish long term strategy for neurological condition include parkinson with clear plan for service integration between the nhs and social care multidisciplinary multi agency approach be vital for people with parkinson to live full independent life finally what guarantee can the minister offer that recent restructuring in nhs england and the department of health and social care will not worsen access to parkinson service delay initiative or harm continuity of care with cut to integrate care board will the minister reassure people with parkinson and their family that they will not be disadvantage the house be unite in want to improve treatment support and outcome for people with parkinson we hope that the government will listen carefully to today contribution and respond with clear commitment that include action on workforce waiting time integration support for carer and access to research and innovation parkinson be relentless condition that rob individual of independence and dignity but with research investment compassionate care and community support we can fight back the conservative party stand ready to work constructively with the government and with member from all party to ensure that progress be not only continue but accelerate let we match awareness with action for only with action come hope be grateful to my hon friend the member for dunfermline and dollar graeme downie for raise this important issue and congratulate he on lead the first substantive debate on parkinson in the house also thank all back benchers for their insightful

servant hold for political purpose with no clear legal redress or access or even clear ground as to why they be be hold do he agree that international law should dictate here not domestic politic with government mark their own homework praise my constituent annette moskofian who represent armenians in the uk the minister can be assure that will write to she with some of annette demand after the debate the hon lady be right to mention the armenians if we go back even far we remember what happen in the armenian genocide she outline the case of those prisoner of conscience and prisoner of conflict in armenia know that the minister have take note of that and will come back to the hon lady who thank for her intervention as we all know thousand find themselves in prison across the globe not because they have violate law but because they have dare to articulate belief that challenge powerful interest or unpopular narrative they be individual who stand firm in their conviction at great personal cost admire any person who take stand on something that they fundamentally and strongly believe in it be unacceptable that in the century we continue to witness the persecution of such individual from china to iran and russia to nigeria those who seek simply to express their belief and exercise their right have face unjust attention and oppressive action these be not isolate incident unfortunately they reflect systematic state hostility towards religion and belief particularly under communist regime as nobel laureate aleksandr solzhenitsyn warn in hatred of god be the principal driving force behind communist policy militant atheism be not incidental it be essential to communist control let be clear such persecution be not limit to christians and sunni muslims falun gong practitioner hindus jews and many other face repression across the globe freedom of religion or belief be human right not privilege of one faith or nation it be every individual right as chair of the all party parliamentary group on international freedom of religion or belief be honour to discuss this topic to help those individual believe that we must make stand against that injustice which be why ask for this debate we must remind those in power that voice of dissent and freedom of thought consciousness and religion represent not merely an individual right but foundation of democratic society and that their offence be not go unnoticed today we bring that to the attention of all the place across the world where this be happen let we affirm our commitment to liberty by remember the ongoing struggle face by prisoner of conscience around the world may we encourage our constituent and community mine encourage every day to keep those prisoner in their thought and prayer while work together through advocacy and informed action to champion the value enshrine in article and to promote the many benefit these freedom bring to society that uphold they alongside article we must consider article which state everyone have the right to freedom of opinion and expression this right include freedom to hold opinion without interference and to seek receive and impart information and idea through any medium and regardless of frontier opinion and expression be the bedrock of any vibrant society that wish to do well and take people with it in unison they enable society to grow and thrive when we suppress dissent we undermine progress there be thousand of prisoner how can we respond to those innumerable violation of human right how can we begin to make difference often think of the analogy of the wee boy on the beach with the starfish the adult say you can save they all the wee boy say but can save this one we have the power to advocate loudly and clearly not just for the release of prisoner of conscience but for the root cause of this duress to be confront and dismantle through sustained diplomatic pressure international co operation and the strengthening of legal and institutional protection for freedom of religion or belief it be our responsibility to challenge the environment be they legal political or ideological that allow such injustice to persist and to ensure that no individual be ever imprison for live accord to their conscience call on the government to prioritise the issue of freedom of religion or belief violation in diplomatic dialogue know our minister do that and believe our government do but for the purpose of this debate we seek that reassurance particularly with state know for systematic abuse can think of many example include china russia iran and north korea we must sanction the individual responsible for religious persecution and we must fund and support civil society group work to secure prisoner release let we stand united in our unwavering commitment to uphold the principle enshrine in the freedom to change religion or belief if that be choice together let we be that voice for the voiceless and that hope for the hopeless they will probably never see this debate but they need to be reassure that we be speak for they in the way that we should would like to mention some of the thousand of prisoner of conscience who be currently hold in this awful state let the record show we have not forget they just want to name they will not go into all the detail but it be important that we have they on record they include jimmy lai pro democracy activist and medium tycoon in hong kong imprison for his advocacy of freedom of the press and british citizen we have not forget about he sahar mahdavi an iranian woman detain for participate in peaceful protest advocate for woman right my ulster scots accent will destroy these name yahaya sharif aminu nigerian gospel musician sentence to death for allegedly

and hold captive for refuse to renounce her christian faith most recently have look at the case of the continue imprisonment of chinese dissident dr wang bingzhang founder of china spring magazine leader of the overseas china pro democracy movement and permanent resident of the united states dr wang bingzhang be kidnap while travel to vietnam in take to the people republic of china and sentence to life imprisonment for his activism after trial that last half day and be close to the public where he be deny the right to due process and fair trial he have be hold in solitary confinement throughout his year in prison and his physical and mental health have seriously decline the united nations working group on arbitrary detention declare that the detention of wang bingzhang be arbitrary be in contravention of article and of the universal declaration of human rights congressional resolution in the united states congress of resolve that dr wang bingzhang be be arbitrarily detain in the people republic of china in violation of international law it be quite clear that he should be release and he have be in prison for year the international case be clear and we should co ordinate with the government of the united states in effort to seek the release of dr wang bingzhang and his safe immediate and unconditional return to the united states from the people republic of china could he be one of the starfish save while acknowledge that we can not save they all we can save some we must keep hope alive and hope that this debate will keep that hope alive for all those people as luke remind we the spirit of the lord be upon to proclaim liberty to the captive and to set at liberty those who be oppress let we proclaim that liberty and not forget the daily plight of prisoner of conscience alongside faith group international ally non governmental organisation and parliamentarian worldwide because this be not just the uk fight this be the world fight it be humanity fight for every one of those people the house be aware that my private member bill the special envoy for freedom of religion or belief bill be schedule for second reading have introduce this bill because believe we can do more today as think of prisoner of conscience also think of the persecute church of christ and those who be persecute simply because of their faith across the world we can not save they all but we can do more to save some look to the government to stand up stand alongside they and send message that the treatment of the human right of those who be minority will impact on trade deal our government aid programme and all aspect of international involvement this be about one thing alone freedom freedom to express ourselves in the way that we have the right to in this country it matter to prisoner of conscience it matter to the family it matter to the politician and it matter to this house hope the minister and the government will take the opportunity today to show that it also matter to they it be an enormous privilege to follow the hon member for strangford jim shannon who be tremendous advocate for the voiceless may begin by reiterate the importance of the question that he have raise and by ask the minister to address in her wind up the question of what action have follow the telephone call between the prime minister and president al sisi on the question of pursue the release of alaa abd el fattah be there any plan for secure the release of jimmy lai we have have many prisoner of conscience of our own at random off the top of my head could name thomas more dr barnes latimer and ridley cranmer archbishop laud and even john bunyan in bedford jail free parliament that have the will to do so could have campaign for their release and history might have be significantly different the problem for we now be that the prisoner of conscience be well beyond our jurisdiction so when we raise case with ministers often enough we have no leverage whatsoever with the jurisdiction that have imprison they we can no long simply deploy the royal navy as we might have do in the past and as indeed we do when we deploy it to eradicate the scandal of the international slave trade even in those jurisdiction where we do have alliance share national interest and good diplomatic relation often enough government have big fish to fry with respect to regional security and stability and international trade so when we raise case with ministers we be tell these be raise at the high when be minister raise they at the high level but not much action follow be we waste our breath be we waste the house time this be not counsel of despair it be essential that we continue to do as the hon member for strangford have do to persevere we have to try we have to try to lift the odd starfish as he say at the very least we will have send powerful message to those prisoner their relative and their friend that they be not forget that we do campaign for they and indeed that we pray for they we be remind in chapter of the act of the apostle that st peter guard by four squad and chain between two soldier be spring by an angel in chapter paul and silas be spring in an earthquake and end up evangelise the prison governor until those miraculous day return however we be confine to continue to raise matter with ministers accordingly raise the case of ali minaei young man in iran who have be in prison for the last year he be sentence for have attend church service in somebody home he also have severe heart condition he be deny medical treatment in prison and have be subject to beating include blow to his chest it be not untypical for christians in iran to be sentence for crime against state security to be give long sentence to have prolong interrogation sexual harassment and beating or to be deny privilege that other prisoner have access to see young ali as an architype for all those prisoner of conscience that my hon friend the member for strangford mention be they imprison for advocate for human right for their insistence on freedom of expression or because of their adherence to minority faith and whether they be imprison in xinjiang hong kong north korea afghanistan turkey egypt venezuela or wheresoever share belief with my hon friend that there will be day of liberation when the prisoner will be free but that day of rapture will also be day of wrath and judgment for their oppressor we ought all to shrink from that judgment because we share in the guilt of their tormentor through our inaction and by our silence call the liberal democrat spokesperson thank the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure this important debate we all agree that the number of member able to attend in the chamber today in no way reflect the importance we attribute to the issue it have much more to do with the democratic process happen in parish hall and on doorstep across the country right now as liberal democrats we stand firmly in solidarity with those imprison for their political view around the world we believe that free speech and the freedom to organise be fundamental democratic right and those imprison for such cause be true symbol in the fight for democracy free expression and the right to challenge government policy the free practice of religion should be universal right for all people everywhere it be vital that we shine light on religious persecution wherever we find it and commit to oppose it with unwavering resolve many religious people globally face extreme form of oppression include threat to their very life we be deeply concerned by the lack of global action to safeguard religious freedom protect minority group and uphold human right that must change liberal democrats have proud history as strong defender of freedom of religion and belief those be not just political position they be our core belief human right and the rule of law stand at the very heart of what it mean to be liberal democrat in our general election manifesto we commit once again to protect defend and promote human right for all include those persecute for their religion or belief we call for the appointment of an ambassador level champion for freedom of belief and increase funding for humanitarian aid and asylum support for those flee religious persecution we firmly believe that liberalism and co operation have vital role to play in secure peace promote democracy and defend human right across the world the uk must work with ally as champion of freedom of belief today certain country have notably high number of prisoner of conscience often tie to political regime religious repression or authoritarian governance in china the government policy in xinjiang have lead to the mass detention of uyghur muslims in re education camp where they face torture and force indoctrination house church christians face harassment arrest and imprisonment simply for practise their faith outside state control the deliberate systematic persecution of the uyghur population meet the standard for impose sanction under the sanctions and anti money laundering act we call on the government urgently to issue their uk china audit to set out clear approach that include work to shine spotlight on beijing human right abuse russia under president putin increasingly authoritarian leadership have see crackdown on opposition figure journalist and minority religious group jehovah witness have be label an extremist organisation lead to numerous arrest in power there be balance of opportunity and risk and one important point make by my right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne be that minister often have big fish to fry when deal with international relation from the hon gentleman perspective what be the right balance between stand up against human right abuse and maintain and develop relation with emerge power such as china that be an important question indeed it be one of the question for british foreign policy as we go forward this be not just about china we can also look at country such as türkiye at the moment where we see clear oppression of political opposition although türkiye also play key role in the defence in europe and the future of european security in relation to russia the hon gentleman be completely correct it be not for to tell the government how to get the balance right but any government need to have set of principle that they abide to and to say this be the standard we be set and we apply it equally to everybody those of we in the room might come to different conclusion as to what those standard be but the hon gentleman be absolutely right do not underestimate the compromise that have to be make by ministers obviously be not in that position but some of we in the chamber be and welcome the intervention in russia political dissident and human right activist have be persecute clear example of that be the late alexei navalny who die in prison on dubious and politically motivated charge the hon member for strangford mention aleksandr solzhenitsyn who publish the famous book the gulag archipelago in the that be so dangerous to the soviet regime that it be suppress completely and ban in russia great example of how freedom of expression can play an important role in bring down entire regime however secure they may seem at the time declare my interest as an unpaid trustee of the index on censorship think specifically about regime such as that in russia and the importance of allow journalist activist and other to achieve level of freedom of expression in those very repressive regime what would the hon gentleman say about the support give via different government agency for people in those sort of situation that be an area of great importance particularly in russia where the regime have now become so stifle that there be little freedom of expression at all within the country and we do not see much alexei navalny be great example of vladimir putin complete his suppression of political opposition it be fundamental for our government to support voice for democracy and freedom across the world and that be particularly important now when we face this challenge from russia which be interfere in the internal process of other country it also become particularly incumbent on lead democracy such as ours to find way to help promote freedom of expression and the ability of journalist to do their job be particularly important to that we have moral duty to stand with those who risk everything for democratic and press freedom from jimmy lai in hong kong to mzia amaglobeli journalist who be recently arrest in georgia good example of russian overseas interference the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne be right to mention alaa abdel el fattah who be imprison in egypt their courage be stark reminder that defend democratic value must never be selective or silent in iran the regime maintain strict interpretation of islam and enforce its religious law through harsh measure member of the faith be persecute on charge of apostasy or heresy christian especially convert from islam face arrest as conversion be consider criminal offence the recent crackdown follow the death of mahsa amini demonstrate the regime continued brutality accord to the united states commission on international religious freedom there be currently individual assess as imprison for their religion or belief with the high number find in china russia and iran the government must do more to work with our international partner to secure the protection of religious right and robustly challenge state to ensure all people be safe to worship and express their political belief this must include state uphold article of the universal declaration of human right that guarantee the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion we call for specific action first use the uk magnitsky sanction to stand up against human right abuse secondly ban import from area with egregious abuse such as xinjiang thirdly enshrine in law right for british national who have be politically detain abroad to access uk consular service fourthly develop comprehensive strategy for promote the decriminalization of homosexuality and advance right globally and finally strong uk engagement with international body such as the united nations the european union and the commonwealth to promote religious freedom worldwide we call for long term comprehensive global strategy to protect freedom of expression political and religious right and to create world where no one be imprison for peacefully express their belief the liberal democrats strongly oppose any form of authoritarian or totalitarian rule that seek to imprison or silence individual for their belief we will continue to urge the government to use the uk influence and foreign policy to promote and protect these value be there not dichotomy there the liberal democrats profess that they be against authoritarian rule and yet for we to project power internationally even if that be soft power we risk involve ourselves in the sovereign decision of independent country do the hon gentleman accept that when we seek to impose our value on other culture and country we create tension where do he think the right balance lie whole book on liberalism be write about this very topic as the hon gentleman probably know the situation in the united states at the moment have bring this into sharp focus for many year we have hear country around the world speak about how america at time with our support have intervene in the internal affair of their country and have ask how that be consistent when america have complain about they do the same thing now that america be take different role perhaps some people be reassess what level we should go to can not answer the hon gentleman question right now although be happy to have separate discussion with he if he would like but hon member who be interested in foreign affair have to think about the subject that he touch on and where the line lie famously the americans refer to the mogadishu line as line that they cross in somalia where they feel they get too involved in the internal affair of that country clearly that be difficult issue but thank he for raise it to conclude our commitment be clear to protect defend and promote human right for all around the world we will not rest until every person can freely express their belief without fear of persecution call the shadow minister begin by extend my thank to the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure this important debate he be tireless defender of human right and his dedication to the cause of those who be persecute for their belief wherever they may be be courageous admirable and much need thank he for it thank the backbench business committee for enable the discussion to take place it be vital debate and it be only shame that there be not more hon member present this country the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland have long be sanctuary for the oppressed and this chamber have be voice for the voiceless and champion of liberty from the day of william wilberforce to the last government establishment of special envoy for freedom of religion or belief this house of commons have stand up for the fundamental freedom of speech conscience and belief long may that continue wish to speak for those who can not speak freely themselves and who languish in prison cell not for any crime but simply for have the courage to believe differently to respectfully challenge authority or to follow their conscience in the face of tyranny we have have short but meaningful debate with some excellent contribution from colleague on all side of the house the hon member for strangford who speak passionately as he always do tell we about the importance of defend those who profess their faith and uphold their conviction and the importance of stand up for freedom the love of freedom have always inspire in politic grow up in the when we have prime minister who defend freedom around the world margaret thatcher stand against totalitarianism and communism across the world particularly in the soviet union belief in freedom and liberty drive the conservative party love of country be part of that and we have always be nation that have stand up for the liberty and freedom of the people of these island have great admiration for the hon member for ealing central and acton dr huq who be no long in her place and have work closely with she on the issue of armenia we recall the armenian genocide year ago she refer to her constituent annette moskofian who also know very well and with whom have work on uphold the freedom of the people of armenia as the hon lady say armenian prisoner who be be keep in azerbaijani jail also need to have their freedom armenia need to live as an independent free democracy without fear and the people must be allow to express their view freely last week attend wreath lay at the cenotaph with the hon lady and other hon member from across the house in support of our friend from armenia which be christian country that simply want to be democratic and independent and not to be threaten by an aggressive neighbour no one in this house could ever compete with the passion belief and deeply hold view of my right hon friend the member for new forest west sir desmond swayne have admire he ever since enter the house in he speak with enormous passion and he understand that this be christian country our law tradition and custom be found on those christian tradition if we discard they we discard everything we have in this country that do not mean that we do not respect other religion but our christian heritage be fundamental and lead britain to be champion of freedom free speech and freedom of religion and democracy around the world as we have be for far long than most other country my right hon friend rightly remind we of how our own royal navy erode the slave trade it be often forget that it be britain that lead the way against the slave trade thank he for everything that he do to stand up for the right of the oppressed and particularly those religious minority who be deny the right to worship and practise freely the liberal democrat spokesperson the hon member for lewes james maccleary speak extremely well and raise lot of issue that be well know throughout the house he speak about the uyghurs in xinjiang and the importance of the china audit which we be still wait for it be important that we get on with that we have moral duty to stand up for those who have lose their freedom britain have proud record of that that transcend party politic and be sure that it will do so in this house today he also mention those of the faith who be persecute which be another very important point there be superb intervention from my hon friend the member for broadland and fakenham jerome mayhew who have now leave his place he speak rightly about the balance between deal with nation around the world we want good relation and trade and co operation and we want to work with many country economically but equally we need to think about human right we need to balance those thing equally he speak about impose our value on other country which be always balance we can not impose british value on every country of different tradition and religion but nevertheless we should never be silent when we see an injustice know that certainly on the opposition benches and be sure on the government benches as people who believe in freedom and democracy we all stand for stand up against injustice wherever it may be in the world will rightly focus on the people members have mention who be wrongly detain in prison for their religion or belief what practical step be his majesty government take to monitor identify and support such individual the minister have lot of time to answer all these question she will need to tell we very clearly what resource be be allocate by the foreign commonwealth and development office to monitor prisoner of conscience globally how be that information be use in the uk broad human right strategy as member of the article alliance will the minister tell we whether the uk actively propose name for international advocacy as we have already hear the statistic be deeply alarming accord to the us commission on international religious freedom more than individual be currently imprison for their belief in just country that include people in communist china people in putin russia and people in iran other members have mention other country where similar issue need to be address such as vietnam and north korea the hon member for ealing central and acton mention azerbaijan and armenia which refer to early my right hon friend the member for new forest west quite rightly mention venezuela meet delegation from venezuela only last week and be an observer at venezuelan election some year ago have to say that it be not very democratic and do not think that much have change since in fact it have get lot bad we should absolutely highlight that country as one in need of radical democratic change my right hon friend also mention egypt and turkey there be many other country that we could think of but the point be that britain must lead the way we be the nation that always stand up for the right and freedom of people and we must do so with vigour and without compromise will the minister confirm whether the government have raise specific case with the government of those country and other if so will she tell we which one she have be speak to in recent day be aware that this debate be centre on matter of faith however like the hon member for strangford take the opportunity to raise the case of apple daily founder jimmy lai we need to see he release and an end to his politically motivated trial and the repeal of the draconian national security law in hong kong it be one matter to speak in this place about individual far afield who have little to no connection with these island but it be another matter when it involve british national what development have there be on that issue so far we talk lot about it but we see very little action give that the government look as though they be become more economically align with china which think be huge error will jimmy lai case be front and centre in our engagement with beijing have the minister specifically call for jimmy lai release in dealing with her chinese counterpart commend the hon member for strangford and all the member of the all party parliamentary group for international freedom of religion or belief for their laudable initiative and tireless effort in launch scheme that enable member of this house to advocate for individual prisoner of conscience that initiative represent meaningful and compassionate step towards amplify the voice of those who have be unjustly detain for exercise their fundamental right in the light of that important work must ask the minister whether the fcdo be actively support that endeavour by assist member in establish contact with relevant embassy in the united kingdom as well as engage with international legal and diplomatic mechanism to strengthen advocacy on behalf of those individual be pleased that the government heed the call from the opposition benches on renew the last government position in have special envoy for freedom of religion or belief however can the minister outline exactly what the special envoy be do to advance the cause of individual prisoner of conscience have the envoy engage directly with foreign government or institution to press for their release do the government intend to enshrine the post in law for which my good friend the former member for congleton fiona bruce passionately campaign when she serve in this house until last year britain have long use both aid and diplomacy to promote our value abroad in that context ask the minister whether the allocation of uk aid to recipient country be ever make conditional on demonstrable progress in safeguard freedom of religion or belief be consideration give specifically to the treatment of individual imprison solely on account of their religious conviction be our financial assistance ever leveraged to encourage reform and accountability in such case those in prison today for their belief be they christian ahmadiyya muslim jewish hindu buddhist any other religion or member of minority or non religious community deserve more than just our concern they deserve our advocacy our voice and our unwavering defence our foreign policy must reflect not only our national interest but projection of how we treat our own people we must never shy away from call out wickedness and unjust imprisonment or from defend the right to freedom of conscience as the great john stuart mill once member of this house so wisely say bad man need nothing more to compass their end than that good man should look on and do nothing we look forward to this government do something it be real pleasure to serve under your chairship madam deputy speaker and to respond to member in what have be fascinating debate be very grateful to the hon member for strangford jim shannon for secure it and be very grateful for the contribution of other hon member will try to respond to all the point raise the government stand in solidarity with those who be in prison solely because of their religious or other belief and we call on government to ensure that the right to freedom of religion or belief be protect and promote for all people everywhere society that respect and uphold human right include freedom of religion or belief be generally strong more stable and prosperous as many in the chamber have articulate so eloquently the scale of freedom of religion or belief abuse and violation globally be of grave concern article of the universal declaration of human right state that everyone have the right to freedom of thought conscience and religion however the reality face by many include the community in yemen and iran the ahmadis in pakistan the church member in nicaragua who have be harass and arbitrarily detain and non muslims catch up in sudan civil war be far remove from that principle persecution harassment discrimination and arbitrary detention be sadly part of daily life for many my hon friend the member for ealing central and acton dr huq and the spokesperson for his majesty opposition the hon member for romford andrew rosindell both mention the current issue of armenians in detention follow the recent conflict with azerbaijan annette moskofian have have few mention because she be such an ardent believer in freedom of religion or belief and be the constituent of my hon friend the member for ealing central and acton for those reason we be work hard to highlight and address the scale and severity of freedom of religion or belief abuse and violation include by lobby for the release of prisoner of conscience shall set out some example lorenzo rosales fajardo pastor and leader of an independent church in cuba be imprison for participate in peaceful protest in that country the foreign secretary write to he in december last year to express solidarity and call on the cuban authority to release he we be delighted to hear that he be release in january as the right hon member for new forest west sir desmond swayne say this must not be counsel of despair occasionally we get good news in these case mubarak bala have also be mention in this debate nigerian atheist and president of the humanist association of nigeria he be sentence to year for his belief we regularly lobby the nigerian government include through letter to the kano state governor and call by ministers for his release and we be pleased to hear that he be also free in january of course there be many other example and will try to set out what we be do to support they the uk be determined to use its extensive diplomatic network to champion freedom of religion or belief on the international stage as member have mention our human right approach be be refresh by the minister for human right in the other place lord collins he will come to parliament in the usual way to set out that work when it be complete be very pleased to meet my hon friend the member for north northumberland david smith early this week to discuss his role as the uk special envoy for freedom of religion or belief to address the bill propose that we make that role statutory while we recognise the benefit of the position we do not believe that its value would be enhance by make it statutory as such we will continue with the approach take by the last government under the excellent fiona bruce maintain the role as an office within the foreign office but with strong sense of challenge welcome the tone in which this debate be be conduct give that the minister will not make the special envoy role statutory will she state very clearly that she will not make something else statutory that she will not reintroduce blasphemy law in the united kingdom she will recognise that the abolition of the blasphemy law in the and mean that people could express whatever belief they happen to hold in completely free way that end level of oppression that have be possible although not exercise for many year will the minister make absolutely clear that in no way will this government support blasphemy law and that they will not allow police to introduce one through the back door by criminalise act that would otherwise be cover by freedom of expression will she make absolutely clear that his majesty government stand for freedom of religion and non belief not just belief and that that mean the freedom to change one religion to reject previous religion and to criticise any religion do she agree with that of course agree that freedom of religion or belief or the right to have no belief at all be critical and paramount know that organisation such as index on censorship which the hon member for west suffolk nick timothy be part of be very robust in that regard it be crucial that we have the right to freedom of expression on the fine point of the right hon gentleman question if he would like to write to will be very happy to write back use the particular language that he would prefer be pleased by the minister answer to my right hon friend the member for tonbridge tom tugendhat if we be talk about freedom of expression internationally we have to be incredibly careful about freedom of expression in our own country while ministers often say that they oppose blasphemy law we have see section of the public order act use to prosecute people for act of protest include damage the koran be this not in reality the development of back door blasphemy law reiterate my position that we uphold freedom on the specific point that the hon gentleman would like to fall into trap on if he would write to so that can get exactly the right language would be pleased to write back want to pursue my point about the importance of this not be counsel of despair as the right hon member for new forest west say couple of member have mention the country of vietnam this afternoon and while there be number of concern include some that raise with vietnam deputy minister of foreign affairs on her recent visit to the uk in the context of discussion on matter of bilateral interest be very pleased to read that there have be an acceptance rate for the universal periodic review recommendation hope that vietnam will be able to develop national masterplan that specify concrete measurable and time bind action to follow up on those recommendation we offer the expertise that we have within the foreign office and stand ready to share our experience as we go on that journey together as mention the uk be determined to use its extensive diplomatic network and the priority of my hon friend the member for north northumberland will become clear as he meet with each of the ministers to lay out his concern with his background at the bible society know that he will have lot in common with the hon member for strangford and be sure that they will bring more debate to this house in future continue to challenge ministers on these important matter to give another example last week my hon friend the member for north northumberland and the minister for the middle east and north africa my hon friend the member for lincoln mr falconer meet the former prisoner of conscience dr nader al sakkaf who be arbitrarily detain by the houthis in for his association with the office of the public affairs of the of yemen they hear about his experience in yemen and discuss way in which the government could support he and other case of this sort also want to highlight the vital work of human right defender in address freedom of religion or belief abuse and violation include arrest and arbitrary detention as the foreign secretary say in his human rights day speech in december last year human right defender around the world risk their liberty and often their life for their belief in uphold fundamental human right for all through protest document human right abuse support political prisoner and stand up for democracy and justice without human right defender we would not know the full scale of abuse and violation think of the tragic story this week of viktoriia roshchyna journalist whose body be return without organ to her family follow detention in russia know that that will be of interest to the hon member for west suffolk give his association with the index on censorship it be an absolutely tragic case the uk be pleased to support important flexible fund such as lifeline which have provide almost grant to civil society organisation under threat in over country since july turn to our bilateral engagement the government do not shy away from challenge country that be not meet their obligation we

be kent only land base rural college it be unique in our county for the offer that it provide its huge range of course be design to provide the skill need to maintain kent place as the garden of england have be campaign for fantastic conservative councillor early today in the beautiful sunshine can assure the house that it remain that wonderful garden the college be regional powerhouse and an important part of the local tonbridge community speak to any of our key rural business and they will say how the skill offer at hadlow college help maintain our agricultural capacity in kent for those reason we should have always be celebrate what hadlow college do for the local area but must be honest there be period when we could not in hadlow college become the first further education institution in the country to enter educational administration during this debate will explore how the process affect hadlow and the community today and ask the minister to consider how it could be improve before do that pay tribute to all staff and student who be at the college and all the link institution during this challenging time they make sure course keep run and that most be unaffected will name just few of those people graham morley the first interim principal after educational administration in lindsay pamphilon jim mawby at the tonbridge site and now david gleed and chris lydon from north kent college that be not to forget paul boxall and his team at hadlow rural community school to whom will refer later the reality be that they have much hard job because of the process the college go through in in may hadlow college become the first further education facility in the country to enter educational administration after an education and skills funding agency investigation this follow update to the statutory college insolvency regime in january that affect further education and sixth form college it mean that hadlow college keep its door open but it be not just hadlow college that need to be rescue also include be hadlow rural community school west kent college in tonbridge betteshanger colliery in dover ashford college princess christian farm in hildenborough animal management site in canterbury and mottingham and further site in greenwich the question be simple how do so many further education institution end up insolvent the expansion happen quickly in the year precede it be about not just the acquisition of further site but the subsequent investment let we take the example of betteshanger colliery after hadlow college interest start it spend million on change plan for visitor centre and then lose million on the collapse sale of business park it very quickly become clear that the college have be reckless with its finance its expansion be get far away from its core purpose to provide land base education in west kent follow the esfa investigation write to the then minister of state for apprenticeships and skills at the department for education anne milton on may on betteshanger colliery the letter say would be concerned if further investment be make here in light of the financial situation should course be cut with student leave unable to gain their qualification put simply money be either be use for peripheral project that do not exist or be transfer out of student education at this point wish to touch on the concept of the hadlow group have copy of letter receive on october from the so call hadlow group which inform of proposal to merge west kent and ashford college with hadlow college in the interest of time shall not go into the background of the merger which start with the collapse of college nearly year ago merely want to point out that the hadlow group be seek to merge college at the time as the esfa the further education commissioner the administrator and the department have rightly recognise the hadlow group have no legal structure it be essentially marketing term to provide credibility to the ever expand portfolio of site which give we an indication as to where thing start to go wrong in the year lead up to meet representative of the college many time and often be ask to help secure significant amount of money for they in december be inform of two immediate funding issue the repayment of from the financial year which arise from the college acquisition and the that be need at west kent and ashford colleges for ask the department for this funding on the basis that it be use to support further education provision in west kent but be it we now know that hadlow college apply for million from the esfa transaction unit but the application fail the esfa demand that its funding be return and hadlow college consequently ask for what be essentially government bail out include all that history so that the minister and the house can understand the complexity of the situation and to make it clear what be happen money be be request on huge scale supposedly for further education provision but that be not where it be go as subsequent investigation have find there be financial mismanagement on scale never see before which lead to hadlow college enter educational administration there must be some accountability for the people who make those decision and it be therefore disappointing to many that those responsible for the expenditure primarily the principal and the finance director at the time have not have their investigation conduct in the public domain we learn in november that paul hannan the then principal will be fin if he ever work in education again we also know from the administrator report that deal be make with the deputy principal mark lumsdon taylor whereby he agree to pay four figure sum as part of confidentiality agreement find this part of the process extremely unsatisfactory ten of million of pound of public money have be pour into the educational administration process because of the reckless action of the two senior leader of hadlow college at the time give the scale and profile of this issue do not think that confidentiality agreement be appropriate and urge the department to bring forward amendment to future legislation that increase the level of transparency and accountability in such matter this view be widely hold in the community because sadly the offer at hadlow college have deteriorate since the educational administration process the hadlow college farm shop be no more and the broadview tearoom have close its landholding have decrease all of this have enable hadlow college to be sustainable provider prior to the reckless expansion plan pursue in the last decade that be all now go because of the need to pay back for fail business venture put simply what have happen here be gamble with student education to expand beyond the core purpose of hadlow college want to build on this point far and would appreciate answer from the minister about how we can strengthen the educational administration process to future proof education land why do focus on land because that be what hadlow college be fundamentally about it be land base college it need land to train the next generation of rural entrepreneur the more land it have the more it can contribute to the rural economy the same apply to hadlow rural community school in number of parcel of land around hadlow be market for sale by knight frank on behalf of the administrator and the proceed be use to pay back creditor understand that rationale from financial perspective but this be not an administration process it be call an educational administration and education provision have successfully continue throughout this turmoil there be broad agreement from all those now responsible for deliver further education at hadlow include north kent college and hadlow rural community school that the sale of parcel of land have impact the student offer this be deeply regrettable would therefore like to ask the minister how we may be able to adapt the educational administration process to ensure that land sale be not the default especially for land base educational establishment with this specialism from the perspective of north kent college have just take over hadlow college the speed of this process mean it could not accurately make argument to safeguard some land earmark for sale this have mean repurpose its provision on small footprint this have big impact on the village indeed have to repurpose mean much desire footpath and cycle way between tonbridge and hadlow be extremely unlikely to be deliver the impact on hadlow rural community school be even more severe be afraid be deeply concerned about the approach the department be currently take towards its governance the school have do extremely well to survive the process it be design for land base specialism which the educational administration process rightly safeguard the separation of the college and the school be inevitable but not necessarily detrimental to either however the loss of land in hadlow affect they both refer the minister to my letter of april to the secretary of state the department be now articulate base on letter to the school from the department date april that the plot of land at court lane which could be use for educational provision be sell frankly it be this letter that motivate to apply for this debate the reason give for that suggestion be interesting it be claim in this letter that minister have determine that capital investment option do not offer good value for money this be the same department that have rightly invest ten of million of pound in secure the future of education in hadlow both for the school and the college the education provision need to be appropriate in competitive market tonbridge have some of the highest perform secondary school and further education facility in the country and many people move to our community for our school hadlow rural community school be an important part of this network and one that have clear specialism the department need to support this first and foremost in addition be extremely disappointed to see pass reference at the end of the same letter to the school engage with north kent college in long term solution may please remind the minister that the long term solution be find when separation occur encourage the minister to speak to official who can remind she of the considerable correspondence we have back in to secure the appropriate lease for the school to access the college land return to the nub of the issue hadlow rural community school must thrive and succeed to do so it must have land available to retain its land base specialism it can do this under the current governance model not as part of north kent college delivery of service at hadlow college this work well for both party otherwise we run the risk of repeat all the governance failure that contribute to educational administration in the first place the history refer to early of murky governance process expansion without clear justification and frankly some pretty outrageous scrutiny of public finance by the two individual name must be avoid this be where want to end education administration be an extremely difficult process it be expensive and since the incorporation legislation in doubt whether there have be many other transaction where two interconnect college be break up with one split into two part and then transfer to three receive college today many part of the complex further education web at hadlow and in kent more broadly be thrive pay huge tribute to those in further education college who give so many opportunity to so many as say at the start staff management and student must take huge credit and huge pride for what they achieve during those difficult day it be now the responsibility of the department to safeguard that under the current governance model will continue to be happy to work very closely with the minister and her official to achieve that so we do not allow any historical action of the kind have list to happen again congratulate the right hon member for tonbridge tom tugendhat on secure this important debate too wish to pay tribute to all the staff and student at the college and the school mention in the debate north kent college and hadlow rural community school in fact wish to extend that to all college and school across kent hear very clearly the point he make and will attempt to address they during the course of my response further education college be vital part of the education system it be important that we continue to support they and provide all the necessary tool to assist with ensure that they have good financial sustainability that include the ability to respond to financial distress and in its bad case insolvency land base provision be an important part of the further education system with strong link to the government mission to kick start economic growth support britain ecology and make it clean energy superpower hadlow college part of the north kent college group be the only land base college in kent it have its own beef herd sheep farm horticultural production large animal management centre fishery lake machinery and land base technology facility and equine centre its curriculum include course in agriculture agricultural engineering animal management equine management fishery floristry and horticulture as well as some non land base course it have an important place within the kent skill system hadlow college have one main campus in hadlow prior to be place into education administration it be federate with another college west kent and ashford college general further education college with campus in ashford and tonbridge historically in the college face series of financial challenge result in request to the department for education for exceptional financial support at this time the college continue to face significant creditor pressure which be key factor in the decision to place hadlow college into education administration combine the college owe creditor approximately million prior to education administrator be appoint hadlow college be place into education administration in may follow by west kent and ashford college in august follow the appointment of education administrator they in conjunction with the department stabilise the financial position of the college while solution be seek to ensure that learner be protect without the college need to remain in education administration the education administrator also hire an interim principal to run the college with advice from stakeholder education advisory board during this period what follow be an intense period of option review lead by the further education commissioner to determine the good future outcome for the college provision this include invite interested party to make proposal to take on the provision it should be note that ofsted visit both college during the process and find that they be make reasonable progress with regard to educational performance this result in the recommendation that north kent college should acquire the hadlow college provision and its respective facility the transaction be support with funding from the department and be complete in august at this point would also like to say that the protection of learner be achieve which will go on to explain far alongside the hadlow college education administration the education administrator for west kent and ashford college also run an option review in conjunction with the further education commissioner and invite interested party to take on the college provision this result in the recommendation that east kent college should acquire the college provision and its respective facility at the ashford site the transaction be support with funding from the department and be complete in march combine with the transaction at hadlow college together with other small similar site between both college more than learner be protect through the education administration process an investigation into any mismanagement at the college be undertake by the education administrator and then joint liquidator this be statutory lead investigation that apply not only to education administration but to other insolvency process the outcome of those investigation be detail in the joint liquidator progress report publicly available at companies house but in summary they reach settlement agreement with the individual involve the department welcome the conclusion of the joint liquidator investigation into the conduct of certain relevant individual at hadlow college and west kent and ashford college the department take the protection of public fund extremely seriously and we will continue to support robust action where there be concern about the safeguarding of taxpayer money as the right hon gentleman point out there have be implication of the education administration of the college for the co location of hadlow rural community school the school be originally establish by hadlow college with land base specialism the two organisation have governance link and the school access the college extensive land base facility to deliver its offer during the process of the college education administration separate governance arrangement for the school be establish and the department work with the school to ensure that these arrangement be robust the price for hadlow rural community school to access the college facility rise to the extent that it be no long sustainable within the school budget and the school have request departmental support to help it develop its own land base facility appreciate that the school have undertake extensive work on proposal to the department over number of year to inform the official assessment and pay tribute to headteacher paul boxall his team and the hadlow rural community school trust board for all the work they have do and for the passion they have show in seek to ensure the very good for their pupil however this be complex case and it be critical that any support the department may provide offer value for taxpayer money it be of course important that the school have clarity so that it can move forward with certainty and thrive to be clear ministers value the school land base specialism and appreciate the challenge this situation have cause for the school and we remain open to consider way to support the school to ensure it can continue to offer high quality and broad land base curriculum the recent decision the right hon gentleman refer relate not only to the court lane land but to potentially significant capital investment to develop facility on that land particularly with high quality specialist facility at the neighbouring college in the context of constrain public finance ministers decide that it do not offer good value for money give those facility at hadlow college our view be that rather than replicate such specialist and expensive facility next door it be worth explore whether an agreement can be reach between the college and the school on share use of the college facility we understand that there will be complexity to that and that it will be important to the school for any solution to offer security for the long term should the two organisation agree to negotiate we have offer support from official to try to help broker that and at the moment this seem very likely to be clear we understand the school desire for independence and the department have no intention of force the school to change its governance arrangement we remain open to consider alternative proposal from the school indeed the school have recently suggest new option which official have agree to consider the liquidation of both hadlow college and west kent and ashford college remain open while the liquidator realise the remain surplus non educational asset again the detail of those asset be in the joint liquidator progress report available at companies house but in summary they relate to surplus plot of land in hadlow the liquidator strategy to realise the surplus land involve planning application for its inclusion in tonbridge and malling borough council local plan which would if successful enhance its value the department have priority security on all these remain land asset and any realisation directly offset the cost of the education administration process and be effectively return to the department and the taxpayer those asset which be not surplus and be require by either north kent college or east kent college be transfer to those respective college as part of the transaction to take on the learner and provision of hadlow college and west kent and ashford college and achieve the objective of the education administration to protect those learner know that the right hon member have request meeting and understand that that be in progress can assure he that we will continue to work with the joint liquidator to ensure the good possible outcome for taxpayer we will also continue to work with north kent college to ensure that the land base and general further education provision in hadlow continue to succeed for the benefit of its learner and for the right hon member constituency question put and agree to house adjourn
